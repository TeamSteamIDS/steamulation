												I know this almost goes without saying, but any gamer alive should play the Half-Life games. Even compared with the modern flashy big-budget single-player shooter extravaganzas of today (I'm looking at you, Far Cry and Bioshock), which are rightly heralded as amazing games, Half-Life makes your jaw drop at how amazing of an experience it is to fight throuth the crumbling Black Mesa facility battling humans and headcrabs alike. This game really makes you realize how much Jason Brody, Booker Dewitt, and every other major  fps protagonist since owe the man with the crowbar, Gordon Freeman. If you are a sane human being who can play a video game, there is no excuse for you to not play Half-Life. None!			",85,7,0,11,7,0,31

												I've stayed away from the Half Life series for a very long time, solely because I didn't even have a Steam account! But I recently bought Half Life: Source and Half Life 2, and I must say, they've already become some of my favourite games.The formula in this game, although the game is 10 years old, still feels fresh to me, and feels like a new game. It's also one of the first games I've tried of this genre that I've actually enjoyed. The graphics are also fantastic for their age. Well done Valve!			",118,21,3,8,19,0,3

												Half-Life: Source is the 2004 port of Valve's award winning game to the Source Engine. With just that knowledge, it would sound like Half-Life: Source was a gift from above, but it's anything BUT that. Half-Life: Source was critically panned, which makes you wonder HOW it has a ""Very Positive"" on Steam Reviews. Half-Life: Source is one of those games Valve chooses to forget, with the likes of the first Left 4 Dead and Ricochet. But, before we get into a review, lets go over the history of Half-Life: Source.The History:In 1999, Valve started development of Half-Life 2, the award winning squeal to Half-Life, originally running on the GoldSource engine. Around 2001/2002, the Source Engine was created, and it surpassed what the GoldSource engine could do, so, Valve planned to port Half-Life to the Source Engine to have it replace the GoldSource counter parts. In 2003, Axel Gambe got a hold of the full Half-Life 2 Source Code, raw map data, and a build of Half-Life 2, who later gave it to some friends, who leaked it. In those leak files, there was the Half-Life Source port, along with files to a Source port of TFC, DMC, and CS 1.6 (which was remotely playable, but at this time, this port was starting to become the game we know today as CS:S.) The port of Half-Life: Source was quite buggy and unfinished, which is to be expected for it being a leak of a beta. So, 2004 comes around, and then Half-Life 2 is coming around the corner, as a bundle with Half-Life 2, you could get Counter-Strike: Source (by this time is the game we all know and probably love) and Half-Life: Source. Half-Life: Source saw little change from the 2003 leak of Half-Life 2, minus some minor bug fixes and having the Half-Life 1 HUD. At this point, be expected Half-Life: Source to be just like Counter-Strike: Source, a re-imagining of the game, in HD (for 2004 standards), but what they got was a direct Half-Life port that didn't seam quite finished. This is why if you ask anyone why they don't like Half-Life: Source for the most part (especially pre-2013) you get told it's graphics were just the Half-Life graphics. But as stated before, Half-Life: Source was meant to replace Half-Life as a whole, but due to how poorly received it was, Half-Life Original saw another day. In 2006, Valve ported the Deathmatch counter part of Half-Life into the Source Engine, and if you thought Half-Life: Source was a bad port, you should of saw this game. All player ragdolls had broken physics, some weapons were broken (the Shotgun's double barrel sound is just the single barrel sound), and the gameplay was more like Half-Life 2 Deathmatch with minor HLDM gameplay stuff slapped in (the game even lacks the backpack pickups that were in Half-Life Deathmatch), the only reason I can see for this port, was just to give EP1 a pack-in game. Around 2007, Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source were ported to Source Base 2007, but due to the amount of bugs now included with the game, Valve didn't release this patch to the public, it wasn't until 2012 that the public knew of this update's existence, since in 2012, the whole 2008/2007 source code to Source Base 2007 was leaked into the public, it also confirmed that the Team Fortress Classic port was in further development than what everyone thought. But due to the amount of hate towards Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source would mean we would probably never seen of these ports.So, that runs down a good chunk of the history of Half-Life: Source besides one of the more major things, the 2013 update. Valve in an effort to ditch the GCF system and upgrade everything to VPK and have a better downloading system and a better game asset pack to engine communication, they created Steampipe, but since Valve decided it would be best to port all games to Source Base 2013, they decided to do that, and try to provide updates to all Valve games. In the same year, Valve canned the project, leaving a ton of games in a broken state, Half-Life: Source being one of them.So, this leads us into the review.The ReviewHalf-Life: Source was a mediocre port to the Source Engine, where it would be mixed who liked the game and disliked the game, since Half-Life: Source had that audience. Half-Life: Source is now a BAD port to the Source Engine, since those 2013 updates broke more than what it fixed. Not only did Valve cancel the updates to these games, they released the beta depots into the release depot to remove traces of GCFs. So, those games that had a good release depot, now have a beta released into them, and a lot of these betas were far from done. We now have broken Save/Restore errors in various NPCs, 2 out of the 3 tentacles in Blast Pit can harm the player or AI, one of the maps in Residue Processing will blind the player if your flashlight is turned on, skill configurations are broken (so now the AI is harder), Gonarch spit is now black squares, one of the maps in Surface Tension has a broken skybox, you can jump over a lot of things making it so you can skip half of ""We got Hostiles"" and skip various other parts in other chapters, all of the Chrome shaders are complete♥♥♥♥♥(they were never good, but this is just worse), and even more. It's sad when a 2003 leak is better and more playable than a 2013 update. Plus, if you load the HD Pack you get a GameBanana skin pack, since Valve was too lazy to port the assets their selves of even double check to be everything matched in the first place. But the icing on the cake is that, well, at first install, you can't even PLAY Half-Life: Source since Valve provided corrupted or outdated DLLs to Steam VR, so every time you reinstall Half-Life: Source you have to verify the cache of Half-Life 2 or Steam VR. Not only that, the person who was working on these updates, Alfred, shrugged off a few errors as design points.Half-Life: Source had potential to be a great port, to even be on par with the Original Half-Life (definitely should NEVER replace the Original), but its potential was lost with a company who couldn't care enough about the game, which is why it was left for about 6 years without an update.I recommend to play Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source so you can see what happens when a company just flat out doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥Even though I didn't review the pre-2013 build, I'm still going to give it a ratingThe Half-Life: Source that existed before 2013, I give that a 6 out of 10I give the current Half-Life: Source a 4 out of 10, avoid at all costs.Actually, I recommend you report both Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source, as it very unplayable and is using stolen assets. You shouldn't let Valve sell this to people, especially when people think this is the better version of Half-Life			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Would I recommend Half-Life? Hell yes. Would I recommend Half-Life: Source? Er, maybe. The original Half-Life was, and still is, an absolutely fantastic game. The story and how it’s conveyed to the player works extremely well, and the controls, gameplay mechanics, visuals, and sound are all phenomenal. Very few bugs, and certainly none game-breakingly noteworthy.However, this is where Half-Life: Source fails. This game’s major problem is its glitches and bugs. Some minor, some absolutely game-breaking. On one hand, you have scientist’s AI screwed up, running into open fire, constantly shooting off their response lines. On the other hand, you have some parts of the game where the textures and models go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, essentially simulating your graphics card melting.Even with the bugs, the game does try to make it up with some enhancements thanks to the Source engine. The water effects are slightly better (although in my experiences it’s just extraordinarily shiny and reflective), and the lighting effects are significantly improved, although inconsistent when walking into an area that needs to load. However, the HL2 bullet hole decals make it possible to create magnificent works of art with your crowbar on walls. Thankfully, the gameplay, controls, and overall look and appeal of the game is still there, unaltered. There’s no denying that the game is awesome. Half-Life in general is awesome. I just love how people on the GoldSrc version of Half-Life were complaining about the game having extremely old and outdated graphics, saying HL:Source is better in this field. Well, it’s not. A majority of textures and models are completely identical. Aside from the water and bullet decals, the games are visually the same, which is something I’m completely fine with. The regular version of Half-Life actually comes with the HD texture pack, something this port lacks. It essentially gives the game updated models to characters and weapons, and slightly enhanced textures in some areas. It’s nice, but not essential, which is fine.Overall, yeah, go ahead and get it. If this is ever on sale for cheaper than the regular Half-Life, and you own neither, by all means, go ahead and get it. You (hopefully) won’t regret it. ",67,5,1,2,7,2,0

												I'm not some trolling idiot, I actually love HL1... so please, at least read what I have to say before downvoting, don't act like that just instantly means I hate HL1.Yes, Half Life 1 is one of the best games you'll ever play.  Assuming, of course, that it was designed for its engine.  Meet Half-Life Source, a game that was made on GoldSrc then converted to show off the new engine they had made.HL simply wasn't designed for Source, and no effort was put into properly re-writing the game for the new engine.  The AI is bugged to eternally walk into any wall, I've yet to see a working hitbox, and HL1's graphics are better than this remake.  It's actually unplayable due to the scripted events being broken.  Sorry, that door isn't opening.So you may ask about the low playtime.  Well, when I realized I wouldn't be entering the test chamber, I tried skipping forward a few levels with the map command.  Guess what?  BUGS!  LOTS OF EM!  Nearly anything involving AI interaction would NEVER happen, half the time your enemies can't even hurt you (and vice versa), and a few levelskips forward, I even fell out of the world once when I got hit by a box.Overall, I'm scoring HL Source with a 3/10.  A complete waste of money you're seeing here, it's got to be some sort of joke on Valve's part.  It only scores anything because under the technical crapshow is the 1998 classic that, Xen aside, is nearly perfect.If you want to play the REAL Half-Life bug-free on the GoldSrc engine, click here.

												It's the original Half-Life, with less modding support, texture glitches, and improved water effects. If you already own the Goldsrc version of the game, the only reason to get Source would be out of curiousity during a sale. Otherwise, there aren't nearly enough additions to justify the additional purchase. Half-Life Deathmatch Source is fun...when you can find people to play it with, which isn't nearly enough. So, while it is as good as the original Half-Life, it is also nearly identical to it as well. You're better off buying the standard version, which is compatible with Opposing Force and Blue Shift, unlike Half-Life: Source.			",102,2,0,1,4,3,4

												Original review from 30 Jul, 2012 @ 12:58pm ---	 This is more of a comment; Half-Life Source is Half-Life upgraded onto the source engine and with some minimal graphic enchanments. There really is no difference between this and Half-Life other than chapter selecting, gmod compatibility, and source enging modding and editing etc. Edit:With the current EA release of Black Mesa it made me think. A bunch of people on the BM forums are complaining about how it's a paid mod and all that junk, but really BM is a giant remastering, a complete overhaul built from the ground up in a whole new light, and yet Half-Life: Source still lingers around and has no real fresh thing about it other than it's simply on the source engine and there is no mod community for it at all.People should be getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at this than BM, because this has more reason for it. If BM was released by Valve, or just suddenly popped up without anything previously knowing about it, it would have no hate whatsoever. Half-Life: Source should not be sold separately because it has nothing to it that's worth a full 10 dollar price tag on it's own. It should just be bundled and sold with the original Half-Life.

												First, let's get the formalities out of the way. Half-Life is Half-Life. It's unimaginably fantastic. Half-Life Source is different though. It's essentially the same game, just on a more updated engine. And while that might sound like a good thing, Half-Life 1 wasn't designed for the Source engine. It doesn't fit. The updated textures look strange and out of place, it's buggy as all hell, and the AI is changed. That last one's big. Considering there's no cutscenes in Half-Life, any important scenes are done as scripted events. And with the AI different, they just don't act the way they're intended, making you miss important story points. I've also noticed that they move around a lot, so you'll get swarmed real quick, which makes the game go from challenging to unfair. It also doesn't help that weapon switching is unnecessarily slow in this one compared to the original, giving a horde of enemies barrel-assing around the corner ample time to punch holes in you. Also, with the new Source engine, any music that's playing is cut off when you move to the next map, and since there's music cues right before a map change, you'll hear the first five seconds of the song before it just stops playing. Seriously, if you want it, make sure you play the original first. I may have under twenty hours on the Source version, but I have over 130 hours on the GoldSrc version. And that's the campaign alone. Don't be stupid. Get the original.			",55,9,0,4,1,1,2

												I was thinking if I should do a new review for this game or just not even cover it, but I decided to review so here goes.http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/70/ My original review of Half Life.Half Life Source is the remastered (if you can call it that) version of the original Half Life. With less game breaking bugs and better textures.At first when I started playing I didn't notice many different things as the game still looks a lot like the original Half Life. Apart from some different textures like the better models and water physics the game looks pretty much identical.My biggest problem with the original version of Half Life was that the game was incredibly buggy. I encountered many game breaking bugs. This wasn't the case with Source. Apart from one chapter where I encountered texture pop ins, I didn't encounter much more.In the end there's nothing more I can say about Half Life Source that I didn't say in my original review. It's a fantastic game and one of my favorite games to date. I highly suggest buying it if you haven't already and playing. Now which version do I recommend playing ? I suggest playing this instead of the original. But I do suggest getting the first one just for Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Final Rating:8/10 - Worth BuyingIf you liked this review please consider giving it a like and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

												It's just the original Half-Life running on the Source Engine instead of the original GoldSrc Engine.So the what's the point in getting this?+Well, all the maps and models are indeed usable in Garry's Mod+Runs off Source+Has slightly better graphics+Singleplayer and Multiplayer Deathmatch modes are seperate so it lets you download what you want.+Isn't capped to just 100 FPSWhy should you avoid it?-Graphics aren't that noticeably better (Black Mesa did a much better job at that)-Not many mods are made for it-Deathmatch mode is DEAD-Has more bugs than the original (LOL WTF Valve?)Overall if you got this with the Half-Life Complete bundle, go ahead and give this a try! If you want a TRUE remastered HL1 experience, go buy Black Mesa.Overall rating 6/10 - It does what it said it does. Play Half-Life on the Source Engine			",153,11,6,6,3,2,0

												There isn't much of a difference between this game and the original Half-Life. If you're deciding which to buy, it honestly doesn't matter. The water is nicer in this game and there are ragdolls and better physics. Other than that, it's essentially the same game. Don't worry about not getting the ""pure"" experience of HL1 because this is essentially it. Lower resolution water and people who just lay down and die without leaving a ragdoll for you to smack with a crowbar weren't the cornerstones of the Half-Life. Playing HL is an experience, regardless of trivialities such as this.I wouldn't get this by itself personally; if you really wanna pick it up, get it via one of the packs in the Store and/or wait for a sale.One interesting note though, you can load up the content from this game in Garry's Mod. If you have Gmod, this might give you some fun stuff to play around with.			",83,7,0,6,8,0,3

												Sadly I can't recommend this. Maybe for 2 €, but not for 10.HL is a timeless masterpiece, you can play it over and over and never be bored (same for HL 2, that is even better than the first one imo).But this ""upgraded"" port is nothing but a glitched version of HL 1. If you are new to the HL universe, go buy the original game, together with Blue Shift and Opposing Force.If you want to see a REAL upgraded port of this game, go play Black Mesa.

It doesn't add anything new, just a new engine.If you want a complete reimangining of Half-Life, get Black Mesa. Overall, get this game if you're looking for an excuse to replay Half-Life. It also adds assets to Garry's Mod, if you want that.			",46,1,0,6,3,0,1

												Half-Life is an amazing adventure, sci-fi, and FPS game from Valve.  Your goal is to escape the ruined Black Mesa (the same one that is rivaled with Aperture Science from Portal) while fighting the invading aliens.  Even though first person shooters are generally hated today becayse they are considered rehashes and uncreative, this game is the exact opposite.     You start off in a train ride on your way to some sort of test chamber everyone is talking about.  As you take the ride, you will see a lot of different places that you will visit later, so pay attention.  You eventually make your way to the test chamber when disaster strikes and aliens invade.  It sounds a bit cliche at first, but the game tells the story in such a great way that it works.  You eventually meet a security guard and encounter enemies.  The security guard then helps you, which brings me to my first point.    One amazing thing about Half-Life is that it gives choices.  When you meet the security guard,  you already have your first weapon: a crowbar.  Since a crowbar is a weapon, and there is a person with a gun in front of you, and you need to survive... well, you can see what most people would do.  About 20 minutes into the game, you can already get a gun early, or you can have the security guard help you, until he is apparently can't crawl through a whole that an average scientist can... what a security guard.  This is just one example, and there are a lot of security guards willing to help you.     Anyway, onto the graphics.  They're not as good as other Source games, but don't let that discourage you.  Games are meant to be played, not looked at.  Also, if you want to, you can make the game look like the original Half-Life.     I would reccomend Half-Life to pretty much everbody, as long as you don't get scared easily.  Trust me, you will get a bit scared.  There is a creepy atmosphere, zombies, and A LOT of tension and a feeling you are being watched.  There are no jumpscares are other cheap scares, luckily (I'm looking at you, Slender).  This game gets a 10/10			",63,6,0,9,5,1,2

												Half-Life, the original game from 1998, is possibly my favorite game of all time for reasons of nostalgia, gameplay, story, and the fact that I don't mind the graphics. That being said... This version has taken that amazing game, ported it to the same engine as Half-Life 2, and neglected to fix the  massive  glitches. These include weapons that do not work properly, several graphical problems (If you use the flashlight in a few rooms, the visuals just about break.) Sure, the graphics are 'better' but all that is changed is the blood, lighting and the added ragdoll physics. But these clash with the textures, all of them much lower resolution, making the game look  worse	. I reccomend the original Half-Life, as well as it's expansions and sequels. And if you can't stand the graphics, then I reccomend Black Mesa Source. It's a  much	 better remake of the original Half-Life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As others have mentioned, the core game is fantastic.   However, the Source port is buggy to the point of distraction - the triggers and interactions that made the original non-Source Half-Life such a revolutionary, tight combo of story and game are broken: * scripted events involving hostiles seem to trigger wrong or not at all ( ""I killed twe-RECON! GO GO!"" )* wounded NPC's yell over and over and over and over at top volume.* Source physics on the jumping puzzles have taken them from hard to impossible.* Got as far as blast pit, which all sneaking tension is gone and replaced by an indestructable npc shooting the creature over and over again.Half-life (non source) is an awesome game, and it sounds like there may be a better fan-made port in the works.  But stick with the old version if you want the story, and I'm surprised Valve would let anyone curious for the mythos of Half-Life play such a buggy version.  I won't be returning it because hey, I paid $1.99 on a Steam sale, but it seems disinginuous to give a recommendation to this version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. Here are all of the pros and cons.Pros:Great remake of a classic game.Voice acting is excellent.Enemies aren't too easy, but not to hard.NPCs are smart, for originally released in 1998.Amazing story.Silent protagonist. I know it's a weird thing to complement, but could you imagine how stupid it would be if Gordon, or Chell (the protagonist of Portal) would speak?Cons:NPC's eyes don't have animation.Some minor glitches.Black Mesa won't stop ripping off Aperture Science.That last one was a joke. Overall, amazing game, Valve. :)			",20,4,0,1,0,0,0

												It's basically the same thing with prettier water, more comfortable flashlight, faster movement speed and ragdolls instead of original death animations. They fixed the Barney's miming of numpad sounds but broke a ton of other things like: specific weapon selection sound, gore, Barney's friendly fire, less blood on walls after shooting, the elevator lights are broken, music stopping after loading, echo in vents and larger areas, the subtle head bobbing, the weapons now have recoil and look more oily, the crowbar makes the same sharp sound when hitting stuff, explosions are less satisfying, transparent water, headcrabs don't move around they just stare at you. But on the other hand: crowbar is stronger, swimming is better, flashlight now casts shadows, the textures look crisper and nicer thanks to shaders, FOV is adjustable and higher in weapons, meaning you can see them better. If you want to play HL1 then play HL1, or try Black Mesa, but HL:S is still HL, so play it anyway, to enjoy the few nuances that make the game even better.			",191,33,9,25,4,1,16

												Ive been a steam user for 9 years, i loved the goldsource games, i even have the original WON version of Half-Life. I Love the Half-Life series and its mods. This game is not one of the games i love.Sure it may look like the original half-life with uppgraded graphics. Sure it may ""Feel"" like the original Half-Life untill the bugs happen... When i reinstalled the game to see why i havent played this version of the game i finnaly rememberd..This game has gamebreaking bugs, that will halt your progress. First of all, let me list down the issues i had when starting this gameIf your steam is in any other language other than English, the main menu will say #clickeble menu ON EVERY OPTION. You will have to change the language on steam to English!When playing, sometimes when you explore before ""unforseen consequenses"" be sure to pick up your suit before you talk to the guard or else, your save will be corrupted.When in missile silo, where the tentacles are, resetting the power to the machine to later turn on the fuel, the hatch leading to the fuel will be permanently closed. For me there is no fix.When the game needs the user to open up the console and cheat to get it working, then you know its wrong.The game feels like it was halfassed. Every element in this game feels flawed compared to Half-Life (Goldsource). Where skripts to open doors will fail to load. Events wont happen. Buy Half-Life instead of this. I cant stress that enough..			",231,6,6,24,3,1,25

												The attention to detail in Valve’s games has never been amiss and I’ve always been impressed by how much they put into this series. The setting for the game is an underground research facility, your character witnesses a catastrophe that plunges the facility into chaos. You have to fend off alien species to escape the facility and try to figure out what is happening. It’s a sci-fi game and that’s what gives it its character. The weapons especially get more interesting as the game develops, as you start to discover more and more alien technology.I used to love watching my dad play this as a kid, but I just never managed to be able to get very far myself until I decided to go back to it now. The Half-Life 1 series is extremely nostalgic to me and its great still being able to play these games despite how old they are. For me, they are great, but I imagine for people that have never played them before, they might just look awful. Despite that, I would hope the overall feel and story of the game would be compelling enough to make those people enjoy it anyway.Half-Life: Source has a few bugs here and there, a few of which I thought were going to be game breaking for me. But there was always a way around it. The glitches and bugs were tedious but given how old the game is it’s forgivable. The source engine reboot of this game changes up the game quite a bit. It was given new map textures, new weapon models, new NPC models and enhances to the sound. The changes are good, they definitely make the game look better. But I enjoy the original just as much, if not more. I’m used to and remember the old one. Which oddly, when I played this game I’m not too sure what happened with it. I downloaded the game, fired it up and played quite a bit in one session. Not noticing that it was all actually the old game assets. I shut it down and gave the game a break and when I booted it back up suddenly the new stuff was being used. Weird!Anyway, there is never a dull moment in this game, there is action and something new always around the corner. It’s essentially a first person shooter, but it manages to break it up in-between and give you enough else to do so that it doesn’t get boring. It’s all around a fun game and I think you should give it a try, even if you haven’t got that Half-Life nostalgia that I do.TL;DR : Old but great, lot of nostalgia for me. It’s a good first person shooter sci-fi game, give it a try.For anyone interested, My Review for Half-Life: Opposing Force:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/50/ ",412,272,31,20,31,5,36

												Worst way to play a great game. The source engine adds very little to the game. The engine’s properties such as realistic water look very unnatural with the surroundings. If you want a graphical upgrade, Black Mesa is a tremendous recreation of the game in the source engine. Otherwise, stick to the original game.			",67,13,2,2,11,0,4

												This is a nice remaster of the original Half-Life running on the Source Engine. So you will get better physics, lighting, shadows, and water. However you should know that this version has less mod support and can be very glitchy. During my experience one section caused the entire game's graphics to just glitch out that I'm watching a static image that I can't see what I'm doing! And I also hear other people saying the game crashes at certain moments in the game so I probably would recommend you stick with the original game.Rating 6/10			",517,101,5,40,21,2,11

The ability to spawn monsters, though, has given me a lot of fun in Surface Tension map.You can spawn monsters in GoldSrc by using the Spawner mod.But still, about this game. I have not encountered bugs so far, but I'll see in the future.It's, good. Although when using the HD Content some of the reload sounds aren't there. Fixed this though.

												There are two kinds of people who should buy HL: Source. The first is the person who somehow doesn't have a copy of Half-Life but really, really wants Source physics involved. The second is the rabid Half-Life fan who already has Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Eps 1 &2, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift and still requires more HL to fill the gaping void Gabe Newell has left in their heart.I plead no contest.Seriously, the Source remake didn't really add anything to the game. As near as I can tell, the only gameplay difference is that the crates don't spazz out as much when you try to pull them. Graphically it's mostly the same but the human characters all look significantly creepier. Well, all of them except the G-Man, and he was creepy to begin with.			",80,80,0,7,4,1,1

												This game has been pretty broken since a recent update to the Source engine. It used to be fine, but after this recent engine change: Barnacles no longer render properly unless you re-enter the room you find them in. Until you do, you won't see their tongues dangling where they should be. Your crowbar makes a hitting-concrete sound on top of whatever material you hit with it (wood, glass, etc). Several scripting errors (e.g. security guard who normally dies in Blast Pit runs back and does nothing). The Gonarch (the headcrab boss) now just stands in one spot and spawns a single baby headcrab at a time that just sits under it doing nothing, and his ranged attack makes a black square appear on the floor. map c2a4c has a serious graphical issue where a low-resolution texture tears through everything. See screenshots (1, 2) map c2a5c has a bad skybox which from some angles will render the void as if the map had a leak. See screenshot in several instances, models getting a black texture.Don't get, they probably won't fix this at this point since development on this version of the Source engine has pretty much ended.

												Most reviews talk of glitches and bugs but I never encountered a single one. Maybe I was just lucky or maybe the reviewers were lying. Who knows.But anyway. I wanted to check out Half-Life since I got sucked into the Portal universe (and hearing that Aperture Science and Black Mesa were linked somehow) and it was recommended that I get the Source version as opposed to the original. So I did.I actually really enjoyed the story. An experiment at Black Mesa goes wrong and it's up to silent protagonist Gordon Freeman to set it all right again. And despite being a scientist, he's a damn good shot with a gun or he'll really smart you with a crowbar. The gunplay feels good and movement is good, though sometimes jumps can be a little floaty.I never judge a game on graphics but either way, the graphics are good for a game of this agel, and a HD retexture is included. Both sets look good but graphics do not make a game.The gameplay itself is good and the difficulty has good progression, so you start with easier enemies and then as the game progresses, you face tougher enemies. Occasionally the difficulty can spike in places but this is usually doe to miniboss encounters, which is expected.Either way, this was definitely a fun experience and I would highly recommend it.

												This is game is pretty good....it's a port of the original half life on to the source engine,many people say this game is too hard even on easy.OK,it kinda is,but if you have played other valve games this ones controlls will be familiar,when you play the game a lot of times you'll start to understand how the AI works,you know how every enemy in the game thinks,it's a lot of fun setting up traps where the enemies would teleport,the story is good,if you don't shoot everything in your way the story will be clear.Also I have to talk about the graphics,the game is more shiny and the water is shadery as well.The environments look more ""alive"".The only thing that everyone hates are ladders.THEY ARE THE WORST.

												A buggier but slightly shinier version of the original game.They didn't bother updated textures and meshes and so it looks rubbish, and the shiny bits contrasts directly with the old 1998 textures.Don't bother, buy either the original old version of the game or get Black Mesa			",177,16,4,12,9,1,17

												For my review of Half-Life, check out my review of the original game. This is just a short insight on my thoughts of the Source version. Half-Life: Source is simply the original Half-Life ported to Valve's newer (at the time) Source engine, it doesn't bring anything new to the table aside from a few new menu options such as selecting a chapter, but it does improve a handful of aspects, mostly minor and technical. The most noteable changes are to the water, the ragdoll physics and the map lighting (in some cases). There are plenty of other minor things that you will notice after playing through once, it's like a new layer of polish, but nothing that would make me recommend buying this version over the original game as unfortunately the Source port has also caused a large number of bugs and errors to arise that were never in the original version. While some of the new features and mechanics in the Source engine are nice, the game hasn't really been updated to take those aspects into account, and thus, more problems popped up. So I have mixed feelings about Half-Life: Source, but I'd say that this version is worth playing through at least once if you are a Half-Life fan, it has a slightly different feel to it but ultimately I'd say to just stick to the original version of the game instead. It may be dated but that's what gives it it's charm.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you own or have already played Half-Life 1 I highly discourage buying this game. The graphical improvements are really minor and would only be barely noticeable when making a direct image comparison. If you want to get a true reimagining of this game then I highly recommend Black Mesa. It's too bad they didn't update Half-Life with improved graphics like they did with Half-Life 2.Edit: Also has a lot of bugs and glitches that Valve still hasn't fixed, some don't really affect the overall experience but some do.

Screw modern brainless AAA-shooters that's simply reskins from the last version (no names mentioned) the old school shooters are top notch.

Details were swapped with the half life versions.A very minor example is the blood texture, hell maybe that wasnt changed.If you dont have half life already buy this by all means yes, but if you dont, this is a little bit cheaper.But if you want extra bang for your buck for a dated game, you could get the Black Mesa mod, on steam for substansially more, but the crew deserves it for the remarkable work done there.Furthermore, Im concluding this with, dont buy it if you have the original, or Just get Black Mesa if you dont want 1999 Textures with Half Life two effects, and some little details.I have played Half-Life far longer on PS2 by the way.

												Is it worth it if you already own the original? YES!!! Now, please, come ON people! Stop hating it because it is ""the same as the original"". I will tell you why it is BETTER than the original. 1. If you beat the game but forgot to save, this game allows you to go to ANY point in the game. 2. It is a nice love letter to those Half-Life 1 and exansion players. 3. Yes, it is the same game, BUT, Valve wants new players to go try the 1998 classic, with better lighting, physics, and just some better mechanics that Gold Source could not handle. BONUS FOR GMOD PLAYERS. 4. You can't use Gold Source models in the game without addons, so now you don't have to. So I give this game a 10 out of 10. So new players who haven't had a chance to try the original, hope you like it, and people hating the game because the reason stated before, hope you know see reason Valve made this game!

												First of all this is not a remake (like Black-Mesa), it's a remasterization. Well this is the same old Half Life we all know, except that now it has some improved textures, mainly the metalic ones (incluiding floors), overall lighting, color intensity and all of the character models. The weapons are better looking too as well as your H.E.V. suit (it has nice details on your hands and arms. I recommend it, yes, but only to people that don't own the original or die hard fans like me that would take up any excuse to replay this masterpiece. The thing that bugs me (ignoring the glitches) is that this remasteriztion feels incomplete. Despite they added physics and the death's are more realistic and satisfying (plus the bullet impact splatter and the bullet holes on characters are a nice detail too) now you CAN'T hit them with the crowbar, it just passes through. The only way to ""hit"" the body is hitting the surface were it is and through the bodu. Only then it'll start moving and it is weird because the hit sound it's still the surface one. If they are re-releasing this too, they should have added something extra, like achievements or cards. I also hate that the impact sounds of the crowbar, even when you are smacking wood, it's METAL-HIT-LIKE SOUND. WHAAT????Finally, I have to say that I played Black Mesa. That is a remake, it has the essence of this game but changed some maps and things (the leechers on the water are gone and the enemies act and react different to the weapons, for example). I liked it and it was a good excuse to travel to Black Mesa again. I still prefer the originall one, but I salute the developers for making an outstanding job at it.			",245,23,4,19,8,1,5

												PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYINGHalf-Life Source is just Half-Life, in the Source engine (BUT) it is broken thanks to SteamPipe.If you really want to play it you should buy it, but if the bugs hamper it too much go online and find a NoSteam crack (Not Illegal because you already paid money for it) and it should run greatly, and with very few bugs. (I have not run into any gamebreaking bugs (I am at the dam in Surface Tensions) I found 3 bugs: the box jumping puzzle the last box slides into the wall, does not affect gameplay. When opening the storm drain in Surface Tensions you can get stuck on top the valve, but I got off by using the grenade launcher.  I saw 2 Marines walking into eachother but that was right after a loading screen and they got out when they saw me.Now onto my review.Half-Life Source is a very well made game. (before steampipe) I would highly recommend doing my above method to play this game for anyone looking to get back into Half-Life, but thinks the graphics could be better. The water and skies look amazing, the lighting is good, and without the High Def Pack (It comes with the Steam version, enable it, it makes the game look very good)  the guns, the models, and textures are decent. I have found the recoil is  different (It reminds me of going from CS 1.6 to CS:S) but besides that normal gameplay is very much the same as The GoldSrc version. Please buy the bundle that includes Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, as it is also great. (This game also gives you more models for GMod 8.2-16) ",50,0,0,6,1,0,7

												The only reason, the ONLY reason I am giving this game a negative recommendation, is because Black Mesa is now available on Steam.  Half-Life is a fantastic game, but this version of it is a sloppy port at best.  Save yourself the heartache of playing this version and go buy Black Mesa.  Black Mesa includes Trading Cards and Steam Achievements, which this version of Half-Life, sadly, does not.Here's a link to Black Mesa, which is far worthier of your time:It has since come to my attention that the final levels are still not available in Black Mesa.  That was my mistake and I own that.  I still dislike this version of Half-Life.  If you REALLY want to experience the original Half-Life, I would say play the original game sans port.

												Half-Life is fantastic, but Half-Life: Source is far from a remaster. Whilst rag-dolls and improved water are nice, drawbacks like incorrect lighting in many areas, unnecessary reflections on weapons/models, and various source engine related bugs; it leaves a lot to be desired in a so-called remaster. That's not even taking into account the long loading times that weren't present in the GoldSrc version. Perhaps the only real benefit of Source is proper widescreen, but if you're like me you'll prefer playing Half-Life in 4:3 as originally intended. To summarise just play the GoldSrc version of Half-Life.			",810,236,5,120,92,7,118

												I don't have any idea what Valve was thinking when developing this version of Half Life, because, aside from the improved textures, they didn't put any real effort into this piece of software at all. As this game should rather be seen as an improvement of the original game than a real remake, I'm not able to recommend it. It's terribly glitched and I sometimes got the impression that it wasn't even tested properly. (Scientists floating above their chairs, messed up AI, broken hitboxes on some bosses, etc.)If you want the original Half Life touch, play the old Goldsource version.If you want to play a remake that improves gameplay mechanics and the overall appearance, check out Black Mesa.

												Quite simply one of the greatest games ever made. Amazing introduction, completely immersive world, astounding tension, brilliant puzzle-solving elements, astounding as a first-person shooter, atmospheric story, genuinely frightening (especially when confronted with Marines and their fear-inducing radio commands which one hears from time to time), everything about this game is sheer excellence.

												   Beat it while offline, took about 20 hours. It's a great shooter in the way it plays and in the spreadout of obtaining weapons. Compared to the original which I played some of there seems to be more glitches and bugs in this than the original though. So don't rebuy it if you already have the original.			",51,5,2,6,2,1,8

												This review was originally a recommendation, but after my latest play through, i have to not recommend it. I'm just gonna make a simple pros and cons list.PROS:1. its Half-Life2. runs on Source engineCONS:1. REALLY buggy, even 10 years after release2. Scripted things don't always work3. Hitboxes are sometimes only hit by certain weapons (Gonarch boss)All in all, just get the original. You can get it for the same price and its much better quality. If, for some odd reason, Valve comes back and fixes it, then maybe I'll change my opinion, but don't get it unless you want a few things in Garry's Mod.			",111,10,0,2,4,1,4

												Its like when you use converter on an audio file, but this time, it was done on a game. Gold src > Source. Water is now beautiful, but it doesn't fit this game anymore. Almost everything is the same, as it was in the original.  Some bugs disappeared, new ones appeared. Textures are pretty much the same. Models are better, but it's still the same pretty much. No new content of course. If you own the original Half life, then this might give you a bit different view on it, but Black Mesa looks much better, because they completely remade the Half life story using the Source engine.If you don't own the original Half life, then avoid this one. Not worth it. Play Black Mesa or the original Half Life instead.			",217,31,2,24,15,4,20

												Unless you're a purist, this is probably the best way to enjoy this classic game in the modern era.  In retrospect, it's not perfect - there's a few points where you really struggle to find the best way forward  and a few levels drag more than they should, but otherwise, well, this is Half-Life, the thinking man's shooter.  The formula wasn't perfected until HL2, but this version shares it's gene pool, and that should be enough for most.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-LIfe: Source is a, ehem, ""remake"" of Half-Life 1, which in this case means ""we took HL1 recources and transfered them off GoldSrc engine to Source Engine"". And yes, it contains single-player campaign of HL1... DeathMatch portion was released serapately later. Though now that you can only purchase bundle of Source with DM, it doesn't matter much. Yes, it comes with HD models from Blue Shift bundledSo, what remake brought? Nothing major. Just small things here and there. First, default things from engine changes - dynamic shadows from flashlight that HL2 Episode 2 brought into engine, for example. There is more of metallic reflective textures, that look ugly in the darkness. The water was changed into HL2 style one... Means more transperency yet the rippling animation was removed. Enemies don't have death animations anymore - they use ragdoll... Which sometimes looks clunky with low-polygon monsters. There are even occasional decoration object that now uses physics, like hooked boxes. And you don't throw boxes away over the hills when you try to move box sideways. At least it all comes along with HD Models pack from Blue Shift.One of the non-graphics changes got to be improved AI, which I also think came. NPCs always react finely, while in original they would often first turn around slowly to face the threat. Security officers that follow you don't get lost as easily, you can even forget about babysitting them. And where in original they had ""shoot at some aliens"" as high priority, ""follow the player"" seems to be higher one in this remake... Which means that they will not shoot a thing if they will be busy following strafing player. Guards are better at guard duty, yep. On one of the notes, flying enemy with huge brain in final parts of games is now more aggresive, attempting to get into your face, all the time!Some of the damage values were changed. The biggest example got to be clowbar, it got buffed... Now, just like in HL2, it takes only one hit of this tool to bring down Headcrabs and Barnacles.Some of small bugs in HL1 were fixed, some new small bugs were added. Oh yea, and music stops when you go to the next area. But overall, original is safer bet as mods for HL1 will work with original, not Source remake. But Source one isn't bad either. Much better looking today, at 2014 year thanks to engine updates, while at time of release it didn't look like it added much.Deathmatch multiplayer part of remake was released after single-player part and comes by default with bundle on Steam... But let's just say, it's dead and not worth checking out.P.S. I approve ability to start at any chapter, easier to pick up.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												OMG!  I played it when it first came out and loved it.  Made me hooked for life.  Blue Shift, Opposing Force, 2, E1, E2, all of them.  Was bored, bought and d/l Source and... IDK if it is original bugs or new bugs but with out noclip I don't know how I'd get through some of the areas.  Oh, the vent is half an inch too short to just walk through but an inch too high off the ground to just crawl through.  But still, enjoying the some what updated graphics and ragdoll physics.  Just started tonight and played through to Blast Pit before deciding it was time for bed.But other than the few times I needed noclip, the game is as good as ever and makes me want to buy BS and OF and then move through HL2, E1, and E2 all over again on my next day off.  I would say get this game if you love the series but if are new, maybe stick to HL2?  Some will whine the graphics aren't amazing, and I do miss the gravity gun(Best gun in any game ever) but this classic is classic for a reason!			",61,29,1,8,18,1,5

This version is the same fun experience as the original game, but ported to the Source engine for slightly better graphics and ragdoll effects. Seriously, Half-Life is pure awesome. And remember, if it wasn't for this game, none of us would be using Steam right now! Not to mention that killing headcrabs, zombies, and bullsquids really is hours of fun. I rate this game 10/10.

												Dear valve, Please fix the issue where music starts playing, then the source engine decides to load a new section of the map 2 second later, stopping the music before you can even get into it. This issue really takes you out of the game, and its an issue with both the source versions of the originals, as well as 2 and its episodes [though thankfully not as badly - the most notable time being the Water Hazard mission, where again, the music barely starts playing before it is cut off by a load screen]. This is the best franchise in gaming history and I hate that this one little issue messes things up. =( Even though the graphics are slightly more dated, people are better off playing the original version of halflife, which is a sad thing to have to say.-Faithfully, Concerned Citizen-			",525,113,8,59,48,2,76

												Half-Life: Source is the original Half-Life ported to the source engine. The source engine gives the game a slight graphical update, but it also causes some performance issues not present in the original game, such as longer loading times. It's also not entirely one to one with the original because of the source engine, but I still think it's overall faithful to the original game.

												I like Half Life. It is one of my all time favourite FPS games. I believe it is because of Half Life why I really came to like this genre. I have been collecting FPS games ever since. I hate its Source conversion. Why? Because it is not a full conversion but simply an enhanced version with the Source engine's features. You have better water effects and you also have better shaders, lighting, shadows, etc.But essentially, it is the same as the vanilla version was. If you do not use high-res textures in a room then using modern water effects makes the game look strange. You can easily see how these things cannot work together.Black Mesa is a much better way to relive the experience Half Life gave us 15 years ago. It is a total conversion of Half Life and what is more important: it is free. Download and install that one or simply reinstall the vanilla game again.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

It may be very similar to the original, but Half-Life: Source contains almost 100% of the models from 1998, plus improved shadows, water graphics, ragdolls, etc. I will note that barnacle tongues don't always stick out for some reason.

												Northing much to say which hasn't been said before. While this updates HL to the Source engine, I was left unimpressed. Some things were prettier but some gameplay changes had been made which, in my opinion, negatively affect the game. Graphical glitches (neither which happened playing the original HL or HL2) and the speed of movement are my two biggest complaints. That said, if you've never played HL before, this isn't a bad way to do it. It's in my Library and I'll not complain but I will be playing the original port when I do it again.			",111,37,1,3,7,0,3

But the original Half Life has several hundred fanmade modifications created for it already, with many more being developed. But this game allows you to play on Half Life 1 maps in Garrysmod and use the models for your posing delights.So my recommendation is to buy them both, it's quite worth it in the long run.

												For the record, my review of Half Life: Source can be applied to the original version of the game, except for a few asects that I touch upon regarding its transition to the Source Engine.By now, PC gamers everywhere have grasped full comprehension of Half Life. This monument of the videogame medium as a whole was VALVe Software's very first product; one that was by no means easy to produce, but was eternally rewarding. Half Life is still being played today and enjoyed by many people, and deservedly so. For it is one of those titles in videogame history that is recognized by many; even those who might have very little experience with the franchise or its modded stand-alone offsprings.Half Life puts the player in the shoes and HEV mark IV Protective System of everyone's favorite mute, crowbar-wielding, monster-slaying, marine-fighting theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman. The plot takes a humble beginning, as Gordon arrives to work--late--and prepares for what seems like a regular day at the Black Mesa Research Facility in the underground desert landscape of New Mexico. Perhaps a regular day, if not for the ""deviation from standard analysis procedure."" The player is let loose to briefly explore parts of the facility, allowing for a brief settlement before the experiment you are taking part of goes horribly wrong and all of a sudden that elevator you rode is out of order, that corridor you walked through is now covered in blood. That security  guard you talked to is trying to revive a scientist you had just run into 5 minutes ago, and that other scientist you talked to has turned into some weird mutant that is now walking towards you, though no longer with any interests of making small talk. Everything that the player had seen and gotten used to is now part of a horrific thrill ride; one that is action packed and will only get better from there.The game's story telling is absolutely fanstastic. It delivers a truly immersive experience by never leaving the first person perspective of the player and Dr. Freeman. It sacrifices cutscenes and cinematic mumbo-jumbo for first-hand experiences and uninterrupted gameplay. Said gameplay is very satisfying. There is a very good mix of firefights of varying intensity combined with puzzles and first person platforming. The puzzles can be a tad difficult at times, but just the right kind of difficulty to encourage perseverance and reward the player for their astuteness. Firefights are also quite fun; you start out making your way through waves of hostile inter-dimensional beings and later on fight none other than the few, the proud, the Marines, who pose quite an intimidating threat. The Marines really shine in the AI department, they're aggressive but smart enough to know when to retrieve. They have a sense of personal preservation unlike anything I have ever seen in any other videogame. They will try their hardest to kill Gordon, using any tools at their disposal, but they don't want to die, and will thus will make effective use of cover and defensive tactics. I would highly recommend purchasing the Source version of Half Life due to some added features such as much better particle effects, improved lighting and water effects, as well as the intergrated ragdoll physics. Those not interested in such added details could easily overlook the Source version and buy vanilla Half Life, seeing as how it is the same price on Steam as the Source version, but I would highly recommend getting this version for those who haven't experienced Half Life and are looking to get into it.You musn't dare call yourself a fan of Half Life or VALVe if you haven't played this game. Experience the original tale of a theoretical physicist trying to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility, perfectly remastered into VALVe's state of the art Source engine. It's a game you will not regreat putting your time and money into			",223,24,2,6,10,1,9

												This is an epic game. If you consider yourself a true gamer, a gamer, or just someone who likes games, this goes without saying: Get this game. For the sake of this being considered a 'review' (not a bath of game-praise), I will give a slight reviewish thing.An epic game, with a satisfying-length story line, pretty good puzzles/obstacles, and also a pretty good fighting/shooting graphics and sound set. Keep in mind that I'm not going to say that much of anything is 'great', as this game is from a decade and a half ago. The regular graphics are ahead of their time (though not up to all modern standards), and the regular sound is good. This game is rated M (17+), but I've found it more to be a 13+ game since the graphics/blood/fighting is generally realistic, but is still old enough that it isn't in the ""this is disturbing I just shot this guy and blood exploded everywhere"" section. The aliens (enemies) in this game are generally unrealistic, and their blood isn't even red (more of a yellow-green hue), and the soldiers (humans, but still enemies) that you have to fight are, for the most part, completely covered in military armor and it's almost nothing like shooting another human. However, you are able to shoot allies (humans) as well, and if you do it's the same effect as the soldiers (blood flies lightly onto the nearest obstruction, character falls over, possibly shouts/groans in pain).That's pretty much all I've got. The jist of this review is: GO BUY THIS GAME. Okay? Good. Now leave me alone. ;)			",140,29,3,9,5,1,8

												The port of Half-Life for Source engine. Unfortunately they just shipped the game to source, not giving a damn about upgrading graphics, for instances. So it's copy past Half-Life on a better engine. Nothing much here. Check Half-Life reviews and you'll know if you want to play this. Short version of my review is, if you want to know Half-Life's story, you MUST PLAY THIS GAME. If you want a challenge, PLAY IT. If you like long games, PLAY IT. Overall, YOU MUST PLAY IT if you like FPS games. 11/10 played it again 3 times already			",346,84,17,32,25,8,36

												I do not understand the critisiams that this port has recieved. Scrolling down to the comments section, it shows that people are butt-hurt about a '♥♥♥♥♥♥ port of the origanal' and plenty saying to 'buy the gold source version'. I think that these reviews are unjust. Now before clarifing, I have not purchased or ever played the origanal game. That said, HALF LIFE SOUCE is one of my favourite games of all time. Now people may be salty at me because I have never played the very first valve game, but the hatred towards it is that people have encounted lots of glitches. I however, have encounted none whatsoever in the many hours of playing. To clarify, I dont have a great PC. It has a crap Intel HD graphics, 8GB of RAM and a Intel Core i3. After second reviewing, I have found that the negative 'buy the origanal 1998 version' fanboys are from the last 30 days. I hope to counteract this, as I think it its embarressing to see one of my favouite games be downranked by meer mortals that don't know what a better version of a game is if they saw it. Because this game fixes,1: Better Models (Player Arms, Guns, Enemies, with only a few odd looking textures here and there that are bearable)2: Source intergration (You can play the maps in Garry's Mod and can play Half Life 2 levels if you know the console commands)And before people complain for me to get the origanal, I'd rather get Black Mesa than even attempting to play a game still stuck in 1998			",47,6,0,3,2,0,0

												Before downvoting me, please read. I do not hate Half-Life, in the matter of the fact Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time. But this game is not Half-Life that you will enjoy and have fun with. It might have better shadows and water, but after Steampipe update, Valve released unfinished port to Source Engine 2013 which broke a lot of stuff. Before steampipe update. Everything was fine and worked perfectly.This same goes for Half-Life Deathmatch: Source.

												Half Life 1, one of Valve's first games to come to the Source engine.Common question I get asked, what's the difference between the ""source"" and ""non-source"" versions?Really, not a whole lot. Textures look the same, lighting, story, all that. Only things that you will be able to pick out is that the puzzles towards the end are wired differently. This is why I would have someone play the Source version over the goldsource one.Should you play it? Yes.Do you have to play this to call yourself a PC gamer? Yes.Is it really required or a ""must play""? No.Many people would not be able to deal with the graphics, puzzles and ""lack of heart pounding action"". Sad to see people turn a title down due to those reasons.Speaking of graphics, you should be able to run this without problems. If you can't, get rid of Steam.

												Half-Life 2 may be a timeless classic, but the 1998 original needed a bit of a re-surfacing to hold up in a modern gaming environment. Half-Life: Source is the entire original game running on top of Valve's ""Source"" game engine. This gives the game much better lighting, physics and overall gameplay.Strangely, though, it does NOT include the higher(er) resolution textures and models update rolled-out by Valve and Gearbox as part of the release of Blue Shift. Without it, it's the same low-res graphics through Source-colored glasses.Fortunately a third-party has adapted the update for use in Half-Life: Source. I highly recommend downloading it to make this the definitive version of Half-Life. http://hds.newmail.ru/eng_download.html ",171,37,4,19,8,0,12

												It's somewhat ok as far as graphics goes. there are a lot of bugs and glitches and all that funtastic stuff. Something thats pretty strange is that the first time I started the game up and played it, all of the weapons and character models where completely different from the original Half-Life. The second time I started it up, the models were the same as the original the only difference to the game is just better textures and lighting (somewhat better). I have no idea what thats about or if anyone else is having this problem. Really the only thing that keeps me playing it is that you can turn on fast sitch weapons which is like really awesome.  I honestly dont like how this game looks and I recommed either getting the original Half-Life or just wait for Black Mesa to come out on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life Source is a great idea on paper. A complete remake of the original Half-Life but in the Source engine with all the technological and graphical improvements that would bring. It is something a lot of us fans of the original would love to see. Unfortunately that is simply not what happened here.Half-Life Source only barely qualifies as being a port. They didn't change or upgrade anything, everything looks and feels the same and the only way you can tell it's a Source game is by looking at the game name.Graphics, animations, physics. Nothing has been improved to what Source is capable of. It is Half-Life running in Source sure, but if you can't tell the difference does it really matter?It is a great disappointment and a huge waste of money. If I had lost my copy of Half-Life back in the day I would have gladly shelled out the cash for a new copy so I could keep playing. But this isn't back in the day and this isn't the right Half-Life. You don't get the mods with this one.Stay away from this horribly rushed money grab. It's a waste of your time and your money. Go buy the original Half-Life instead or if you already own that, go play the Black Mesa mod. It's free and it doesn't suck.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												There are new physics and other cool stuff but it is very broken and they haven't done much effort to this remake. The weapons looked allright in the original Half-Life but in this they look like plastic. And i liked playing in thirdperson sometimes in the original but in this it's a mess. Just enable thirdperson in the console and see how Gordon has a crowbar, crossbow or a huge rocket launcher as a di*k. This may be cooler and better to some people, but for me... meh.After all the original was one of my favourite games back then and it still is, but THIS is just bad in my opinion.

												Half-Life: Source is possibly the biggest flop Valve has ever put out besides ricochet. There's really nothing different between this and the original 1998 Half-Life besides Realistic Water and a new Physics engine. Infact this game doesn't really ""Enhance"" it at all. You could think of it as worse considering the amount of Bugs this game has and the fact that the recent Steam-Pipe update ruined everything and messed up the Shiny Shaders. I would totally not reccomend this game to anybody for the sake of it being worse than the 1998 release of Half-Life.			",53,2,0,5,2,0,0

												I went into this having played hl2, but not the original. I was pleasantly surprised.The story is a bit odd, but still quite good. Freeman just gets thrown in the deep end, which if you look at it from one of two perspectives either makes everything terrifying or hilarious. This also provides a bit more backstory to the universe, which is good.A wide variety of weapons available. More so than hl2, I think, which is interesting and quite neat. It makes sense, given that this is set in a scietific research complex.I had some trouble getting my xbox controller to work with this, but I think using a keyboard/mouse setup works better. There's no real need for a gamepad here.Textures are about the right wuality for the age of the game. Not great by ""today"" standards, but still better than some games released about that time.The soundtrack in this is really good, but the voices in the game can sound a bit garbled and echo-ey at times.Despite the fact that this is a moderately old game, the source remake means that it has no compatibility issues with newer systems.If you've never played the original half life, then definitely buy this game. If you've not played either half life or half life 2, I would reccomend looking for a bundle on steam to buy that contains all of them.			",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

												While it does use some of the Source engine's features, it's just a lazy port of Half-Life to the Source engine, and came with a couple bugs and glitches not seen in the original. Counter Strike got a full remake on Source, but this is just disappointing and by how much this game aged, I think it needed a full fledged remake (cough, cough, ""BLACK MESA"" cough, cough) Overall, buy the original Goldsrc version.

												Half Life 1, one of Valve's first games to come to the Source engine.Common question I get asked, what's the difference between the ""source"" and ""non-source"" versions?Really, not a whole lot. Textures look the same, lighting, story, all that. Only things that you will be able to pick out is that the puzzles towards the end are wired differently. This is why I would have someone play the Source version over the goldsource one.Should you play it? Yes.Do you have to play this to call yourself a PC gamer? Yes.Is it really required or a ""must play""? No.Many people would not be able to deal with the graphics, puzzles and ""lack of heart pounding action"". Sad to see people turn a title down due to those reasons.Speaking of graphics, you should be able to run this without problems. If you can't, get rid of Steam.

												a brilliant game, one of the best games ever created and source adds to it. it adds better water, ragdolls and shinyness to the game. great If your'e a half life fan but if your'e playing this game for the first time i personally prefer the more retro look of the oigional half life. it comes to a choice, do you want to sacrifice soul for better graphics and a more modern feel?still mindblowingly great			",114,23,0,9,7,0,4

												Now this game.............man this game. highly recommend it since well its pretty much what started alot of half life mods. this is the best FPS game due to the fact people have been able to actualy make mods from it, as well as sprout off into a series. The storyline is great, variety of weaponry, level designs are confusing at times, and it has its fair share of jumpscares here and there. for a game back in its time this is a game i would highly recommend for anyone wanting to get into half life and some of the mods that came from it			",221,35,3,23,12,0,7

												Bought the complete Pack for $10 during the Winter Sale. A pretty good game, in my opinion. Graphics arent great at all considering the games we have today, but graphics dont entirely make a game. The story was pretty good. This game doesnt focus on just running around, killing everyone, completing the objective and moving on to the next stage. It has a good amount of jumping puzzles and scenarios that make you think about how to advance to the next chapter. I will admit i was stuck on the end boss for about a  good 30 minutes before i realized what i had to do. The end of the game definitely left unanswered questions. I will most definitely be playing the whole series. Overall, Half-Life was a good, fun game.			",207,47,2,17,10,0,29

												I am recomending it for being a neatly upgraded version of Half-Life. By Upgraded, I mean that the water is very pretty. Despite my recomendation, I did encounter a few glitches. In the conveyor belt area, the graphics were popping around so badly, I could not see where I was going. There was also a game breaking glitch where I could not progress past a door and it forced me to cheat to get past the problem. Keep that in mind, if you buy it. But remember! Pretty water...

												Half-Life is one of the best and most influential fps games of the last few decades, and I think most would agree. Half-Life: Source is an update using Valve's source engine. While it's mostly the same, from level design, weapons, ect. there are minor differences such as updated water, better lighting and ragdolls. But this version has a lot more bugs than it's Goldsrc counterpart. Some that i came across were a floating scientist in the Anomalous Materials chapter, invisible barnacle tongues and the tentacle in Blast Pit not doing any damage (although that might not be a bug as I've heard that it was severely nerfed and can barely hit you). As for which version you should get for a first time player, it's kind of a toss-up. On one hand, Source looks slightly better, can be played in widescreen and has the updated water/lighting, but the original has much less bugs and has many more mods. It's really just up to you which you want. If you already have the original, though, there's not enough of anything new to justify a purchase. If you want a true source remake from the ground up, then buy BlackMesa.			",32,0,0,1,2,0,0

												Half-Life was a game that was released in 1998 which was very old by today's graphic standards, but very great at it's time. Needing only a 500 MHz processor and a 16MB Direct 3D card this game was very much playable today, but since source came out (2004) the game's graphics engine was updated causing a 1.2 GHz Processor and a 64MB video card uping up the graphics, but still being beat by Half-Life 2's graphics later in the year.Gameplay:     The gameplay was very long and hours, even days to complete this 19 chaptered game in order to have the full experience, but I'm not going to tell what happens in the story like Half-Life 2's review because I'd ruin the story.     The enimies are harder in this game than Half-Life 2, but it's still able to be beat, but you will need to stratigize to beat this without taking tons of damage to yourself.Rating:     The final rating was 9.5/10 because it could've been less time consuming, but the story really counters that con anyways.Up next in reviews by Dead Kitty: Half-Life 2: Episode One			",36,0,0,0,2,0,0

This game basicly took all the things I liked about the normal one and just made it look awful (THE CROWBAR LOOKS LIKE CRAP) and made the game A LOT more buggier. This game WILL crash.....often, and after a while it just got stupid so I switched back to the original one. I'm not saying Half life is bad, no I actually recommend that game, BUT NOT THIS VERSION!

												Even so many years after it's release, this holds up really nicely and the Source update adds an extra pop to the visual splendor. But, visuals aren't everything in a game and Half Life understands it. Building on the puzzle mechanics of Doom and Quake, the puzzles are challenging, complex and they are quite accessible once you are involved in them. The combat mechanics are very immersive. The A.I. is really good and the enemies are challenging to defeat, especially the marines. Black Mesa is a delightful post-apocolayptic base that is a lot larger than initially expected. The voice acting is a little hoakey but it gives the game a more narritve feeling that was unique at the time. The sound effects are impressive and the enemies are well-designed. The amount of effort put into the game and the satisfaction you'd get from playing it is certainly admirable. It invigorated the FPS genre and its not hard to see why. :)			",107,17,2,6,9,0,3

												Half-Life Source: It's Half-Life 1 with the source engine. HL1 is my most favorite game if all time. I like it better than HL2. I'm really happy they brought it to the source engine. It has some few minor problems. It crashes every once in a while. Sometimes, some graphics don't load. Despite those minor little issues, which happen rarely for me, the game is very nice and plays smoothly. I like playing HL1 on the source engine more than the original. It has better physics and fixes some problems with the original. Worth the money! Has a great, in depth story, awesome guns, great settings, awesome enemies, and the best protagonist of all time, Gordon Freeman. 10/10 Would crowbar headcrabs again!			",18,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The granddaddy of them all.Newer gamers might have a hard time visualizing how revolutionary this game was at the time, but it was one of the first truly narrative-driven FPS in gaming history. What's truly surprising is how well the game holds up - level design has aged somewhat (lots of corridors. LOTS of corridors), but the standards established in this game are still quite present today.This version of the game has been updated to use the Source engine for effects and physics, as well as the water modeling, so it's the best version of the game to purchase if you're looking for the best experience.Words cannot express how much you should own this game. It's as close to a mandatory purchase as you can get in gaming.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

If youre familiar with source games this will be easier for  you compared to the original one. Im so used with how valves games work and this will be fun to play in source.			",142,13,3,5,14,0,3

Despite the fact that there were more technologically advanced games available when I played it, I still found myself immersed in both the universe that the game was painting, as well as the mechanics of the gameplay itself. Sure, some things leave a little to be desired (looking at you, ladders), but the fact that people still talk about, play about, and modify this game (see: Black Mesa) should be testament to its timelessness.

												Half Life is a classic game, enjoyed by many in it's time, and even now. This however, is not exactly the original game, but more of a remake, built in the Source engine. In my review of the game I'm going to sum the whole game up, with an honest review on it's ups and downs - so let's get right into it.So let's start of with the storyline of the game. You stard of as a newly graduated Gordon Freeman on his way to work at the Black Mesa research facility. When you get to work, you have to get into a test chamber, where they are putting some kind of crystal onto a laser, but something goes wrong. The crystal messes with time and space and opens a portal to another dimension called Xen, through this portal, alien beings wreck havock in the facility. In the mean time the government here's of this, and decides not to help, but to kill everyone and everything involved. Nowadays, this story seems pretty generic, and is used in practically every sci-fi movie ever made, but this was made in 1998. Even still, I do think it was a bit lazy, but was a fun and exciting story nevertheless. The game includes many strategy based puzzles, and most things were very challenging, and some points I had to watch a YouTube tutorial on how on earth to complete parts. These puzzles were slightly annoying though at times, such as when the tram in 'On a Rail' and the conveyorbelts in 'Residue Processing'. Despite this, you always feel a sence of achievement after completing them, which is great.The original Half Life was a game that was made in 1998, and the graphics, while not horrible, are not great. This Source remake version was made in 2004, and the graphics are slightly improved, but I don't really think it matters which game you decide to play. I do think that the Source version however, was not ported over very well, as there were many scripted events that were broken, such as a security guard dying and so on. Also on the chapter, 'Residue Processing' which jumping from platform to platform, the screen will randomly show yellow, red and black splatters of colour across the screen, (see screenshot on my profile) which made the level almost impossible. Overall, I found this a great game to play, it was verey enjoyable, but extremely annoying and painful in certain chapters. I am going to give it a 7/10, purely because there was a lot of stuff that was broken, but aside from that I would reccomend you play it.			",102,9,1,8,7,0,1

												I've owned 5 copies of this game.THIS is the game by which all future story driven FPS games would be measured by.  It is one of the greatest games of all time.Now understand that even though I love this game (LOOOOOOVE!!!!), it's been toyed with.  Updates to the Source engine have caused issues.So, it's a play at your own risk kinda thing.Favorite quote -""                                                    .""-Gordon Freeman			",33,3,0,6,0,0,0

												Why should you buy this instead of the original one? First of its using the source engine and source engine is from 2004 which has good HD quailty like todays hl2 series have. The original is always better but the pros about this is not becuause its better quailty. I bought the HL Complete pack which I installed the source one. If youre familiar with source games this will be easier for  you compared to the original one. Im so used with how valves games work and this will be fun to play in source.			",142,13,3,5,14,0,3

												The granddaddy of them all.Newer gamers might have a hard time visualizing how revolutionary this game was at the time, but it was one of the first truly narrative-driven FPS in gaming history. What's truly surprising is how well the game holds up - level design has aged somewhat (lots of corridors. LOTS of corridors), but the standards established in this game are still quite present today.This version of the game has been updated to use the Source engine for effects and physics, as well as the water modeling, so it's the best version of the game to purchase if you're looking for the best experience.Words cannot express how much you should own this game. It's as close to a mandatory purchase as you can get in gaming.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												Half-Life Source: It's Half-Life 1 with the source engine. HL1 is my most favorite game if all time. I like it better than HL2. I'm really happy they brought it to the source engine. It has some few minor problems. It crashes every once in a while. Sometimes, some graphics don't load. Despite those minor little issues, which happen rarely for me, the game is very nice and plays smoothly. I like playing HL1 on the source engine more than the original. It has better physics and fixes some problems with the original. Worth the money! Has a great, in depth story, awesome guns, great settings, awesome enemies, and the best protagonist of all time, Gordon Freeman. 10/10 Would crowbar headcrabs again!			",18,0,0,0,0,0,0

9/10 - may Gaben be with you.Hey, it's Half-Life. It was ahead of its time when it was released, but has it aged well? In terms of mechanics, not really. Graphics? Meh. The story, however - holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I forgot how much I loved this game, and loved it with good reason too. The story is nothing short of amazing, and it's pretty obvious why people are begging for an edition to wrap everything up.If you want to get into the series, HL: Source is the way to go. Updated physics and a few graphical changes may not mean the biggest difference in the world, but it's enough to get noticed.Are there things I'd argue are flawed? Sure - but overall the plot is so enjoyable that you'll accept the game's age for what it is and still have a great time.			",212,71,2,51,39,2,51

												The game that gave birth to the wonderful Half-Life 2. This game really is great, it perfects its action sequences while at the same time throwing in some humor and freedom that Valve knew the player would take great use of. You could lead an army of scientists or guards to follow you around, helping you until they die. It really is fun and easy to work with, and for 1998, it really has a creative and tactical storyline. There are plenty of puzzles and battles that the player has to put their skills to the test, definitely a must play and a classic.			",63,5,0,5,2,0,0

												This game was on my wishlist ever since I played the original Half Life, because I thought ""Hey, Half Life with better graphics and physics? Yes please!"". At that point, I had already played Black Mesa, the fan-made mod for HL2 which is essentially Half Life with better graphics, better than this even!Anyway, the Negatives:- I had some graphical issues related to the factory levels with the conveyor belts, when I turned my flashlight on and look at water, the whole screen would mess up- Gonarch at two points refused to move, meaning I had to skip the entire chapter (but I could do that easily via the menu, I didn't need to use commands!)- Even enemies refused to move sometimes- Xen in general was pretty broken and messy, so if that's your favorite chapter, be warned!- You can't gib ragdolls by hitting them anymore, nor can you move them around like in Half Life 2The Positives:+ The graphics and physics are really nice, everything feels more real than the original+ Destroying shelves and boxes and whatnot is way better and more fun+ The Flashlight was improved a LOT, as well as lighting+ Unlike Black Mesa, all the levels were exactly the same and the enemies behaved the same way as they did in HL1+ The Menu was improved a lot, as well as saving and loading and the whole GUI+ Movement is still the same, but it felt smoother to me and less clunky than in HL1All in all, I'd only recommend this game if you have played Half Life 1 already and want to play it with slightly better graphics. I wouldn't recommend it over Black Mesa if you want a Half Life game JUST for the graphics, only if you prefer the gameplay and feel of the old game and want to see it with a slight twist!If Half-Life 1 was a 96/100, I'd give this game a 88/100!

												The only reason I am giving this a reccomendation is because I love half-life. Other than that it's a pretty poorly worked port of half-life to source engine with bugs that honestly make it look like you bought a comedy movie with the game. For example, sometimes friendly NPCs keep screaming even after their attacker is dead.			",26,11,0,6,6,0,1

												Unless you have Garry's Mod and want to play around with HL1 stuff, don't get this version of the game. It's just HL1 in a different engine with very minimal graphical upgrades that don't really fit with the old graphics in my opinion. And if that wasn't mediocre enough, it's filled with bugs. So, unless you enjoy getting seizures from graphical errors and like to watch scientists as they magically float above their chairs, get the regular GoldSrc version instead.			",299,82,8,55,37,6,41

												Don’t get me wrong Half-Life is an amazing game, a masterpiece in fact that really stands the test of time. However I cannot in good faith recommend this version of the game. Considering this is supposed to be a remade version of the original game it has too many bugs to make it worth a buy. Now these are not bugs from the original game that they just didn’t fix, the game introduces NEW bugs and glitches. While I myself have never experienced anything game breaking or crashes (although I have heard of it happening). I must ask you what's the point in getting it if it's just worse than the original? Not to mention you're missing out on the huge mod scene of the original game.			",198,38,0,6,4,1,6

												So why would I write a review for a game that's been out for like over 10 years and that is one of the greatest games on Steam? Well because I wanted to, but all other things aside this game is a great game hands down. Now I know it is a remake of Half-Life on the Source engine so it does do things a little bit differently sometimes from the original game. But the original game in a nutshell is basically that you are a scientist named Gordon Freeman on a project doing with specimens from a dimension called ""Xen"". You arrive at work late one day to test a rather unstable specimen, causing a sort of bridge between the dimensions of our world and Xen. You must fight through these monsters that teleports through this bridge and find out whats causing this catastrophic event. You must also fight the military who are trying their best to quiet this event by killing all of the monsters and the faculty of Black Mesa. Shooting is very satisfying in this game and it goes by the traditional ""You are Hulk ♥♥♥♥ing Hogan and you can put 20 guns in your pockets"". Which means you can carry stuff like pistols, smgs to rocket launchers and alien weapon things. Overall I give this game atleast 9.5/10 in my book. (If it was IGN I would give it a 20/10)			",92,4,1,3,4,1,1

												Half-Life Source is a slightly enhanced version of the 1998 classic. This supposed remake retains most of the original game's textures, models and animation but favours towards the better world effects available from the new Source engine of the time. Half-Life Source has a Havoc powered physics engine with enemies and objects obeying Newton's three laws, picture-quality water reflections and expanded scenary - now built as geometry rather than painted on backdrops. Also, the sound and presenetation now borrows heavily from Half-Life 2.My opinion of Half-Life Source is rather mixed, befuddled even. HL: Source feels very sloppily put together and thrown over. Valve could of and should of done a complete overhaul of the game. It's lukewarm reception from the many alienated players of the game led to the creation of Black Mesa Source, a total conversion set to unofficially reimagine the first game on the source engine. I implore you to wait for it instead. Otherwise, buy the original.			",1297,466,58,157,117,11,205

												Half LIfe is a great game, however, Valve did a sloppy job converting it to source. All of the models still retain their goldsrc materials and models, except now they have ragdoll physics. Also, thanks to the change of physics, there are certain parts that are harder to navigate. For example, in the chapter ""Blast Pit"" where you have to move the crates over the electrified water spill,  the crates hardly move at all thx to the source physics, making it almost guarenteed you'll be shocked.You're much better off playing Black Mesa Source.

												Where do I even begin? Half-Life is easily my favorite game of all time. The controls are amazing. The story line is intriguing and is hugely expanded on by the large amount of sequels (still no Half Life 3 though). I love how you can talk to the AI in the game and convince them to follow you and help you fight, which can help save ammo, but also adds to the control you have. Honestly, thats what makes Half Life 1 great. Control! You feel like you have full control over the game. You are never fighting with it to get it to work. I hate to do this, but this is just one of those few games that I simply can't find any flaws with. I would honestly rate this game a 10/10. I often come back to this game and play through it again, and I will continue to do so in the future. If you haven't already, get yourself a copy and play this game!			",39,9,0,3,9,0,2

												Seriously this is bad work from Valve. Don't buy this just because it's remastered and the better graphics. There is lot of bugs and errors. And the graphics didn't change much they just put reflections and water looking better. Mostly game looks exactly the same the original. BUT hey you can get almost 300 fps (on my computer). JUST GO buy Black Mesa or original Half-Life instead of this carbage.			",43,0,1,0,1,1,0

												HL:S doesn't offer much from the original HL beside the engine: ragdolls, water reflections and HDR support, but other than that, it's pretty bare. There is absolutely no new content, and many textures, models and maps are broken compared to the less-but-still broken version of the original Half-Life on Steam. If you want to only focus on the single player campaign, I suggest purchasing a disc copy of Half-Life online. However, if you want to jump in to a multiplayer server, purchase HL1 from steam, as HLS has a very dead multiplayer community. I think that the only upside of purchasing this is the ability to use its content in Garry's Mod. I am not a hater of HL, but this is a very bad buy.			",77,5,5,4,7,0,1

												Half life. One of the original games that almost every PC gamer has heard of or played. Half life puts you in the shoes of a scientist from black mesa. Gordan Freeman. A experiment goes horribly wrong and causes a ""Ressonance Cascade"" (not sure if i spelled it right) which allows aliens from another world (dimension or universe) to come to earth. The complex goes wacky and communications are out. Troops from the surface are coming down to rescue, as the science team says, but they plan to kill everyone who was involved.You must fight the troops and aliens, and make your way through their homeworld to defeat Nihilanth that controlls everything. Once Nihilanth has been defeated, all the vorticaunts and aliens are free. Gman then teleports you and gives you an offer. Work with him. Or be teleported to thousands of aliens and be slaughtered with the text that says. ""You Died"" You choose to work with him.On to Half Life 2...Pros:A classic CLASSIC game that every PC gamer should play.An amazing storyline that features some of the best moments in gaming history.Made by Valve.Cons:You havent bought it yet.Its a upgraded source code that's a little broken. Sometimes there are glitches but I havent come across any or crashes.10/10The. Best. Game. In. History			",72,2,0,3,3,0,1

												This really didn't need to be a thing, especially not for a retail of $10. It's only redeemable quality is Sources dev_console, and the ability along with other Source games, to choose a chapter to start off with, if you have already completed that chapter previously. Reports of graphical bugs throughout and some that are game breaking. Consider purchasing the original instead of this if you haven't already.			",104,11,1,12,6,0,5

												Half Life 1 on Saucehonestly, this is a downgrade to half life.It still uses the old weapon and character models wich have a bit better looking textues.But valve has made new models for the original game wich look way better already.Also, this version has more bugs and gliches (taking damage by not moving obejects, textures go apeshiet,etc) So there's not point to play it.Just spare youself the money and buy the normal half life if you don't have it already.it's still a great game but my negative review is towards the unnecessariness of this product.

												To make that people understand: Half-Life: Source is Half-Life. I enjoyed it because of that. Everything related to the original game is there, so, yeah, Half-Life: Source is a very good game in that aspect. Read that review to understand that HL:S could be a good choice for those that never played Half-Life - http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/70. For people like me, that played the original back then and many times after, the only real change seen is in the graphics but not in a spectacular way.Contrary to the title, the Source Engine, from Half-Life 2, isn't used at all. In reality, I feel like it's just the HD Texture Pack that was applied. And that pack was used for Half-Life: Blueshift, released in 2001. The mod-that-became-a-game Black Mesa is better if you want a real Half-Life with the Source Engine (though it's not sticking strictly to the original in terms of level design).I felt cheated. I don't remember if I bought the game or if I got it in a collector's edition of Half-Life 2 but I felt cheated there. I was expecting much better thing from Half-Life: Source and in the end, apart the fun that is still intact because it's Half-Life, I felt that the promise wasn't there.That's why I'm thumbing down this version of the game for people that love Half-Life and that would have preferred a better treatment for it. It doesn't mean that the game is bad in itself, I repeat, it's Half-Life. But I prefer to buy the original than that, that's all.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												As of today 2/27 this game is weird. It seems buggy as heckI dont really understand, from what Im reading the game was fine when it came out? But now its near completely broken I think. There are glitches EVERYWHERE and other weird going ons. I don't really understand how Valve could have broken so much in this game with updates?Technically speaking there are supposed to be very little changes, controls feel like you would expect in Source and are good and accurate when compared to how the old GoldSrc games control today which can take some getting used to but isn't bad. The way everything is rendered and shaders are diffrent, things look a bit more crisp but all models and textures are old. They actually look uglier to me than the standard HL1 non-hd models which I feel are the best to me visually. Ragdolls are added but thats really the only physics addition. Everything else from gibs to med packs uses the old HL1 physics where it simply falls or for gibs bounces and bounces. The water looks nice but does not fit in when everything around it looks cartoony. It ruins the dam scene for me atleast. Also they made some small changes in areas that I wasn't a huge fan of, mostly just looks related stuff and nothing big or something worth whining about. But of all the ports of HL1 I have played, which is only the PS2 and Source port, I like this one less. Atleast the PS2 version was objectively better than the original on PC when it came out in 2001. The orignal was released in '98. The Source port came out in 2004 and has none of the new content found in the PS2 version including the Coop expansion, Half Life Decay. I have not touched the Dreamcast version nor have I ever owned or played the Dreamcast aside from maybe one time at a family friends...maybe..its been probably near a decade since that. I also have not played the Linux or Mac ports but honestly I have no reason to ever want to us Mac OS. Linux is gaining ground though.Also the expansions are not present. Just basic Half Life 1.Present in this current version there is a huge problem with hit boxes on tanks, helicopters, and enemies of that type. The Gonarch also seemed to not take damage alot of the time when I was hitting it. Its just iffy and I want to say broken. Also with source some of the design decisions that were taken with Half Life 1 just seem awful. Vorts never missing even though it feels like your moving like Speedy Gonzalez just feels like bs and Xen still sucks. Yeah, Xen always sucks. I hate it so much until you get closer to the end and fight the nihlanth/final boss.But Half Life is still half life and its still fun. But this just isn't better in any way than the original aside from a few negligible graphics points. Black Mesa Source is what this game should have been, except for the fact that they did change alot of the game and removed some points and added others. This game should have just been Half Life but graphically updated with some small gameplay upgrades. Its just not what it should have been and falls short of the original.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												Now, I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs that I've read some other people complain about, but since I need to complain about SOMETHING, here is my review.Hitboxes: They normally work fine. Except the time I wasted 10 bullets shooting a barnacle realising they all go through it. Had the same problem with houndeyes during the Blast Pit chapter. The real problem was with the Apache helicopter during the Surface Tension chapter where most of my rockets seemed to go through it, so unless you're lucky or skilled enough to hit it in a specific spot, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.The AI was really ♥♥♥♥in' dumb in some situations. I'm not saying that it was perfect in the original GoldSrc version, but how did they manage to dumb it down?Also, some textures and sound files were missing.tl;dr - Stick with the GoldSrc version.

												There's no doubth that this game is a classic, i remember playing it back in the 90's when it was just getting popular, magazines and gamers all across the globe were praysing Half Life for basically everything that could've been considered ""good"" in a game. Whether it was or not the gem that people claim even to this day to be, Half Life hasn't aged very well. The problem ironically doesn't last on it's graphics or even voice acting, the problem with Half Life it's it's game design, playing through the popular mod ""Black Mesa"" I can assure you that each and every single problem was solved on my part, the game was incredible, it had fantastic set pieces that played across perfectly as you played through the game having fun and confort all together, but this classic is just invaded with problems such as bad controls, difficult platforming, ""sluggish shooting"", and so on. Maybe you can get some enjoyment here and there if difficult first person platforming goes well with you, as it for me, it just tends to give me a headache.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's just half-life with better water. Nothing comparable to the original half-life. If you would like to play a modern graphic level half-life buy black mesa. Though you are better off with the original half life both ways because of all the fun mods that you can play aside from the game.			",29,0,0,1,0,0,0

												I feel ripped off.I bought this classic during the summer sale in the hopes of getting the full half-life experience in slightly nicer graphics than the original. Valve published it, this is *the* valve brand, I bought it on steam and I expected it to work. I didn't even get to do any gameplay, before I was fuming. During the car ride in the beginning alone the game had to stop and load (!) four times! When I finally got out it had to load around every third corner. Don't make me laugh and say it's my rig. I live in the year 2014 and I expect a game from 1998 (or even 2004) to work properly and without loading every 30seconds!			",141,36,4,28,18,0,26

												I'm sure this game was amazing at the time the original Half-Life came out. However, by todays standards this game leaves much to be desired. While I enjoyed the story telling from the eyes of the main character ""Gordan Freeman"", I found the actual gameplay to be disappointing for the following reasons:1. Movement is far too sensitive. Gordan moves very quickly. This wouldn't be a major concern except that this game includes plenty of platforming elements and this over-sensitivity makes certain parts of the game as well as ladders annoying and frustrating. 2. NPC's act glitchy. They will repeat grunt/pain noises repeatedly even when they are no longer being harmed. I have even seen some get stuck running in place without any obstacle stopping them. Enemy AI can be abused.3. Sound. The sound for the starting gun and crowbar are overly loud while the sound for other weapons such as the assault rifle are nearly impossible to hear.It's an old game obviously, and it shows. By todays standards I cannot recommend this. I am only continuing for the story so I can start Half Life 2.			",333,69,6,36,24,4,30

												Half-Life was an amazing game back in 1998. It's one of the few games that I remember playing, and completing during that time. I would recommend Half-Life to anyone who hasn't played it, but for those who have, it just doesn't hold up over time. It's just not the same as playing it back in the 90s. Then again, many things aren't.This source version of the game, doesn't do anything for me. The graphics are better, but that makes the game... ""less scary"". There is way too much lighting. Areas that used to be dark, and spooky, are now brightly lit, and the emenies aren't scary at all, because the newly done models, just don't have the same effect as the older, darker models.I remember nearly running from the room when the game originally came out, because it was just too scary. The new graphics, and brightly lit models, just put me to sleep.I find this source edition to be even less interesting, because it gives you instant access to every level in the game. So there is no challenge anymore. There is no reason to play the game from the start (there is no reason to save), because you can just pick any level you want, and start there. That might be fun for some people, but as soon as I saw that was an option, I was instantly turned off. Sure, this is an option, and you don't have to play it that way, but just due to the fact that the levels are all open, is a turn off for me.If you're looking for this game, because you think it's going to take you back to the 90s... Don't be surprised when it doesn't have that same effect.			",0,1,1,1,1,0,1

												It's a garbo port. Simply put, they just redid some of the textures/water and called it a day, failing to account for how the small differences between Goldsrc and Source could completely change the game. Twice Source's slightly different jumping physics led to me ending up in areas of the levels that rendered them unwinnable (and not obviously unwinnable for a good 5-10 minutes, either), the first boss is completely broken and can't even hurt you, and the new soldier AI makes the soldiers go from ""reasonably difficult"" to ""lord help me I'm being swarmed and have nowhere to go"". In the end, a slight graphical touch-up just isn't worth dealing with the myriad of problems this port introduced.			",2310,879,81,245,235,24,319

												Half Life---- One Of The Best Games Ever Created, I'm am totally ♥♥♥♥ing serious. This game is absolutely ingenious and it's about 16 years old now. This was, (and probably still is), Valve's Greatest Achievement. I speak for all the ports and versions,(Original 1998 Release)-Buggy-Classic Feeling(Source Version)-Physics Engine-Fixed Most 98 Bugs-Added More Bugs(Black Mesa)(I don't know much about)-Physics Engine-New Models +Textures-Female Scientists-Probably Moar Bugz(Playstation 2 Disc)-HD Pack Installed-No Physics Engine-Bugs Are Rare(There may be more that I don't know about)I Love The First Half-Life So Much, I Was Literally Gordon Freeman for Halloween Last year, (Looked more like a short mexican doctor with Gordon's nametag though).

A classic game that does not need introductions.This is a classic that defined its genre, and 16 years after its release is still very enjoyable.The ""source"" version of it is a reimplementation of the original game on Valve's then new engine and offers a slightly better graphic experience, although much of the visual artifacts have been left unchanged, with low-count polygons models and low-res textures.In terms of gameplay one has to think to how computers and games were back in 1998.  Seen with modern eyes some of the game mechanics are repetitive (especially towards the end, where increased difficult = more badass monsters from previous levels to kill), but again, if you are going to play this game now you should definitively approach it as a movie-goer would approach a black&white film from the 40's.

												Meh. Buy it if you have some strange urge to, but If you want a source remake of the original Half-Life, just look up Black Mesa. This isn't really worth it at all. Just buy the original Half-Life if you're gonna buy this.			",46,0,0,6,1,0,0

												♥♥♥♥♥♥ all around. The graphics were worse than the original. The sky looked like one of Buckmister Fuller's geodesic domes. Using the flashlight in a tunnel resulted in strange planar artifacts that occluded the view. The final level never completed, even after the big boss was killed. It would have been better just to play the original.			",82,1,0,3,0,0,0

												Having heard some good things about Half-Life, I finally purchased it one day. As a huge fan of FPS games, I wanted to like this game.Sadly, I didn't. At least not as much as other FPS games I've played, such as Doom, Quake and Unreal. Those games are better than this on many levels. For one, they didn't have annoying platforming with mechanics that just barely function. They also didn't include frustratingly difficult human enemies that drain your health from 100% down to 5%, sections where you had to run and jump through enemy hordes and traps because the game suddenly decided to not give you any ammunition, or areas you couldn't get out of if you happened to find yourself lost in them.Half-Life, on the other hand, did include all of those things, and those are the reasons why I only enjoyed it so much. While the game shines in its presentation, it falls short on its gameplay, at least for me. Unless you're into stuff of the aforementioned sort, I can't say I'd recommend Half-Life either.

												The only reason you should have this game is if you got it in the Valve complete pack.If you got this game instead of the regular Half-Life go get that instead.1/10 would not play Assasins Creed Unity Simulator again.(BTW I dont hate Half-Life, its amazing but this Source port is broken as hell.)

												essentially Half life but ported to the source engine (an outdated one though)the only thing it adds is source's lighting, water and ragdolling to some enemies (very crap ragdolls might I add)the ability to select chapters is a nice thing, but of course we made do with console commands etc.however this isn't enough to count as a remaster.as a matter a fact there is significantly less gore in this one than the originalmost of the sounds are just recycled from HL2.and last but not least because it doesn't use source 2013, the game doesn't function properly anymore.at least we have BlackMesa, now thats a remaster we want.

												This game is excellent. It has a decent story and fun gameplay. It's very unbalanced, but its a fairly quick play once you figure out how to go about it. I would suggest you play this before you play HL2, otherwise this looks like a worthless piece of crap. This is a part of gaming history, and its worth playing even just to say you did.

												This game is very good, I barely ran into any bugs. The graphics are much more enhanced, now we actually have shiny objects. However there is not a lot of mod support nor do people try to mod this game. I'd stay away from this one and play it safe, just get the original Half-Life. Also Half Life Source does not have a multiplayer function built into the game. Instead Valve decided Hey let's split up the game into two so we can make double the money hehehehe. So not only with the original are you getting mods, you're also getting multiplayer. That's my review thank you have a good day, if you have any questions on this review just send me a steam message or something.			",49,0,0,3,2,0,0

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. Half-Life is a classic that should be played by anyone who appreciates FPS's. In fact, it's your obligation to play this game, because it was the first to do so many things in video games. There are many games that have heavily leaned on the format, gameplay and story telling strategies of this game. The game is very dated, and it shows, but Valve did implement the Source engine which gives it a more polished, free-flowing look. I was able to disregard the dated graphics, because I knew that this was such an original and classic game. The first half hour of the game is brilliant, because nothing is really happening, but there is an ere tone and feeling that lets you know that something's not right. Some subtle foreshadowing occurs when some of the computers break, and a scientist says the power is going to be switched on to 105%. It's show-not-tell things like this that make the game so gripping and immersive. It's something we don't seem to see in many games anymore. Anyway, during the first three quarters of the game, you're running around, collecting new weapons, killing aliens, and soldiers sent there to kill you, (a perfectly executed plot twist) solving puzzles, picking up more of the story, riding on rails, launching rockets, blowing up helicopters, storming military bases, navigating mine fields, annihilating green, bangy, tentacle thingies, electrocuting, and blowing up giant, blue flamethrower monsters; the list can go on and on. Basically, you're just having a lot of fun. The constant change of objectives really keeps the player immersed in the game. You never feel like you're repeating the same things over and over again. This is a staple in the Half-Life franchise. Once you start getting bored of something, it changes it up so that you're doing something different and more exciting. The pacing in this game is also phenomenal. It usually goes in the order of: Action event, slow puzzle event, action event slow puzzle event, with some events that feature action and puzzle at the same time, and story exposition sprinkled around and mixed in through everything you do. It's constant fun that never frustrates you or makes you feel cheated. The subtle rise in difficulty is more subtle than, you know, just changing the color of the monster. It's realistic, and makes you feel the tension rising around the Black Mesa facility. The first three quarters of the game are nearly flawless.In my opinion, the only downside to this game is the last quarter where you play in the alien world, Xen. This segment of the game really breaks up the immersion. The gravity is toned down, so everything you've gotten used to in the first part of the game is scrapped for a floaty, hard to manoeuvre, way of moving. It's also very slow. From a story telling perspective, it's mind blowing, but from a gameplay perspective, it's quite dull and frustrating. During the chapter Xen, you're just platforming, trying to figure out where to go. Gonarch's Lair was just an annoying, frustrating, slow paced boss fight, But the REAL kicker was interloper. I hated this level. It was way too long, way too difficult, way to confusing, and way too frustrating. If there was an enemy I could have removed from this game it would be those flying baby thingies, but they were everywhere here and they would respawn all the time! There's never enough health, energy, or ammo for you, so you have too eek by in this extremely hard level. In most levels, if it was hard, it was because you needed to change your strategy. It was your fault if you died. But in this level, there are just way too many overpowered enemies. You're trying to save your health and running out of ammo, and BOOM! You're hit with ten million, flying babies, and bee shooting giants, while being hit with vortigaunt lightning from every corner. The only way to get through this level is to set the difficulty to easy, and die a million times before you memorise where each enemy will be and when he will attack. That's no fun. That's just drudgery. Nihilanth was just a giant version of those annoying flying babies. Great. To be honest, he was just mediocre. Okay, I do hate how all the Zelda bosses, for example, have huge shiny targets on them that show you exactly where to place a bomb or shoot an arrow, but at least they help you figure out how to defeat it. In Nihilanth, I had no idea how to defeat the monster. shooting it did nothing, and it kept sending me away to these weird caves by throwing portals at me. I was completely lost. I had to go on youtube and see how it was done before I even knew how to kill it. It was still too hard too kill it though. If you play it the way it was intended and jump up onto those cliff things, it's really hard, and he will keep sending portals at you. If you're cheap like me and just hid behind the spiky rocks, then it's easier, but it's painfully repeditive and tedious.Boss fights in this game were not good with the exception of the green tentacle thing. I will cut it some slack though, because it was kind of a 90's thing to have bosses in your games, and this was a very hard game to put bosses into.In the last chapter, you're given a monologue from the mysterious G-man, who you may have noticed stalking you throughout the game. He makes you go through a portal, and then the credits hit, reminding you how good the soundtrack in this game was.All in all, Half-Life was a classic, and should be played by anyone who likes video games. If you like steam you should play this game to show your respects to Valve. It was the first game they made. Half-Life rose to my personal favorite video game franchise after the Metroid Franchise was ruined by Other M. Anyway, just play this game. You have no excuse not to. Oh, and Gabe, PUHLEEEZZZE MAKE HALF-LIFE THREEEEE!			",21,0,0,0,1,0,0

												I have played the game for about 2 hours now. This is probably the first time since the late 90's/early 00's since I have played the original Half-life. Its amazing how well the game still holds up to this day. Its easily much more fun then most shooters on the market, and I would argue that its also better then Half-Life 2. As for the changes in this verison, the game comes with the HD pack that originally shipped with the Blue-Shift expansion pack, and improved ragdoll (did the original even have ragdoll?), as well as realistic water and slightly better lightning. Explosions sprites have also been replaced with half-life 2 like explosions. Overall I would say this game is considerably better then the original Half-life. I would also like to mention that this game is worht playing even if you have Black mesa. The reason is that the game just feels so much different then black mesa does. The graphic style is completely different. You can't really compare the 2. Overall I am giving this a 9/10.			",198,12,4,15,36,7,62

												Great game aside from terrible design elements.  It creates ways that no matter how good of a player you are you cannot just get past if you are on lowish health.  It forces you to save often for these such cases.  Examples of this are the dog room and CONSTANT FALL DAMAGE.  It is just silly to have a health check like that; no counter play.

This thing is so broken it's making me sad.Apparently it has been this way since 2013 update - I played a pirated version of this that is older than 2013 and it worked perfectly.Buy the original and play the original/pirate this, don't bother with Steam's Source version.

Even though, it takes away the nostalgia from Half-Life.I haven't played the game yet  XD but I can clearly see this is a good recommendation for those who want to revisit the Valve's crown jewel. Yet again, it takes away the memories a bit.Personally, I see this as a better version of the original.But for some reason, I can't play the original game, since for some reason the textures are♥♥♥♥♥♥(9.5/10) MustBuy/Awesome			",44,5,0,4,1,1,2

												essentially Half life but ported to the source engine (an outdated one though)the only thing it adds is source's lighting, water and ragdolling to some enemies (very crap ragdolls might I add)the ability to select chapters is a nice thing, but of course we made do with console commands etc.however this isn't enough to count as a remaster.as a matter a fact there is significantly less gore in this one than the originalmost of the sounds are just recycled from HL2.and last but not least because it doesn't use source 2013, the game doesn't function properly anymore.at least we have BlackMesa, now thats a remaster we want.

												This game is excellent. It has a decent story and fun gameplay. It's very unbalanced, but its a fairly quick play once you figure out how to go about it. I would suggest you play this before you play HL2, otherwise this looks like a worthless piece of crap. This is a part of gaming history, and its worth playing even just to say you did.

												1998, I was 18, Id been weened on the Spectrum, then the Amiga.  I got my PC in 1996 and for two years played pretty ropey demos, and sometimes good stuff, like Theme Park.  Then I picked up half life.  Lifechanger.What can I say?  The intro scene setting, the journey in on the monorail, the voice welcoming you to your working day, the sound design... THE SOUND DESIGN.  I think thats what got me.  Im a music producer by trade and even 18 year old me was blown away by the score, and sound effects.  The levels on Xen, the sounds made, the voice of the Nihilanth, it was all too perfect.  This game holds up today, yep, graphically its a little jaded, but i still play, and I mean this source version, not the Black Mesa update.   ",50,6,0,12,8,1,15

												Half-Life: Source is half-baked and woefully in need of a hefty extra dash of Source. It's a shame. Pushed to pick my Desert Island PC game, I'd sadly set aside the likes of Deus Ex and Combat Mission in favour of the orginal Half-Life. It was an astonishing development in the art of video gaming and there's been nothing quite like it since in terms of story-telling flair, variety and visceral excitement.Applying ""Source technology"" to Half-Life should, therefore, have been a masterstroke.Sadly not. It looks barely any different.Here's what to do: forget Half-Life: Source, download the Black Mesa remake, and prepare to be astonished all over again...   ",364,194,14,78,82,6,143

												Played this game for about 2 hours and in that time I saw numerous bugs, and none of the elevators worked... They were all bugged into the wall. The reflections in this version are also very odd, none of the items even look real, and the explosions (as many other players have mentioned) look much worse in this ""source"" version. The graphics really arent better at all compared to the original one that's here on Steam and the bugs make it almost unplayable. Trust me, play the regular version of Half-Life and avoid this game breaking ""source"" version. - Rocky			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unlike the original Half-Life, which is in my opinion the best game of all time, Half-Life: Source is a buggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥with broken AI, broken hitboxes, sentences.txt written by an intellectually disabled dead squirrel, broken weapon recoil, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ standard HL2 user interface, ear♥♥♥♥♥♥inducing SteamPipe save-load freezing which often results in the game crashing, poor optimization, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (optional) HD weapon models that look like they were ripped straight from Gamebanana in 2002, broken multicore rendering which causes strange graphical glitches in certain areas of the game and it uses the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ default Source 2K4 movement system and footstep sounds along with poorly implemented Half-Life 2 water textures and HL2 barrel models that don't fit with the rest of the game. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever compared to the original game and it should be removed from the Steam store because it's just the same game with more bugs and better water.

												Has NOT aged well... I really can't stand it. Yes, this game is important to history, so you should at least try it at some point, but I don't think it's worth anything anymore. At this point, it's a relic that represents a landmark in gaming history more than it is a game. My main gripes are its absolute adherence to old-school shooter design with the modern (as we know it) narrative design layered over it. It was revolutionary at the time, but so many games have come along and done what it did so much better that it's impossible to look back on this and still say it's good on it's own terms. Maybe Black Mesa will change my opinion on it (especially if they put in PROPER full controller support), but until then? Find some way for a friend who already loved Half-Life to let you play it instead of buying it for yourself is what I have to say.			",148,19,2,26,4,1,13

												One of the best FPS games I've ever played.Level design is good. The strict hallways in the beginning, the more open areas in the middle and the alien world in the end are all nice to play. There are some more difficult sections in the game, but nothing you can't overcome with training and skill.I like the weapons. My favourite is the crossbow that makes a funny noise when you launch it to obliterate someone's brains. The Xen weapons are also nice, but like in Halo, I prefer human technology.Buy it. The updated Source version isn't even expensive.			",46,16,1,5,9,0,6

												How to start...Half life 2 is an AMAZING series and it really is a great series including Ep. 1 and 2 as well.Half Life on the other hand, in my opinion, is ridiculously convoluted and difficult for it's own good.I have spent hours, LITERALLY hours of my life trying to make this game function correctly. multiples upon multiples of times I have died the exact moment a loading screen comes up, the downside to this is that once those screens come up, it autosaves with no warning. This means, if you're like me anyway (Not saving every 5 seconds), you will lose ALL of your progress and have to restart. It is also extremely difficult to figure out the path you are meant to take to complete your task out of Black Mesa, this isn't exactly a downside as older games are all mostly like this and won't just hold your hand, which I am a fan of. Personally, I do not recommend playing this if you value your sanity and sleep, as you will be losing the entirety of both while you try to fight the game just to finish it.That being said, this game does add to the amazing story and universe of Half Life/Half Life 2 that we all love as well as the FPS mechanics are perfect and defined an era of games.I give Half Life a 4/10, it just doesn't hold up well at all and is rather dated			",50,12,0,6,5,2,2

												The crappy port of the original/former greatest PC game of all time. Get 1998's Half-Life instead. This is Half-Life with a ton of additional bugs (thanks to broken Steampipe updates and some original poor porting),new water textures, added ragdolls, barely improved skyboxes, motion blur, broken AI, screaming scientists,glowing floors and bloom, (which doesn't work). Not good! And whaddya know the port was done by Gearbox. Some of the alterations to the gunplay and weapon properties already affect it negatively but what's most shocking is how buggy it is and how many lenghty loading zones that weren't present in the original Half-Life have been added. Some load zones even intterupt the music just as it starts. The 2013 Source Pipe update didn't do it any favors either and in fact making it far worse and unstable to boot! There is a 50/50 chance the game will fail to start for players for some unknown reason. Stranger yet is one level is even uglier than it was in the 1998 original shockingly by making the map look far less expansive:

A Screenshot of Black Mesa
By: GuyOnAChair




(The last picture is from Black Mesa's faithful remake.)If you've ever seen a picture of a scientist floating above a chair then the picture was in fact taken from Half-Life: Source as that bug never happend in Half-Life 1998. Oh and here's an example of one of the many bugs ingame:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696258149Note the lack of sky and the fact that my HEV suit has dissapeared. Not to mention that when a game released on the Source engine is prone to crash more than a game released on 1998 on a modern PC you know something  has gone awry. There are also instances where new Half-Life 2 textures are right alongside badly ported Half-Life 1 textures leading to a George Lucas remastered effect. Not to mention some broken scripting, missing music and textures shining as bright as the sun in dark rooms. The orginal runs flawlessly and works in widescreen and in terms of gameplay still holds up quite well with the obvious (Doesn't bother me.) exception being the graphics which are more than a little dated. Oh but of course you could always just toggle to use the HD models instead. If you wan't a version of Half-Life with subtle improvements to atmosphere, immersion and better graphics and that actually take full advantage of the Source engine get Black Mesa instead. In fact both the Black Mesa mod (Black Mesa retail/Steam edition runs on Source 2013 and recently so did Half-Life:Source.) and Half-Life: Source run on Source 2007. Half-Life: Source was so crummy that we have it to thank for inspiring people remake Half-Life on the Source engine themselves. If Counter Strike: Source was just 1.6 visuals rendered on the Source engine with a plethora of new bugs and weird changes to the gameplay (Unlike Counter Strike: Source which is a whole new game.) you would have pretty disapointed wouldn't you? This doesn't do much of note visually and adds longer loading to really hammer the nail in the coffin. Oh and Source SDK doesn't work with it either. This is pretty useless and I don't reccomend getting it in the year 2016 where as I would still whole heartedly reccomend the 1998 original or even the unfinished Black Mesa.My review for BMS can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/362890My review for Half-Life: Source Deathmatch can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/360 ",246,13,3,8,1,0,2

												Good morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. The time is 8:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 93 degrees with an estimated high of 105. The Black Mesa Compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times.This train is inbound from Level 3 Dormitories to Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities. If your intended destination is a high-security area beyond Sector C, you will need to return to the central transit hub in Area 9 and board a high-security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the retinal clearance system, you must report to Black Mesa personnel for processing before you will be permitted into the high-security branch of the transit system.Due to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in the Black Mesa Compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the Black Mesa transit system. Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first.

												I highly recommend this product if you want to venture Half-Life 1's campaign in Garry's Mod, with the ability to spawn every one of your favorite Xen aliens/monsters. If you're a fan of the Half-Life franchise and wan't to relive the gameplay of the first game in a polished and new light, then you're better off installing Black Mesa: Source. Compared to the original version, Half-Life: Source offers absolutely nothing new to the table. The game basically lives up to its name, it's Half-Life 1 imported and playable on the Source Engine, nothing special.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, it's an AWFUL game. Half-Life WAS an OKAY game, for it's time. Now this isn't because of age I have multiple reasons.*THE STORY*I blew up something and now there's aliens?If the story was padded with interactions with characters it would be alright, but you have no sense of direction. I literally spent the game shooting things and aimlessly pressing buttons. I'm not a stickler but this was done horribly. I just walked, shot, pressed buttons, jumped, and turned wheels. The story is just awful in the first. The security guys are useless as well. They just say stuff that doesn't matter, giving you vague objectives. What kills the story is that everyone and everything feels lifeless. You can hate me but it's true. The game is LITERALLY 13 HOURS OF SHOOTING♥♥♥♥♥♥AND PRESSING BUTTONS WITHOUT ANY PERSONALITY. No one was funny, no one was cool, no one was my friend. It was a chore to play this game. Hell ,if Gordon was suppose to be an extension of the player why do we barely interact with people. THEY JUST SAY ""SURE I'LL RISK MY LIFE 4 U♥♥♥♥♥IT BIG BOI!!!""*THE GAMEPLAY*Oh god, even on easy everything was a bullet sponge while *YOU* THE GUY IN A POWER SUIT DIES IN LIKE 4 HITS!Killing♥♥♥♥♥♥didn't even feel satisfying, it got so boring that I turned on god mode the last 4 chapters. IT'S NOT FUN AT ALL. THIS PIECE OF *BLEEP* IS STILL BUGGY AS ♥♥♥♥ ON MY NVIDIA GTX 640 INTEL I7 QUAD CORE AND 16 GIGS OF RAM! There was screen tearing and crashing. What. The. ♥♥♥♥. It didn't do much except the EXCEPTIONAL PHYSICS ENGINE! The gameplay remained tedious with a few sequences of platforming and escorting people, that is too far apart and too far in between. How does it hold up today?It doesn't.I give Half-Life Source a 4/10. ",139,9,0,9,2,0,4

												Do not buy this game (unless your rich and have money to waste). Valve did not even try to recreate Half-Life, This is Half-Life 1998 ported over to Source creating more glitches. The only difference is that the radiation and water looks real compared to the original, appart from that its just a more ♥♥♥♥ed up version. For the best experience buy the 1998 version or the BLACK MESA version.			",83,5,2,2,9,0,2

												Overall a fun game, but it is very plain.  It only took me 18 hours to complete, but it had become boring after only 8.  I finished just for the sake of completeness. Though I guess I'm not a big shooter game fan to begin with, it just seemed like the same thing over and over again after a while.  Shoot this, shoot that.  The storyline sequences happening in ""real-time"" instead of having cutscenes was pretty novel, and it was a snippet of a neat story involved, but other than that this is just a dusty old historical piece.  I would only recommend it to hardcore FPS fans who want to relive a milestone of the genre.  But even then... why not just get Black Mesa?Oh, I should note that I had a bug early in the game, before any real action had taken place.  I couldn't walk through a door.  I had to work it out a using a cheat to ""no-clip"" through the door.  It ran just fine from then on.			",46,1,0,8,2,0,1

												This is one of the buggiest games I have ever played. I decided to stop playing purely out of frustration. There are some unbelievable long load times (which I can promise are not hardware related). Random hang ups, freezes, pauses, and sound glitches which are all extremely annoying. Problems with saves dissapearing and reappearing. The AI on most of the monsters in the game is borked. The headcrabs, barnacles, and tenctacle creatures are all broken and not functioning correctly. Hit boxes are broken. The list goes on.Just buy the original version of the game, Half-life source is trash.			",489,170,6,57,41,6,55

												against better judgement, i decided to purchase this game. the sound and physics in this are atrociously bad and the game is with no doubt, riddled with debilitating bugs, not the squishy kind. simple tasks that shouldn't be difficult become jarringly impossible because of the way your player moves in lightspeed mode, and the sounds... headsplitting. the graphics are goofy, but forgivable for its time, dont expect this ""source"" version to be much different from the original, if anything, it makes the game worse off. im a big fan of the half life universe and the only real thing i want out of this game is the story, and unless you're a fan of this original, source or not, i'd wait for a black mesa: source full release before i gave it a go, again. save your munnies.

												Short version: Go buy Black Mesa. If you want to know why this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, by all means, proceed. HL Source is the only bad Valve game ever released. It's honestly unbelievable how awful and fundamentally broken this one is, Valve managed to take their most iconic game- not to mention the one which launched their company to stardom, and absolutely deprive it of quality. For 10 bucks, what do you get from HL Source? An unplayable mess full of broken scripted sequences, broken NPCs, unbalanced weapons and damage systems, infuriating glitches, levels so broken you can't win, levels so broken you can't lose, just a total disaster. I hate to repeat myself so much, but this game is a broken mess. Even the Garry's Mod content is pretty lackluster, you'd be better off with a free mod like Half Life Renaissance. Oh, and for fans of the HD models that came with Blue Shift, don't even bother. For one they seem to be modified from the original release (why bother with such tiny changes?) and most importantly, the models are incomplete showing wireframes, and even the sounds on the guns like the M4 and SPAS-12 are missing altogether. The ""selling points"" of HL Source include a HL2 style chapter select, improved Source Engine lighting, HL2 style water, and ragdoll physics. That's it. For ten bucks. How could Valve have gone so wrong? Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat Source offered complete Source remakes of their predecessors, so why are we stuck with this awful port instead of a real remake, like the mod Black Mesa? And more importantly, why hasn't Valve even bothered to make this garbarge at least functional? It's full of little distracting mistakes any HL series veteran will notice immediately. Just a mess.I will say the Deathmatch multiplayer is fun. You can actually get this in a pack of other Source multiplayer titles without having to get HL Source. DMS has a lot of the same problems as Source, but luckily the abudance of great community made maps makes it worthwhile.  ",65,13,0,2,4,0,4

There is no real reason to get this unless you need it for Garry's Mod mounting (and even then...). This is a port of the original game that does not improve on it in any meaningful way, and actually introduces a few glitches and out-of-place elements. Basically: either play the original or Black Mesa.			",277,120,0,17,16,2,12

												While I can see why the game was so groundbraking back in 98 it just doesn't hold up well.There are some good moments in there but for every good one there is one frustrating and two boring ones. Visually game doesn't look good. It is not a matter of old graphics but lack of atmosphere and artstyle. Areas look quite similar to each other for the most part.Gameplay is just painful. Half-Life exists in this awkward spot between old-school shooters and new Modern Military Shooters. You move fast and have access to many weapons at once (they are quite a boring tough) but many of your enemies especially in the late game use attacts which can't be dodged. It gets really annoying really quickly. Also first person platforming. And movement. Gordon slides all the time. You will die repeatedly by falling off something.			",190,33,1,13,15,0,39

												This version of Half Life is inferior on a gameplay standpoint. While the Source Engine may improve some sections and add very little to the game, the whole expeirence is almost the exact same thing like the 1998 original, except with one horrible addition that practically breaks the game at most parts, slippy jumping physics. While it may not be noticable at first, the crane platforming section early on in the game becomes extremely infuriating and tedious because of the slippy jumping in this port.The original had tight jumping which made platforming work very well, but here it can make new comers hate the platforming of Half Life; which already has a mixed reputation from some audiences. Save the money from this version of the game and just buy the original 1998 version. You are not missing much here, if anything for that matter. If you want Half Life Source that a certain group of modders envisioned back when this was released, then check out Black Mesa. If you are in some dire need of Gmod models and whatnot, then wait for a Steam Sale to pick this up.			",261,38,1,6,7,2,5

												By the time I picked this game up back in 2004 it was already a old game, but HL is single handedly responsible for me getting back into gaming, and switching from console to PC.Back when I was a kid I always prayed that one day they would make a videogame that was like a virtual reality where you could move around a real enviornment and interact with objects. Prior to Half-Life I had only played Woffstein3D and doom for PC. Doom was great but it wasn't really interactive or very realistic. Half-Life was a dream come true and it will always be my favorite PC game of all time.For all those youngling's out there who grew up with Call of Duty and the like, you probably won't like this game. The graphics are old now, and the pace is slow. However if your still relatively new to gaming then please do yourself a favor and try it. Hell it even has a training room for those who don't have experience controlling a character in first person.The only difference between HL and HL source is that source has slightly improved lighting and textures in certain areas. Its worth getting over the stock version, but then again if you really want to experience the game as it came out back in 1998 then sure get the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finally got around to playing the original Half-Life, wanting to expand my knowledge on the universe that Valve had created.This is possibly the worst Valve game I have yet played. It has aged poorly. I guess if I had the fortune of playing it upon release I would appreciate it more, but I just can't understand how it managed to garner so much praise back in 1998. Perhaps there were some major changes that affected gameplay when they released the Source version in 2005?The AI is completely broken. You can edge around corners and slowly pick off immobile enemies by shooting their feet. If they can't see you their AI won't kick in. Pretty terrible mechanics. Apparently the AI was taken from Half-Life 2 when HL: Source was released. It doesn't show it.The controls are way too twitchy. It's almost impossible to succesfully climb down a ladder without dying the first time. You often go sliding off edges as if Gordon's feet are made of ice. It was certainly a frustrating experience.There is also absolutely no story or character development. None. You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist. You open a portal to another dimension. You close the portal. The end. Everyone you meet along the way is disposable and has no distinguishing features or names.There is no explanation for any of what is happening, there is no lead up to Half-Life 2. The reasons for the military presence are not explained, neither is the fact that they are replaced with Combine forces in the sequel, however many years later.The only connection between Half-Life and Half-Life 2 is Gordon Freeman and the G-Man. That's it. The only recurring enemies are the headcrabs and Vortigaunt, the latter of which are apparently on your side for some reason. Who knows how they ended up on Earth if the portal was closed.This was an amazingly empty experience, void of any story or sense of progression. I understand that was Valve's and, especially, Gabe Newell's intentions, but it just doesn't sit right with me.I know my opinion will go against the grain and, while I did enjoy the game overall and appreciate how it is placed within the Half-Life universe, I still can not overlook the many smaller flaws that become overbearing during gameplay. I have to wonder if these issues exist in the original Half-Life game or if they are exclusive to the Source version.			",823,300,26,81,65,10,105

												Is Half-Life truly the greatest game of all time? I can answer that question with one word.No.My friend had been pestering me for months to play this game. I had heard so many wonderful things about it, “It’s the greatest game of all time”, “It has an amazing story” are just two of the many great claims I’ve heard about this game. I’ve got to say, I’m extremely disappointed.After launching the game, I’m greeted by some pretty abysmal graphics. The original game was released sometime around 1996, so poor graphics are to be expected in the original version of the game. What’s not to be expected is for there to be poor graphics in the remake/remaster of the game (Half-Life Source). If the graphics are this bad, I might have well just played the original version.At first I put this aside; a game with bad graphics doesn’t always equal a bad game. I decided proceed through the “tutorial” area until I actually reach the real part of the game (in which you get your first weapon). I was quite frustrated to find out that I had to use a crowbar as a weapon, which in my opinion is quite a bad design decision. You are going to get a gun later in the game anyway, so why not just provide a gun earlier in the game? Another thing I can't work out is why did they put glasses on the main character? It doesn't seem very badass for the main character to wear glasses.I then struggle to play though the game due to the dry story and boring combat mechanics. I honestly don’t know why everyone thinks the story to this game is so amazing. A science laboratory gets filled with aliens and you need to escape that laboratory. The story doesn’t get any more complicated or in-depth than that.You also see a man in a suit from time to time. I don’t see the point in this since you never get the chance to fight him. He is clearly the bad guy in the game, but instead of fighting him at the end of the game, you just speak to him instead. What a disappointment.Take my advice. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.			",111,5,1,11,14,1,23

												This game may be the kickstarter to one of the greatest franchises Valve has ever made, but not only is the story boring compared to the Half Life 2 games, IT'S SO FRICKIN' HARD. I can't go ONE MINUTE without questioning the game's hatred for it's consumers. If there's a bad guy, screw tutoriels! They're just gonna make you figure it out even if it takes you 2 HOURS! There's no story, no background, and a question that's been boggling my mind, ""Why are the Vortiguants BAD in this game?!?"" In HL2, they were wise, powerful, and were the greatest companions to have at your side. And why is the style of the game so choppy?!? I know it's supposed to be a redo of the original game, but there's no point in making it so choppy! I've seen what Valve is cappable of! USE IT!!! There are also a load of areas where you have to solve something and a new enemy arrives to kill you while your trying to figure everything out! The ancient Chinese used this game as an execution device! The Mayans predicted that on 12/21/12, the sanity of people would come to an end due to this game! Even JonTron wouldn't want to play this! This game is crap! crap crap crap crap crAP cRAP CRAP!!!!! Don't make the same mistake I did. If you want to play this game, GET THE ORIGINAL VERSION!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, you shouldn't be playing this game unless you want the ""full Half-Life story experience"". It really hasn't aged well, first-person platforming is horrible, and the enemy AI has pretty terrible power scaling (any time an enemy is in your field of view it just aimbots you, meaning you can't actually have fights without taking massive damage). It's a good history lesson, but I don't think this game deserves high reviews. Play HL2 instead.			",142,33,1,3,9,2,15

												Which is better, Half-Life or the Source version? Well, that depends on what your willing to deal with between the two. Half-Life Source looks quite a bit better than the origanal with its water effects, motion blur, and fixed box-pushing machanic. However, unlike the origanal, Source DOES NOT have an auto save! So you could progress throu the entire game, die right at the end, and start over at that damn long tram ride. Another thing to mention is the enimies just love to get right in your face, so be perpared to use you shotgun alot. As long as your willing to deal with that, and have a habit of pressing the F6 key, then go ahead and get Half-Life Source. Otherwise, just stick with regular Half-Life.*Note: In case anyone hasn't played a Valve game before, F6 is the manuel save.*****			",52,6,0,1,7,0,7

												Half-Life is one of those games, a game you will spend hours on without even knowing. Its a game that has really left a impact on me as a gamer and is so good its still being talked about now. Half-life is a master piece in story telling and non-linear gameplay, and with its HD remake ""Black Mesa"" out now for free there's never been a better time to slip into your H.E.V suit for a Sci-fi, puzzle solving, alien and zombie killing EXTRAVAGANZA!!

												Half Life Source is amazing. I first picked it up last year and I loved it. I still love it. However I'm playing it again now and I'm experiencing a TON of bugs. Like in the part in Residue Processing with all the conveyar belts the map is really glitching out making a bunch of things I clearly don't remember seeing making it really hard to navigate. Another is the securrity guard from blast pit who yells ""EAT LEAD YOU OUTERSPACE OCTOPUS!"" doesn't get killed from whatever that thing is called making it not pay attention at all to you etc. I'm not saying this is a bad game at all in fact I highly reccomend it it's just it kind of needs to be fixed up a bit.

												The game who started it all.. Valve's proud. one of the best games i've ever played in my life, it's this: Half-Life.A game unlike any other you've ever played. Stronly reccomended to play. It has an awesome story, sound, levels and gameplay. Back then this was THE game to play among with other real-time classics like Deus Ex and System Shock 2.Now i play the Source version, but i still know how good the classic one is. It's not been my childhood, i've discovered this game since i got Steam back in 2009, but man, i'm glad i've found this out.So i got to play it and as i said; it's one of the best game i've played.Go play this, you really need to, because you miss one hell of a classic game if you don't play it.

												Highly recommend. An FPS classic full of action, puzzle solving and fast paced, difficult gameplay that still stands up today. Definitely get the Half Life or Valve Complete pack to get the most bang for your buck, or wait for Black Mesa (the community created revamp of Half life with improved graphics, etc).Only difference between HL Source and HL is some improved audio/textures and stuff I cannot name off the top of my head.

Half-life is by far one of my favourites and I have enjoyed every moment of it. I started playing in 2012 and plunged through the series to “half-life 2: episode 2” and am anticipating the next episode. I highly recommend this game, and that you also begin from the start!!!

												Half-Life is a science fiction first-person shooter. The game's graphics have dated somewhat since this software's release and a lack of a pad-based controls create a barriar many converts from console gaming cannot overcome. Players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility, whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong. No self respecting fan of the FPS genre can afford to miss this milestone achievement in videogame history. I give this game an 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a cool game that lets you experience the begining of the half life series redone in the source engine. This game takes more of a ""halo"" (before halo) approach with more sifi weapons and environments than its successor and for anyone who played the half life 2 games first you will finally understand the original half life references .

												There's not much to say about this great game that isn't already known. The story is probably one of the best from the history of videogames, and Half-Life is like a beacon to every FPS that came after. The Source game engine brings even more enjoyability to this great game, and i think everyone that loves this kind of game should try this at least once.I advice to leave it in your wish list and try buying it in a promotion, and if you could get it in a pack with the other games from the Half-Life series, even better.Congratulations to Valve for this great work, in one word: a Masterpiece.

												A classic worth playing. Great example of minimalistic storytelling (there is zero exposition in this). There are no pauses or breaks in this game and the intensity grows until the big finale. Very challenging--but fair--difficulty that has you conserving ammo and searching every nook and cranny for all the secret staches. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, but the ending certainly leaves you wanting more (fortunately there IS more).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In a nutshell, this is Half-Life ported to the Source Engine including all the benefits the engine provides.  I chose to play through this one instead of the original because of the more advanced engine.  Gordan Freeman must fight his way out of the Black Mesa facility after a terrible experiment release creatures from another dimension into our dimension.  The Government sends troops to silent the experiment and all survivors within the facility.  It feels like a classic FPS such as 007: GoldenEye, which is good then again it is from 1999 and Valve's first game.  There isn't much reason to play this other than to learn of the history before Half-Life 2.  For 1999 standards I give it a 9/10, for its 2004 release 8/10.  Right now, a 7/10.			",52,1,2,3,4,0,2

This time I intend to complete this game. This is probably what I like about this game, even after many attempts of trying to finish it I have not given up the hope to finally do it and I never got bored of it.This game looks very stable, despite one level where I experienced texture pop ups.

												Graphics and Bugs:This game is an original Half-Life but on the source engine. Which means better graphics and less bugs and glitches. On the original Half-Life the sound could not be heard sometimes, here its fixed. But really rare there is a ladder bug when you jump on ladder and it knocks you off (requires restart) and basically thats it.Difficulty and genre:Luckily the game was developed a long ago, when the story was not very important, when developers were adding much more action than in modern games. Yeah of cource it has story, and events but nothing complicated. The athmosphere and action are something to enjoy in this game. It is difficult even on easy difficulty to find where to go, or just complete the chapters (some take 1-2 hours). But I would call it ''challenging'' instead of ''omg sucks'' or ''too hard''The start and end of game:The start was clear, whole chapter spent on introduction which is kind of needed to be done. The end had some kind of mystery, and some questions could be asked. Has two endings, and you can only hope what Gordon is going to choose.Rating:I would give this game 9/10. First played in 2015, and it is a game for all the times! ",67,8,0,4,6,0,4

												Is there a gamer on the planet that doesn’t know Half-Life yet? Would we have Steam today if Valve had not made Half-Life? Good questions but I’m really supposed to write a review about this game. The atmosphere is dense, story compelling, action super fun and challenging, controls responsive, and game world buzzing with weird lifeforms. Half-Life sort of faces the same conundrum as Crysis as in the sections where you fight the human soldiers feel a lot more fun than blasting the aliens. In this game, though, the difference isn’t that huge. The aliens are menacing but you feel like a badass when you get them to submit under your shotgun fire. The only thing that really made me wanna drop the score is the fact that the difficulty level on the game is super cheap. And by cheap I mean you’re gonna die a lot. You can save whenever you want but that doesn’t help too much when you gotta perform a stunt obstacle course where a single wrong move makes the difference between a live Gordon Freeman and a dead Gordon Freeman. You need to be a bit of a masochist to play this game, but if that’s not a problem, you’re gonna love every second of it.			",450,113,17,63,51,4,101

												Truly a bar raiser for the time, this FPS has timeless gameplay that has aged very well in most aspects.  The Source version is even better than the original with improved physics and full water simulation.  The textures are exactly the same however.To get the most out of this game, in my opinion, you have to download the Black Mesa mod for it.  It vastly improves the textures, adds fancy graphics options, has reworked animations as well as a lot of redone voice acting.  It allows the game to have wonderful, modern graphics paired with the excellent gameplay of the original.  Best part is, it's free!			",198,35,2,13,22,1,25

												One of the best classic games out there. Story, vision, in-game rules etc are great, but I don't like gameplay sensitivity. Some controls are super sensitive & some are much less sensitive.This is remastered edition of original Half-Life which runs on modern Source engine, but still graphics needs serious improvement. I'd suggest Valve to re-develop this great game from scratch with modern graphics & special effects.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are unfamiliar with Half-Life, it is an fps in which you play as a physicist who has to survive an alien incursion in an underground research facility. This is a port of the original Half-Life to the Source engine.The gameplay is varied, containing combat, puzzle solving, and platforming. The story is interesting; however, the player must pay attention in order to get some of the more obscure plot points. There is plenty of enemy variety and a large number of weapons to use against them.There are a few negatives: the platforming can require many attempts to get past certain sections and there is a large difficulty spike near the end.The differences between Half-Life and Half-Life Source are improved water graphics and physics, the addition of ragdoll physics, better lighting, and 3D skyboxes.Overall Iwould give this game a strong recomendation of 9/10			",48,3,0,6,4,0,2

												In all honesty I would recommend this with or without Source, but it is a game for those who want to go back to where it all began and still be able to see decent graphics. Anyhow, it's normally a game that one would play for the storyline, which is very well-constructed and built-upon reinforcedly by its sequels. Of course, then there's the gameplay, which is done splendidly, you have control over thirteen different weapons by the beginning of the Lambda Core chapter, which, though rather far into the game, is a landmark in the series. These weapons include two laser guns and an alien organ with infinite ammo, so there is plenty of science fiction to go around in the story, along with detail to explain it. The graphics are done beautifully for a game of its time, with or without the source engine added, and make for a spectacular exploration through the Black Mesa facility, and eventually another dimension known as XEN.

												Ok, do we even need to talk about Half Life's story. We all know it's excellent.That aside, the Source version, though buggy, gives you graphical options which just weren't there before, as Half Life (non-source) does look like it was rendered on a potato, be honest.With Black Mesa here, Source doesn't have so much of an appeal to most anymore, but to those on a tight budget, I would recommend this over Mesa, until there's a sale. Then, get Mesa. I know I will.			",185,57,2,13,9,0,21

												If you want to play HL in the source engine, than this is THE version for you! They don't realy change to much of the game. But some graphical things are pretty much improved. Some puzzles also include a brand new twist because of Source's physics engine. The body's are now fully dynamic and so is the flashlight. You're now able to add motion blur and other new graphical stuff that makes the game look a lot better. They also keep the tone and mood from the first game by including all of the original textures. But some of the sounds (Like the foodsteps) are directly from HL2 witch makes the game sound alot better. And if you're a fan of the HD content the original Half-Life had, they included all of those moddels into this version. Witch makes it look even better. So if you're a HL fan, this game will stand nicely in your game library.p.s: Sorry for my english. Its not my main language. ",155,10,4,13,12,1,4

But there are some improvements and you can feel it in game. All in all, it's still a good old Half Life.If you didn't play HL or you played only its successors, you might want to try this (first?). But if you are a true HL fan you should get a HL pack and enjoy them both. So much awesomeness at a good price (especially when on sale).			",344,146,15,64,27,3,72

Levels are intuitively designed, voice acting is good, combat (if you're playing on hard) is intense and requires some quick movement and reflexes.

												I don't understand why some people don't like this game.""Oh it didn't age well"" -I played and finished it in late 2015 at the age of 14, amazing game. It still stands out as a revolutionary game for its time. I do happen to play a few older games(not too many). This is mostly because: ·It's cool how games have changed ·The ones you hear might hear about more, like Half-Life, are very interesting milestones and ·With my current laptop these older games are much less taxing and can be played at the best settings.""Well HL:S is just the same game but on the Source engine with some graphical differences. It ruins the experience"" -Yes, that's exactly what it is. But it doesn't ruin the experience. I'll compare this to a newer game hopefull you may have played. If not, go do that after you play this. It's like The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Amazing N64 game. Woah! Look it's Link in 3D! And a couple years ago WHAM! It's LoZ OoT 3D. Link in real 3D woooaaahhhh! It's the same game, in fact that has more differences than HL:S to HL, and they're still mostly visual and otherwise unnoticable. Yes, if you haven't played this game, play it. If you haven't played Half Life 2 then I highly recommend playing this first. Otherwise you start up the game and WHAM Who's this guy? Who's he talking about? Who's THIS guy? What beer??

												Although Half-Life is a great game, I recommend getting Black Mesa Source instead. Half-Life Source is a direct port of the original, but other than a few minor graphics enhancements, such as better water and lighting, there simply isn't enough changes to the game to make it any different to the original version. 5/10			",45,2,0,7,2,0,4

The black sheep of the Half-Life seriesFirst of all, Half-Life is a great game. Everyone knows that. I don't need to bother describing Half-Life's gameplay in any detail. Long story short, I loved the game then and I still do. Its influence on the industry is virtually unparalleled and indirectly led to the creation of Steam in the first place!However, Half-Life: Source is a disappointment with a misleading title. I say ""misleading"" because having already played Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, I expected this game to be a full HD remake of the original, with proper models and textures. Instead, all we got was the original 1998 models and textures running on the Source engine. We didn't even get the polygonal upgrades that Half-Life Blue Shift received. Sure, the physics and lighting are modern, but it's hard to notice when everything else is blocky and jagged. It makes this game seem pointless especially when the original 1998 game is still available and has a much larger community. It's such a shame - I'm sure this game would've made a killing selling at full price if it were a proper HD remake. At least I didn't directly pay for this game - I got it as part of a much larger bundle.Fortunately, not all is lost. The Black Mesa: Source mod (which I've played) has done what Valve failed to do - remake the campaign with proper HD graphics. Either play that game, or stick to the original 1998 game. Don't waste money buying Half-Life: Source standalone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, way ahead of it's time and it still holds up today perhaps not graphically but definitely is strong gameplay wise and that is what's most important in a video game. It's a rollercoaster of gameplay where it constantly switches between run & gun shoot 'em up, survival horror, and puzzle platformer. It starts of strong with and immersive experience and the best intro for a video game in my personal opinion. But I have to note that the last missions in Xen are the weakest missions in the game and a painfuly difficult boss fight with an ending not worth the struggle at the end, the ending leaves you asking more question than you did at the begining of the game but the Half-Life series is known for that. But overall it's a great game and a must own, it's just the Xen missions and ending that are slightly dissapointing. I would give it an 8.5/10			",38,1,0,4,3,0,1

												Alright. Let's Start.I'll start with this. The Game is awesome of course. If you are new to this game. It's super long.For etc. I completed the half-life in 24 hours. Yeah. I explored everything . well 90% atleast.Second time i'm completing the game. Made It in 5.7 hours. Still exploring most of the spots and all that♥♥♥♥♥♥So Keep that in mind.The Main reason you may be reading all these reviews is because you have no idea what's the difference between Half-life and Half-life Source. None. I'm talking about the script and story. No difference. On the other hand, The graphics are improved, some monters are improved and changed the look of them. If you don't want to spend money, don't buy it. If you are a HL fan buy it. Get the speedrun record. do it. The Record is 20:49 minutes btw. So good luck			",117,10,1,5,6,0,3

												This game is simply amazing. Even though the graphics are outdated for the present, this game does not dissapoint. You're trying to escape a lab after an expirement goes wrong. Creepy aliens and monsters start walking around the lab. This game gave me the jump scares xD . If you like first person shooters, and a bit of puzzles, and shooting aliens that jump at you, GO GET THIS GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, do we even need to talk about Half Life's story. We all know it's excellent.That aside, the Source version, though buggy, gives you graphical options which just weren't there before, as Half Life (non-source) does look like it was rendered on a potato, be honest.With Black Mesa here, Source doesn't have so much of an appeal to most anymore, but to those on a tight budget, I would recommend this over Mesa, until there's a sale. Then, get Mesa. I know I will.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												im shocked frankly!How did they ♥♥♥♥ up a game i played so much as a teen!back in the day when i was just a weeee little 13 year old, i used to pirate half life, after a while my grandparents bought me half life source and death match source, and i liked it, i got this game right around the time freeman's mind was coming out, the game was good i liked it, it was stable looked nice, and ran decently on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hp pavilion slimline running vista, then my account got hacked and i lost the game, now year's later im 21 and decided to buy this game again to relive some old memories, i shouldn't have, this game has some how along the line gotten worse, what was once a decently put together game ported to the source engine is broken, so here are some good and bad additions, THEY FINALLY ADDED THE HD PACK! bad news, they added the HD pack. took them long enough but its worse than anything, textures look strange and inconsistent, the hev suite has wear on it, and so do all the armor on the barneys. Sounds are missing from various weapons when you turn it on, They never fixed the crow bar making one sound on every surface, (who knew it sounded like hitting a pipe on metal when you smack soft sand) There’s this strange inconsistent shiny texture i cant turn off, looking at freeman’s mind i dont see that, and i dont remember it, its annoying and only on specific parts of the gun, Ive made it as far as residue processing and ive just stoped. the strange shinny texture glitches here and splinter’s off, almost like how raggdols would noodle in fall out or world at war, they just shoot off and splinter across the map, and this covers the entire screen, The AI in areas is broken, head crabs wont lunge at you when you stand right in front of them, good thing for those who play on hard mode like me! Sounds all over break, sometimes they just dont play as if there’s not enough sound channels. Thats all i can name after spending a good portion of my day playing this game, There’s no reason to play this game, and almost no reason to buy it outside of garry’s mod assets, But hey, at least its on the source engine, and that makes it all better riiiiiiiiiight *just go buy black mesa already*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The black sheep of the Half-Life seriesFirst of all, Half-Life is a great game. Everyone knows that. I don't need to bother describing Half-Life's gameplay in any detail. Long story short, I loved the game then and I still do. Its influence on the industry is virtually unparalleled and indirectly led to the creation of Steam in the first place!However, Half-Life: Source is a disappointment with a misleading title. I say ""misleading"" because having already played Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, I expected this game to be a full HD remake of the original, with proper models and textures. Instead, all we got was the original 1998 models and textures running on the Source engine. We didn't even get the polygonal upgrades that Half-Life Blue Shift received. Sure, the physics and lighting are modern, but it's hard to notice when everything else is blocky and jagged. It makes this game seem pointless especially when the original 1998 game is still available and has a much larger community. It's such a shame - I'm sure this game would've made a killing selling at full price if it were a proper HD remake. At least I didn't directly pay for this game - I got it as part of a much larger bundle.Fortunately, not all is lost. The Black Mesa: Source mod (which I've played) has done what Valve failed to do - remake the campaign with proper HD graphics. Either play that game, or stick to the original 1998 game. Don't waste money buying Half-Life: Source standalone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very good and very popular shooter. It is very challanging, and it has puzzles and battles, and aliens. I would recommend this version though, the source one. I think the other might be easier because it's less realistic. This game isn't for casual play. It is possible to use cheats and fly through the whole game (literally fly through everything)but I would recommend actually playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, this game is very much the same as the original Half-Life game. All the qualities mentioned in my Half-Life Review more the most part still covers this game. Geometric lighting, very shiny metal surfaces and good-enough human AI graphics are all still there. Let me put it this way, if you already have Half-Life then don't get this game. You already have the game. I would be the same as having the original Star Wars episode 4 then buying the remastered version. Which brings me to the distaste of changing the special surprise ending to the original. I really didn't care for what it was changed out for. Otherwise, I would still recommend it, and recommend reading my review on Half-Life if given to serious consideration, yet still new to the game.  I question what all was fixed. I think I noticed one instinct where you could avoid an obstacle altogether, yet I still ran into a glitch that made it look like Freeman just got hit up on LSD (when looking up the surround blurred into an assortment of visuals overlapping for for a disorienting 70's tie design).

												Half-Life: Source is practically no different than the original 1998 Half-Life. Ultimately, the difference comes down to more polygons, somewhat smoother animations, slightly better physics (enemies just ragdoll on death here, no predetermined animation) and shiny things. Water is also better, but the nature of this game is that it's still apparent that the game is old. However it holds up to the old standard, and the price tag is much better since you also get the Deathmatch Source game with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After an hour into this game I felt totally reminded of Portal. You run through a facility and fight for your life. Both games got Valve printed on it. Even though I enjoyed Portal more.But I can see why Half Life is such a good game, especially for the time it was released. Fighting is merciless in this game, likewise the ladders. For a noob like me, managing hp/armor/ammunition and descending ladders is enough to chew on. Be prepared for a tough and sometimes tedious playthrough. Even on easy. It's not a modern shooter, it's Half Life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's Half-Life with some of Half-Life 2's graphic features. The most notable (but not the only ones) are the transparent water, ragdolled models (and now your shots cause wounds on their skin, cool), and the lighting.I think other things were modified too, beside graphics. I noted changes in AI, enemy attributes, weapons and maps.There are some weird bugs, but they don't compromise the experience.

												There are legions of fans all over the Internet praising this game left and right for its innovative approach to telling a story in an FPS setting. I'll concede that point, but I'll also say that an FPS is mostly about gameplay and immersion, not about story. The gameplay in this game is pretty atrocious, because a lot of it involves jumping puzzles.Jumping puzzles, with rare exception, DO NOT WORK in an FPS. They don't. They. DON'T. If you make a jump in real life, you have a bunch of senses other than sight helping you land where you want to land. In an FPS, you've got limited sight and none of the other senses. Now I was going to give this game a pass, since it came out early on and maybe the developers simply didn't get this as they were breaking new ground in the FPS genre. But then I read that the sequel also has jumping puzzles, so they clearly didn't learn their lesson.A second flaw is the ""realism"" of the game. You fight a branch of the military at several points and they'll set up ambushes or minefields in which you don't see either of them coming. You need to navigate a minefield completely blind, which is realistic, but let's consider the fact that a theoretical physicist with little to no combat training fighting hordes of aliens and the military, in reality, is going to get his bullet-ridden♥♥♥♥♥handed to him in approximately 12 seconds. You pretty much need to abuse save/load to get through this game, which isn't fun at all.And what the flaming hell was up with losing all your equipment halfway through the game? That served exactly no purpose at all except to♥♥♥♥♥♥the player off. Really? The soldiers set up an ambush, like all the other ambushes Freeman had no trouble getting through, but this time they turned off the lights! Gasp! So much for realism and storytelling.Yeah, I'm not playing the sequel or the sequel to the sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have not yet played any version of the first Half-Life, I strongly reccommend you play the very first and original version of it, not the Source version.If you think it's a complete remake and overhaul of the original ala Counter-Strike: Source, then you would be wrong. It's just the original game ported to the Source Engine. The result is alright for a few things, but in all honesty I've found it to be less enjoyable than the original.On the plus side, the best thing I can say about is that the water looks better. Yeah, it's not much, but you can actually see through it here unlike the original, which can be helpful for getting an idea of underwater areas before diving into them and can allow you to more easily target underwater enemies without actually having to be in the water and risk attacks from them.There's also the addition of ragdolls, which generally look much nicer than the set death animations and poses NPCs took on in the original whenever they were killed.However, some enemies don't have the same behavior as in the original, some enemies are less aggressive and will not seem to notice you as often,  It might make the combat a bit easier, but that's what takes away from the gameplay, it's not quite as challenging as the original is.Other NPCs don't seem to have translated very well over to the port. One of the best examples being the friendly NPCs, Scientists and Security Guards will constantly make pain noises and grunts after being injured just once, something that's rather annoying to listen to if you want any to accompany you for backup.Overall, the game just doesn't have the same old feel of the original that I found myself enjoying and is also less challenging than it. I definitely don't recommend playing it before the original Half-Life, at the very least. It's not necessarily a ""bad"" remake, just one that doesn't offer enough to be favorable to the original, I feel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah Half life, possible one of my favorite game and game series of all time. I decided to pick up the old half life and try playing through it again on hard mode and it was quite a challenge for me, but a fun one nonetheless. If you have not played this game yet and are considering buying it, ask yourself this: Do i like shooters? Do i lke survival horror shooters? Do i enjoy a game with fast paced action, linear movement of story, easter eggs, fun, and a game that is just so good that i cant possibly resist playing it? If you answered yes to any of those questions then this game is right for you. A word of advice though, this is the source version so while osme textures are improved there are an abundance of bugs, glitches, and new errors. if your willing to look past all that (which is easy to do) then buy this version. If not then just buy the original half life. Either way I highly recommend this game as it is easily a lifetime classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Old, but gold, is the phrase I would use. It might seem lame in this day and age, but if you've never played it before I'd recommend playing it just because it's one of the classics.Also because you should get a sense of the plot that leads up to Half-Life 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good and original game, I can see how this game could've been so influential back in 1998 because of all the tiny details that you didn't get in a FPS game then, things such as interacting with your environment by means of pushing boxes and knocking out vent openings and leading guards and scientists to open doors for you, to name a couple of them. The game keeps you entertained throughout its duration and doesn't get boring once, you're either gunning your way through an area full of enemies or solving a puzzle to get through a different area and testing your resourcefulness and intelligence; the horror aspect is eerie and creepy without resorting to many jumpscares that today's ""horror"" games do so much of.The game hasn't gotten old either, you can still play this game today nearly 20 years since its release and it will still deliver as enjoyable if you don't mind the old fashioned graphics and audio, of course!

(1= Bad, stay away; 2= not recommended; 3= average; 4=I liked this, you should try it; 5=One of my all time favorites). The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 is probably the fact it isn't Half Life 2. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to play HL in the source engine, than this is THE version for you! They don't realy change to much of the game. But some graphical things are pretty much improved. Some puzzles also include a brand new twist because of Source's physics engine. The body's are now fully dynamic and so is the flashlight. You're now able to add motion blur and other new graphical stuff that makes the game look a lot better. They also keep the tone and mood from the first game by including all of the original textures. But some of the sounds (Like the foodsteps) are directly from HL2 witch makes the game sound alot better. And if you're a fan of the HD content the original Half-Life had, they included all of those moddels into this version. Witch makes it look even better. So if you're a HL fan, this game will stand nicely in your game library.p.s: Sorry for my english. Its not my main language. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall enjoyable game if youre looking to see Half Life with better lighting and added physics. I recently played it and after having uninstalled it, i cant seem to be able to install it again. STEAM TRIES TO INSTALL HALF LIFE 2 INSTEAD. Even though i dont even have Half Life 2 jet. I think its fair to say that days before i tried to install Black Mesa Source and had installed Sourcre SDK Base 2007 or whatever it needed so it may have somthing to do with my current problem.   I just thought it would be fair to put it out there. Seems though that nobody else is having this problem, so... ...? As much as i played it i enjoyed it But felt it should have been a bit more than it is now. All things considered, I would still say buy it if youre tired of how the original Half Life looks and are looking to experience the game with a bit of polished paint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Often when we look back at games we wince at the idea that we once thought it was good. When we look back at Half-life, we find new things each time.I've played it hundreds of times when I was younger: battling through the first few missions and eventually confronting the craft millitary grunts who are sent to kill me, then giving up. But, as a more seasoned gamer (and have a better grasp of the ""quick-save"" concept!) I've managed to fight through to the very end a few times and save BlackMesa, and the earth, at least for a short while.From the moment you first fade into the tram ride at the start, to when you first grasp the crowbar, to when you have you back pressed against a wall listening for footsteps of black-ops assassins, to when you're in an Alien world killing an invading overlord, Half-life remains atmospheric, sharp and is excellently considered, balanced, challenging and most of all fun.It's become gospel to gamers, and it's one of my favourites.

												I'm gonna be honest. I am 19 and I never played this game until now and I am so glad I did. This game is fantastic in every way. It is so amazing such an old game can still impress me so much that some of the new games today feels bland and rather boring in comparison. The game is so challenging and sometime even frustrating and yet I still keep coming back. I tried and fail, and tried again until i finally finish the whole game and there is only one word to describe my feeling, GLORIOUS. Will definitely play Half Life 2 and hope that it will bring me even more surprise and torture as well. For those who never played this game, PLAY IT NOW.

I still remember how 'stupid' the name felt to me at the time, little did I know the weight this franchise would carry in the next 14 years.I first touched this game at a friends house, it was amazingly brilliant, it looked like a movie, it WAS a movie, something that had never been done, a game with a movie-category introduction, it was something groundbreaking in game history.This is a must-play-before-you-die for any hardcore gamer.

												I recently played through HL:Source and I forgot how great a game it is. It certainly withstands the test of time and multiple replays. If you've never played it you're in for a treat. Levels are intuitively designed, voice acting is good, combat (if you're playing on hard) is intense and requires some quick movement and reflexes. Tiny little additions like the missle guiding system relieve the tedium of shootin'. Must play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life: a fantastic game, and a keystone in the development of the modern first-person shooter. If you're into nostalgic titles - even if you have no experience in the Half-Life franchise - then this game is for you. I'm amazed at how well the gameplay holds up today. Obviously, its age shows, but that doesn't hinder its sense of fun. Because that's what this game is - fun. Extremely, unbearably, unrelentingly fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it’s gritty enough to avoid that stupid tongue-in-cheek pretentiousness that a lot of late 90's shooters have. I've never played a game that matches the level of ridiculousness this has without upsetting the suspension of disbelief. When you step into the pixelated (and non-existent) shoes of one Gordon Freeman, you honestly won't bat an eyelid at the fact that you're suddenly smashing in a one-eyed alien dog’s face with a crowbar. It won't click that the scientists all look like a♥♥♥♥♥♥drawing of Albert Einstein, or a polygonal potato motion captured by a person without joints in their limbs. You won't notice that the voice acting sounds like it was filled in by whoever was hanging around the office that evening. When you just play it, all of the game's wrinkles quickly iron out. And do you know why?  Because you'll enjoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.  The awesome level design, the kickass weapons, the seamless integration of puzzles and gunplay – they all come together to create this milestone in gaming history. The game that gave us Valve, the game that forged the modern FPS, the game that brought modding communities to the frontline - this game is all of those, and so much more.All of that being said, the game's transfer to the source engine feels a little... pointless. Having played through both versions, the only substantial differences I've seen are the improved water textures - which are rendered with the source engine’s better shaders, (looking incongruous given the more aged textures of the remainder of the game) some slightly improved lighting effects and the source's superior physics engine -  which this version does a fantastic job of ignoring. While Half-Life is a classic title, this new version adds essentially nothing in terms of gameplay, and yet it is several gigabytes larger in installation size. Frankly, if I could choose between the two again, I would choose the original version. There’s a strange appeal in playing such a definitive title in the original, intended, unaltered form. Of course, the original game has its own set of flaws – the increasingly infuriating Xen segment being one of them – however, when we’re dealing with a title as significant as this, those flaws all become water under the bridge. This is a marginally improved version of a fantastic game with an indomitable sense of fun - I'd recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good romp at the fast-paced FPS's of olden times.

												This game played a key role in the transition to full 3D in first person gaming. After the richness and depth seen at the climax of the '2.5D' era, the move to full 3D seemed to throw all that advancement out the window. Whereas the 2.5D era had reached a point where such depth was near inherent, successors like Quake and Quake 2 showed a simplicity that while enjoyable, left an undeniable lacking. And gone were so many of the innovations defined by the previous era. On consoles, a game named Golden Eye brought many of those past innovations kicking and screaming, into the 3D space; On PC, at the forefront of the charge, rode the mighty Half Life. Granted, despite the game's release, the war remained unwon, but the battle was a major victory, and Half Life will never be forgotten.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half Life is (of course) a fantastic game. This is a good version of it.Pros:-Improved water, bullet, lighting, and physics effects-Ragdolls are cool-Fixed some annoying issues from the original-Levels can be accessed individually, and you're given a sizeable arsenal to startNeutral:-Same graphics in generalCons:-Occasionally a scripted event won't execute properly, such as a door not opening on ""Surface Tension"" or being teleported to a glitchy place on ""Lamba Core"". Luckily these were at the very end of their respective levels, so I just skipped ahead to the next one. These are a pain in the butt. However, I've also heard this was an issue with the original.-Some sound effects don't work when you choose the option to ""Load HD models"". This is annoying because the HD models look way better.Overall, if you've played the original recently, there isn't much new or different here. I would recomend it for new players looking to play a classic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As big a visual improvement Half-Life Source is over the original, it's sadly riddled with bugs. On first play, I wasn't able to progress past the first chapter as the game script appeared to be broken when a security guard or scientist was supposed to open a door for me but wouldn't. There are also numerous sound and rendering issues, such as weapons being invisible and the sound of your gund being played in the distance. There's a particularly nasty bug on one of the levels where a storm drain is blocked by a grate that isn't meant to be there. The only way past was to use the noclip cheat.With the original Half-Life on Steam for the same price, the graphics won't be as good but you won't get these game-destroying bugs. Avoid.

												After an hour into this game I felt totally reminded of Portal. You run through a facility and fight for your life. Both games got Valve printed on it. Even though I enjoyed Portal more.But I can see why Half Life is such a good game, especially for the time it was released. Fighting is merciless in this game, likewise the ladders. For a noob like me, managing hp/armor/ammunition and descending ladders is enough to chew on. Be prepared for a tough and sometimes tedious playthrough. Even on easy.

												Often when we look back at games we wince at the idea that we once thought it was good. When we look back at Half-life, we find new things each time.I've played it hundreds of times when I was younger: battling through the first few missions and eventually confronting the craft millitary grunts who are sent to kill me, then giving up. But, as a more seasoned gamer (and have a better grasp of the ""quick-save"" concept!) I've managed to fight through to the very end a few times and save BlackMesa, and the earth, at least for a short while.From the moment you first fade into the tram ride at the start, to when you first grasp the crowbar, to when you have you back pressed against a wall listening for footsteps of black-ops assassins, to when you're in an Alien world killing an invading overlord, Half-life remains atmospheric, sharp and is excellently considered, balanced, challenging and most of all fun.It's become gospel to gamers, and it's one of my favourites.

I recently played it and after having uninstalled it, i cant seem to be able to install it again. STEAM TRIES TO INSTALL HALF LIFE 2 INSTEAD. Even though i dont even have Half Life 2 jet. I think its fair to say that days before i tried to install Black Mesa Source and had installed Sourcre SDK Base 2007 or whatever it needed so it may have somthing to do with my current problem.   I just thought it would be fair to put it out there. Seems though that nobody else is having this problem, so... ...? As much as i played it i enjoyed it But felt it should have been a bit more than it is now. All things considered, I would still say buy it if youre tired of how the original Half Life looks and are looking to experience the game with a bit of polished paint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quality game, even by today's standards...the HD pack adds lot and the difference to textures, people and weapons is quite stark. The HD addition does seem to be unfinished though as the sounds to some weapons seem to be missing, such as reloading. Still though, it is worth it overall for everything else that it brings to the table.Well worth a play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An all time classic game which shows its age these days. For me its a great game let down by the control system on speed. Walking is too slow and running is like skating on ice. In fact I have yet to complete the game because of it, it annoys me so much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is almost exactly the same as the original Half-Life, the only difference is that it runs on a different engine (some levels are slightly different).The original Half-Life is a much better choice to buy, because it has a wide choice of mods to play once you have completed the main game. I don't believe I have ever found any mods for this game.Only buy this game if you want the same game as the original, but on a different engine.A better choice is to buy the Source mod, Black mesa. Black mesa is basically a remake of Half-Life, it is basically what the modders believed Half-Life Source should have been.For a review on the actual game, please see my Half-Life review.

												An old classic re-done with the source engine, unless you loved the original and were a fanatic lover of this game like i am, it's probably a difficult purchase.The source engine adds some nice new features, including less gore from head crabs in particular, and ragdoll effects.With finishing it over at least 200 times from when I was younger to now I still play it for nostalgia and this remains as the best FPS Campaign I've played.

												This is a good port of the original Half-Life to the Source engine. The texture rendering could be a little bit better though. If you want to get into Half-Life, I highly recommend the unported one as the original graphics will give you the full experience of what it was like when it came out and how far it's come. However, if you've already played the original one, the Source version is a nice take on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No matter how old the game may feel, the concepts and ideas brought to Half Life will always seem new to me. One moment your scattering for ammo while hitting headcrabs with your crowbar and the next literally running for your life against a Garganturae or fighting waves of marines as you uncover more about the aliens and where the come from. Is has that real variety that few shooters today have. However if I where to nit pick at something it would have to be a few of the Xen missions felt a bit off par with the other chapters and just seemed more like the scene from a movie you just want to skip and the platforming puzzles. This game could be considered as one of the most innovative FPS of all time for good reason. To be honest I don't think I can think of any other FPS games really like this. This is a classic... nuff said.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is so classic that its almost a sin not to even play it. this one game inspired so many people in the industry today. that if it never exsited. we would not have as many modern clasics that we have today. especally call of duty. so you can think this classic game for it. but yes it is pretty old. 16 or 17 years actually but still so much fun to play. almost everybody knows the sotry for this game. so im not even going to bother telling it to you. if you havent then you should not be here and nor dont even know what a great game is. the graphics are pretty fair. seeing how old this game is. compare to other old games. its not that bad. the sound is beyond great. the soundtrack is really memorble. from errie background music to tecno of the 90s. i even have some favorties from the game. and i really dont like video game soundtracks. so me saying thaty is alot. i can say alot more about this classic game. but it would take forever to type. point is if you have the money you should buy it. you will not regert it. trust me. its one of the greatest if not the best PC games of all time.

												Yeah, wow. When I finally got this years after release due to new PC that could handle games, I played only using quicksave until I jumped to the wrong place and could not get back! It was hard, because it was the wrong way!Anyway, I have faint memories from several areas of the game, but never a continious run. Right now I'm playing through it in the DK2 to get the complete package. The Source version does polish up the original quite a bit, there are many HD models, water effects, shadows, modelled environments instead of cube-maps etc. I paid for this separately, and I'm happy I did.As for playing in VR, of course it's awesome, but. Before doing this I've played 30h+ of HL2 in the DK1, 15h+ of the episodes in DK2, as well as a ton of other VR experiences. This game, HL1, is not for the person without VR legs if you want to play it with supreme immersion. You run super fast, close to the ground, haha. At first it was a bit crazy, but now nine hours later I'm very used to it, and I plan on finishing the entire thing in the DK2.A classic I never experienced at the time, but I still remember seeing it when visiting a friend. I only had time to sit through the intro, the loader robot still amazed me, and the character models... THEY MOVE THEIR MOUTHS. And chromed helmets on the guards... amazing stuff guys.

												Which is better, Half-Life or the Source version? Well, that depends on what your willing to deal with between the two. Half-Life Source looks quite a bit better than the origanal with its water effects, motion blur, and fixed box-pushing machanic. However, unlike the origanal, Source DOES NOT have an auto save! So you could progress throu the entire game, die right at the end, and start over at that damn long tram ride. Another thing to mention is the enimies just love to get right in your face, so be perpared to use you shotgun alot. As long as your willing to deal with that, and have a habit of pressing the F6 key, then go ahead and get Half-Life Source. Otherwise, just stick with regular Half-Life.*Note: In case anyone hasn't played a Valve game before, F6 is the manuel save.*****			",52,6,0,1,7,0,7

												Half Life Source is amazing. I first picked it up last year and I loved it. I still love it. However I'm playing it again now and I'm experiencing a TON of bugs. Like in the part in Residue Processing with all the conveyar belts the map is really glitching out making a bunch of things I clearly don't remember seeing making it really hard to navigate. Another is the securrity guard from blast pit who yells ""EAT LEAD YOU OUTERSPACE OCTOPUS!"" doesn't get killed from whatever that thing is called making it not pay attention at all to you etc. I'm not saying this is a bad game at all in fact I highly reccomend it it's just it kind of needs to be fixed up a bit.

Stronly reccomended to play. It has an awesome story, sound, levels and gameplay. Back then this was THE game to play among with other real-time classics like Deus Ex and System Shock 2.Now i play the Source version, but i still know how good the classic one is. It's not been my childhood, i've discovered this game since i got Steam back in 2009, but man, i'm glad i've found this out.So i got to play it and as i said; it's one of the best game i've played.Go play this, you really need to, because you miss one hell of a classic game if you don't play it.

But that's about it. It's the same game. Nothing changes.It is a nice complement if you buy the complete Half-Life franchise pack though. And it has many model and texture mods that make it look great. But if you're looking for an HD remake of the original Half-Life, I'd recommend you grab the Black Mesa mod for Half-Life 2 instead. It features a lot of new stuff while keeping the original storyline and locations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life: Source is pretty much the classic Half-Life ported to the Source engine. The graphics are pretty much the same, the main differences being water animations, the introduction of ragdolls, and some other physics stuff. And the skyboxes are more detailed now. The maps remain largely the same, so, if you like Half-Life, you'll like this as well.Personally, I play both games whenever I feel like replaying the series, but that's just because I'm weird like that, as the story in both games is exactly the same, this being a port and all.

												Although the graphics aren't anything to brag about (even in the port to the Source engine), the gameplay is still the same crazyness its predecessor brought. A storyline worth wonders put out piece by piece, an always low supply of ammunition, and the kind of difficulty that isn't too difficult, but will kill you at any chance is just perfect. Blend that in with the fact that there are THREE ""factions"" (Black Mesa, the U.S. Army, and the Aliens) that are constantly warring and you have one heck of a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It have problems, like out of place lighting, unnecessary ragdoll physics which leads to no gibbing minor graphics and physics errors. Nevertheless it's interesting to try out an aged classic in a new Source shell. Plus a models integration into Garry's mod . I still give it a positive mark and recommend to buy once it's on sale. On the contrary, if you like a real, worthy remake of the Half-Life, get Black Mesa.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although people expected more from this port when it first came out. I think it deserves some credit. It reduces buggy-ness of the original game. Includes chapter selection and a few preformance changes.One of the main reasons I prefer this version over the GldSrc version is because, on that version, I get INTENSE lag spikes if a lighting update occurs.Although, I think it's a good choice for the person who wants to play Half-Life again, but more reliable on the technical side of things.

												No matter how old the game may feel, the concepts and ideas brought to Half Life will always seem new to me. One moment your scattering for ammo while hitting headcrabs with your crowbar and the next literally running for your life against a Garganturae or fighting waves of marines as you uncover more about the aliens and where the come from. Is has that real variety that few shooters today have. However if I where to nit pick at something it would have to be a few of the Xen missions felt a bit off par with the other chapters and just seemed more like the scene from a movie you just want to skip and the platforming puzzles. This game could be considered as one of the most innovative FPS of all time for good reason. To be honest I don't think I can think of any other FPS games really like this. This is a classic... nuff said.10/10			",48,4,0,8,2,0,0

												If you've played the original 1998 Half-Life game then playing through Half-Life: Source will essentially mean playing through the same game for at least a second time. The classic base game is the same and nothing from the original has been left out. Half-Life: Source just makes use of Valve's newer proprietary Source engine since the original Half-Life was built on and ran on the Goldsrc engine.There are some noticeable differences in the game being ported over to use the Source engine and most of the improvements are to the graphics, textures and effects. Most areas do not have a significant and obvious amount of refurbishing but I observed the following areas of improvement.Firstly, the weapons appear more slick such as a more smooth edged and shiny crowbar which is a nice touch but nothing radical. The next graphical improvements that are noticeable would be things like the water effects which make the water ripples and flow look and feel a lot more realistic. The overall texture of everything in the game has been slightly or greatly improved on. Since the game is using the Source engine you will find the title menu has been changed to reflect the new engine which feels like Half-Life 2's main title menu.The whole point of this version of Half-Life is to showcase the original classic in its glorious transition from the original Goldsrc engine to the newer Source engine. This is the reason why the original Half-Life's multiplayer component is left out because if you want to play the multiplayer aspect of the game then the original is what it's intended for.One area of Half-Life: Source which appears to mildly hinder the experience are the loading screens. There are frequent, and sometimes considerably long loading screens. The original Half-Life had some loading screens which were very short but Half-Life: Source seems to have them at regular intervals and with quite a delay. I'm guessing this issue is mainly to do with the new engine adopted for the game. However, if you can put up with this then the game is still brilliant and this will not really be anything of significant concern.I've noticed quite a few negative comments for this version of Half-Life and they state that things in the game are broken such as helicopter hit boxes. This is actually incorrect because I haven't had any difficulties with taking down helicopters in the Dam level and other levels. You just need to be aware of the right tactics.Overall, the game is essentially the same as the original with a nice polish and I have also reviewed the original Half-Life on Steam so checking that review out will provide complementary views on this game as well. If you've played Half-Life (original) on Steam or elsewhere then playing Half-Life: Source isn't really necessary. The only reason you would play it is out of curiosity like me and because it is a fairly short game. An excellent classic nonetheless.			",373,155,5,63,52,4,94

												As big a visual improvement Half-Life Source is over the original, it's sadly riddled with bugs. On first play, I wasn't able to progress past the first chapter as the game script appeared to be broken when a security guard or scientist was supposed to open a door for me but wouldn't. There are also numerous sound and rendering issues, such as weapons being invisible and the sound of your gund being played in the distance. There's a particularly nasty bug on one of the levels where a storm drain is blocked by a grate that isn't meant to be there. The only way past was to use the noclip cheat.With the original Half-Life on Steam for the same price, the graphics won't be as good but you won't get these game-destroying bugs. Avoid.

												Half Life is (of course) a fantastic game. This is a good version of it.Pros:-Improved water, bullet, lighting, and physics effects-Ragdolls are cool-Fixed some annoying issues from the original-Levels can be accessed individually, and you're given a sizeable arsenal to startNeutral:-Same graphics in generalCons:-Occasionally a scripted event won't execute properly, such as a door not opening on ""Surface Tension"" or being teleported to a glitchy place on ""Lamba Core"". Luckily these were at the very end of their respective levels, so I just skipped ahead to the next one. These are a pain in the butt. However, I've also heard this was an issue with the original.-Some sound effects don't work when you choose the option to ""Load HD models"". This is annoying because the HD models look way better.Overall, if you've played the original recently, there isn't much new or different here. I would recomend it for new players looking to play a classic game.			",104,2,2,3,1,0,22

Play against aliens of all types in a high tech lab, to the side of a ravine, then to a planet far away, to destroy a tall, floating, fat, puppet, that can teleport you, or electricute* you. You have all but yourself, your weapons, and your enemies. Teleporting, ugly creatures, and crazy soldiers that are ordered to shoot you. *Bad spelling*			",60,0,1,1,6,0,2

												Half life 2 was the first one i played, so coming back to this game is a shock graphic wise yet i cant stop playing the game. The action is good and the game has a few ""oh crap, im dead"" moments that make you hang on the edge of your seat to see if you will survive. Well worth playing and worth getting in the complete set.			",61,6,0,5,3,0,0

												There's nothing special about Half-Life: Source. The ragdoll physics aren't much to behold. Nothing as changed graphics wise. The characters, enironment, weapons, etc. It's all the same. All they added were the ragdoll physics and improved water textures. Oh and I guess the lighting is a little better. That's about it. I recommend just sticking with the original.

												I'm gonna be honest. I am 19 and I never played this game until now and I am so glad I did. This game is fantastic in every way. It is so amazing such an old game can still impress me so much that some of the new games today feels bland and rather boring in comparison. The game is so challenging and sometime even frustrating and yet I still keep coming back. I tried and fail, and tried again until i finally finish the whole game and there is only one word to describe my feeling, GLORIOUS. Will definitely play Half Life 2 and hope that it will bring me even more surprise and torture as well. For those who never played this game, PLAY IT NOW. I don't care you buy it full price or on sale, just purchase it and you will have the greatest time of your life.			",100,11,0,8,1,2,1

												A classic worth playing. Great example of minimalistic storytelling (there is zero exposition in this). There are no pauses or breaks in this game and the intensity grows until the big finale. Very challenging--but fair--difficulty that has you conserving ammo and searching every nook and cranny for all the secret staches. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, but the ending certainly leaves you wanting more (fortunately there IS more).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This first time I played this (all those years ago, in the original version) I got goosebumps just during the introduction. It reminded me of all those old sci-fi movies I watched growing up as a kid. The tension builds throughout the game, with occasional respites to catch your breath, and the story evolves and advances, just like those old movies. Unlike those old movies, there's no big rubber monster at the end with cheezy special effects. You will find a battle that you will have to work at, and feel satisfied in the end(?)

The storyline is the same, there is some bugs and glitches in the game but it doesnt harm the gameplay. Its possible to beat it. I got through it and beaten it so if you are worried about them, dont worry its possible to get through it.

												Graphics and Bugs:This game is an original Half-Life but on the source engine. Which means better graphics and less bugs and glitches. On the original Half-Life the sound could not be heard sometimes, here its fixed. But really rare there is a ladder bug when you jump on ladder and it knocks you off (requires restart) and basically thats it.Difficulty and genre:Luckily the game was developed a long ago, when the story was not very important, when developers were adding much more action than in modern games. Yeah of cource it has story, and events but nothing complicated. The athmosphere and action are something to enjoy in this game. It is difficult even on easy difficulty to find where to go, or just complete the chapters (some take 1-2 hours). But I would call it ''challenging'' instead of ''omg sucks'' or ''too hard''The start and end of game:The start was clear, whole chapter spent on introduction which is kind of needed to be done. The end had some kind of mystery, and some questions could be asked. Has two endings, and you can only hope what Gordon is going to choose.Rating:I would give this game 9/10. First played in 2015, and it is a game for all the times! ",67,8,0,4,6,0,4

												Great game, way ahead of it's time and it still holds up today perhaps not graphically but definitely is strong gameplay wise and that is what's most important in a video game. It's a rollercoaster of gameplay where it constantly switches between run & gun shoot 'em up, survival horror, and puzzle platformer. It starts of strong with and immersive experience and the best intro for a video game in my personal opinion. But I have to note that the last missions in Xen are the weakest missions in the game and a painfuly difficult boss fight with an ending not worth the struggle at the end, the ending leaves you asking more question than you did at the begining of the game but the Half-Life series is known for that. But overall it's a great game and a must own, it's just the Xen missions and ending that are slightly dissapointing. I would give it an 8.5/10			",38,1,0,4,3,0,1

The black sheep of the Half-Life seriesFirst of all, Half-Life is a great game. Everyone knows that. I don't need to bother describing Half-Life's gameplay in any detail. Long story short, I loved the game then and I still do. Its influence on the industry is virtually unparalleled and indirectly led to the creation of Steam in the first place!However, Half-Life: Source is a disappointment with a misleading title. I say ""misleading"" because having already played Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, I expected this game to be a full HD remake of the original, with proper models and textures. Instead, all we got was the original 1998 models and textures running on the Source engine. We didn't even get the polygonal upgrades that Half-Life Blue Shift received. Sure, the physics and lighting are modern, but it's hard to notice when everything else is blocky and jagged. It makes this game seem pointless especially when the original 1998 game is still available and has a much larger community. It's such a shame - I'm sure this game would've made a killing selling at full price if it were a proper HD remake. At least I didn't directly pay for this game - I got it as part of a much larger bundle.Fortunately, not all is lost. The Black Mesa: Source mod (which I've played) has done what Valve failed to do - remake the campaign with proper HD graphics. Either play that game, or stick to the original 1998 game. Don't waste money buying Half-Life: Source standalone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my favorite games ever. everyone should play it at some time or another. I even prefer it to the beloved sequel because it nails the claustrophobic atmosphere. the game boasts a breaking bad esque soundtrack that kicks in only when it needs to. It is a compelling gameplay expirience with a minimalistic yet effective narritive. the main character gordan freeman is infinately relateable and the player is invested in his survival. The game doesn't have very many characters but the ones it does have are well developed.the ending is possibly my favorite part because it leaves the player SOO pumped for the next one. the updated physics engine is just icing on the already fantastic cake			",24,4,1,1,2,1,0

												It's Half Life, but in the Source engine. If you've played Half Life, there's no reason to play this one. The expansions Blue Shift and Opposing Force also won't work if you have HLSOURCE and not HL, so I'd you're looking to pick one or the other, I'd recommend Half Life: not source.

												Graphics and Bugs:This game is an original Half-Life but on the source engine. Which means better graphics and less bugs and glitches. On the original Half-Life the sound could not be heard sometimes, here its fixed. But really rare there is a ladder bug when you jump on ladder and it knocks you off (requires restart) and basically thats it.Difficulty and genre:Luckily the game was developed a long ago, when the story was not very important, when developers were adding much more action than in modern games. Yeah of cource it has story, and events but nothing complicated. The athmosphere and action are something to enjoy in this game. It is difficult even on easy difficulty to find where to go, or just complete the chapters (some take 1-2 hours). But I would call it ''challenging'' instead of ''omg sucks'' or ''too hard''The start and end of game:The start was clear, whole chapter spent on introduction which is kind of needed to be done. The end had some kind of mystery, and some questions could be asked. Has two endings, and you can only hope what Gordon is going to choose.Rating:I would give this game 9/10. First played in 2015, and it is a game for all the times! ",67,8,0,4,6,0,4

												As big a visual improvement Half-Life Source is over the original, it's sadly riddled with bugs. On first play, I wasn't able to progress past the first chapter as the game script appeared to be broken when a security guard or scientist was supposed to open a door for me but wouldn't. There are also numerous sound and rendering issues, such as weapons being invisible and the sound of your gund being played in the distance. There's a particularly nasty bug on one of the levels where a storm drain is blocked by a grate that isn't meant to be there. The only way past was to use the noclip cheat.With the original Half-Life on Steam for the same price, the graphics won't be as good but you won't get these game-destroying bugs. Avoid.

												Half Life is (of course) a fantastic game. This is a good version of it.Pros:-Improved water, bullet, lighting, and physics effects-Ragdolls are cool-Fixed some annoying issues from the original-Levels can be accessed individually, and you're given a sizeable arsenal to startNeutral:-Same graphics in generalCons:-Occasionally a scripted event won't execute properly, such as a door not opening on ""Surface Tension"" or being teleported to a glitchy place on ""Lamba Core"". Luckily these were at the very end of their respective levels, so I just skipped ahead to the next one. These are a pain in the butt. However, I've also heard this was an issue with the original.-Some sound effects don't work when you choose the option to ""Load HD models"". This is annoying because the HD models look way better.Overall, if you've played the original recently, there isn't much new or different here. I would recomend it for new players looking to play a classic game.			",104,2,2,3,1,0,22

												For me, after 19 years, Half-Life is still very playable, nowadays, often underrestimate game, with sadly not astonishing storyline and thrilling gameplay. The game's climate of secret insitution (based on 'Area 64' idea) and underground labs is perfect. I won't be saying anything about graphics since at 1998 it was delightful, however the sound quality could be definitely way better. Storytelling technique was highly sophisticated since it was told more visually than in text. The game guarantees tons of action and fun. Personaly - as my favourite one - I find it the best in the series and now, Source engine is making it even better. Thank you Valve. Quick summary: +perfect climate of secret institution and labs situated underground +very good graphics (to the standards of '98) +good storytelling technique +dynamic, full of action gameplay based on shooting creatures +Valve's Source engine is making it even better -sound quality -despite that it got old quite good, it is still the game from previous generation -not astonishing storyScore: 7/10			",112,13,2,9,4,2,13

Half-Life (Source)Positives• Most likely a good game in 1998• Simplistic shooting mechanics that make sense• Ammo and resources have to be found and are sometimes scarceNegatives• Repetitive and senseless puzzles• Enemies are too easy to take out and are just a nuisance rather than a challenge• Gordon seems to be too powerful for a protagonist fighting mutants and hundreds of soldiers• Graphics are never updated and is a bit bad for my liking even though it is an older title• Story is a bit dragged out mostly due to the annoying puzzles which make the game seem choppy• Player physics are very buggy in the source version, for example you can run way too fast• Seems like nothing changed between Source and original• Outdated and stale for todays standards• Frustrating, boring and repetitive at times• Pointless shooting and slaughtering predictable enemiesFinal Thoughts: Although the game came out more than ten years ago, it still does not make up for the boring and repetitive gameplay. I got this game because I wanted the whole Half-Life story but the story was ruined in this version. I could barely get through the first 5 hours when all Gordon was doing was escaping the facility.Rating: 2.5/10-Penta ",26,5,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life had an impact in the FPS world akin to Doom or Quake. There's no doubt that this is one of the greatest games of the FPS genre ever made. The AI was revolutionary for the time, the set pieces were impressive, and the design/art direction was extremely creative.This game may be a PC gaming classic now, but you can experience it in the source engine with this release!

												As much as I love the Half Life series, I recommend that the original Half Life be played first before this iteration. Yes, it had a graphical and engine update but so what. The gameplay itself was tampered with.....it was made easier, even on ""Hard"" there is a noticeable difference between Hard on this source version and the original. In Blast Pit there has been an extra npc placed that stands at the top of the platform continuously shooting the ""tentacles""(and for some reason never dies), which completely ruined the tension that was there previously.Almost a walk in the park.

												Review's of Half Life don't even matter 'cause everybody knows how good of a game it is. 9/10 would probably own this game because of valve-bundles and sales so ""should you buy it"" is also out of the question. The problem with this game is according to the reviews the many bugs it has. All I have to say is that I have encountered less bug while playing this version of Half Life. I did not have the bug with the gargantua in ""on a rail"" in which case the gate wouldn't open and I could effectively pull/push crates. Ofcourse I've put slightly less hours in this version. essentially, it was just Half Life with the original Glock-skin and SMG-skin to play.			",49,5,0,4,0,0,6

												If you want to see how Half-Life Source improved on the original just look at Barneys (the security guard) face in the opening scene, in the original he looks like a human, in source he looks like a corpse, there are so many little things missing from source (and only in the first few minutes) it feels like what Half-Life would have been if maybe EA owned it or something.

												I'm sure I don't need to boast the quality of this game; Half Life is a classic, and any fps enthusiast should play through this at least once. The Source version did demonstrate some difficulties. Music stops at level change. Certain textures are missing (towards the end, the white spluge turns into black squares when landing). There is a level where the aliens simply don't attack me. There is a boss (the one producing the crabs) that is completely unaffected by arrows. Some of the trampolines at the end simply don't work sometimes. I don't know if the original version is available on Steam, but I'd recommend looking into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Estamos Falando de Algo que foi a Base de Todos FPs do Mundo!. Pois HL1 foi Algo que Revolucionou o Mundo dos Games. Uma Mistura de QUIVER e PROSPERO (Planos da Valve) No Game você se Passa na Pele do Gordon Freeman, Um Cientista Cujo Entreu e uma Encrenca da Pesada, Ao Fazer Parte de um Experimento da Black Mesa onde deu Errado. Pouco Depois Aliens de Outra Dimensão Aparecem na BM E seu Objetivo é Fugir do Laboratorio.    O Jogo Contem Diversas Armas, E diversos Tipos de Aliens. O Game Não é Rapetitivo. E Poucas Partes tem Uma SondTrack e uma musica. MAS quando tem São Otímas. Mais Detalhes Podem ser Encontrados ao Zerar o Game. Muito Obrigado e Esse Foi Meu Review  :D ",94,9,2,9,2,0,1
