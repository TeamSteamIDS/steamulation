												Some parts of the review is more than likely how to get the game working. This game is completely abandoned since Sierra Entertainment company went away. If your looking for online multiplayer do not bother as the servers are gone. Clicking ""Internet"" multiplayer will just freeze the game. Happily LAN still works. You need to download a physx driver from Nvidia in order to get this game working. Steam should have added this file as download with the game. Too bad the Developers are gone.http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.0604-legacy-driver.htmlSome people buying this game have no clue how to make the game working without reading the forums.It works for both AMD and Nvidia Graphic card users.Beware, you might need to turn off ""Hardware Cursor"" in option menu if you are getting crashes.It has a good singleplayer campaign, but you might not like the ending. I can't really recommend this game due to it being an abandonware game.  The game is very balance between the factions.  There is a bug in ""Vigilant Arms"" mission where if you destroy the artilleries before the map expands, you cannot complete the secondary mission. Spotting the artillery for F117 to automatically to bomb them. The secondary mission I do believe should have been activated during the start of the mission(bug). When the map expands the secondary mission activates. So destroying them early stops you from completing the mission.There is no secrets or unlocks in the game. If you are a big real time strategy fan you should get this game, unless you don't want to be bothered to get this game working. If you are not a fan of real time strategy, I cannot recommend it unless you can get it to work. If there was a neutral option in steam review I would have selected that option. The game currently works on Windows 8.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Joint Task Force is a real-time strategy game from HD Publishing.In Joint Task Force, you don't get to build a base unlike any other RTS out there, but instead you have to secure a landing zone to deploy your heavy forces. Light forces such as infantry can be deployed directly near your officers via helicopters. Vehicles will need soldiers/crews to operate, and their effectiveness will increase if the right crew mount them. Soldiers that operate a vehicles can also be killed even if their vehicles still intact, which makes capturing enemy vehicles possible. Officers can also call in an airstrike or cruise missile strike.The graphics are great and awesome for an old game and the effects are very good. This is the first strategy game where I see ragdoll effect is featured. Unit collision is also a big matter here, as unlike most RTS game out there, vehicles and tanks almost cannot collide with one another. Even on very low graphics setting, somehow the game still looks good.The downside of the game is, the skirmish game is somewhat boring, as the AI is quite stupid. The skirmish setting are also bugged, as there are some setting that makes you win or lose instantly when the game not even started. Multiplayer are also dead I think. I haven't been able to play multiplayer.Joint Task Force has great potential to be a great game, overall the campaign can still give you some hours of playtime. I recommend this.Rating 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. It's still kind of topical, but I don't play it for the politics. The graphics are nice, the missions are fun, and there's a lot of replayability because if something doesn't work, back up a little and try a different approach. Sometimes the AI is a bit wonky, especially when in vehicles, but overall the controls are smooth and intuitive. I like that you have to pay attention to how much money you have and that you can't rely on just endlessly churning out or requisitioining equipment, supplies, and soldiers.. It makes you play smart with what you have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can honestly say this game is a hidden gem if your an RTS/ RTT fan.First the bad, well some very annoying path-finding issues. The performance could be better, and there are animation glitches.  (however it is more than stable, and FPS don't fluctuate that much)Now the good, the story is rather generic, but done rather well.The graphics are pretty good, and to this day some of the best models of the (AH-64 Apache, and AV-8b Harrier) I have seen in an RTS/RTT. Campaign is a decent length despite having only 1 faction, there is like 21 or so missions.The gameplay is arguably some of my favorite in a Real Time Tactical game (which this is more that, than it is an RTS, there is no base-building) The options are many and nice. Can actually do some awesome guerrilla style warfare in this game.  (Also it is slower-paced)Sound is good, Music is better than most RTS/RTT games set in this time period.For $10, I recommend it.  If it goes on sale, there is no excuse not to try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kind of intriguing. A twist on the usual strategy game elements. base building is no longer recquired, and you have a selection of ""hero"" units at your disposal that can call in reinforcements. Basic units such as rangers or medics, even tanks and humvees, can level up and become ""promoted"" to a hero unit. Each hero unit has specific abilities based around their original class. For instance, the marksman(sniper) unit can upgrade into a veteran Sniper, giving him abilities like stealth, and the ability to recquisition units like scout helicopters and humvees. As said, it's intriguing and worth a look. There is a demo in the steam store, and if not, you can download the demo from fileplanet.com. Trust me, even though the voice acting is a little iffy at times, you can't judge based on cutscenes and chatter. it's the gameplay that counts and thats what this game has.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A gem in the ocean, that's pretty much wrap up about the game.To be honest, at first, when I see it, I don't think this is a good game. Just another war game, I think. But, I try it anyways, and has so much fun playing it in my surprised. It has so many things that ulike any RTS game, you don't have base, for start, just field of operation, you will plan your move around your officer. That means you need to move a lot.Physic is pretty good in this game, the explosion seems somewhat sastified. The music is so-so thought. The bad thing is no one still playing this game in multiplayer. This game offer so much for you for a change, you should try it out, I'm sure you will enjoy it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Joint Task ForceDeveloper:  Most Wanted EntertainmentPublisher:  HD PublishingGenre:  Real Time StrategyGeneral ImpressionJST is a story driven real time strategy game that has aged very well. From both an aesthetic  and gameplay perspective. Honestly, I found it hard to believe this is a 10-year old game already. The missions are complex and feature enough diversity to keep the game interesting at all times. The AI is decent, taking into consideration that this is a 2006 RTS. Difficulty settings are well adjusted, even though I recommend you play it at hard from the get-go. I thoroughly enjoy strategy titles in which I have no base management to deal with and can focus directly on the battleground. In JST you have a requisition budget that is quite finite, so you have to be careful about overspending on reinforcements and airstrikes.Strong Points+ Good looking  graphics that stood the test of time.+ Mission composition along with terrain and unit diversity.+ No base management.Weak Points- No Steam Trading Cards or Achievements.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Great and under rated RTS. I am surprised I did not know about this game until more recently considering it is from 2006. I think those who enjoyed CnC Generals Zero Hour but wanted more would enjoy this. Has enough in it to keep micromanaging of units interesting while not being overdone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Joint Task Force is a bit like the Commandos games as you have to be careful with the units you have at hand.Now you can during certain missions call in new units, but most of the time you're on your own with limited units.And the game also has that any vehicle, that has had its crew killed or been abandoned, can be piloted by any of your units, but for maximum effectivness it is best to have a vehicle crew pilot them.Another important aspect of the game is that you're constantly under the watchful eye of news reporters that inform the world of your progress, killing civilians will lower the support for you and thus means less funding for calling in reinforcements.

												I have been playing a lot of RTS games lately and Ifound JTF quite pleseant and entertaining.Pros: -Modern Warfare alike (90's) based game, no futuristic♥♥♥♥♥♥-Entertaining, nothing else.-Average US units available, you can actually use most of the units laying arround such as cars, pickups etc.-Destroyable Buildings.-Fully LAN support. ☺ A+Cons:-Short Campaing-PhysisX bugs-Limited units available-Mediocre AI, game has no way to form groups or units (set them into formation) and they are a lil bit stupid.-Discountinued Online support.-Lousy cinematics.So in a short term, if you are a realistic Warfare RTS guy you must play at least the campaign, anything else avoid this game.

												Lots of potential buried under poor design decisions. I remember when this first came out way back when, I was really excited for it and then incredibly disappointed by the ending. That feeling more or less holds up now - the first couple of missions are great, with a cool ""international peacekeepers"" concept that's pretty unique, but then the story very quickly departs from that and becomes a convoluted mess that never makes any sense and ends on a sequel hook cliffhanger with no real explanation of anything that's going on. The game was a bomb and a sequel never got made, so the story ends up feeling like complete nonsense. It feels like the game went through several rewrites and the different plots ended up being sloppily patched together to make missions fit in the end. Speaking of missions, they become unbearably boring and articifially difficult about halfway through, making the game an overlong slog that's absolutely full of padding. The unit variety makes tic-tac-toe seem deep, with every unit in the game introduced within the first few missions, and the AI spamming forces of roughly 80% anti-aircraft units in the late game in order to render all of your air support completely useless (and thereby upping the difficulty considerably, since not only do you effectively lose air support, but the enemy's AA is also great anti-infantry and decent anti-armor.) This is made even worse by the terrible AI - poor pathfinding is more or less expected in RTS games, but Joint Task Force has painfully bad and often harmful pathfinding, with units running themselves repeatedly into obstacles and getting stuck or directly into the enemy and getting destroyed, even when a shorter, simpler, and safer route is available. Combined with the fact that your units will often refuse to perform automatic reactions like they're supposed to, such as firing on nearby enemies or healing injured allies, and the game just becomes a micromanagement nightmare that's not worth the effort.

												Barely recommended that is. This is a bargain basement job when on sale, I got it for just 69p!For that low price it does not matter this is just a barely adequate bog-standard RTS.At it's FULL price of £6.99, it is NOT recommended. Do not buy when above £1.99 IMO!It's settings are various US vs Middle East, Bosnia etc in 1990's - 2000's type conflicts. Not much to say really, as you will have seen this all before if you are an afficionado of the RTS genre. A few people, especially those who are using Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 report problems getting it to run due to ""missing PhysX drivers"" but here's links for the drivers you'll need to get it (hopefully) up and running:-http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.0604-legacy-driver.html - for Win Vista / 7 / 8 and 8.1 (not sure how Win 10 will work with this) <----- TY to ""Gekido"" for posting this link uphttp://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.html - for Win XP / Vista and 7 thanks to ""Winkeltim"" for posting thisAs always though, there is one major problem with this game. A problem sadly endemic to so many RTS games - the STUPID UNFAIR difficulty levels. There are two difficulty levels:-""Normal"" aka ""HUURRRRR DURRRRR Impossible"" and""Hard"" aka ""You playing on THIS level bro? You retard bro?""All the AI seem to have at least a 5x stat advantage, with ALL stats, over your units. One poxy militia recruit can easily take out ten of your most elite commandos! I had ONE, just ONE, such militia goon in a good position inside a container ship, wipe out NINETY of my troops - they would not even use their grenades which would've solved their problem!Military realism is NOT a strong point, the only realism it has are some correct vehicle names! Other than that, no armour stats, just simple HP points, a BMP-2 has as many HP as an M1A2 Abrams, you get the idea, not an ounce of realism to it. Made for the XBox brigades methinks!If you fail a mission you an ""easy"" button appears that you can press for your second attempt..... even ""Easy"" is aka ""Still Impossible!""Vehicle pathfinding iS TERRIBLE! With their oversized footprints they tangle themselves amongst each other and the often cluttered map objects! You will scream many times at the unbelievable dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥your vehicles will often do. Infantry doesn't have this problem though due to having small footprints. Neither do air units, they still have large footprints and can still get in the way of other air units, but they just sail over ground clutter!Vehicle footprints are so oversized, I once could not even drive an M2A3 through a gap that was five times it's own width!Edit: As I've played further in to the campaign, reaching the scenarios set in Iraq, I have never seen more horrible, stupid, unfairly designed scenarios! I had to have ALL cheats running ALL the time, and still found these scenarios just too tedious and stressful. No fun at all in these later missions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
