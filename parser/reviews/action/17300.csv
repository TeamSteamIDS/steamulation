												I can't believe its been a decade since its release and it still looks awesome as evar! Better looking than most of the so called half baked 'Next Gen' games that are released nowadays. Also this game is the reason why we have the better graphics cards,etc today.I still remember the first time I played it, ran it on a 7100 GS on lowest settings on 640x480 resolution @ 5~15 fps approx. And yes finally, I can play it on max settings at 60 fps lol. We dont really need a HD remake or something like that for atleast a century.It pushed the boundaries that are expected in an FPS, but sadly, it ended up as one of the highly underrated series.Mother of Graphics!9.5/10

												Ohhh yeah look at that grass! These leaves are rendered beautifully. And, my god, look at the water, I can see my perfectly modeled reflection! Can you run Crysis, or can you not run Crysis? That is the question. If you can, you are one in a million. You are part of an elite organization dedicated to the eradication of visible polygon edges. You strive to inform the world of the dangers of trillinear filtering. But you also laugh as you run 5 different instances of Crysis at the same time, while the average gamer struggles to complete a game of minesweeper. As you watch your maximized particle effects without frame tearing you get a sense of superiority that is, well, frankly justified.Besides prestige and graphics, Crysis does offer great gameplay. The plot makes you feel, it makes you want more. The freeroam approach to objectives lets you choose your style. And at the end of the game you are just left in amazement at the 10 hour, non-stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you just had.So If you want to inflate your ego or just want a fantastic game pick up a copy of Crysis today... if you think you can handle it.

												Don't buy the Steam version, it doesn't include the x64 files and doesn't run on newer OS's/ systems. Steam really shouldn't be selling this non working and incomplete product, or is it now the norm for Steam games for one to have to spend hours searching the web for fixes and unofficial 3rd party patches which may possibly contain malicous software.Is that the point of buying games on Steam? I don't think so, bad form Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't a bad game at all. It's one of the greatest shooters of all time and 10 years later it still holds up. From what I hear this game is also used more of a tool rather than a game as a benchmark for pc gaming rigs. It even gives some modern gpus a run for their money barely passing 60 fps. High end rigs back then could barely run this, let alone at MAX. Truly a testament of it's time. But that's not why I give this game a negative review. Don't let my playtime fool you, I have the original retail copy of this game and wanted a digital copy. It's the only reason I got the Steam version. The steam version of the game is just terrible. It uses 3rd party DRM (SecuROM) that is not equipped to run on modern operating systems like Windows 8 or Windows 10. It doesn't work because it doesn't include the x64 files to work on newer windows OS, unless you own the retail copy. My retail copy works fine on Windows 7 with no problems what so ever. The Steam version works on Windows 7 however if you spend a little bit of time in the menu section or when you pause it, the game freezes. There is no need for 3rd party DRM since Steam is already the DRM. My advice, get this game on GOG instead. DO NOT bother with the Steam or Origin version of the game. The game is a 10/10 but the Steam version is a 3/10.Buy it here instead:https://www.gog.com/game/crysis ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: I originally finished the game using my disc based copy of the game bought in 2007. I bought it again on steam because it was included in the Crysis Franchise Pack.INTRODUCTION:One of the rare PC Exclusive titles to break free from the Console's restrictive and dated hardware. Crysis 1 was the benchmark for most PC games back in 2007 until it was finally replaced by Metro 2033 in 2010.Crysis follows the story of Jake ""Nomad"" Dunn, member of a Delta Ops Nano Team tasked with infiltrating an Island currently occupied by North Korean Forces. Not soon after landing, the Delta team finds out that the KPA is the least of their worries.PROS:+ Cutting Edge Graphics: -Considering this game was released in 2007, Crysis can still go toe-to-toe with the 2012 game Far Cry 3. Back then, almost 95% of all PCs in the world could not run Crysis on its maximum settings. Crysis 1 was meant to be a PC only exclusive mostly because the developers really wanted to push both their creative freedom and raw hardware power. This is the game also spawned the internet meme: ""But can it run Crysis?""+ Innovative Gameplay: -This game was the first to introduce the Nano Suit which added a wide variety of new approaches to missions and objectives. A Quick hand and good reflexes are needed to fully utilize the Nano Suit's power.+ Pseudo Open World: -Its not Sandbox, but it's not linear. Each mission objective involves a map of gigantic proportions where you can go and carefully plan out your strategy before going in a mission. Like what I said in my SW: Republic Commando Review, not every game needs to be sandbox. Crysis 1 had a good style by giving enough freedom while keeping the player in a directed flow in the story.CONS:- Terrible Optimization: -Although it was the Graphical Flagship of its time, the devs mainly focused on sheer brute force power of the GPU but made so little optimization. If properly optimized, most mid-range PCs could have ran this game a bit better.- Unresolved Bugs: -6 years and some of the bugs from the first release still persists. Downloading some of the latest patches actually causes a bug. Not game breaking but terribly annoying.- Resolution Problem: -You may or may not encounter this problem but the game seems to have a problem doing a full screen with a 1920x1080 resolution. To fix this, you'll need to edit the settings via note pad.CONCLUSION:MUST HAVE. One of the landmark games that dared a primarily Console dominated market to shine a great light once more to the PC.Additional Note: This is not a fast paced action game like COD or Battlefield. This game actually requires some planning and tactical movements to get the job done, specially in some of the harder difficulties.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Reasons to buy this game:-good graphics, even today-you are able to develop your own playing style-very detailed and smart AI-had gun attachments when CoD 4: MW was released, CoD only added attachments in later games, way later-really exiting and intriguing storyline -long singleplayer gameplay hours to be expected (20+)-great multiplayer-extremely large open world-large amount of content in the campaignI recommend buying the whole Crysis series for all these (and much more) reasons.

												Crysis isn't a game, it's the most hilarious benchmarking tool I've ever bought. RX 480 and 6600k and it still can't mantain a framerate above 60 in numerous locations. Switching down to high instead of very high results in negligible change. It heats my CPU in 20 minutes about 10 degrees more than an Aida 64 stress test does after an hour. It's barely a game anymore, more of a rite of passage and a time capsule of the glory days of the 8800 gtx.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After what....six years now?....this is still one of my faves. I still come back and play it periodically. Never get tired of the skulking around you can do, then open up fire on a few baddies for a while....then go back to skulking. This and the expansion pack Crysis Warhead are just a kick. Sort of like Call of Duty meets HL2, but with more hi-tech baddies and then some pretty mean aliens both big and small. Exceptionally weaponry at times as well. It's engaging on a lot of levels. You get your action on for a while. You get to sneak up on enemies and eliminate them in fun and interesting ways. And it challenges you to find sneaky means of taking them out. Even cooler: there are dozens of ways of attacking, and you can go back when replaying and try various new things and methods.Even better: it's as complex and slow-moving as you want, or you can force combat into a faster pace.

												This game is well-known for being beautiful, but to desribe it only as eye candy really sells Crysis short.  There's a lot to enjoy about the gameplay, especially how it breaks up the old ""series of chest-high-walls"" shooter formula.As a super soldier your suit contains a variety of powers that can be toggled between:  super strength (enhancing melee abilities), super speed, maximum armor, and active camouflage (which makes you truly invisible to enemies who haven't seen you yet).  Active camo is the true selling point, learning to use it (and honestly, abuse it) is what keeps you alive.  Your character is not well suited for going in guns blazing, you'll rely on stealth and run-and-gun tactics against enemies who prefer to hunt you instead of bunkering down behind a chest high wall.  In general, human enemy AI is fantastic and pushes you to quickly learn how to survive a Crysis fire-fight.Weapons customization is another well-done aspect of Crysis.  The same gun can be customized to a short/medium range spray-and-pray style semi-automatic, or a long-range silenced sniper with a scope and laser sight, all pretty much on-the-fly.  So while the number of unique weapons is actually pretty small (5 or 6 maybe), you can get a lot more mileage out of them through customization.  While the first stretch of the game fighting human enemies is very fun, the game has an abrupt change when you begin to encounter mostly aliens.  I definitely found this part much less enjoyable, it seems more about showing what you can do with the Cry Engine than keeping the game fun for the player.  My level of interest dropped off pretty sharply, to the extent that I didn't even finish the game.That doesn't mean I'm not glad I bought it (I definitely still recommened it), and you may not have the same experience I had.

												Crysis, better than FarCry.+ Amazing gameplay that can be absolutely cuhrayzee levels of fun+ Very large open world, with alright level design.+ Almost everything has physics, you can mow down trees to blowing up shacks.+ One of the best looking games from 2007.+ You can see your legs.+ Game is a little short, but the gameplay is so fun it's worth it to replay.+ Everyone's voice work was great, except Helina's. She's terrible.- Crashed a lot, had to Google a solution.- Some of the body physics were wonky.- You literally don't need any other rifle than the AK.- It's only toggle zoom, instead of hold down right mouse button. It felt weird to me, may not be a problem for others.- The story was fine until aliens showed up, then it got kinda lame.- Not enough checkpoints (at least you can quicksave).8/10, very good game and one of the prettiest and most fun FPSs out there.

												Would I recommend this game on it's own? Yes. Absolutely. Not only does it have amazing semi-open world gameplay, but it's graphics still hold up surprisingly well today. Which is amazing when you consider that this game came out 10 years ago! However, I cannot with any amount of seriousness recommend the Steam version. For some reason, EA completely neglected to include the latest update patches and the 64-bit version (which is the ONLY version PCs with AMD FX series CPUs like mine can run). I did manage to get the game to run without crashing on startup by manually installing the 1.21 patch and the executables for the 64-bit version myself and launching the game with a fan made .bat file but the point is, why do I HAVE to do all of that just to get the game to run? Doesn't the fact that I still had to manually patch the game myself kind of defeat the purpose of the Steam client? What's even worse is that from what I've heard, this problem isn't limited to the Steam version. The version sold on EA's own Origin service has the exact same problem!If you want to try this game for yourself, get it on GOG. Not only does the GOG version actually have both the 1.21 patch and the 64-bit version included from the get-go, but since it's a GOG release, it also has the nice added bonus of being DRM free as well.

												Anyone who has heard of Crysis knows it is still heralded to this day as a benchmark for graphics. Based on the Cry Engine 2, even now it is absolutely stunning. But more importantly its actually a brilliant game all round. The story is pretty standard, you are a special force operative kitted out with a ""Nano Suit"" which allows you to perform as a super soldier, whilst on mission you discover an Alien species which are plotting to invade the world (or so it seems). Voice acting is pretty good, the facial mapping is OUTSTANDING! But the key point that won this game for me was the true freedom it provides you in how you play. The map is very open, leaving it up to the player how you approach each objective. You can switch your suit to max armour and plow straight through the next check point murdering people left right and centre... you could turn on your optic camoflage and sneak through without a soul knowing, you could buff your strength, pick up an explosive barrel, hurl it at the building and watch the Crytek physics bring the roof down upon your foes. It really gives you the freedom to play it in a way that suits you and that is why I would recommend Crysis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A normal game PC nowadays is able to play Crysis like it was meant to be played. I upgraded my (7 year old) PC earlier this year, and therefore Crysis finally became playable for me. Because, let's be honest, a game like this should be played maxed out. So I picked it up at a recent discount on Steam, but was it worth the long wait?I really enjoyed the game, but from time to time it really got me frustrated as well. I struggled with the checkpoint system of the game a bit, but maybe that's because I'm not used to it. Ultimately, I have a good feeling after finishing it and that is the most important factor for me.Anno 2013, Crysis still is a stunningly beautifull game, and you no longer need extra-terrestrial hardware to play this game on very high settings. However, the last level is very demanding on the system, and I had to run the game in DirectX 9 mode to be able to stay above 60FPS (just add -dx9 as a startup argument).So, all in all, do I recommend this game... yes (if you can pick it up a at a discounted price of course).

												It took me a while to be fond of this game as I played it years ago and while my rig met the minimum requirements (almost reached the recommended ones) it had a hard time running Crysis on it properly. There were numerous glitches, audio issues and frequent CTDs.But you know what? Putting the technical difficulties aside this is a damn fine game! You play Nomad, a special forces soldier who wears a so-called nanosuit. The story takes place in the future and the objective is to find out what happened on the island previously seized by Koreans. While you traverse through the deep jungle and small settlements you notice two things: the game is stunningly beautiful (there was a reason for the high system reqs) and that by hiding-shooting you cannot eliminate your foes. You need to utilise your nanosuit. You can bring up a special menu and select from various abilities. Speed makes you faster, Strength allows you to melee your foes or throw bigger objects and Stealth makes you invisible. All drain your energy bar (which will refill automatically, but slowly) and I do not have to mention that Stealth is the most exciting and most useful among all. Oh, yes, there's a 4th power enabling you to take more damage.Enemy AI is great - they respond to the noises, work in squads and will try to find you even if you are invisible. On greater difficulty settings they speak Korean so you do not understand what commands they give to one another.Occasionally, the game throws in some scripted cutscenes - these look good and also interesting. By looking at the pictures on the store page one can guess what they'll find (and what the army was really looking into), but let's not spoil it here.Crysis is a stunningly beautiful game (even today considering it's more than 5 years old) and makes for an interesting, action-packed ride.WARNING: This review is based on playing the game on a 32-bit operating system. As per the feedbacks on the store page and amongst the discussions people detail further issues when it comes to 64-bit systems. I understand there is a workaround which has been tried and found good, still, this is just to let you know that before the purchase you should look into this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""ADAPT. ENGAGE. SURVIVE.I've never ever felt so confused about rating something I have just finished. At the moment I'm talking about story and its side of game because other parts of game (which we'll be talking next) are perfect.On the release date (2007) was this game truly revolutionary. In that time game's graphic was something unbelieveable. And still when we're comparing nowadays games or games from at least from 2010+ we can see, that Crysis is still next step above them and not in graphic, but in whole gameplay, even stealth and sometimes AI. This game is damn 7 YEARS OLD for God's sake and still nowadays developers are not even able to put their games to level Crysis was in 2007 which's really unbelieveable. My PERSONAL opinion is, that if there weren't aliens and SCI-FI side, it'd be one of the best FPS games ever been made. At the moment I got my hands on my head, and thinking of words which could describe the first hours of game. Alright, I'll divide this game to 2 parts ... 1st with Koreans and 2nd with Aliens. If the whole game was only about Koreans .... I still have no idea why they've put Aliens in it... Just because they had to think of new story? Ridicolous, since the story flew 5 hours without problem and without mentioning Aliens... They really have could let it in only.There was mentioned stealth, so let's take a look on it. It's really different, than in nowadays games. Now, when you hide into creek or tree, or just some textures which obviously should cover you, you're automatically spotted because in source code they're just textures, but in Crysis somehow you was able to cover in creek or tree and enemy could be few feets away from you, and he didn't spot you which's realistic I'd say. But of course only if you stood still. If you made a move, he could hear you obviously, so also as I said AI is pretty good made here. When you're in firefight, they won't rush you, they'll wait for you, throwing grenades on you, but in open field, they wan't to crush you from sides which really doesn't matter since you got Nanosuit... Multiplayer is totally dead. No wonder when this game is 7 years old. Still you can find servers with 30+ players, but only sometimes, and they're different version than Steam version (Servers for cracked copies) and there are only 10 servers for Steam version which're empty and when there is someone, he's cheater anyway. MP won't change rating.To the end let's say, apart from fact there're Aliens it's still awesome, great, brilliant, and one of the best FPS ever been made, but not BEST. Crytek always knew how to make games (not these days .. NOTE: F2P). The ending was one of the worst I have ever encounter. Ending of game took me 10 hours in total and parts with Aliens was like 3+ hours.Bonus Point: FPS RevolutionRating: 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning for 64 bit usersFirst off the game won't work so you have to download a file unzip it in your crysis folder and follow some instructions. Not a problem. Game works perfectly fine after this. Then it hits you. The game stops working after a while, it tells you your os is not supported. Strange it was working just fine for a few hours. Turns out securom is the culprit. You can either a) Download a 64 bit crack that is filled with malware or b) use a tool to try and remove securom and mess up your computer... Either way, I can't recommend this game. Using win 8.1 64 bit. Some research indicates I'm not the only one with this ""problem"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game! Got through the whole game in 10h on record.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-Graphics are great for a game from 2007-The campaign is a long one but it never gets dull or repetitive-I had encountered only 1 bug which isn't game-breaking one, it's a graphical glitch. So that's good-Cutscenes are great-A couple of weapon customisation choices-A lot of vehicles-Enemy variety in models, weapons which they use, good AI-Small community but it's alive-There are 26 servers with a small playerbase, but hey - it's working!CONS-Multiplayer is broken but you can fix it here: http://www.crysis1.com/viewpage.php?page_id=19 , 100% works, tried it myselfI recommend this game.

With this being the first time I've played it nearly ten years later, I underdtand the hype. The graphics are still stunning, the physics are perfect, and the storyline and gameplay are on a level of their own. This game gives you that sense of epicness that so many FPS's lack. It does get linear towards the end, but the action picks up so I wasn't dissapointed. One of he best games I've ever played, hands down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis is a  first-person shooter game developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts in 2007.An elite group travels to North Korea to investigate an artifact. While the player faces Korean soldiers and research facilities , an alien ship prepares to emerge and begin the invasion of Earth . Nomad  faces Korean forces and tries to defeat the alien threat . The game submerges us under incredibly detailed rainforests. The physics of the game is excellent . Apart from the story, one enjoys walking around the environment , breaking the palms, catching animals, piloting boats , swimming with fish , and driving around the islands.The graphics engine is the successor to Far Cry . It was a real revolution in real-time graphics . The image quality and texture is still among the best of all time . This makes the game very immersive . It took five years after release to play the game with very high quality settings and get  a reasonable experience. Many people spoke at the time of bad optimization when in fact the game has three times more polygons than his contemporaries , volumetric clouds , day- night phases and huge maps. Nothing compared to the fixed pixelated sky on a Call of Duty game .The player has a special suit that gives different powers or abilities for a period of time, such as invisibility , speed or armor. While it is not a Sandbox, it has  open maps that simulate the world much better than its very linear successor, Crysis 2. In that regard, it is even better than Crysis 3.The game was one of the best action games of 2007 but did not have many sales due to high specifications, hardware requirements and DirectX 10. It has two Secuels . Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 .While Crysis 3 surpasses some of its graphic , 1 remains the best game of the 3 .The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Crysis es un videojuego de disparos en primera persona desarrollado por Crytek y distribuido por Electronic Arts en 2007.Un grupo de elite viaja a Corea del Norte a investigar un artefacto. Mientras que el jugador se enfrenta a soldados coreanos e investiga instalaciones, una nave alienígena se prepara para emerger y comenzar la invasión de la tierra. Jake Nomad deberá enfrentarse a las fuerzas coreanas y alienígneas para intentar derrotarlas. El juego nos lleva por selvas tropicales increiblemente detalladas. La física del juego es excelente. Al margen de la historia uno disfruta de pasear por el entorno, romper las palmeras, agarrar animales, pilotar lanchas, nadar con peces y manejar vehículos por las islas. El motor gráfico es el sucesor del Far Cry. Fue una verdadera revolución en cuanto a gráficos en tiempo real. La calidad de imagen y texturas sigue estando entre las mejores de todos los tiempos. Esto hace al juego muy inmersivo. Recién después de cinco años pudo jugarse el juego con la calidad máxima activada y una experiencia razonable. Mucha gente habló en su momento de mala optimización cuando en realidad el juego tenia tres veces mas polígonos que sus contemporaneos, nubes volumétricas, fases dia - noche y mapas enormes. Nada que ver con el cielo pixelado y fijo de un Call of Duty. El jugador posee un traje especial que le confiere poderes especiales por un lapso de tiempo, como la invisibilidad, la velocidad o armadura. Si bien no es un Sandbox posee mapas que simulan un mundo abierto mucho mejor que su muy lineal sucesor, el Crysis 2.El juego fue uno de los mejores juegos de acción de 2007 aunque no tuvo muchas ventas debido a las altas especificaciones y el requerimiento de DirectX 10 para aprovecharlo al máximo. Posee dos seculas. El Crysis 2 y el Crysis 3. Si bien el Crysis 3 lo supera en algunos de sus aspectos gráficos, el 1 sigue siendo el mejor de los 3. El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I guess I got to this one late. Actually the only reason I bought this was because I got a new PC that actually can play games and, with Crysis having once been ""that game for crazy good gaming PC's,"" I decided to check it out for that reason alone.Even after ~8 years, it's quite a pretty game on max settings. It's also a decent shooter with a giant open world that allows for varied approaches towards completing objectives. But it weakens in the later parts of the game as it becomes more linear and all about fighting off hordes of enemies coming to attack you. Also the ending is kinda abrupt, but I guess they did that so they could cash in on some sequels (and they seem to have done exactly that).So... is it worth getting? I guess. It's not a bad game at all, though I can't see myself playing through it again. Play it for curiosity's sake, then put it away. :o♥♥♥♥ EA.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics in this game are amazing, even when compared to a lot of current-gen games. This was truly ahead of it's time. Of course, there are some minor flaws which are commonly seen in first-person open world games, mainly problems with the enemies being dumb as soup cans even on difficulties above easy. But, in defense, the game was made to be eyecandy and not to be a gameplay masterpiece. Still, the stealth, the weapons, the vehicles, the open world and the missions all make Crysis most certainly worth it's price tag. Also, you're best off getting the maximum edition, because it includes Crysis Warhead, which just adds to the experience. So, despite it's flaws, I give Crysis a solid 9.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is great, but the Steam version comes with ridiculous limitations.First off, there is an activation limit, which from what I know, is not revocable.The Steam version is only the 32-bit version, no 64-bit available.It's buggy at some places and crashes often.Many people report the game not even starting at all, despite me not having this problem on a 64-bit machine. Windows 10 users are especially affected.You can get around the bugs and crashes with community patches, but that is already a minus if you need community-made patches to get the game run correctly on steam.So, please, get the retail version of this game, the steam version is not worth the pain.EDIT: After I have been provided a link to the 64-bit binaries for Crysis, the game has been running stable now. It is not guaranteed that it will work, but it should fix some issues for 64 bit users. This fix is useful if your game is refusing to even run.

												The game may be 9 years old, but the graphics can still compete with many new releases today.Sure there may be some assets that are not wuiet up to todays standards of games that are considered looking great today. For instance the palm trees may be a bit edgier than more modern trees that use tesselation. or some rock textures that aren't quiet as crisp as they could be. Everything else when it comes to graphics still holds up very well to new releases.When it comes to performance the game should runs just fine on maximum graphics, as long as your system has decent hardware. im thinking soething like a gtx660 and some i5 should handle it just fineNow that we got the ""graphics part"" out of the way.Let's get to the actual review:I played this game 9 years ago when it came out and I loved it. The Physics are some of the best I've seen in any game to date. You can destroy entire huts. Without having them collapse in a predetermined way. but instead theyll actually react physicly correct to how you interacted with them.There are 10 Levels in the game. That are all pretty big. So there is no pre-determined way to go like in call of duty. Each of the levels are several square kilometers big that you can actually walk on. And there aren't really any areas that feel empty.The AI is pretty smart for the most part. On the highest difficulty they are pretty hard to beat at times. However they aren't perfect ofcourse either. For instance in the 1st level there is a guy in a toilet. and 8/10 times when he gets alert to you he runs into the wall of the toilet instead of out through the door.The Story is probably the games weakest feature, which doesn't say it's bad. It's just nothing particularly special either. That beeing said, as a little side note: The story in Crysis 2 is actually quiet an improvement over the one in Crysis 1.And now the most important gameplay element: The nanosuit. For me this made it for one super cool, cause you are some super hero kind badass (with a slightly more grounded background lore to how the powers work than most comic book super heroes). And also I think it makes for some very fun options gameplay wise. You have great mobility with speed and strength mode. you can choose to fight as a tank with armor mode (although you still die very quick on delta difficulty so its not crazy overpowered) and you can play very stealthy with the cloak mode (which makes you almost but not completly invisible).All those abilities use the suit's energy, so they can not be used indefinitly.And the best thing is you can switch in between the diffrent suitmodes at any time, so you can adapt your playstyle to the situation at any given time.Last: The Multiplayer:So appereantly the multiplayer doesn't work anymore due to the service it used (gamespy) shutting down. However there may be workarounds to still play online. And the LAN mode still works ofcourse.I personally didn't bother much with the multiplayer in crysis 1. Back when I tried it it seemed alright, but I don't think it lived auiet up to the potential of multiplayer fun there could have been with the nanosuit. crysis 2 was an improvement in that regard in my opinion.So all in all Crysis 1(and I'm mainly referring to the singleplayer here) in my opinion is one of the best shooters ever made. And I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet. (9/10) (10/10 if you choose to ignore the slightly weaker story)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning, contains mild (Edit: heavy) spoilers.Never having played the famous Crysis, I thought I'd finally give it a shot and find out what the fuss is all about. Naturally, since I played this in 2014, my perspective on the game will be very different from the one who played it when it came out. But only an hour into the game, I realized why people call it such a revolutionary shooter for its time. I didn't play with any mods, yet I would've never guessed the game I was playing came out in 2007 judging from what it presented to me. This is due to the following reasons:- The vastness of the world and the graphical fidelity are overwhelmingly impressive for an FPS title this old. You can clearly see that the CryEngine is designed to push the limits on what's possible in terms of looks and scope. I was impressed by how open-world-y the terrain is, yet the missions are unmistakably straightforward... which turns out to be an incredibly fun combination in my opinion. Being dropped on a tropical island where you shoot people in a vast and open area offering multiple ways of approaching your goals is to my mind a great way to design an FPS. The level of detail is stunning to say the least for a 2007 title, I have seen much worse in considerably newer titles.- The gunplay, gun variety and AI are simply great. Shooting enemies feels fun, feels rewarding and feels challenging since the AI actively tries to hunt you down when you for example sneaked away again using cloak. One of the core mechanics, the exosuit and its accompanying suit powers offer great variety for both people who like to be stealthy or those who love to cause mayhem. I found a mix of these to be the most effective and entertaining. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it I think I never experienced as much satisfaction as when I blew up a truck with a rocket launcher while crouching in a bush with cloak engaged. The effects are mindblowing, as are the sound assets, just really immersive overall.- Performance is solid. With CFX 7950/7970 I easily manage 60fps, except for very intense scenes involving lots of explosions and stuff. FoV seems to be exceptionally high, I didn't see a slider for it in the menu, but it's at least 100 by default, which is great. Sadly there's a few bugs involving for example scripted events and cutscenes not triggering correctly when loading from quicksaves amidst a level, nothing game-breaking though. Also, 1920x1080 or higher resolution is not enabled by default, you have to manually adjust it in the config file, which is no big deal though.- The level design is interesting enough. While most levels feature open tropical island terrain with hilly, foresty areas, there's also a sequence where you are in weightless space, floating around inside a gigantic alien structure; very impressive and intriguing overall. The enemy variety is great too: From your usual infantry of all kind to jeeps, tanks, helicopters, boats to rather pesky flying alien crystalline squids with fast-firing energy weapons to a huge♥♥♥♥♥alien motherfugger in the process of sinking a motherfuggin aircraft carrier. It should be noted that you can drive jeeps, tanks, boats and helicopters yourself which is super fun if you like to shoot up stuff in the most classy way imaginable.Negative points? I have one major one, but perhaps it's not really valid since the game clearly doesn't focus on that aspect at all and never pretends to:The story is mindblowingly clichée and superficial: >Technologically augmented super soldier infiltrates fictional island under the control of evil North Koreans, gathers intel, blows up stuff, uncovers archeological project gone overboard, sleeping alien entity that feeds itself off energy awakens, causes major destruction, gruffy American general wants to drop nuke on island to kill off the monstrosity, super-intelligent scientists who always know it better advise against it, alien gets nuked anyway, becomes massively stronger, protagonist has to beat XXL format version of alien monstrosity using lots of missiles and a super secret prototype weapon which had never been field-tested but works like a charm (why wouldn't it?), escapes a sinking aircraft carrier and goes right back into the fight because he's a badass and a superhuman, dutiful soldier-tough-guy who has no fear and throughout the entire game requires no sleep at all. There, that's the plot in a nutshell for you. Not really intentended in the beginning but hey, these are spontaneous and minimally structured reviews after all so w/e. So there you go, awesome FPS, don't play it for the story, play it for the mechanics and the looks. This is how every modern military shooter should be. You can make a very linear, bland narrative without sacrificing diversity and creativity in terms of gameplay and mechanics. Crysis taught us this. No score here, read the damn review if you care for my opinion on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you miss first person action games like GoldenEye, Thief 2, and the original Ghost Recon? If you miss games that simply put you in an environment, gave you some objectives, and let you figure out how to do them without driving you down a rollercoaster, the original Crysis is arguably the last and most technically advanced game of this type to be developed. The visual achievements of the CryEngine have overshadowed the fact that this game, well most of it at least, is a shining example of objective-based game design released just before everyone took shooters in the complete opposite direction.The first level, which is shown off in the demo that’s available at crysisdemo.com as of this writing, is a perfect example of this. In a small bay occupied by a few enemy fortifications along the shore and some motorboat patrols, Crysis gives you two main objectives and an optional objective to tackle in any order. You can work your way along the coastline through the forts, take over a boat to zip around the bay, or whatever, through any combination of stealth and assault tactics.This continues through the next several levels which are sort of a linear chain of small sandboxes: a village you can infiltrate from multiple angles, a group of bases along a river, a harbor, and so-on. The level design in all these areas is quite good, always giving you options and setups for fire fights that never happen the same way twice. This is even true in the game’s more linear sections early on. In the early parts (more on that later), even when Crysis is a corridor it’s still a very wide corridor.I think the best way to describe the core game mechanics would be to call Crysis a simulation based on the original 1987 Predator movie. Your tools are Schwarzenegger-esque explosions and futuristic super powers. The nanosuit let’s you choose between super armor (the default), increased running speed, and a temporary stealth cloak. You’ll probably use the cloak the most but the other powers offer potential for fun combinations and interesting choices. Super strength let’s you jump higher, and you can combine it with speed for running super jumps. When sniping you can choose between staying hidden with the cloak or using strength for a more stable shooting arm.Behind the nanosuit the Crysis boasts a varied sandbox of shooter mechanics. Not only is there the ever-present option of stealth, but you can also lift and throw most objects at enemies and control various vehicles. Most buildings in the game are also dynamically destructible through the physics engine, which feels like it has a tangible effect on gameplay. Crysis even let’s you fit most weapons with a modest variety of attachments with a quick tap of the C key like different sights or a silencer.The reason you might hear a lot of people praise Crysis by saying “the first half” or “the first two thirds” of the game, is because for some reason it turns into a different, much worse game at a specific point later on. The later sections of Crysis are far more linear and introduce gameplay mechanics that while unique, just don’t work that well.  It’s probably best if you stop playing when you start a boss fight with a North Korean general. The most succinct thing I can say is at that point it feels like the level designers ran out of gas.The good parts of Crysis though will still net you at least around 10 hours of gameplay, and that’s just for one run. I consider Crysis to be a pretty replayable game just because you can approach its missions with multiple strategies, but also because each difficulty mode above normal changes things considerably.On normal you can pretty much toy with enemies using the nanosuit. On hard you can still play with them a little bit, but you have to be smart about it. Higher difficulties change a few core mechanics, and the deadlier enemies ensure you have to rethink the way you use the cloak and cover. Hard and Delta mode almost turn Crysis into a straight-up stealth game.Of course what Crysis is most well-known for is the “but can it run Crysis?” joke pertaining to the game’s harsh treatment of processors. Even after six years, Crysis is not an extremely easy game to run. My GTX 760 still only get’s 60 frames per second MOST of the time in 1080p. The consumer experience when you first install the game doesn’t make things easier either.Being from the early days of DirectX 10, Crysis forces it on you by artificially locking the highest graphics features behind DX10 when they are in fact available on DX9 just by editing the ini file or downloading a custom one. DX10 does little more than drag down performance of the already demanding Crysis.If you’re wondering if Crysis still holds up visually after six years, I think with vanilla settings it’s beginning to show its age, but still looks significantly better than most console games released in even the last couple years. Really, only the highest-end recent PC games (Crysis 3, Metro, Battlefield 4), and next-gen-console-only launch games like Killzone Shadow Fall beat it. It can still look impressive with custom ini files and texture packs though.I think it’s kind of a crime Crysis got labled as just “that really pretty PC game nobody can run.” In my opinion it’s one of the most underrated first person shooters of this past console generation (it did come out on consoles eventually after all), if not one of the best. It’s one of the last, if not the last of a breed of shooter that game designers seemingly forgot in the chase after Call of Duty’s popularity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While many reviewers are saying not to purchase it because it does not work in 64-bit systems, there is a way that allows it to work (though it is completely ridiculous that these steps are necessary). This is tested and working in Windows 10 Pro.What I did was to follow two different suggestions found here:Steam Community postand here:Youtube VideoStep 1:Download the Bin64 files from the first link then extract and copy the entire folder into the Crysis program directory.Rename the Bin32 folder found in the same directory to Bin32.BAK. Then rename the Bin64 folder you just copied to Bin32.Step 2:From the second link, download the Crysis.exe file found in the video description. In the newly renamed Bin32 folder (the one that was Bin64), rename the Crysis.exe file to Crysis.BAK. Next, copy the Crysis.exe file you downloaded from the Youtube link into the same Bin32 folder.Step 3:While still in the Bin32 folder, right-click on the Crysis.exe file you just copied and select Properties. In the Compatibility tab, check the box next to ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and then select ""Windows Vista (Service Pack 2)"" from the drop down menu. Click Apply then OK. You're finished!Now the game can be launched from within Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis is a decent length FPS made by Crytek with graphics and gameplay that still hold up to this day. If you're looking to get into the series, the first is often considered the best, so start here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Teal DeerDevelopers: CrytekPublishers: Electronic ArtsInitial release: Nov 2007Genre: FPS#Worth/NotWorth: #SoWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationWhoever said this was a glorified tech demo had their head buried in a hole.Crysis is a truly open world first person shooter. Nothing before nor after (at least at the time of writing this) has matched its prowess of being able to almost literally do anything you can think of to complete a task or objective. You're given an experimental special ops nanosuit. A suit that has the ability to infuse strength, provide protection, increase speed as well as provide a stealth cloak. Limited only by the suits energy levels, these functions can be swapped on the fly. Aside from the suit you have a extremely modifiable weapon not to mention weapon pick ups that are additionally modifiable; from silencers, stocks, sights and auto/semi fire type can be exchanged at a whims notice. As well as vehicles and gun mounts to use, any play-style is immediately within your grasp. There is nothing quite like punching through a wall and blasting the occupants close range with a shotgun with full armor going “H.A.M.” and tanking it. With the dichotomy of attaching a scope, applying strength to steady scope sway and using a silencer to drop enemies from afar and then go in closer using your cloak and take them out with a pistol or however else you may desire. With all of these options at the ready constantly, you are truly only limited by your suits given power at the moment, your imagination and I suppose the edge of the map if you want to be that guy. The StoryIt's not going to win any awards, its certainly a big blockbuster summer movie thriller. But its got that primal visceral gumption to effectively pull at your heart strings and asks you to defend humanity from certain doom and annihilation during an alien invasion. A very, very minor spoiler warning; There are some very well done sequences involving the loss of power and the absence of heat that will really test your resourcefulness of the games mechanics. THE GISTOne of my favorite all time first person shooters that doesn't deserve the negative assertion of it being a tech demo it receive during the time of its initial release. It is far more than that and is still a lot better than some of the more modern shooters I've seen.Follow my curation for more ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												if you're on Windows 7 x64 or higher, just know that this one's a gamble. crysis is an excellent game, but it is loaded with needless/annoying DRM, crashes easily, and doesn't play that well w/ Windows these days. i've often had to tweak/patch older games to get them up and running well, but Crysis has been an unusually stubborn one for me. if you get it working, or are lucky enough not to have issues, be aware that you will still be installing PunkBuster DRM and some outdated bs called Gamespy Console in order to play. (or else spend time figuring out ways to disable and get around them.)if you can get this one running, it's a great game. but getting it running properly can be a major headache.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a notorious benchmark when it first came out. While the graphics are still great, I think it took the attention away from how excellent of an FPS this is. Play this game on the hardest difficulty, as it should be played, and you'll find a game that's extremely different from today's shooters. You'll have to be constantly juggling your abilities every few seconds, you'll need to always stay on the move, and you'll need to be developing strategies on the fly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a long time, I had Crysis down as a graphics demonstration; all the looks & headlines but with no substance. Hardly surprising when all that was talked about was 'Can it Crysis?'.However, I picked it up cheap in 2010 after building a fresh system & wanted to see what it could do.It was only when I found I was riveted to the game did I realise that underneither the headline grabbing garphics, was a game that utterly appealled to me; it's a seriously immersive story that holds on to you for hour after hour.The game play is excellent, switching suit modes is fast & intuitive, the gun upgrades are all worth considering & best of all you can be gung-ho if you want or you can stealth you way around & not really kill anyone & still acheive the mission objectives, the game simply sets you're objective, then lets you crack on with it, rather than forcing you one way or another, a trait that defines utterly iconic games like Deus-Ex.The vehicles handle like boats though, much like Farcry, Crytek's first game & the climax is a little overblown. It's dramatic & exciting, right up until you fight the final 'boss'. However, like Bioshock, the build up is so enjoyable, any final battle is going to feel like an anticlimax.Ultimately, the game ended with me chewing my hands for more, which means that it's succeeded in engrossing me in the world it's creating, which is the one thing I demand. An excellent multiplayer is all well & good, but if a game has a story line, in my mind, it has to stand on that alone or not at all. Crysis doesn't need the graphics or EA's massive marketing department to be a truly noteable game, but it does help make us aware of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

~Maximum Review~This Action-FPS game was released back in November, 2007. But at the time it had some of the best graphics ever for a game of its kind! The main reason behind this was the kickass-German made Crytek engine that used a heavy demand on graphics cards at the time to present lots of new features. Does crytek sound familiar at all? if it does-that is because they also created the first far cry game waay back in 2004!

These kinds of games typically have big expanses of various maps and consists of stealth missions near the start and middle sections but blooms into a beautiful action-set experience with lots of options! (Even some optional quests!). Crysis was no different and delivered a great action game with many new useful features/gameplay mechanics that more than made up for simpified story sequences, crappy nano-suit power (It is the damn future!) and some really dumb AI.Anyway i dont want to list everything this game offers here! instead ill chop it into clean little pieces and serve you....The Pros and Cons.Pros:+SO many awesome small little additions to gameplay that make a big difference! Some of these include: Your PC's battery level shown, lots more graphics and weapon options at the time, Minimap accuracy with coordinates,  enhanced physics and a deadly shark to stop people from leaving the map! A frickin shark!!+I really liked the Abilities FOR the nanosuit, but not the Nanosuit itself (Because of numerous energy reasons that ill describe in Cons below) The Cloak, Speed and Strength are used regularly, and for good reason!+The Story is very strong and warhead fits in very well. The Title really fits the plot! and the ""Futuristic spelling"" helps a little bit too i guess. No Purposeful emotional scenes or anything  like that, its an action game dammit! Shoot Cephs first and ask questions later!.But the story has got some great seperation between the stealth and action sequences! A calm cutscene to recap what big event just occured, followed by a guerilla-style trespass on an enemy base is a great mix! Basicsally what im trying to say is that the Pacing in this game is very well done. +The Vehicles some of which include: A tank, a Vtol jet, a Military jeep and military dinghyhandle very well surprisingly and are easy to control, speaking of that...+The tutorial is hardly a tuturial and just a slow part of the story that just happens to teach you the controls. Which are simple and very easy to change! (Loads of settings means more gameplay styles to suit more people=potential larger audience)+Map is big and cut into sections, but that doesnt really matter as you traverse most of the area with ease. Missions take you to several different locations some of which include: A Dense Tropical Forest, a Launch Site, Dig sites, Tank battleground (Large Clearing with airdrops) and even an Aircraft carrier! Dont classify this as an open world game at all! It is very linear like Basically all FPS shooters. It just has a big map for a few missions then changes it for a smaller, denser one And Repeats often.+Weapons are quite realistic and have noticeable effects with mixed with the nano-suits abilities! Bullpup rifles will have more recoil than the generic AK-47 found often and it will effect your aiming long distance!+The Way the Story transforms into the action packed shooter with various sci-fi elements attatched it amazing! If you asked me at the start of the game how i thought it would end, i would give a very different answer. But this is good! It means that the story will keep you guessing often while it introduces new Things to you.+I couldnt talk about the pros without mentioning the Graphics that it possesses, it is has lots of technical features that i could fill the list with but instead ill give you this  Link[dsogaming.com] Basically with mods it can run at 8k 60fps and all that good stuff. But remember this is extremely specific to most people. Depends if you care enough about it to mod the games really. But without it, it is definetely impressive+Enemies are difficult at times, and can be placed in such environments to even give some peope a fright!+Speaking of Difficulty...Try Delta! it really changes the game and makes you appreciate corners and baricades more than parts of the environment!


Standoff 
A Screenshot of Crysis
By: Jaeger




Cons:-Below-average boss battles, with repetitive strategies to defeat them. Especially at the end!Also i found myself restarting plenty of time because i didnt understand how to beat them clearly!-The AI in this game is quite dumb and found some soliders running into walls, ignoring me throwing grenades and even firing their guns randomly! (Who are they recruiting?).-The games ""maps"" are surprisingly linear as i said above and you are contantly reminded of this if you go slight too far away from the beach, or from a checkpoint, etc.-Nanosuit is so Underpowered. The features are great and well thought out, but due to the double A batteries of the suit most of the abilities run out after about 5-10 seconds! Running is definetely the worst offender, because it is one of the most useful mechanics in the game (And would have made speedrunning quite easy!) it is just sapped away by the energy so quickly! This might not seem too important to some people, but remember if you are in a fire-fight with enemies and you just used a different Ability (eg.Cloak-Mode) your energy will be sapped and if you need to make a inhumanly-quick escape...you can see where this is going.-Most of the Map is just jungle with beach attatched! it gets so boring after a little while and you always look for a car to drive quickly to the next location because you dont want to take a slow walk and ""Enjoy"" whats on offer. Because there really isnt much! although it may look very beautiful and all, it is not dense at all (Full with structures or unique features) much like Just Cause 1, 2 and 3! Although this is a linear shooter at the end of the day, it feels like in some sequences, its trying to awkwardly change that!-Lots of Glitches (Obviously! no game is perfect..) that affect the game's graphics and also a crappy save system which, although being very manual to the player, has a very irritating habit of saving before a big battle. Now what would happen if you arrived early to said battle and were already taking lots of damage? Maybe an explosion happens at the last second? Save System: ""Go Back 30 mins  to the slow-stealth section please!""-Many minor parts of gameplay, controls or even visual effects will obviosuly be beaten by games today. So Ignorant players expecting a Battlefield 4 style Combat system will obviously not recieve it (The Combat/Weapon system and variety develops heavily in the second game!). Not really a Con, more of a ""warning"". But people know what they can expect now cant they!Final Thoughts:I give this game a 9/10! If you even remotely enjoyed Far Cry 1 or even 2, you will love the version with Aliens, futuristic weapons, and various Gameplay Tweaks.Highly Recommended for Anyone who likes FPS games in general, Expansive Areas and Sci-Fi Elements.

												I've played though this game on delta difficulty and I have to say it was a lot of fun the second half of the game is my favorite when you get to drive and polit vechicles. face huge bosses and punch trees. Way to make though on delta is to cloak first take out soliders one at a time not start shooting like on the intro cut scene. I would say try it out on sell you might just like it, oh plus I had to go on youtube to fix the black screen problem this link is the video I used to fix this issue. 


YouTube™ Video: How to run Crysis on 64-bit Windows 

			Views: 147,267		

			Here is a tutorial I wanted to make for a long time because I have inncounterd the same problem. Enjoy! 64-bit Bin download: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71527378/Bin64.zip Mirror download:...		

 once you have are done doing the stuff in the video restart the game though when starting the the EA logo may take a minute but that only happens if you do the fix then start the game if you try playing after already starting the game after trying the first post fix the logo will boot up quickly faster then before it's just something I nonticed. I was using Windows 10 when playing this game and it works though at the last mission sometimes it would crash near the ending cutscene IDK why this was happening I just restarted the last save and finished the game it was no biggie.

""But can it run Crysis?""While most PCs nowadays should be able to run the first Crysis game, it still engrained itself into the collective minds of gamers mainly because of its graphics and even today, 9 years after release, this game still looks great.  Because of its reputation as ""playable graphics benchmark"", I didn't go into this game expecting too much gameplaywise.  Fortunately enough, the game plays outstandingly, featuring open levels which most often allow for multiple approaches to nearly every situation.  The key gameplay mechanic is the so called ""Nanosuit"", which enables the protagonist to move at high speed, become invisible for a short time, gain super human strength or just be able to take more damage, transforming him into a one man army.  Despite these abilities, the player still has to choose his actions with care, for exposing himself to multiple enemies can still mean a quick death.  Due to this, the game remains challenging throughout the course of the adventure.The mission design is rich in diversity: apart from on-foot sections, the player is often able to use enemy trucks and boats to traverse the large playing areas, and may even pilot tanks and a VTOL aircraft over the course of the single player campaign.Unfortunately the game drops off towards its slightly unsatisfying conclusion, as it trades in its sandbox gameplay for more linear level design.Overall Crysis was a very fun experience due to the freedom given to the player and the options given by the Nanosuit.  While the story is by no means groudbreaking, the game is definitely worth picking up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How the hell is this from 2007... I've played it before but a long time ago. Didnt remember the graphics being this epic. Like it actually looks better than some new games. So to me for a 2007 game the graphics get a 10/10. The story is actually pretty good in my opinion not very long. i messed around alot, but you can finish it in 8hrs easily. So i give the story an 8/10. Now the gameplay. Again the game is from 2007 so i thought it was just gonna be a simple shooter but the suit controls are really fun *CLOAK ENGAGED*, you can grab an enemy and throw him into his allies or just run around like sonic for 2 seconds. The idea is great but some powers could've cost less energy but otherwise it's great. So an 8/10. So overall a great game, highly recommend, really fun but not sure about the multiplayer, i haven't tried it.

CrysisBack when this game was first released, I remember how my PC at the time refused to even start it. Once I finally upgraded, I spent quite a few hours playing the demo, but I never ended up purchasing the full game. I noticed it on a Steam sale one day, and decided I'd finally finish the first-person shooter that gave me so many options, even with only one level.GraphicsWhen Crysis was first released, it was groundbreaking. It pushed every graphical limit known at the time, and the result was one of the most detailed and greatest looking first-person shooter games ever created. Post processing was used tastefully, almost every part of the environment is on the same high level of detail, and though some newer games have since left it in the dust, Crysis still holds up nicely, showing up games like Far Cry 3 or Arma 3 Apex thanks to the beautifully crafted levels of the Ling Shan islands. The only faults that Crysis has in the graphical department pertain to two vastly different ends of the spectrum. Terrain detail suffers the closer you get to the map boundaries, and character models - more specifically, face models - could definitely be better. With that said, if you want something nice to look at, Crysis will still give you that.

AudioAudio design in Crysis is similarly high quality on most fronts. Weapons all sound punchy and satisfying, and the environmental effects are fantastic. The soundtrack, while not especially noteworthy, does contain some very nice orchestral tracks, and the game was scored well. The only major flaw with audio design is the voice acting and writing. The writing itself was like something out of a B-movie, and the voice acting quality matched it accordingly. One nice consolation about the voice acting is that all KPA troops will speak Korean on the highest difficulty level.PerformanceWhen this game was first released, it was often criticized for its performance. The question in many people's minds about PC gaming became, ""Can it run Crysis? and often times, the answer would be no. But thankfully, as hardware has evolved, most people will have little trouble running this game now. My system runs Crysis on maximum settings and maintains a nice 60 frames per second at almost all times. There aren't many bugs that I've found, and although I did encounter a handful during my play-through, none of them were game-breaking.GameplayAt first glance, Crysis probably looks like a run-of-the-mill first-person shooter. Taking a deeper look reveals, however, what makes it so unique. The player is equipped with an experimental Nanosuit, a wonderful piece of technology that allows for them to switch into different enhanced modes: Maximum strength, speed, armor, or a cloaking system. This allows for situations to be tackled in almost any way imaginable, with either a focus on stealth and guerrilla tactics or pure shock and awe. There is also an on-the-fly weapon customization system, allowing the player to swap out attachments on every weapon to suit whatever situation they're faced with. This all leads to an immense amount of freedom in both single- and multiplayer environments, and is one of the things that makes Crysis so fun to play.

SingleplayerThe singleplayer campaign of Crysis places the player into the boots of Jake Dunn, a member of the futuristic Delta Force team Raptor, assigned to the Ling Shan islands in the Philippines. Raptor team was sent to locate an archaeologist who was taken hostage by task force of the Korean People's Army, though they soon discover there are far deadlier things at play than just the KPA forces on the ground. Each level is sequential and allows the player to carry over their items from the last, and each one presents the player with one goal or another, typically miles away from where they start. This means that the player is free to reach their objective however they want; some might opt to steal a vehicle and blast through KPA checkpoints, while others might stealthily creep through the jungle undetected. There are eleven levels in the campaign, each taking place in a different part of the islands, and the campaign itself will take most players between eight and twelve hours to complete, depending on the difficulty level and their tactics.MultiplayerThe multiplayer component of Crysis featured two primary gamemodes; Power Struggle and Instant Action. The latter was a run-of-the-mill deathmatch gamemode, made more unique by equipping every player with Nanosuits. The more unique and popular gamemode was Power Struggle, which at first glance resembled Conquest from the Battlefield series. The biggest divergence from Conquest was how a team would win; a specialized 'TAC' heavy tank would have to fire a tactical nuclear warhead at the other team's main base, obliterating it. Larger maps also featured factories in addition to normal objectives, which would produce vehicles over time, rather than simply spawning vehicles when an objective was controlled like in Battlefield. Unfortunately, I describe all of this in the past tense because the multiplayer was run through GameSpy, and Crysis did not receive a multiplayer patch after GameSpy shut down. As a result, there is, to my knowledge, no multiplayer community left in Crysis.

Community ContentCrysis redeems itself for its lackluster multiplayer component here. It features a terrain editor known as Sandbox which allows for the creation of both single- and multiplayer maps, and also supports user modifications. These modifications are unfortunately (mostly) limited to new weapons and vehicles, but you'll still probably be able to get a few more hours out of Crysis thanks to its support for community content.VerdictThe Crysis franchise is a bit of a tragic tale in my mind. The first game was so unique, and yet its developers threw away nearly all of what made it unique in favor of two scripted corridor shooter sequels which are, if you will, ""all looks and no brains."" Crysis certainly isn't a thinking man's game like the Arma series can be, but if you're looking an interesting and entertaining semi-open world first-person shooter and you see Crysis on sale, I would definitely endorse it.I would recommend Crysis, but would suggest waiting for a sale.

												Now, don't let the age or tacky trailers fool you; Crysis, 9 years later, is still a phenomenal game that sent the industry forward. Imagine an FPS that removed most of the stupid cliches of modern FPS games, getting rid of things like ""shotguns are short range"" and ""melee attacks deal 100x damage"". When I first hopped into the game, I expected an FPS I would play for 3~ hours and say ""eh, it was worth 4 dollars"". What I got was a unique experience that left me with a constant desire to replay the game again and again,GAMEPLAY:Playing a tad like Far Cry (The developers started the series, featuring huge environment and gameplay similarities) or modern MGS, it allows you to approach enemies with a variety of ways with an INSANE ammount of ways to approach it. It isn't like Dishonored (Which I also highly reccomend) where every option feels forced and in your face; I can switch to Strength mode and knock down a hut, then use the curved roof as a ramp to launch myself out of danger by charging at it in speed mode. Encounter a 3 man patrol? pick up the strongest of the group, switch to strength mode, snap his neck and then toss him at another soldier, before finishing off the last one with a bullet to the head or a punch strong enough to instantly incapitate him. Base surrounded by trip mines? single individual guards out, toss them over the wall, and walk away as his body slides over the mines. Cornered by 4 men and using a box as cover? Switch to Strength mode, smash the box with the butt of a shotgun, then have the now flying box incapitate them all. Small radio station on a hill? lure the opposition into a frail building then smash the roof, causing the building to collapse and kill everyone inside. Taking the high ground to scout is beneficial, as in one situation I spotted a car 'bout half a mile off speeding down the road, allowing me to take the chance to shoot out its tires from a long distance, causing the speeding vehicle to go spiraling into a ditch, killing the crew inside. While scouting, I spotted an attack boat surverying a cargo loading zone. As the boat went further down shore, I dove to the bottom of the seabed. As the boat made its approach, I switched to speed mode and swam upward at superhuman speed, sending me a good 20~ feet out of the water... and allowing me to toss a grenade stright into the boat. Armored patrol of 5 getting out of a car? Strength mode, jump to one side, kill the two koreans and shoot the gunner atop the car, then punch the car hard enough to send it spiraling into the remaining Koreans. Catch a DISGUSTING COMMUNIST taking a leak (Enemies actually do this) at a river? hold him underwater until he drowns.Needless to say, the game is packed with variety, and even without it, the gunplay, which is phenomenally realistic and enjoyable, would alone make the game worth it.STORY:A bit generic on the outside (Crysis 2 and 3 aren't as good but expanded on the story quite well), Crysis' story is quite good, but certainly not the best feature of the game. SPOILERS AHEAD; Technologically advanced Aliens nicknamed the Ceph are advanced to the point of being able to create anything they can think of; so, they turn their minds to things they cannot think of or predict. They send ""Colonization pods"" to planets that have the potential to host life, with our world being Pod-ed two-million years before Humanity came to exist. In 1912, Richard Hargreave sets out on an expedition with 3 other individuals to Alaska, where there is rumored ""riches"". What he and his crew discover, however, is a massive ammount of Ceph Technology. Hargreave's two colleagues are heavily injured in the operation, and using alien tech, he saves their lives with reported super-human abilities. Hargreave, being a genius, founds Hargreave Science Corp, and begins to use Ceph technology to create weapontry and amass a fortune. Sometime between 1990 and 2200, Hargreave begins to fear a Ceph awakening and allies Hargreave Science Corp. and the child company Crynet Systems (Hence why ""Crysis"" is spelt the way it is) with the United States, giving them acess to Nano-Suit technology.  North Korea discovers and alien colonization pod on the Lang Shian Islands and mobilizes the North Korean People's Army to evacuate the island with the intention of utilizing Alien technology to become most advanced civilization and to defeat the United States. However, their intentions are never fufilled, as two elite Nanosuit teams (Team Raptor, Crysis 1, and Team Eagle, Crysis Warhead) defeat massive ammounts of Korean People Army Forces, and combined with the awakening of the Ceph colonization pod, which the main charecter of Crysis 1, Nomad, enters in an attempt to defeat the Ceph. Realizing his efforts are futile, he attempts to escape the pod, only to be met with a Frozen Wasteland created by the Ceph in an attempt to push out human forces. Nomad, Psycho, and Prophet (Nanosuited Individuals) escape the frozen landscape and rejoin eachother on a U.S Battleship, where Nomad is provided an experimental tactical nuke device, and also where the Captain of the ship fails to realize that Ceph absorb energy, foolishly launching a massive nuclear missle into the massive, frozen dome, causing it to massively expand and to trigger the full force of the Ceph invasion. The Ceph assault the ship, and after defeating a massive alien monster called ""The Hunter"", the ship is attacked by a gigantic alien battleship, witch sinks the ship and is barely defeated by Nomad. This ""Victory"" is only a small one in a massive war, with more to come in Crysis 2 and 3 (Honestly, just read about the lore. The games are pretty bad and ruined any chance of the series being any good once more)I hope you've enjoyed my lengthy review. Crysis is easily one of my favorite games of all time, if not THE favorite (Next to New Vegas <3). I'm sure you'll enjoy the game, here are some mods I reccomend;Blackfire's Mod Ultimate OR CyberAlien's Extreme Immersive modAdvanced AIRealistic EnhancementRygels HD Texture pack AND HD Crysis Texture Pack 2016Maximum ImmersionCrysis 2 Nanosuit Voice (Crysis 2 did a lot of things wrong but the suit was awesome)Enjoy the game!nominate for farm or test of time award			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												CryEngine 2 in all beauty.The card of Crysis is the tremendous graphics. The most powerful cursor of CryEngine 2 supports all delights of the tenth DirectX version, the entire happiness will require the powerful computer with Windows Vista. Bewitching landscapes in Crysis shake by the beauty. The impassable jungle and sandy beaches, the leaves moving from the slightest breeze, and extremely realistic waves – the magnificent picture bewitches and tempts. Fantastic specification, accurate textures, the soft shadows tremendous special effects – you won't list all advantages. Animation and physics in Crysis shows the highest level of interactivity – completely destroyed environment, realistic effects from shots and explosions, plausible movements of human ph.Achievements of nanotechnologiesThe nanosuit capable to increase force and speed of the owner, to make it invisible and bulletproof became the most interesting innovation of Crysis. It is necessary to pay for all these ""lotions"" with energy which, however, is quickly restored. All listed abilities are realized by means of modes: maximum strength (powerful force), maximum speed (allows to fade fast), maximum armor (simply armor) and an invisibility mode (on all fours through the enemy jungle).Also It should be noted possibility of modernization of the weapon: it is possible to fasten a sniper sight, the laser index, the muffler, etc. For the rest the gameplay of Crysis doesn't differ from Far Cry.

												I never really cared for games that were based on alien warfare, until I decided to try this one.  I had played AA games like Halo and could never really keep focused on them, I'm not sure why.  This is an exception in my book, it's fantastic.  The game is older, but still looks incredible.  There's a mix of humans and aliens, humans in the former, and aliens in the latter part of the game; and there are some awesome fights.  Everything about this game is exhilarating.  The combat, the enemies, the skills you have to choose to survive.  It's just great.  Go ahead, buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, an absolute classic. This is a game that pushed forward serious PC gaming. Nine years old, and the visuals still outclass anything playable on a console. The campaign is a bit short, but for the most part it is a great ride. It can take some time to get used to the suit controls, but once you do the game feels much more flexible and dynamic.Oh, and the multiplayer is still pretty sweet.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis was a very good game and the first in a great series developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts in 2007. Crysis is a science-fiction first person shooter. You, the player, play as Nomad, an exceptional and strong-willed character determined to fight to survive. The game is primarily set on a North-Korean controlled island where they are attempting to uncover the mystery of a potential grand discovery. Nomad and his nano-suited military team mates and the United States army intervene, however the reveal of a greater power, named the Ceph, strongly influences and alters the story.This campaign is excellent. The campaign is a great example of a story that starts slow, but builds to a climax. The setting of being on one island suggests a limited campaign, however, the great areas of on the island and in the island create a nice variety of missions. I adore the fluidity and transition between missions within the campaign. For instance, you complete a mission and run to the extraction point - instead of the game taking you to a loading screen, it immediately starts the next mission, which is a massive positive. The only issue I encountered with the campaign is the mild relevance of the side missions. Nomad would have to gain intel from a North Korean camp, and while it adds some further dialogue in the story, it is not substantial. Also, it is really a standalone player game as your squad-members do not assist you in missions and are very useless.Gameplay is your standard first person shooter gameplay, The gameplay is fluid and solid. There is nothing more to elaborate on regarding shooting and cover. Driving is a nice feature but clunky as the vehicle is very sensitive to player controls. The issues I encountered within the gameplay section is the lack of ammo for an American gun and the very small variety of overall guns in the game. I had to rely on a North Korean assault rifle because there was no ammo to be found for my American Scar. There are some minor bugs such as the red dot on a red dot sight not appearing and the insane amount of bullets required to kill an armoured North Korean enemy. To kill an enemy would regularly take 75% of a magazine. To kill an Alien would take a larger amount of ammo, which is understandable as they are strong aliens, but for humans, that is very odd. The main disturbance regarding gameplay is the sheer stupidty of AI. Some enemies would run in circles while ally team mates would be useless in completing objectives, as stated prior.The graphics are incredible for a game developed in 2007. Crytek is known as a high-quality graphical company and they really emphasised that in Crysis. While the recommended settings were a Nvidia GT 8800, I could not play at ultra settings, even with my graphics card, which is odd as I had to play on very high settings with V Sync and Anti Aliasing turned off.Overall, this game is a good game. I only played the campaign and I can safely say I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I played this game in around eight hours. It's a solid length of a game. I recommend the game at the Steam price of $19.99. Furthermore, I would strongly suggest buying the Maximum Edition that includes Crysis, Crysis: Warhead, and Crysis II.

												This review is for the game ''Crysis'',a first-person shooter video game,developed by the video game company Crytek.The game was published by Electronic Arts and released in November 13 on 2007(in North America) for Microsoft Windows.The game uses the CryEngine 2 and was later upgraded to CryEngine 3(not for Microsoft Windows though).PlotYou are Nomad,a delta force soldier,who with the use of his military nanosuit's capabilities (Maximum Strength,Maximum Speed,Maxim Armor and Cloak) his weapons,vehicles and with his other military friends and along the way acquaintances has to engage enemies(firstly Koreans then bloodthirst aliens) in order to save the world from the possible alien domination.Gameplay:The player can  encounter enemies in a variety of ways.You can use short ranged weapons or ranged rifles,use stealth and surprise your enemies by attacking them from behind(either killing them swiftly or tranquilizing them) or just aggressivly kill whatever moves by spraying bullets all over their bodies.Game includes a high variety of weapons such as:pistols,assault rifles,sub-machine guns,missile launchers,gauss rifles,shotguns,miniguns,the TAC gun and the MOAC all of which can be customized through several attachments like the sniper scope,the iron sight scope etc.In addition you can usemany vehicles like hovercrafts,jeeps,acp,vtol etcMultiplayer: Even if this game is 7 years old you'll be surprise to see how many people still play crysis 1RecapThis game is a must buy.Incredible graphics(remember the phrase ""Yeah, but can it run Crysis?""),Simple yet enjoyable story-some would say Cliché but not me(Bad Koreans have found an energy resource and they want to use it but everything goes to hell and aliens swarms the island BUT a brave American saves the day with his raw masculinity,risks his life and saves the day alongside his trusted companions.),Challenging gameplay,Atmospheric gameplay and many many other characteristics that make this game a piece of fine art.Only thing i find as a con is the customization which i found limited.Can easily compete with modern 2014 games in many ways and win.Thank you Crytek Developers for this wonderful game.P.S I didn't refer much on the Plot section because i didn't want to spoil the game to you.Buy it and play it thoroughly.You can thank me later.

That said, that doesn't change how frustrated I was when it wouldn't work, it shouldn't be sold at all, without some kind of fix or warning.

												A revolutionary game in its time graphically. I was impressed 10 years later. It was hard to recommend this game, however, because of the issues with glitches and errors. My game crashed several times and the final portion of the main mission, though graphically demanding, I had to use console commands just to finish after several attempts (due to crashing and rendering issues).That being said, there are many great guides on here to help those through issues like that, and I would recommend you play this game for about a $10 price tag.

												Pros: • Graphics are amazing, amazing how they hold up even till this day.• Love the challange of trying to preserve ammo and switching up guns when needed to.• Love how semi-open world the game is and how you can go about completing the objectives in different ways, like going all out or just going about it in full stealth.Cons: • The Story was just terrible in my opinion. I just hated how most of the story mostly depended on Nomad and how he had to do EVERYTHING mostly.• The NPCs in this game is just abysmal. How in the world could the NPCs cross map kill you with a highly inaccurate mounted mechine gun? That just doesn't make sense to me, and it kill the fun for me.• The energy wasn't enough to do much to survive off of. I found myself stopping in mid combat a lot just to recharge my energy for my maximum ablites.Over all: At first I wasn't going to reconmmend this game to anyone. After I got done with the game, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, and I felt unsatisfied. However, as I was going through the pros and cons, all of that just changed. The game is 'ight'. It's a classic to say the least. The game was released back in 07 where games back then were different than they are today. I guess the cons of the game were compared off of games of today, where they're just too easy nowadays. Crysis is NOT an easy game. I played most of the game on easy mode because of how difficult the game was at times. So don't come at this game thinking it will be a cake walk. I've purched the entire series so I do plan on playing more. Let's just hope those games are better than this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis is one of the best looking FPS games out there which features realistic looking jungles with awesome action. What makes this FPS different than others is that you are powered with a nano-suit which lets you choose different powers (speed, strength, shield or cloak) at a time which allows the player to play the game however they choose - either be stealthy, run and gun, or just tank the bullets. There are a handful of different guns to use and each can be customized a limited amount. The story is decent and somewhat unique as the setting takes place on an island that the North Koreans forces have occupied which you are sent to investigate a lost team trying to see what they have uncovered. The campaign runs around 6 - 8 hours which makes an all around fun experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was so ahead of its time; it released in 2007 and was way past so many other games in what it had to offer the player. Anyways, here are the few things that made Crysis stand out to me:  Non-linear routed gameplay. You are given an objective to complete but that's it; it is up to you to determine how you get to the objective's location and what you do to accomplish the objective.  A good story. The story of Crysis is pretty orignal for a shooter and it is very interesting.  Killer graphics. Crysis had killer graphics for 2007. Most people know of Crysis purely because of the Cry-engine and the impressive graphics it is able to render.  Great gameplay. You're a supersoldier and your abilities are not only fun to use but make you actually feel like a supersoldier. In addition, the gun attachment system is great, allowing you to change how you want to use your weapon at will.That's about it for me. Crysis was not only a fantastic shooter, but also just a great game. In my mind, this game is essential to every gamer's library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis is an excellent game and is very original. The most talked aspect about the game is possibly the graphics which by today are pretty, but back then they where so intense that it was almost unplayable on very high at 60fps (not including dual titans) The gameplay is supreme as in the game is so open to random events that its can be quite diffrent from the last time you played it. You have a extremly straightforward objectives with many ways of tackling it, you could use stealth, straight action, or tactics. The invronment is so interactive that you could find so many things to do and get distracted from the main objective along with the interesting abilities, such as maximum speed,armor,strength and a cloak. The ai however is sort of dull at times and even made the hardest difficulty easy in which you could just alert some bad guys cloak infront of them and kill them all.I would give this game a score of 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Originally posted on January 21, 2010 Crysis is an absolutely incredible experience that defines why PC gaming is great. It's an open world shooter with graphics that are 2.5 years old and are still by far the most impressive offering on the market. It's gameplay is a varied hybrid of stealth and action in the proud tradition of Far Cry one, and although there are a few problems with the game, it is one you should not miss if you own a PC.Gameplay-As in it's spiritual successor, Far Cry, Crysis is a game that centers around island/tropics based combat in an open world with lots of vehicles and baddies with great AI that can use vehicles, flank, retreat, give orders, and call in unscripted backup. You hit multiple objectives using stealth or assault tactics and a wide variety of weapons.This much has not changed very much from Far Cry, and I see no problem with that. The AI very much Far Cry 1.5 AI, which is impressive considering Far Cry AI still tops many games on the market. Enemy vehicles still chase you relentlessly once you are discovered, and harder levels can be particularly brutal. You are not usually accompanied by many friendlies in a helpful manner, but there are certain fixed engagements where you encounter friendly AI, and they get the job done decently. It remains a lone-wolf experience for the majority of the game.The most major change comes in the form of the nano-suit, which allows speed, jumping/punching, and armor to rise to greater levels at the expense of energy, and the suit includes a cloaking device. This simple mechanic allows for a huge amount of fun to be had, especially in jungle infantry combat and in enemy camps.Another change would be the addition of on the fly weapon customization, a brilliant addition, and the ability to pick up attachments as you progress through the game. I will say that as gamers we do not always stop to examine the model of each weapon lying on the ground or even in an armory and as a result miss out on early instances of great attachments, such as the sniper scope. Could the auto-ammo-pick-up system from warhead be included in the next installment with a feature that picks up attachments you don't have as well? That would be wonderful. Also, the ability to suppress certain weapons would be welcome and not altogether unbalanced or ""unrealistic"". I could envision the shotgun and sniper rifle being suppressed but with a louder sound signature and working in game just fine.I will say the alien gameplay is a little less fun, as it was with mutants in far cry, and though the story remains interesting, the enemies are somewhat less interesting to fight (warhead partially helps with this) due to less intelligent tactics and repetitive attacks. Also, the introduction of Aliens generally is accompanied by more linear missions, which is not where this type of game shines. Far Cry had the same problem.Story- However, far cry also had a terrible story, with about as much cheese as anyone can handle. Crysis' story actually is quite decent, and they really take advantage of some cool cinematic techniques to tell it. The plot certainly makes more sense than Avatar's, and the pacing is better too. And what Avatar's technical visuals are for movies, Crysis' are for games.Visuals- Crysis is currently(Jan. 2010) the best looking game on the market for any gaming platform, and will most likely continue to stay there until Crysis 2. This has been the situation since Crysis was released in 2007! This gap is of course due largely to the economic impact of console markets and in turn the technical limitations of consoles, and Crysis really demonstrates this gap. The last great PC exclusive graphics engine, in all honesty. Not to mention that after patching and drivers it is quite well optimized, and though I must admit I have a 4870, it runs well on much worse hardware. The Character models and lighting effects are standouts in the visuals category, accompanied by the water and foliage effects. The alien ship also looks astounding.Also, the music is cinematic and the battle theme is really quite exceptional.All in all, Crysis is a graphics juggernaut that nothing on the market can really touch, and incredible shooter and gaming experience, and not a half bad-cinematic experience either (certainly better than any big-budget Michael Bay style film I've ever seen). This comes together in one amazing package that meets all expectations as far as I'm concerned, even if it could have improved in a few areas.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a major step up this game was from the original far cry. A lot of people give this game sh*t for just being a tech demo but i do genuinely believe that this is a good game behind the sh*tty optimisation and being a pain in the asss to get it running on windows 64 bit. This game has a lot of awesome and memorable sequences and most of them  were not scripted at all its all because of the way i played the game so you're enjoyment level is very subjective by how you play it. I don't remember the game being this short though, only 7 hours i thought it was much longer and i didn't feel like i rushed through the game at all. A big complaint about the game is the aliens in the second half. The zero gravity mission is awful ill say that but actually fighting the aliens was alot of fun for me, i really like the shooting and the cloaking. I don't understand the hate, the game would have been boring if you were fighting koreans throughout the whole thing. If you don't mind spending some time to get the game working on windows 64 then go ahead and play it.7/10 (Good)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember Crysis being known as the benchmark for graphics and processing when it originally came out back in 2007. I heard the console versions never did the game justice either. This year I was playing it for the first time and even now it's a remarkably beautiful game. The southeast Asia setting is  vibrant and complex, and the countless explosions is endless entertainment. However, for the most part the game plays out much like any other military styled FPS you've seen before but with suit modifications at your disposal; Speed, Strength, Cloak are enhanced at the cost of your armor. Nothing crazy. The Sci-Fi twist in the story is what makes this stand out amongst the other carbon copy shooter's and having no interest in the multiplayer I don't see much replay value. I recommend this game only when it's on sale for $5. Graphics10/10Controls7/10Gameplay7/10Replay Value0/10Overall7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Disclaimer This review is aimed at the single player portion of the game. Detail I first played this game back in 2007. It was the talk of the town, all because of it's advanced CryEngine I was so impressed that my Pentium Dual Core processor, 4GB RAM and my trusty Radeon 2600XT could run this on medium. I simply watched in awe of the images which were rendered before me. Since then I always used this as one of my go to benchmark games and tools - upgraded to an Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 and NVIDIA 9800 GT and later to my previous rig: i7 870, 8GB RAM, and Radeon 5870. I could finally play this game smoothly on ultra at 1920 x 1080. It looked stunning.But, apart from the graphics department, how good is this game really?The plot is a mixed bag. It's no different from your typical action movie, but not bad either. I really didn't care about any of the characters, except for Psycho and prophet. Nomad (controlled by the player) has a stale personality, almost robot-like and emotionless, focussing only on the mission at hand. Crytek tried a few times to give the idea of emotion, but ultimately it still felt shallow.The game mechanics are very fluent. Movement and gunplay feels natural and faced paced – exactly what you want in a shooter. The Nano suit was a great new innovative idea, breathing new life into the generic state shooters usually are.The campaign maps are huge. The environments are unique, varying from lush jungles to dirt filled excavation sites.One major issue for me was optimization. Bear in mind that there came a point in time where Crysis reached it's limitation at fully utilization modern hardware. It was unable to fully utilise both my CPU and GPU – the CPU cores sometimes only being used between 20% and 40%. The GPU had similar results. There were a few scenes which the frames dropped below 60fps toward 20 to 30 fps, although it kept to 60 fps 95% of the time. This is an older game which was released when Core 2 Duo CPU’s were the gaming standard and the 9800 GTX was the cream of the crop. To expect that it should fully utilise modern hardware is ridiculous, but something to take note of. Verdict  The good  Beautiful graphics and environments. Huge open ended maps. Good game mechanics. The bad  Boring, unimaginative and forgettable characters. Unoptimized for modern hardware. Occasional frame drops.Overall, it’s a great game which I highly recommend. All PC gamers should pick this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fans of the genre won't be able to avoid drawing comparisons to Halo, but if one steps back and enjoys the game for what it is and for the benchmarks it established, it's hard not to be impressed.Try it.

												Beautiful game and the most astonishing PC graphics I have seen on a game. It only took eight years and a $5k gaming PC to run it beautifully on Ultra settings @ 2K resolution. This is with a single GTX 980 Ti (min. was 41 FPS).I must admit I enjoyed the story line and how single player is long enough to make it interesting without becoming boring. Normal difficulty was just perfect. I have to say, I am extremely pleased  with the Crytek 2 engine after so many years. 10/10 !Moving to Crysis Warhead now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finally got around to playing this game, hesitant, thinking it was going to slow down my system but my computer ran it like nothing! The graphics in this game are awesome and the gameplay was a totally new experience for me. Having the power to go invisible, have super speed, armor, or super strength at your whim while running around like a gun-toting super-agent doesn't get any better. I was disappointed at how short of a game it was as I beat it in a number of hours but it is a game that is going to stick with me for a long time. I definitely recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahh Crysis, what a gem it is.If I look back to the early 2008 this was nearly a bomb for me; always wanted to play it, playing through and again, again, again.It holds itself up, after so many years, still looking good and still it is great fun. Mostly because of its Sandbox-like Gameplay. Fast first person shooter, or silent stealth game, or BOTH! Improvise or use tactic methods; weapon mods or the abillities of your armor. Get a vehicle, fill it with explosives and drive it into an enemy outpost, no problem. Throw your surrounding objects, like crates, barrels, refrigerators, chickens, at your enemies or destroy little houses. You can play as you like and the game doesn't punish you for it.I, for my part, didn't like they stealth gameplay though, it's quite hard if you really want to sneak through without an alarm going off. I like it more as an action game where most effort was put in.Besides your ""one man- army"" missions, you can take a seat in a tank battle, a helicopter escort mission or survive in an arctic world, fighting from fire to fire to keep yourself warm.It is great in every aspect of a game, not superior to most games today has to offer, but still...And a short word to the multiplayer:Although the GameSpy servers were shut down, it's still possible to play the multiplayer via a Mod created from the community.ConclusionRating: Very Good -> After all a wonderful shooter, varied, good-looking and just fun to play. Get this pearl, the price is just fair!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember the first time I played this game. Was it 9 years ago? Man, I can't believe it's been 9 years already! When I heard about this game I was like this must be the greatest game ever and yes, it is. It has GREAT graphics for 2007. Way too ahead of its year. I can compare it with 2016's graphics. Story is interesting, too. Gameplay is unique. They say Steam version has some problems like crashing in every 5 minutes but I played it without problems to be honest. My OS is Win 8.1 Pro maybe that's why because the ones who had problem with this game were using Win 7 64 bit I think. So, if you're using Win 8.1, don't even think one more second and buy this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll get to the point here:Crysis sets a standard in graphics fidelity up to this day thats' still unmatched by some current-gen games.The story is not exactly top-notch (Sci-Fi, nanosuits and aliens, of course) but it does create a sandbox game worth playing whose length is perfect: Not so long and repetitive you'll begin cursing (Some CoDs out there) or so short you'll go WTF (Battlefield 3, anyone?).In its' own right, this game has set a precedence of what we gamers expect when it comes to futuristic and forward game development. Up to date, this game still requires a PC with considerable power, a testament to its' developers' forward thinking as of its' time.Overall personal rating: 8/10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first part of this game on the highest difficulty is simply perfection. You are an elite Spec Ops warrior having to regroup with your team on a tropical island amid a heavy North Korean military presence. You have to use precise stealth and stalking  tactics to stay alive and take down soldiers. Yes you have a nano-suit but it will not keep you alive in a fire-fight against a platoon of enemies. The story is tense and builds up nicely to a confrontation between North Korean and American troops. And the visuals are still, 10 years later, maybe the best ever created if you have the hardware. Then... suddenly it becomes an aliens game and it loses alot of its edge towards the end, before a thrilling final fight. 9.5/10 Still a legendary FPS and better than the uninspiring sequels.

												Crysis easily ranks up there with the most exciting games I have ever played. And it has aged well. I just reinstalled it on a new Windows 10 64bit system and it is running fine for me, even when I crank the graphics up to very high settings. It looks magnificent, and when playing Delta difficulty it is dangerous as hell and calls for maximum stealth, well-timed aggression, and precision shooting. Other games like Far Cry 3, F.E.A.R. and Half Life 2, all favorites of mine when they were fresh, don't match the sheer exhilaration of putting your Nanosuit to work in this game and dealing damage to hardcore enemies and aliens while watching the environment destruct around you. Definitely worth playing when it first came out--even more so now when modern systems have caught up to the demands Crysis makes on GPUs and video cards.Epic story! Great gameplay! Terrific graphics!

												If you , like me, were here to see if your latest PC could run Crysis maxed out and still hold a decent frame rate... I have bad news for you. It can't. But, do not dispair... After all these years I can look back, wisened in my old age, and realise that Crysis was never going to run well. The developers were using so many new, unrefined graphics techniques that the game by its very nature is not capable of running at a steady 60FPS, with all the graphics turned up to very high. And it never will be capable of holding a steady 60FPS. Guys, Crysis just runs badly. I'm afraid that's the hard truth we all have to swallow....Quick tip; if you find the frames chugging, just turn off, or turn down, the very bizarre motion blur effect. It murders the FPS, and really doesn't look especially good. Strange, no matter how fast I whip my head around I just can't seem to make the world blur like that....  But now that we've got that out of the way, does the game still hold up after all these years? Does it still look good, and is it still a good game? Good news; yes.Upon first starting Crysis my jaw landed somewhere between my nipples. It really is incredibly difficult to believe this game is nearly ten years old. And, it's equally mind blowing to realise just how much the Xbox360 and PS3 held back graphics advancements, considering where they were prior to console restrictions. In some areas of Crysis the foliage and lighting effects are still mind blowingly good, even by modern standards. Sure, the rock textures are vomit inducing, and the tree trunks look like the rear end of a horse, but the overall foliage detail is still extremely impressive. I just never get tired of shooting through foliage and seeing the physics effects.Gameplay wise I can only say this; ""Oh, yeah. So this is what games were like before the CoD generation.""You can lean! And go prone! You can change the fire mode of your gun! You can throw chickens at enemies! (Here's a challenge for you; see how far you can get in the game by murdering people only with thrown wildlife.)The enemies in Crysis really don't ♥♥♥♥♥ foot around, especially on harder difficulty settings. And frankly, I love it. Once they've spotted you they will murder your♥♥♥♥♥ Its genuinely challenging, and the nano suit is actually REQUIRED, or you will get your brains handed to you in five seconds flat. I haven't played a game that offers such wide open spaces, with such a feeling of freedom and realism, in a very long time. Crysis 3 is equally as challenging, as I recall, but just doesn't deliver the same feeling of space that Crysis 1 does. Crysis 1 feels like a real island, and although some may say the space is wasted, I say it does exactly what it's meant to; make you feel like you're in a real world situation.  In conclusion; Crysis is still pretty impressive as far as graphics go, but the real surprise for me was to realise just how good a game it still is. I strongly suggest giving it a go again, especially if you're an 80's baby like myself. Take a dip back into the good old days of first person shooters, folks, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

												Crysis 1 could have been a masterpiece at its time, yet it ended up being merely an unpolished one. Still, this game should be played by FPS fans at least once since the first half of the game is pretty good.+ It looked well in 2007 and it's still very good looking+ Great first half of the game+ A lot of open world missions. How do you want to proceed with your mission is totally up to you. You can just shoot them all, use your stealth cloak or often simply avoid all enemies.+ This series has some of the best soundtracks.+ A lot of weapons to choose from. Also, you can modify them if you want to.- Optimization is bad and it was that way even upon release. Some players might find the game impossible to run on very high settings despite having a modern pc.- The second half of the game felt a bit weak in comparison.- This game is quite inbalanced at times. Some parts are rather easy while others will have you killed by hordes of bullet sponge enemies. - One specific alien mission was rather long and boring. I got lost and was more confused than entertained. - Note that there is a bug in the second last mission where you have to fly to a carrier that will lead to a CTD. Quicksaving at the very same moment when a soldier called Psycho muttered his last sentence before quickloading let me continue playing the game and solved this bug for me.It somehow felt like playing an independence day game. I recommend buying the crysis collection if it's on sale. If you like FPS, Crysis 1 is certainly worth checking out.Replay value: AverageRating: 8/10Recommendation: Yes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best Crysis game. Its successors don't measure up. When I first played the demo of this game (I downloaded it the moment it was released!) it absolutely blew my mind. You begin the first level in the dark and at one point you're on a hill and you see the sun rise as you look out over a tropical bay. This was the exact point that made my jaw drop. The graphics may not look as gorgeous today as they did then but they're still phenominal. The gameplay is also fun as hell. Sneaking around and messing with the Korean soldiers in stealth mode is hilarious and very tense at times. Recommended x a million.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Died by a crate while having full health on maximum difficulty.11/10Serious review:This game is in my opinion, a gem, it's really great, the physics are funny and great for a game of that time, you kill Koreans (North Korea) and Cephalopods (aliens) in a power suit called the Nanosuit, you can use speed, strenght, stealth to kill your foes.This game doesn't really have any flaws except some glitchs that can be funny though, I've never played any difficulty but the highest one and In my opinion, the energy gets away too quick, I don't know if it is the same for the lower difficulties but it's kind of annoying, If it is because of the difficulty, I'd prefer more enemies that play smarter to that.But you can always modify it with some tweaks, I personally don't do that but if you want, you can.I'd wish this game was open world though with freeroam.This is a real great game that I would suggest to any FPS, Aliens, North Korea and futuristic (2020) fans.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis was a game that changed PC gaming in significant ways.  Release in 2007 the game is still fun, relevant, and beatiful all the years later (2014).  ** GRAPHICS **I just now have a computer that can run it with everything turned to max settings (1080p) and it is as good looking as most games being released now.  Many people say it requires a beefy machine because it is poorly optimized but I argue that even if that is the case, it still looks great!  The engine this game was built on has gone on to provide great graphics in many other games as well.** GAME PLAY **Crysis added a fun element to the game with temporary ""super powers"".  Managing your super human suit abilities allowed a variety of game play not traditionally found in the FPS genre at the time of its release.  The game is good.  Its fun to play and to look at.** Summary **If you don't have it yet it is absolutely worth picking up at its bargain price.  It is a great FPS to sit down and play for a short stint or marathon with.  I highly recommend it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game the set the benchmark for PC Gaming. I remember when the question was ""But can your rig run Crysis at max settings?"". For a game that came out in 2007, it's a masterpeice. The CryEngine that the game runs on is something of another world. But enough about the visual aspect of the game. Overall, Crysis is a very solid FPS. Awesome game mechanics and unique playstyles. The choice to quietly eliminate the enemy patrol or go in guns blazing. The only category where that game falls short is the storyline. It wasn't bad not by any means, but I just wish that it had been a little more story driven. Anyway, if you want a beautiful looking game with some great gameplay, I recomend Crysis. If ou like it, pick up 2 and 3 as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I only got round to playing Crysis in 2015, although I've been meaning to for years!From what I'd seen, I was under the impression that you'd play a kind of semi-indestructable super soldier in this game, dashing and jumping around at high speed and slicing through dozens of enemy soldiers with ease, but really it plays more like you're just a fairly standard FPS soldier dude with a few perks. I found myself not bothering with things like the stealth and speed mode very often as they both drain your energy incredibly quickly. On hard difficulty, a few well-placed enemy bullets can still take you down if you're not careful so you don't really feel invulnerable.The gameplay is fairly standard FPS fare, akin to Call Of Duty or whatever, with open-ish world elements but lots of set pieces. The game world never feels as open as, say, the Far Cry series and you are pretty much railroaded into tackling things in order, though how you approach each set piece is up to you and you do feel that you can take a variety of approaches to solve the obstacles you encounter.The graphics have really stood the test of time, It didn't feel particularly dated.My only gripe was that the campaign only took me 10 hours to play through - and I didn't exactly rush through it. If I'm honest, the storyline is also very standard and unengaging, following a rather cliched 'US saves the world from alien invasion that is unwittingly aided by the nasty Asians' formula that's all too familiar by now.Overall, I'd say that if you're a fan of the FPS genre, you've never played Crysis before and you see if on sale for a few pounds/dollars (like I did) then it's definitely worth picking up! It's an enjoyable, if short, experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics are the most substantial part of this game. Anything else, you can consider it broken.Enemies become virtually omnipotent whenever they're on a mounted gun, with an unlimited spotting distance. Helicopters don't even need to see you to know where to fire their one-hit-kill missiles. One wrong step on a piece of debris can instantly end you. The AI can easily break in multiple ways, making them either completely vegetative or nearly unstoppable. Weapons can glitch out and disappear at any time.In fact, there is so much wrong with this game that not even the good bugs, the entertaining ones, can make up for it. This is a sign of pure incompetence, a failure to grasp multiple important concepts of game design. You don't need to look bad to play bad. You can scuplt a Michelangelo piece out of faeces, but what do you still have?Crysis. That's what. Don't waste your time unless you're just out to prove your PC's power.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1st 2/3 of the game was fun. Open world, you chose how to fight. Lush, living world that is inviting you to explore it. I really did like this part of the game as it was very engaging. Graphics still look pretty awesome despite the fact the game was released so long ago. Combat system felt very fluid as you can use anything as a weapon basically -  You can use enemy soldiers as bowling balls, drown them, toss them off a cliff, club them, get into a fist fight, hit them with trucks or boats and more.The world itself is very interactive as you can pick up and throw chickens, local wildlife, rock, branches, pots, fruits, barrels and much more to slam the enemy with. Entire trees will topple over in heavy gun / grenade fire. Soft targets such as huts can be completly destroyed by gunfire / grenades, ramming, or tossing enemy soldiers though the walls.Desite all the good this game has to offer, I do have a couple gripes though that really detracted from my overall experience.1 - Enemies shrug of rediculous amount of damage. I can shoot a guy in the knee - He still manages to sprint as if nothing happened. I can shoot a guy in the head...oh wait he's wearing a basebal cap that allows him to tank 3-4 hits from an assault rifle. What? Enemies really should be more responsive to damage, especially when shot in unprotected areas....like the face...or the balls. Not moving at either 100% or dead.2 - Enemies movement can be unrealisicaly rediculous. Dancing side to side  in the open to dodge bullets, tanking and strafing. I'm not a fan of this in any shooter. With a game that looks as realistic as crysis, I expected different.3 - The last 1/3 of the game - Punishment. What happened? This here was the real turnoff for me - The game turned into a generic, boring rail shooter with extremely, useless, needy, comrade AI that curses you out left and right for not moving fast enough. Your character turns into a yes man that just runs around, taking orders from everyone to do every single thing. Story also falls apart and generally by this point in the campain I really found it increasingly difficult to care...I just wanted it to end as it just got so boring. The alien AI requires no tactics to fight as their combat manuvers are pretty much limited to strafing you from range, or charge in and slash you. With the earlier part of the game playing so well, I'm not sure why they would go this route - by the end the game is nothing like how it started, it feels very cramped and controlled. TLDR - The 1st 2/3's of the game is fun and well done. The Last acts, not worth my time - The game devolved into a heavily scripted, cramped railshooter. At the end....I'm kind of neutral on this one. Now if only we had a button that wasn't thumbs up or thumbs down....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much along the lines of Half-life with graphics that were way ahead of it's time, even today it demands a powerful card to run it at it's best.  Interaction with the real world is unparalleled. The initial opening of the game is really excellent. With the ability to wander all over the place, the gave feels very open, but unfortunately as it progresses it feels more and more scripted and linear. This is also reflected in the load it puts on your graphics card, which decreases as you go along. Unfortunately the final stages of the game rather bugged, and the final boss is confusing to say the least. Amazing that they haven't sorted these problems. However, despite all the problems, it is still a remarkable game, and one you just have to have!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great fun and I thoroughly recommend it. The shooting is smooth as silk and the addition of the suit powers is awesome, really makes you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ at least at the beginning. I found the combat engaging and diverse.It may not be particularly long but what you do get out of it is great. From start to finish it is a thrill ride of explosions, shootouts and alien invasions. It’s not a bad looker either, also with the huge open levels it feels a lot more expansive than a normal FPS. The many animals, realistic island and beautiful sunsets and rises really add depth to the world.Buy Today and don’t delay. Have Fun ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Can your computer run Crysis?""Despite the fact that it has been many years since Crysis came out, you still hear this every once in a while (usually in jest). I definitely wasn't worried about my GTX 670 and i5-3750k having trouble.I had psyched myself up about the visuals so much that my initial impression was ""well this doesn't look half bad..."" and then I remembered how old the game is. And I nearly peed myself. Even the cutscenes were rendered in the game engine, so the game always had a consistent visual style.The appeal for anybody who plays Crysis is of course the beautiful graphics, so I wasn't expecting much from the story or gameplay. As it turns out the gameplay was really good; the controls were nice and tight, even when you drive vehicles. Even flying a VTOL (those flying things that work like helicopters) and floating around in zero-gravity was intuitive, which is saying a lot.Although Crysis is obviously a linear game, the map was usually open enough that as long as you are going in the general direction of your next objective (which is what your character, Nomad, would be doing anyway) you won't feel constrained at all.The one area where gameplay suffered was the enemy AI. I found them laughably stupid, and took great sadistic pleasure in luring large numbers of them into small choke points where I could easily mow them down.On the opposite end of the spectrum, there were a couple of areas where I really wasn't given sufficient tools to complete the objectives. One example was a map where I was trying to destroy a few anti-aircraft emplacements. I ended up having two enemy helicopters following me around, and I only found one rocket launcher on the entire map. It was a pretty open map so I may have missed the others, but they weren't in any of the obvious places. So I ended up just running around cloaked as much as possible until I managed to complete my objective. Oh, and once that was complete the helicopters magically went away.The nano suit is the biggest aspect of the game (besides the graphics) that differentiates Crysis from other military shooters. The suit allows you to choose between several modes: strength, speed, armor, and cloak. Thanks to the nano suit you can play the game using a variety of play styles. One of my favorite things to do was to sneak into a complex cloaked dual-wielding a couple of silenced pistols with laser sights. It then became a nice little exercise in shooting everyone in the head one at a time before they figured out that I was there (and given that the AI was so stupid they would only figure out that I was there if they got a nice long look at me while uncloaked.) Ninja Nomad.The story can be summed up pretty quickly: North Koreans and aliens on a tropical island.Once you know that, nothing will surprise you. There were no plot twists, no sudden betrayals or finding out someone was a double agent or anything. But I was fine with that, because that wasn't why I was there anyway. That being said, I did like the ending; it was a satisfying ""hell yeah!"" at the end of a nice ten-hour campaign.If you are at all interested in playing Crysis, now is the best time to do it. The game is old enough that it is really cheap but it is still new enough to look good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There's a lot of cool things you can do in the game like cloaking, throwing heavy barrels, and fighting giant alients with anti-aircraft vehicles.The story is lacking, but I personally don't play games for the story itself - so that won't affect the rating for me. That's about it - it's a game worth checking out and worth trying. The engine is fun to muck around in as well if you're into that kind of stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis. Oh dear Crysis. It's the fabled representative of the ""PC master race"" cause. Is it a good game? Well, lets see. The story is a bit cliched, reeking of ""Humanity screwed around with something they shouldn't have"" trope, but it is handled with a bit of creativity. You are Nomad, a member of Raptor team, an elite group of soldiers for the U.S Military. It's 2020, and you and you're team are dispatched to rescue some hostages from the Korean People's Army. The hostages were apparantly scientists and archaeologists who had found something buried in the biggest mountain in the area. So, you initally get seperated from your team, and one of your squadmates who barely has any character gets killed off screen by something who ""Tore his body up bad"". From there, you trek you're way across the island you're set on, killing wave after wave of KPA troops. You learn a fanatical general, General Kyong, is in charge of the Korean Military occupation of the island, and you find one of the hostages. Then you start to get a sense that something else is on this island with you. Something inhuman. Raptor team's leader, Prophet, gets kidnapped by the same thing that killed your other squadmate in the opening, and you eventually get to General Kyong in a rather anticlimatic boss fight, ending with learning that yes. Aliens are in fact real, and that they really love the cold. From there, it just devolves to ""Stop the Aliens from taking over the world."" I say the story is cliched, sure, but it has it's moments. The voice acting is top notch, with at least some of the actors caring for their roles. Sure, almost all of Raptor team seems to be full of racial and cultural stereotypes, but they grow on you after a while. Heck, Psycho, the british personality, got so popular he even got his own spin-off game, but i'll get to that another time. As for your character, Nomad, he's a little bland. He hardly says anything, as per the first person shooter method, but dare I say, even Master Chief from the Halo series has more character than him. He just seems like the standard, military type who's honorable, and tough. And thats about it. All in all, it's an okay sci-fi plot. Nothing too new brought to the table, but not terrible.The gameplay is pretty damn solid. The biggest table-turner and innovation you have in the game, is the Nanosuit. Imagine if  Master Chief's suit got a major upgrade. Like, major. Actually, imagine this. Imagine if Master Chief's suit, got the abilities of Flash, The Predator, and Hulk. Thats the Nanosuit in a nutshell. It has four distinct modes to choose from. Strength, Speed, Cloak, and Armor. You can only use one at a time, but changing them up on the fly will help you win many, many battles. The Cloak is a little abusive, but thats what Delta level difficulty is for, where the enemy will often see your little invisibility trick. Armor mode is also another one thats pretty abusive, but it does make combat so much easier. Speaking of combat, the firefights in this game are pretty intense sometimes. You do have a somewhat limited arsenal. Theres no carrying around ten different kinds of guns like Duke Nukem 3D or Half Life, but it's no two weapon limit either. You get two primary weapons, two pistols, ten grenades, a heavy weapon like an RPG, C4 charges, and your bare hands. The primary weapon variety in this game is diverse, with 3 kinds of machine guns, and a few others I won't spoil here. Almost every weapon has customization options, like different kinds of scopes, or laser sights. Now, about your enemies. Don't think for a second, that just because the KPA are made entirely of a rather low tech militia, that they aren't dangerous. Each and every one of them can and will kill you without a thought. The A.I that drives them is also nice to watch. While they sometimes do goofy things, like stare at walls, and shout that they are throwing a grenade, but the grenade never comes, they sometimes do rather intelligent things, like flank you, take cover in the bushes, and converge on you from all different angles. The manner in which you take on the numerous amount of KPA infantry is also pretty expansive. Do you go in, all guns blazing, tearing and blowing everything up in sight? Or do you prefer to be the human equivalent of the Predator, sneaking in and taking them out one by one? The choice is yours. Theres also a fair amount of vehicular combat as well, but these vary in the fun factor. For example, the section where you blast your way through a valley in a tank is beyond the term awesome, but other sections like the VTOL retreat, just feel a bit broken, especially in control. Oh, and then theres the latter half of the game. With the aliens. Once you leave the mountain halfway through the game, say bye bye to diverse tactics and combat options, and say hello to generic ""Just use a really BFG to kill them!"". Seriously, the alien combat is the dullest and most boring thing I experienced with this game. There is no specific weakness to exploit with the aliens, just fill them full of projectiles until they crash and burn. To poorly balance this, the final boss of the game, has easily exploitable weaknesses, that make the fight over in less than ten minutes. Overall, I say that Crysis's gameplay is fun as all gets out, until the second you beat General Kyong, and then it all goes downhill from there. Thats just my opinion however. The multiplayer, on the other hand, well...I heard it was fun when people actually played it. The Power Struggle gametype seems like a creative idea, outright destroying the enemy team's base? Sounds pretty awesome to me.In terms of graphics, yes, Crysis is pretty to look at. The world is very detailed, and realistic. However, I promise you, that you'll be spending about twenty minutes in the settings of the game, tweaking and testing, until you get it to look exactly how you want it to look. Once you do though, you'll wonder how this was a game made in 2007, with it's vibrant colors, detailed textures, realistic physics, and excellent sound design. Also, the soundtrack by Inon Zur is amazing, with flourishes coinciding with whats going on around you.Overall, for it's okay story, pretty fun gameplay, and it's nice-to-look-at graphics, I give Crysis a 6/10. It's a must have for any fan of the first-person-shooter genre, and I highly reccommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do highly recommend this game as I had played bits of Crysis a very long time ago and I was eager to purchase this game and play it.  I also highly recommend reading the specifications at the very bottom before purchasing and downloading.  I somehow seemed to misread or overlook all of the minor details of the game specifications before I purchased and downloaded it.  And with that, I simply cannot give this game a thumbs down when I had failed to misread or overlook the fact that I am running a 64-bit computer and I realized a few days later that Crysis is only available in the 32-bit version.  I am also running Windows 8 (which the system requirements say nothing about as far as compatibility issues are concerned).  And to make a long story short, I am currently unable to play Crysis.  I am hoping that another update/download for a 64-bit version of the game will become available sometime soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks amazing, still holds up now even with newer great looking games. Gameplay is decent. I ran into some pretty hefty bugs, I fell through piece of the ship on the last level and it auto saved. The 'floor' beneath me ended up being visual but not actually there so I fell into the ship to an earlier part of the level and could not get out. I had to restart the whole last mission. Aside from that annoyance the gameplay is decent and the story is ok. Worth a play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sci-fi military action adventure masterpiece. State of the art, cutting edge PC graphics and gameplay. This game... makes others feel lifeless and boring. Crysis is a true living breathing world that set the bar of how all first person shooter's should be. Ever since 2007 of it's release many games have been emulating this graphical achievement. It's a simple yet effective story with ground breaking gameplay that set the bar for future games. This game takes you on a true action adventure that feels like Terminator 2 that meets Predator.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game to melt your rig. Well, not anymore, but it still holds a level of graphical fidelity that even today puts many recently released games to shame. Not to mention that with an abundance of mods, due to the rather open nature of the game's engine, you can make it look better than ever.The game itself is a solid shooter, an in certain regards even a really good one. Fighting the KPA on higher difficulties (with the enemies speaking Korean and no crosshair) can get really intense. And that's also the greatest thing about the game: Without being an open world game, you have all the freedom you can imagine to reach your target. Do you sneak through enemy lines? Try to find an unused path? Do you steal a vehicle? Even tanks may not be safe from you. Get the job done YOUR way! You want to do the tank mission on foot? JUST DO IT! The game rarely limits you in what you can do and what you should do.This changes later on, when suddenly the game introduces a new set of enemies and gameplay rules. To keep it fresh, the game uses truly three dimension gameplay, although that doesn't help covering up the fact that lush open jungle with wide areas are exchanged for small, almost corridor-like levels that don't allow for the same freedom as before.If you want more, the community got you covered: There is an unimaginable amount of mods of all kinds available, from simple texture jobs to highlights like Chrjs ""Rainy Days"", which reaches a whole new level of ""WOW!"" with intelligent companion AI (significantly better than what even Crysis Warhead offers in that regard) and excellent voice acting - and all that for free. You can of course get your own hands muddy, and dive right into the extremely easy to use ""Editor"" to create your own settings and missions (or just modify the maps of the single player levels to freeze every single Korean soldier with your God given freeze gun).

												Back in 2007 this game made our rigs over heat. I can't add much about Crysis from what you already know. The first game has the whole thing in terms of progression and environments. This port is decent (I can't say is the best) because  it has some issues to solve like the stuttering even if you have a monster machine and resolution compatibility but is as good as you remember. The bad thing is that maybe you'll find this at a not so cheap price and nowadays Crysis 3 is not on Steam to have the whole trilogy. Another bad thing is that the local multiplayer does not work as did in the past. I remember shoot rocket launchers from one side of the island to the other with a friend, we were testing our new Dell Inspiron Laptops with GeForce 8600m at that time hahaha. Another good memory was that this game managed the FOV in a way that we tried multiple displays up to 3 and it was a blast back then haha. Oh...I forgot...it has a ridiculous 3rd-party DRM for only 50 machines...""only"" haha! Well...buy this sh*t is good! ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Finished the game)I love the way crysis is from such a first-person view that it makes it seem so real. For example when your player is in the alien-world the game limits you from knowing anything about what is going on outside, instead of letting you know everything and making it seem like you are some god looking down and seeing everything going on. This means that the game sort of sweeps by; one minute you are on your own on an island, the next the US army suddenly turn up, and your character gets tossed around, straight in and out of action. The game seems to go so fast but if you think back, you can visualise the whole storyline and you realise how much story there is that you played.And don't get me started on the music; every time I hear 'first light' and 'Strickland's march' it just gets to me how well they put the music in and made the game so unique.Every time I think about Crysis I just think to myself: 'Screw next-gen games, ♥♥♥♥ it's ahead of it's time'10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Crysis series. Regardless of what many may think about it i find it very entertaining with diverse ways to play. It sucks that from what i hear is that they're shutting down their online servers, in which case i hope steam will step in and fix the online. So basically you're a super soldier, you have many different abilities that you can use to your advantage. Whether that is super speed, stealth, super strength, or armor. This game has a bit more of an open world compared to Crysis 2. Unfortunately i haven't played 3 yet, but i will at some point to get more of the story. This game is worth what the price is for the single player. I would however wait for a sale with a bundle together for it. Get them all at once for cheap :PAnyways i would love to get more into this game and tell you about the story, but i think i'll just let the game speak for itself. Enjoy one of the most graphically astounding games of it's time and have fun in one of the most fun games i ever played. :) (fyi i played this on ps3 a bit more than the steam version)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is for those who say to not install this game due to problems between Windows versions. I installed and played this game for almost 2hours today, without crashes and without problems of anz kind.Windows 10 pro x64, 8GB ddr3 1600mhz, intel i5 4690K, Gigabyte gtx 970 G1. If your pc's got issues, do not post bad reviews.Hint: better if played with keyb. and mouse. Playing with the controller is really hard!EDIT: That one person who found this review not helpful is still trying remove viruses from his pc because can't load anything without werid things appearing on screen.So, I wish every game would be like Crysis. It seems impossible but the game works amazingly well with my setup, works incredibly smooth playing with the steam controller and more impressive is that the xbox 360 controller works at the same time!I wish every game would be so well made. Even after almost a decade.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a newer PC gamer that never had the chance to play Crysis when it was released, I find the game to hold up better than all of the other Crysis games.The game feels like a PC game and not some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. The game treats itself seriously and allows you to tackle challenges in anyway you wantPros-Nanosuit changes on command to Stealth mode, Strength mode, Speed mode, and Defense Mode-Guns feel realistic powerful-Enemy AI is smart and will respond to your actions intelligently, which requires great awareness to overcome-Huge World-Graphics definetely hold up to this day, even for a game made almost a decade ago-Modability allows for even greater longevity-You feel like you are in control of every situation and are not limited to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic-You can hold MULTIPLE WEAPONS. Not just limited to TWO. A pistol, 2 primaries, and explosives.Cons--Game story feels kind of similar to the original Halo's story-(this may be a individual issue) but I have issues running this game in 64 bit, with a gtx 980 and an amd fx8350. Doesn't make sense.-Can be confusing at timesOverall this game is great, and a must own for any PC gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the biggest reason to be a PC gamer back in 2007. With it's revolutionary graphics, and a great singleplayer, Crysis is as good as it got when it came to sandbox shooters. The graphics still hold up 7 years later and even still look better than most modern games, which is quite unheard of in video games. The Nanosuit really gives the game a different take on shooters than all the other ones out there, in a really good way. As much greatness the Crysis series has brought with it though, it brought along plenty of disappointment as well with the series getting completely butchered with Crysis 2 and Crysis 3. When it comes to Crysis, Crysis 1 and Crysis Warhead are amazing games and some of the best shooters I've played and still worth playing if you missed out on it back in the day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are a sci-fi fan and also love FPS games, then this is definitely the game for you. Crysis is a game full of action, super awesome graphics (made with cryengine technology), brilliant textures, particles, shadows and physics, very interesting plot, satisfying length, nice weapons and weapon attachement-upgrades. It's a game worth playing by any means.The whole idea about using the nano suit will most probably addict you to a level that you will want to finish the game at the hardest gameing mode!cons: the game has a few bugs and looks heavy, if you wanna enjoy the graphics fully, you need a strong graphics card..PS: the game supports multiplayer and also inporting game mods (some of which are veeery cool)!

												Haven't played too much so far, but what I have has been great fun. Requires actual stealth unlike some modern ""stealth"" games. You can still get in a firefight, but you're not invincible like the trailer makes you out to be.This game has issues on Windows 8 x64. I was able to make it work great through the use of the -dx9 command line switch. Some people claim that this doesn't work, others claim they don't need it. YMMV.Also note that the default resolution is 4:3, and you need to scroll down in the menu to see the 1920x1080 option which is not immediately obvious.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't expect a plot beyond your generic Sci-fi stuff. The gameplay, however, is still incredibly fun, and offers so many options that every encounter can be different. Your Nanosuit has four abilities, and the use of each one drains your suit's Energy bar. Fortunately it, as well as your health, regenerate in a decent pace to allow quick, exciting and varied combat sessions. Combined with cars and boats, as well as fairly open level designs, each fight in Crysis can be a fresh experience unlike many other shooters.Your armor has ""Speed"" to dart around the battlefield and rush up to enemies to knock them down. ""Strength"" for stronger melee, as well as high jumps (one of the favorite fights in my playthrough was using this to jump over a fence into an enemy base, and then run around their rooftops, hopping from one to the other and gunning them down as I go). ""Armor"" to absorb damage and hasten the recovery of Energy and Health. And lastly, ""Invisibility"". The stealth aspect of the game isn't as refined as it could be - silent takedowns aren't too silent and you can't hide bodies - but still enjoyable.Weapons are also modifiable to a small degree with different attachments, adding yet another layer of tactics and allowing different approaches.  Sadly, even on the toughest difficulty (which isn't as maddeningly frustrating as Modern Warfare was for me), I didn't feel a need to switch weapons out of necessity. Just for variation's sake. You can safely beat the game just with the standard rifle you'll find. But, again, experimenting is fun here.It took me 12 hours to complete, but I expect to have another playthrough eventually. Both because it's honestly a very fun shooter, and because by the end of the game you really get the hang of using your suit, vehicles and weapons, that you'll feel like revisiting those early levels where you were still fumbling around. Seeing as this isn't a linear game, those early levels /are/ worth revisiting, because the experience will thankfully be different.P.S.It's still a very pretty game, too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Haven't played too much so far, but what I have has been great fun. Requires actual stealth unlike some modern ""stealth"" games. You can still get in a firefight, but you're not invincible like the trailer makes you out to be.This game has issues on Windows 8 x64. I was able to make it work great through the use of the -dx9 command line switch. Some people claim that this doesn't work, others claim they don't need it. YMMV.Also note that the default resolution is 4:3, and you need to scroll down in the menu to see the 1920x1080 option which is not immediately obvious.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't expect a plot beyond your generic Sci-fi stuff. The gameplay, however, is still incredibly fun, and offers so many options that every encounter can be different. Your Nanosuit has four abilities, and the use of each one drains your suit's Energy bar. Fortunately it, as well as your health, regenerate in a decent pace to allow quick, exciting and varied combat sessions. Combined with cars and boats, as well as fairly open level designs, each fight in Crysis can be a fresh experience unlike many other shooters.Your armor has ""Speed"" to dart around the battlefield and rush up to enemies to knock them down. ""Strength"" for stronger melee, as well as high jumps (one of the favorite fights in my playthrough was using this to jump over a fence into an enemy base, and then run around their rooftops, hopping from one to the other and gunning them down as I go). ""Armor"" to absorb damage and hasten the recovery of Energy and Health. And lastly, ""Invisibility"". The stealth aspect of the game isn't as refined as it could be - silent takedowns aren't too silent and you can't hide bodies - but still enjoyable.Weapons are also modifiable to a small degree with different attachments, adding yet another layer of tactics and allowing different approaches.  Sadly, even on the toughest difficulty (which isn't as maddeningly frustrating as Modern Warfare was for me), I didn't feel a need to switch weapons out of necessity. Just for variation's sake. You can safely beat the game just with the standard rifle you'll find. But, again, experimenting is fun here.It took me 12 hours to complete, but I expect to have another playthrough eventually. Both because it's honestly a very fun shooter, and because by the end of the game you really get the hang of using your suit, vehicles and weapons, that you'll feel like revisiting those early levels where you were still fumbling around.

												Definitely the best sci-fi -military sandbox FPS. Crysis puts you in big, wide, dynamic levels and gives you objectives. How to do them is up to you. It's a big playground. Game doesn't give orders to you every second, make you follow a high rank-cool guy like Call of Duty games and their clones. You are the cool guy, you are the hero. It's a big fun and pleasure to play this game.It's Crysis, so we have to mention about graphics, right? :) When Crysis released in 2007, Crytek said the highest settings are for next 4-5 years' PC's. After 7 years, I can see that. I finished it again and it still has great graphics, even better graphics than many recently released games. Also it's a great pleasure to play it at highest settings at high fps (my GPU is GTX 460).But it's a shame that this awesome game continue with not that much awesome games. Crysis 2 and 3 are good games, they were fun to play but not a Crysis. They redesign the gameplay, graphics and story for consoles.It's still the best Crytek game. I hope with the new Homefront we will see Crytek making awesome games again as they used to.It's a must have if you like action games. Also it's a PC exclusive title, enjoy :) (Yes, it's released for X360 and PS3 after Crysis 2 but not like this quality graphics, and it's originally design for PC, so again, enjoy :) )Update: This game is timeless, both technically and gameplay perspective. Definitely deserves Steam's The “Test of Time” Award.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the gunplay isn´t everyones favourite, Crysis has tons of mods and maps and blablabla...With cheats you can mess around and play with the game´s values.The visuals are pretty good (2014) and despite some low-rez textures very good, compared to date.Is it worth getting?Even if it´s campaign bores you, you are able to mess around with EVERYTHING or try to use the sandbox.If the campaign is amazing (in your POV) and you love it, you should also get the standalone-addon ""Crysis Warhead"".RATING:Gunplay : 6/10The weapons feel clunky and enemys are like bullet-sponges.Graphics : 8/10Back then AMAZING 11 out of 5. Nowadays good, but it has some low-rez textures. BTW: AA is pretty power-consuming.Mod-support : 9/10Even if the publisher is EA, it has mod-support. NUKE BOOOOOMB.....Sound : 8/10It´s good.Controls : 8/10It´s good to control, but has some flaws.Fun : 9/10Mod-support, an ""ok""-singleplayer and cheats are as cool as in GTA.Multiplayer : -/-Gamespy is shutdown and EA does not transfer the multiplayer onto something else.OVERALL :  8/10Go get it.It´s a good game.Because of mod-support, you´ll find what you want.

												Crysis is a great game. It really put a huge gap between what i feel a shooter should be and shouldn't be. The game pits a player throught multiple levels containing vehicles, weapons, and loads of enemies! The player also has access to a suit that enables them to cloak, run at high speeds, have the strength of ten men, or just become a heavily armored brute. The campaign features enemies bases or patrols in which the player is able to take them on quietly or blast them away with loud and massive explosions. The graphics of the game are also outstanding, sunsets and blizzards and more occur as the player travels across the island. The game also features a destructible set of structures for the player to use. A few things i find important to note here, the game is not Call Of Duty style, its not a shoot 'em up. You sometimes have to plan things out and your not shooting enemies or being rushed by a squad member. The stealth in this game adds a few nice features, if you hide in bushes enemies cannot see you (assuming the bush covers the player) and will walk right on by. Cloaking also allows the player to get close to an enemie. As a final warning the internet for this has been discontinued, any of what remained of multiplayer is now dead. But for a great game like this i play the single player a whole lot more than multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis. The original benchmark for gamers that still brings some modern systems down to their knees. Also, one of the most worthwhile titles to play even to this day. Crysis is a fun and exhilarating sandbox game that allows various styles of play--from stealth to a two legged tank warrior--all thanks to the versatile nano suit. Although, the game is at times unstable (prone to the occasional crash) the game still offers a fulfilling singlepayer campaign. It should be noted that there is a ""Crysis: Maximum Edition"" which features the sequel, Crysis: Warhead and its multiplayer counterpart, Crysis Wars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game gives you a supersuit (called the nanosuit) that allows you four really fun abilities: cloak, maximum armour, maximum speed, and maximum strength. Cloak allows you to become almost entirely invisible and makes you feel like the Predator from the movies. Stealth is an option and a great tool for escaping situations or confusing enemies during gun battles.Maximum armour allows you to absorb more damage before your health starts getting affected. It is guaranteed to save your life in this game.Maximum speed increases your movement speed and you move so fast in sprint mode that there's a delayed reaction from enemies. I think reload speeds are slightly faster too. In fact you can sprint so fast that you'll hurt yourself if you bump into objects. Quite a nice touch.Maximum strength makes you super strong. It allows you to throw objects farther, jump much higher, inflict more damage with melee attacks (one punch kill on humans and you can punch down flimsy structures), and significantly reduce weapon recoil.All of these abilities are balanced out by your suit's energy source that gets drained and needs to be recharged frequently. In this game, you need skill in order to pull off amazing stunts while keeping an eye on your energy usage. The powersuit alone makes this game worth it in my opinion. It also helps that this game is non-linear. It is up to YOU to decide how to approach every situation (until the last third of the game). Or you can say screw the situation and go off to explore and admire the pretty environments. This game is cheap too at the moment so why not? Just make sure your computer can handle it ;)DISCLAIMER: I bought this during the winter sale when it was a steal. My opinion still stands even at $20.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis is something else: stunning graphics, an underused setting, an epic story, and an enjoyable multiplayer game to boot. People playing this will likely recall FarCry, with good reason. Crysis is the evolution of that title, using a new engine, but keeping the general feel of a 'hell in paradise'. It all begins with what looks to be like a simple rescue mission. You and your group, equipped with the latest in nano-augmented suit technology, parachute into North-Korean-occupied territory to find an archaeologist. It should be a simple rescue mission, but something is definitely wrong, and as you continue through the island you've been dropped into, you'll find that there are more players in this game than you think. The action in the single-player experience is as intensive as you want to make it. Your nano-suit grants you a variety of abilities, each of which augment what you can do and, depending on your use, how you play. You can increase your strength, adding damage to your attacks and allowing you to jump a dozen feet in the air; you can increase your speed, allowing you to run blindingly around your opponents; you can increase your armor, allowing your suit energy to take damage until it runs out and you start to bleed; or you can enter cloak mode, arguably one of the most useful suit abilities, which makes you invisible for a short time, allowing you to sneak around your opponents and confront them on your own terms.Running into the fray, guns blazing, is always an option but a difficult one. It doesn't take a lot to bring you down, and when you have at least half a dozen enemies gunning for you, things can get real deadly real quick. Hiding in the underbrush allows you to stay out of sight of enemies, which is crucial when lookout towers are scattered across the territory that you need to move through. The result is gameplay that tends to be tense at times, but at others sometimes just feels like the bushes are playing a game of hot-potato, and you're the potato.The game offers some magnificent environments, a notable difference from the usual faire in its genre. Maps span kilometres, which is an impressive feat that allows the game to be played differently than just running through small corridors. Though visually stellar, the problem with the environments is that many of them consist only of a valley that makes you move in a straight line to get to your target, as opposed to the wide-open nature of others. These valleys are probably more open than most FPS games, but they're a stark contrast to other sections of the game, and feel all the more constrained because of it.The presentation is pretty top-notch: great acting, great story, and a pace that keeps the action going throughout.The single player campaign may be fun, but it does end, and when it does, the multiplayer game is where you go to continue the action. Luckily, it delivers quite excellently. Crysis has definitely raised the stakes when it comes to graphics, and is probably going to be used as a technical benchmark for many years to come. Its stunning environments and interesting gameplay that changes with the suit's powers create a very enjoyable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to go out on a limb here and say that this is actually one of the best FPS games I ever played, period.Others may point out the deficiencies, but through the curious way I experienced this game it has ultimately assumed the status of an absolute classic in my eyes.That experience I mention is this: On my first ever playthrough, my rig was such that the game crashed as soon as I entered the final act - all that water and all those explosions, you dig? - and so I never actually knew that it was the final act. In my mind the game stretched on into inifinity - and what an infinity it was. The game goes through three distinct phases, each more jaw-droppingly perfect than the last. At first, one is navigating a jungly-coated tropical island world, evading - or annihilating, though this was never as fun for me - conventional, dastardly Korean forces in a manner strongly remeniscent of the original Far Cry (for me at least, Far Cry didn't really have any stealth component, though i did everything i could to force it to play like a stealth shooter nonetheless) In the second phase, all-out conflict has broken out and, while you can continue to play as a phantom if you wish, the stakes and scale soar upwards into 'epic' territory. In the third phase, you discover a vast and fantastic secret lurking within the island, exploring this secret in a state of permawonder, before re-emerging into a drastically altered form of the second phase, to see out the game.My initial experience was cut short most of the way through the third phase, so in my mind it was, as I've said, neverending, and by jebus that neverending game was FPS fantasy made reality. It really is just an awesome game.Quite apart form the graphics, which are to this day superior to almost any other offering of comprable setting (visually if not technolgically, though the tech is still close), the gameplay is tight and perfectly polished. This is the kind of game that, while vaguely linear, allows a player to turn 100m of linear progression into around 1km of side-track meandering and sneaking more or less throughout the entire experience. One can craft one's own adventure here, as surely as any of those gimmicky kids books from the '90s, and just as everyone had envisioned in their wildest dreams back then this adventure is lush, endless and full of wonders more wonderous than the last.The gameplay is consistent and with the possible exception of the final moments of the second phase, in which combat is more or less forced on you and the game literally ejects any background action in an effort - only marginally succesful - to turn your final stage into some kind of arena, it is consistently entertaining.Why should you buy this game? Because your computer may very well finally be able to run it in something approaching max settings, because it is one of the best FPS experiences you will ever play, and because it is streets, miles ahead of any other similar game released in the years before or the years after.

It allows you to throw objects farther, jump much higher, inflict more damage with melee attacks (one punch kill on humans and you can punch down flimsy structures), and significantly reduce weapon recoil.All of these abilities are balanced out by your suit's energy source that gets drained and needs to be recharged frequently. In this game, you need skill in order to pull off amazing stunts while keeping an eye on your energy usage. The powersuit alone makes this game worth it in my opinion. It also helps that this game is non-linear. It is up to YOU to decide how to approach every situation (until the last third of the game). Or you can say screw the situation and go off to explore and admire the pretty environments. This game is cheap too at the moment so why not? Just make sure your computer can handle it ;)DISCLAIMER: I bought this during the winter sale when it was a steal. My opinion still stands even at $20.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game its self was great when I played a friends copy some years back. This steam copy however I will not recommend. For me on a win 7 64bit OS the game has never worked, I have attempted to try fixes to no avail. Recently I tried again, now the game claims the CD key steam furnished me with is not valid. I recommend buying this game just not on steam, get a decent second hand copy don't waste your time on this rubbish. Valve claim not to be focusing on making games anymore, I have no idea what they are currently working on but it certainly is not steam since the platform seems to get poorer releases by the day.

												I felt compelled to write this. I've been playing video games ever since the Nintendo entertainment system was released in 85. I'm in my 30s now and I did not have a PC that could run this game when it was released. I've played all the big AAA's on PC old and new but always overlook this one. I purchased Crisis 2 and Crisis 3 again overlooking this one it's too old I keep telling myself. Purchased it on this recent sale. Researched some mods Texter foliage lighting etc. Installed them hopped on and OMG what a game. Not only is it beautiful and I mean beautiful. It has amazing AI an awesome story. The immersion is through the roof. If you immerse yourself in the game enough with a headset on you almost think you're in a Rambo movie. It has the old school difficulty of days gone by. The amazing destruction beautiful visuals (with mods) that today's games cannot capture. Battlefield 4 Call of Duty Ghost Assassins creed black flag don't come close visually or technically. What an amazing game I have been missing out all of these years. Of course it's taken 30+ years to be able to afford a rig that can run this and all of its glory. This game truly is a masterpiece.

												Crysis is still a game hog on today's machines.  However, it's a must play for anyone that wants to feel like they have full control on how the game is played.  Do you want to go guns blazing?  Do you want to use stealth?  You get to choose how you can take on each mission.  However, the world is not as open as Far Cry was, it is much more linear.  The graphics are some of the best graphics still even by today's standard and the action is non-stop.  The story, however, isn't that great.  Luckily the visual/audio of this game make up for any loss.  The ability to configure your gun and the added skills that are part of the nano-suit add some RPG elements to a wonderful FPS experience.  Definitely a classic to be played by all fans of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is decent enough (not for Koreans obviously), guns are fair, enemies are a little bit slow to die (paintball simulator dammit), but headshots work as they should - 1 shot = 1 kill.I just see no sense in a long description of a great game that every shooter playing person knows for sure.

												This game kinda sucks. I know its old, and for its time the graphics were amazing, but I just cant get over some pifalls of the gameplay. I know reviewing a game past its prime, you have to take things in consideration, but somethings I cant get over.First thing you want to do is bind the suit powers to a certain key. You cant do this. Why?  Honestly, thats why this game gets a bad review. Im sure there might be a mod that I could download but im not wasting my time. Using the toggle suit powers doesnt work, and having to use the wheel toggle to flip back and forth is slow, I feel defeats the purpose of the suit. You cant melee guys that dont see you for an instant kill.  Some cue appears to grab enemy but I could never get it to work properly. I have this badass suit but no knife? Really? The AI is horrible. I play games on hard and ultra hard, and I hate games where you are forced to use glitches to kill guys on ultra hard. Half the time they dont see you when they clearly should, and other times they see you immediately when they shouldnt.  And that sucks because the game relys heavily on stealth.  I dont quite see the purpose of the silencer.  If you kill a guy with a silencer everyone hears it. Using the Speed Power boost doesnt frighten or stagger the enemies at all, which I find really dumb. If I zip past 2 guys you would think their would be some delay before they would just turn around and kill me. Nope. Pick up another pistol, and youll duel weild automatically and lose the iron sights on the pistol.  I never figured out how to single wield, and you cant aim with pistol anymore.  Dont pick up another pistol, and youll have no pistol ammo.Whats the biggest dissappointment is that you would think with the suit powers there would be some sort of combos or different play styles. There isnt. Strength is for jumping and breaking walls, speed is for getting around the map, armor is used for combat, stealth is what your forced to be in most of the time.I just found it kind of lame because of these problems.  The story seems really good though. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis is a Sci-Fi First Person Shooter.About the Game:You are an army man on a mission from a special task force with a suit, mabye this doesn't sound original but the gameplay is super.What makes this game good if you look to the other FPS games ???The suit... gives you power to ... run fast... jump high or be invisible.You fight your way on a island and play how you want to play.Be like Rambo or sneak like Sold Snake (Metal Gear Solid)The games has a amazing story mode and makes the game worth buying and playing.Game looks amazing and this was the first game in my life where I purchased a 300 euro video card just to play it.I think a lot of people did the same or know what I'm talking about.For me it was a new reason to spend a ♥♥♥♥ load of money on a core 2 duo or quad core pc.Only now you can play the game with a basic GTX650 Ti or higher card,Single Player:Some parts of the game gives you the freedom to go everywhere you like to go.The maps are gigantic and a lot of stiff to explore.Some parts are pure rail shooters... you walk the way and try to defeat your enemies.I think this game has not special story line only it's really great to play and experiance.Not graphic part wil not be a problem for many VGA cards. Yes most games will look better now on the day I made this review.Still Crysis looks amazing and will give you a very good experience.And will let you give a look in the story mode / world of Crysis.MultiPlayer Option:Crysis whas made as a single player demo and the multiplayer has not been updated after the Wars addon.The Basic crysis had only deathmatch and power struggle.Deathmatch is free for all and power strungle is more like a capture the points and earn money to buy new weapons.So this multiplayer is extreme basic as it can be only funny thing is.This whas one of the best multiplayer games i've been played after all these years.Yes it is basic... but freaking good !!Just basic FPS multiplayer fun for LAN or to play with friends online.Everybody has the same suits... no upgrades.. and there are weapons to find and pick up.I had so much fun with this game in LAN partiesPlayed it for more than 500 hours and enjoyed every hour.When I noticed that the game was on sale on Steam for a few euros I bought it right away.Overall:I think this is a must have game for every FPS fan.Epic Game, Good Story, Basic Multiplayer and has a small history if you ask me.That's why I give it a 9/10 score.

												Let me start by saying Crysis is a very different game to what I expected.  Boy was I wrong and I am GLAD for it. I was expecting to step into the shoes of a Master Chief style tank/super soldier that could Clint Eastwood his way through the fight. Crysis instead puts you into the shoes of an American Special Forces soldier and asks you to think like one. It was VERY refreshing and VERY welcome. The Nano Suit (think super soldier suit) which you wear doesn't make you an invincible force of nature but instead makes you feel like you are wearing a USEFUL military designed peice of hardware. It expands the natural abilities that a special forces soldier would need and use, not grant him super powers. The suit merely gives you options to tackle any situation how you see fit and THAT is what makes this game clever. I also want to put on record that I know and understand that the Crysis series is designed to break computers. I played this game on Maximum settings as intended and it is FREAKING GORGEOUS. A game that came out in 2007 still beats out most modern day titles that I have seen in 2014. It is wonderful to be awed by the graphics of a game to this extent and I am blessed to own a computer that could handle it easily (although I do feel that this would be a sticking point for many players with underpowered hardware). Just because my experience was great, doesn't mean your experience will be. Please understand that your milage could vary from my review!So I finished the game in 12 hours (which is leaning on the shorter side)  but the story and the pacing complimented this length nicely so it is hard to chalk this as adrawback. I also played with a gamepad (Xbox 360) but it is easy to tell that Crysis is designed with the Keyboard and Mouse in mind. It works don't get me wrong! But it isn't always natural.So in conclusion I HIGHLY recommend Crysis. It is smarter than it appears.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Obviously a very good looking game, but it wouldn't be a great game if not for the gameplay. Really fun to use your suit's different abilities to tackle situations in a variety of ways. Game gives you a lot of freedom which is apparently missing from Crysis 2 and 3. Overall one of my favorite FPS games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is there to say about Crysis that has not already been said. It is a georgeous masterpiece that looks amazing and stands the test of time. When this game came out in 2007 I can assure you that almost nobody had a powerful enough machine to run this game maxed out. As much as I could say about the graphics it is more than just a tech demo and is an amazing game in just about every other aspect. The game takes place in the year 2020 were you play as a nano-suited supersoldier named Nomad. This suit has many features such as cloak mode, armour mode, strength made, and speed mode. It can also help the user survive in extreme cold and heat. You are sent to the Korean controlled Lingshan Islands when you recieve a distress signal from a scientist named Rosenthal. As you continue your mission members of your team start to die in weird ways and things get stranger and stranger. Little does the team know that their suits have awakened an alien race hidden in the island. I won't spoil the ending because this is a game that you should play for yourself. The gameplay of Crysis is quite fun. This FPS puts you on the island and it is huge and allows you to choose your own path to the next objective. Do you sneak in through the woods and make it undetected or storm in in an armored car. The choice is yours. As for the weapons there are several modern and futeristic weapons ranging from sub-machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, modified alien mini turrets, and even your own fists. As for multiplayer there are two main modes. There is a standard deathmatch mode and then there is the power struggle mode. In power struggle there are two teams, each with their own main base. The point of the game is to capture smaller command points and to kill members of the other team until you have enough money to get a really powerful weapon to take out the enemy's main base and win the game. going back to graphics there are some more things to talk about. The game came out right around when windows vista came out and supposedly can take advantage of its features. Mainly it can run in DX10 mode although it was mainly built around DX9. You normally can't acces very high settings on DX9 so windows xp users would be out of luck but there are two ways around this. The first is to go into the configuraton file and edit it to force very high settings on DX9 wich looks almost exactly the same as on DX10 with the only difference being some subtle lighting effects only on DX10. The other way is to get a version of DX10 that will run on windows xp that was released a year or two ago, go to the files for Crysis and change the name of the file called D3D9 to D3D10 and then change D3D10 to D3D9, and then to go into the lauch options on Steam and type in this line "" -DX10"". This will allow you to run Crysis on the highest settings in DX10 mode on windows xp. This game is more than worth the 20 dollars it costs to get. I hope this review was helpful and that you enjoy this masterpiece as much as I have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have been trying to find a tech-demo with non-linear gameplay, Crysis can may be right up your alley. You need a good system to run it properly because it's unoptimized, back in the day computer enthusiasts used Crysis as a benchmarking tool, It  was the only game that could bring the beastiest rigs down to their knees, the story is rather cliché'but the concept is semi unique. super soldiers fighting koreans on a tropical island. The game has very good mods, the Stargate one for example. I would give this a 7/10 I would recommend it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I played this game from 2007 in 2014, all graphics settings could be maxed out. I was amazed that a 7 year old game, could deliver such an enjoyable experience! Especially as FPS tend to depend alot on their graphics performance. Crysis provided a good mix of stealth, full-on action, vehicular combat and differing environments. Although not as open as some of  the more recent FPS games (e.g. Far Cry 3), it provides ample opportunities to choose different paths in reaching your objectives. The nanosuit deserves a special mention as it adds gameplay due to the capabilities of the suit. Overall, a highly recommended golden classic!Score: 8.5/10Pro: + very nice graphics (even if the game is almost 7 years old!)+ nanosuit capabilities+ excellent gameplay+ semi-open world+ decent amount of mods available on the internet (didn't try any)Contra:- too short; 10 to 15 hours to complete- some enemy A.I. & graphics glitches			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although the graphics and gameplay in this game are impressive, especially for its time, I couldn't help but feel that there was alot of repetitiveness to this game and too much linear gameplay. The game also seems written somewhat poorly because it unnecessarily hogs system resources that it shouldn't have to, even on a modern rig.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's a great sense of empowerment by running through a jungle stealthed up to an enemy base, turning off your cloak and turning on your armour and systematically taking out every enemy in that base as your rifle carefully guides you to your target. The fact that that's just one way of many to go about your objectives is one of the reasons it's a great game.Crysis' strengths are numerous. Gun-play feels satisfying, both the actual shooting of enemies as well as the feedback of toying around with attachments, to the extent that if you played the game as a straight shooter, you probably wouldn't be disappointed. That the movement options available to you wide and varied, from the slow and stealthy approach to the super fast leaping-and-bounding traversal. That you can approach an encounter in a myriad of ways, some because it will be more effective and some because it'll just be plain fun. That these are all wrapped up in a gorgeous visual presentation and audio that gives weight to your movement and minute-to-minute actions is just an icing on an already yummy cake.Really though it's the freedom of the game to let you do things the way you want to that is its strongest aspect, clearly in exchange for a hum-drum plot that, whilst a little awkward, changes tone and direction in the second half to something that is at least a little more engaging. That each objective is punctuated by an open enviroment with traversal allowing you to explore the islands you operate on with no real time limit gives the game a much bigger scope than simply moving from one fire-fight to the next, preventing any sense of boredom creeping in, but ultimately it's down to you to keep things as entertaining as you want them to be. So yes, again, you could just shoot your way through everything, but perhaps you'll strap some explosives to a truck, drive up to a base stealthed, dive out of the car at the last moment and watching the vehicle explode and the base erupt into chaos as you sleuth around it to eliminate any opposition. Or maybe you'll just zoom around at maximum speed punching your targets and sending them flying into walls. It's your choice.Whilst the freedom in play is reduced in the second half of the game with the plot's directional change, the feeling of the hunter is swapped around and instead of using your suit's powers for offensive actions, you're using them to survive in any manner you seem most suitable. With a pace that's consistent and overall length that is neither too short nor overstays its welcome as well as proving as much replayability as you have creativity, Crysis is a great first person shooter with a high quota for enjoyment.

												Just to get it out of the way: yes, this game is gorgeous, one of the best looking of all time and it still is today. However, I've never been particularly a good graphics kind of gamer, I'm more about the gameplay in games. Luckily, the gameplay in Crysis is a lot of fun. The thing that really makes it is the nanosuit, giving you four different abilities to use: speed, strength, armour, and invisibility. Mixing and matching these four modes is a lot of fun, and allows for a lot of experimentation during combat. Stealth is also a crucial strategy, especially when there are dozens of enemies you have to eliminate. The enemy AI is very good as well, it works very well with stealth and during combat they will try to flank you. Add in the different weapon customizations, there are a lot of combinations to use in enemy encounters that it will keep you entertained for the duration of the campaign. The level design is also nice and open, giving you even more options like sniping and using vehicles.The story in the game isn't particularly good, but this isn't the kind of game you play for the story, you should play it for the gameplay and graphics. However, where the game really faulters, is in the last two or two-and-a-half hours of the campaign when you start battling the aliens. The aliens just aren't as fun to fight as the Koreans and don't allow for much variation in the ways you want to fight them.Crysis is a great game, particularly is you like experimentation in the ways you want to handle the enemy encounters.  Half the fun is just seeing what kind of stuff you can get away with, and I love that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crytek regala ai giocatori PC uno sparatutto eccezionale. In termini di longevità si attesta sui valori di Bioshock, il multiplayer riprende le meccaniche di Battlefield, la lotta tra supersoldati e alieni riporterà alla mente le gesta di Master Chief e della serie Halo, il motore grafico rivaleggia con i migliori titoli delle console next-gen e l'intelligenza artificiale mostra meccaniche simili a quelle viste in F.E.A.R.. Il problema è che in nessuno dei casi appena citati il prodotto tedesco riesce a superare il suo diretto concorrente, avvicinandosi al successo ma senza mai riuscire a compiere quel passo in più che l'avrebbe portato sul gradino più alto del podio degli sparatutto in prima persona. voto: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, Crysis is definitely another win for Crytek and another one of those games that's more than the sum of its parts. They’ve created some amazing technology that’s scalable enough that many gamers will be able to play it on some setting, even if it isn’t the best, and have a good amount of fun. Those that have computers to run the game at DX9 on high will find that the amazing visuals definitely enhance the amount of immersion and enjoyment Crysis can provide. This is some fast, well designed gameplay with enough options to allow players to use their own style of attack with satisfying suit abilities and weapons. Crytek has upped their attention to detail in presentation and dropped the worst parts of Far Cry’s story. The multiplayer, while probably not enough to draw players away from their favorites, is also worth the time. While the Halo 2 type of ending for the single player left a bad taste in my mouth, it wasn’t enough to deter me from heartily recommending action fans pick this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More than half a decade has passed, but Crysis still impresses with its gameplay and graphics, though the it stumbles in its second half. In Crysis, you play as a soldier equipped with a nanosuit that lets you switch between 4 powers (Armour, Speed, Strength and Cloak) which, when combined with technically linear yet impressively large and open levels, provides many ways to approach situations. Throw in vehicles (which aren't that nice to control but are still fun to drive and blow up), destructible environments and ragdolling and you have a wonderful FPS experience... for the first half of the game. The second half of the game replaces the North Koreans with aliens as the main enemy and abruptly replaces its large levels with standard linear fare. It's pretty decent at first, but uninteresting alien combat and generic missions soon dull the experience. If that wasn't enough, an annoying escort mission, a potentially engaging VTOL sequence marred by crappy controls and an underwhelming final level pop up to turn an average second half into a tiring and fustrating experience that sits at odds with the not quite perfect but still sublime first half. Despite all these issues, the first half alone make Crysis worth the purchase, if not as a standalone product then at least in the Maximum Edition bundle, which includes Crysis Warhead.

												I seriously need to put more hours into this game, because I can give you three reasons why to pick up this game.1.First thing you'll notice is the graphics, for a game that came out in 2007, it looks absolutely gorgeous, one of the best looking games on the pc, whether it's the facial animation or the lush forests, it's beautiful.2. It's not extremely linear or a corrodor shooter, the levels are open and allow you to stealth certain outposts or areas or to go guns a blazing. That's what separates it from games like cod(and yes I know Cod 4 came out barely before this game did, infact by only 8 days).3.The story is excellent here, now while I haven't gotten too far in the story, I've gotten to the point where it's actually starting to grip me, making me want to fight in the battles that occur later on, it gets extremely emotional.There you have it, Crysis is an extremely well developed first person shooter and I could recommend it to anyone, not to mention that along with the campaign we also get a multiplayer. I give it a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In 2007 Turkish-German game developer Crytek released ‘Crysis’, a cryengine-built first person shooter which exceeded the graphical norm at the time more than any other game ever did or would later do. Almost no computer could run it at the time and for many years it would be the ideal game to test new gaming PC’s with, but even disregarding this main strength of the game Crysis is a very decent FPS. In Crysis you take the role of an American soldier named ‘Nomad’ who is part of an elite squadron of nanosuit-equipped soldiers . You are sent to the Lingshan islands in the pacific to rescue a team of archeologists from North-Korean soldiers who took the place over. Story is not quite the part of the game that deserves closest examination because of that it is quite generic. After all, even back in 2007 there were already quite a few games that had the player kill soldiers while playing as an American soldier himself, but luckily the story takes a bit of a back seat here. It would not be until Crysis 2 that other things than combat would be given some attention. In terms of story delivery there is also nothing new here.What you would want to play Crysis for, if not the superb graphics, would be its gameplay and it does this quite well. Although it uses pretty standard FPS mechanisms the nanosuit makes for a welcome addition. Basically the suit gives you a choice of four superpowers, which consume from one general energy bar. There is a speed mode, pretty self-explanatory, a cloak mode that makes you largely invisible, a power mode that lets you jump higher and fling heavy objects and an armour mode. Using whatever improvements your power gives you costs energy and generally this system holds up pretty well. It is nice that you are given the choice between stealthing a section with the cloak or fighting through it normally, and if you choose the latter you can also pick different tactics with either the speed or the armour mode.  A nice small addition on the side is that you are at any time able to modify your weapon, which means you can pick your sight, add a suppressor or make other small modifications. The game also excels in giving the player freedom. Before Crytek set about on making Crysis they made the original Far Cry. Why these developers are so attached to the word ‘cry’ remains a mystery. But anyway, Far Cry was an open world game which was, like Crysis, set on a tropical island and sometimes it seems as if the developers carved a big and wide linear path out of Far Cry’s sandbox to make Crysis because Crysis feels about as unlinear as a linear game can be. The entire game has a structure similar to Half Life 2, in that you are never teleported to a different location but always go there yourself. There are almost no missions that all of a sudden take place somewhere else unless the last mission had you go there by yourself. Some objectives give you entire towns to play around in, a lot of the houses can be smashed up and most objects can be grabbed and thrown as weapons. What also makes this game feel like some fenced-off sandbox is the completely free use of vechiles. When you need to go to the next firefight you can walk there if you want, or you can get in a car which the game just puts outside most villages. Driving mechanics are not very good though, so if you are being shot at you are in more danger in a car than on foot.Although Crysis is indeed a very good FPS it does have a few minor issues I want to mention. Firstly that would be the story. I understand that a game like this leaves little room for something outrageously good, but they could perhaps have done a little less effort to make the North-Koreans look like jerks because in a game based around so much military excessive force, as showcased in a level where you take part in a big tank offensive, making the enemy seem evil just puts the entire game in a big cliché. Of course in a game with such a simple story you want to have your side as the goodies and the other side to be the baddies, but emphasizing that so much makes it all feel a bit fake. Some enemies come across as silly cartoon villains. My other nibbles mostly restrict to specific sections and mentioning them spoils parts of the game for you, so be warned about the following part. What peeved me a bit about one level that takes place in an alien space ship was that the entire place is extremely disorienting. Although that bit still looks extremely gorgeous graphics-wise, I found myself moving through the same looped corridor about five times before I found the right way by accident and the beauty loses something if it is forced upon you for so long. Another annoying part was one section where your squadmate, ‘Prophet’, has a damaged nanosuit which means you have to escort him and bring him to some kind of heat source every few seconds to prevent him from dying. It is not even hard at all and the combat is not harder with him around, so the entire thing just feels like a silly delay.  On the side, I found the game’s soundtrack to be very unimaginative. It does nothing to increase the atmosphere.So, in conclusion I would certainly recommend Crysis, even today. Although the graphics don’t excel anymore and the story is pretty rubbish, the gameplay is still very nice and you have plenty of liberty to explore the nanosuits potential, and that certainly outweighs the game’s few issues.

												One of the best shooters I have ever played. Actually one of a kind. I have not played the last one (Crysis 3) but I did play Crysis Warhead (good game too) and Crysis 2.When playing Crysis 2 I had the feeling that Crysis had better detailed graphics on some points. I had played it on xp and replayed it on Win 7 64-bit (no problems encountered on this system) and I have to say the graphics of the characters are much better in Crysis compared with Crysis 2.You have a demi-open world and and also the gameplay you do not find in most games. If you are expecting CoD, this game is made for adult players (you are actually allowed to think for yourself).Too bad that games like this are not made anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have been trying to find a tech-demo with non-linear gameplay, Crysis can may be right up your alley. You need a good system to run it properly because it's unoptimized, back in the day computer enthusiasts used Crysis as a benchmarking tool, It  was the only game that could bring the beastiest rigs down to their knees, the story is rather cliché'but the concept is semi unique. super soldiers fighting koreans on a tropical island. The game has very good mods, the Stargate one for example. I would give this a 7/10 I would recommend it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game with graphics that make me wonder how that was even possible when the game came out over 6 years ago.I got this on sale after I enjoyed Far Cry 3 a LOT, so I wanted to check out this highly rated classic made by the same people. The difficulty seems to be a lot higher than in Far Cry 3, though. I switched from ""normal"" to ""easy"" quite soon, and I still find myself in situations that are pretty challenging. Lots of enemies, helicopter chasing me, and running low on ammo.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's a great sense of empowerment by running through a jungle stealthed up to an enemy base, turning off your cloak and turning on your armour and systematically taking out every enemy in that base as your rifle carefully guides you to your target. The fact that that's just one way of many to go about your objectives is one of the reasons it's a great game.Crysis' strengths are numerous. Gun-play feels satisfying, both the actual shooting of enemies as well as the feedback of toying around with attachments, to the extent that if you played the game as a straight shooter, you probably wouldn't be disappointed. That the movement options available to you wide and varied, from the slow and stealthy approach to the super fast leaping-and-bounding traversal. That you can approach an encounter in a myriad of ways, some because it will be more effective and some because it'll just be plain fun. That these are all wrapped up in a gorgeous visual presentation and audio that gives weight to your movement and minute-to-minute actions is just an icing on an already yummy cake.Really though it's the freedom of the game to let you do things the way you want to that is its strongest aspect, clearly in exchange for a hum-drum plot that, whilst a little awkward, changes tone and direction in the second half to something that is at least a little more engaging. That each objective is punctuated by an open enviroment with traversal allowing you to explore the islands you operate on with no real time limit gives the game a much bigger scope than simply moving from one fire-fight to the next, preventing any sense of boredom creeping in, but ultimately it's down to you to keep things as entertaining as you want them to be. So yes, again, you could just shoot your way through everything, but perhaps you'll strap some explosives to a truck, drive up to a base stealthed, dive out of the car at the last moment and watching the vehicle explode and the base erupt into chaos as you sleuth around it to eliminate any opposition. Or maybe you'll just zoom around at maximum speed punching your targets and sending them flying into walls. It's your choice.Whilst the freedom in play is reduced in the second half of the game with the plot's directional change, the feeling of the hunter is swapped around and instead of using your suit's powers for offensive actions, you're using them to survive in any manner you seem most suitable. With a pace that's consistent and overall length that is neither too short nor overstays its welcome as well as proving as much replayability as you have creativity, Crysis is a great first person shooter with a high quota for enjoyment.

												Excellent game that allows you to play how you want to play. The story line is mostly alright until the end mission where my game glitched and i spent a frustrating amount of time trying to lock onto the mother ship which completely killed the ending for me. The conclusion also felt a bit underwhelming, could have done with a bit more closure on how it panned out. Overall, worth a play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant FPS that keeps you attached. Insane graphics and gameplay. Story takes a few wild turns, starting off as a typical military super soldier game to a crazy alien fight, run for your life situation.Nomad isn't much of a protagonist, but he progresses as one of the most important characters in the Crysis universe for being a sort of first contact with the alien epidemic.As for the game, it's Crytek, and while their stories are the most polished, their games are the most polished. The graphics at the time in 2007 were meanth to run on machines and graphics cards that didn't exist yet, so it was obvious that this title, and the devs wwere ahead of its' time.9.2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite simply the greatest game of all time. If you choose to buy it, I thoroughly suggest the Tactical Expansion Mod you can get online for free. Adds a TON of weapons and rebalances the game somewhat. My first playthrough, I played it like a shooter with cloak. Stealth killed a bunch of dudes with silenced weapons, occassionally went rambo. But soon I realized that while that is really fun its still not the most fun way to play this game. What I started doing was turning my nanosuit to speed mode, running into enemy encampments, switching to strength mode after I've built up momentum and doing a superjump, preferably over a fence or up a balcony to deliver an absolute wrath of god punch that obliterates some poor korean. Or leaving one guy alive as you superjump from building to building and laugh as he tries to hit you. If you run at enemies at superspeed, you knock them down without dealing damage. If you jump on top of a guy trying to get up you knock him down again. If you jump on top of a guy he won't detect it. I've spent hours just trolling the NPCs, whether it be by doing that or picking up bulletproof objects and slowly walking at them while shouting ""I AM BULLETPROOF"" before throwing it at them in strength mode. Strapping C4 to barrels and vehicles and driving or throwing them into groups of enemies. Tactical expansion adds among a lot of other things a lot more explosives, such as like 4 or 5 nuclear grenades and explosive ammunition hidden through the levels that are incredibly op and entertaining to use. I'd buy this game for $100 and if it had 1990s graphics. The far cry series, dishonored, metro, half life, bioshock, deus ex, I've played through a lot of them, but they all pale in comparison to the brilliance and unending fun that is this game. If at any point you feel yourself getting slightly bored, try imposing a restriction on yourself. For instance, I've gotten to the aliens part using only my fists, c4 and landmines, and without using cloak.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is just an awesome game, which came out in 2007 and remained the benchmark for hardware for many years preceeding it's release. ""But can it run Crysis?""Forget multiplayer, as Gamespy is no longer around, but for single player, it is up there with the best. A modern quad core processor with even a Radeon 6670 will play this game at 1080p with everything maxed out and it still looks great.For those of you running Windows 7 64bit, you may encounter a blank screen when trying to execute the game, this was resolved for me by the following method:-Search for and download Bin64.zip, and extract itGo to:  Steam\steamapps\common\Crysis (or wherver you have it installed)Cut out your Bin32 file and stick it somewhere safeCopy in your downloaded Bin64 file and rename it to Bin32Re-execute the game and now you should be able to play normally ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I played this game from 2007 in 2014, all graphics settings could be maxed out. I was amazed that a 7 year old game, could deliver such an enjoyable experience! Especially as FPS tend to depend alot on their graphics performance. Crysis provided a good mix of stealth, full-on action, vehicular combat and differing environments. Although not as open as some of  the more recent FPS games (e.g. Far Cry 3), it provides ample opportunities to choose different paths in reaching your objectives. The nanosuit deserves a special mention as it adds gameplay due to the capabilities of the suit. Overall, a highly recommended golden classic!Score: 8.5/10Pro: + very nice graphics (even if the game is almost 7 years old!)+ nanosuit capabilities+ excellent gameplay+ semi-open world+ decent amount of mods available on the internet (didn't try any)Contra:- too short; 10 to 15 hours to complete- some enemy A.I. & graphics glitches			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah the infamous Crysis. A game that required such high graphical settings to run it perfectly when it was released, there actually wasn't a computer available that could run it at those settings. Nowaways, it's not such a chore but the game still has heavy requirements. But it shows as this is a graphically beautiful game. But since gameplay comes before graphics, how does it play? Very well in fact. It is a first person shooter, which I usually avoid unless the game has an extra quality to make it stand out. Crysis places you, for most of the game, in indivudual mission areas which are huge. It's not quite an open world experience but it comes close, as you need to navigate to your objective and complete it, all the while dodging or kill hostiles. The other thing that sets the game apart is the Nanosuit; in this game it features four modes, which are strength, armor, speed, and stealth. Strength gives you a super jump and steady aim, armor reduces damage, speed makes you run faster, and stealth allows you cloak and ambush enemies or avoid them altogther. Of course the trick is that you can't have them all active at one time and you have a limited energy reserve which needs to recharge once empty. Trying to balance these out is half of the fun as you need to strategize and think on the fly if things go wrong.Crysis also features a good selection of weaponry, with explosives ranging from a missile launcher to claymore mines, along with single or dual wield pistols, and several different automatic and semi-automatic rifles. On these you can equip iron, or reflex sights, silencers, scopes, whatever you want (depending on the weapon). Some even offer non-lethal ammo or incendiary ammo. A couple of spots in the game get a little claustrophobic and hard to navigate, and the story isn't the game's strong point (secret U.S. rescue mission near Korea goes wrong, and aliens appear out of nowhere requiring fighting against both the aliens and Korean troops) but it's worth a pickup. Of note is the fact that online multiplayer for this game is being shut down in Summer of 2014 so when purchasing, keep in mind you'll have only the single player campaign.The game is highly recommended.

												Crysis remasters the experience from the original Far Cry with stellar graphics, outstanding enemy A.I. and adds new mechanics by introducing the nanosuit. The game is strongest when you are conquering outposts as an one man army in an open world. Unfortunately this does not last long as you are introduced a more linear apporoach together with allies halfway through the game. This results in downfall in gameplay lasting till the very end, which is a real shame. The bug filled and unoptimized game engine will bring even todays gpu's at its knees.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A schizophrenic gameplay experience that can't decide what it wants to be, punishing the player for taking one role for more than 10 seconds at a time, even a well designed engine with such potential for tweaking and customisation can't save this game and it's trite, overdone, and lackluster story. While you can easily see where the influence of this game came from, I am going to complete this review without any reference to Halo. The most notable detail, one that you'll see as soon as you begin playing, is the scenery. The aesthetically pleasing environment of this FPS puts all others to shame. However, while the levels seem quite open and non-linear at a glance, they feel limited. The numbers in this game need a serious overhaul and a definite position on whether or not it's a stealth game, a cover-based shooter, or a terminator versus the horde game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you use stealth to any notable degree, you'll experience plenty of, ""Hm, that guy really should have seen me there,"" moments.  They can also see you through foliage that you can't see through yourself.  Just keep that in mind.Overall, the best game in the Crysis series and one of my favorite shooters of all time.

												One of the best shooters I have ever played. Actually one of a kind. I have not played the last one (Crysis 3) but I did play Crysis Warhead (good game too) and Crysis 2.When playing Crysis 2 I had the feeling that Crysis had better detailed graphics on some points. I had played it on xp and replayed it on Win 7 64-bit (no problems encountered on this system) and I have to say the graphics of the characters are much better in Crysis compared with Crysis 2.You have a demi-open world and and also the gameplay you do not find in most games. If you are expecting CoD, this game is made for adult players (you are actually allowed to think for yourself).Too bad that games like this are not made anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis pushes the envelope in the graphics department and experiments with some freewheeling gameplay. The end result may not be a perfectly polished game experience, and it might require a monster system to really appreciate, but it's hard to fault a game for pushing so far past the bleeding edge.

												Crysis is a good game!, The graphics in 2007 are PERFECT.In the beginning of the story, leave you tense with things happening since you start the campaign, a story well done.The characters, each with their own personality and place in history, also well done.And If you want to supplement this game, you can play Crysis Warhead, from the point of view of another character.I really liked this game with the exception of the other 2 ...

												Just to get it out of the way: yes, this game is gorgeous, one of the best looking of all time and it still is today. However, I've never been particularly a good graphics kind of gamer, I'm more about the gameplay in games. Luckily, the gameplay in Crysis is a lot of fun. The thing that really makes it is the nanosuit, giving you four different abilities to use: speed, strength, armour, and invisibility. Mixing and matching these four modes is a lot of fun, and allows for a lot of experimentation during combat. Stealth is also a crucial strategy, especially when there are dozens of enemies you have to eliminate. The enemy AI is very good as well, it works very well with stealth and during combat they will try to flank you. Add in the different weapon customizations, there are a lot of combinations to use in enemy encounters that it will keep you entertained for the duration of the campaign. The level design is also nice and open, giving you even more options like sniping and using vehicles.The story in the game isn't particularly good, but this isn't the kind of game you play for the story, you should play it for the gameplay and graphics. However, where the game really faulters, is in the last two or two-and-a-half hours of the campaign when you start battling the aliens. The aliens just aren't as fun to fight as the Koreans and don't allow for much variation in the ways you want to fight them.Crysis is a great game, particularly is you like experimentation in the ways you want to handle the enemy encounters.  Half the fun is just seeing what kind of stuff you can get away with, and I love that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crysis is what machines used to cry on. The beautiful details are even more accessable to the market now that hardware has caught up. Anything built for gaming these days (be it budget or not) should be able to have no problems running this spiritual successor to Far Cry.Gameplay is smooth and allows you to consider just how you want to approach your target; by foot, sea, air, or car. You can use your suit's capabilities to give you that edge from acting as it's default armor, to improving movement speeds (which due to the open environment is very useful), to keeping you fully cloaked.Story-wise, it isn't very appealing, but overall the game in itself is something any PC Gamer should have a go at, if just for their history.

												Regardless of the date of production of this title, it gets a solid 10/10 for being polished.  That said, it was ahead of its time, and I beleive has had an impact on the industry and customer satisfaction even across genres due to the hardware driven nature of this title. Even if you do not delve into the hardware and system tweaking discussions that can be evoked by even mentioning the name Crysis at all, you are left with a great game conceptually and artistically.  The story-telling and voice/character acting are very seamless, and all the entire architecture of the game design is cohesive.  I was pleasently surprised to see the game evolve from remote island views to frozen SCI-FI worlds that are revealed in a manner that is very enthralling.  The plot and enemy design are the best things about this game to me, and they are why I think it is hard to put this game down even years after its debut (although the graphics are what made me interested in the game to begin with).    Unfortunately, it has taken all those years since its release for me to fully appreciate and realize this, as I could not get to the interesting parts without system lags interfering with the enjoyable quality of the game.  I found the game hard to enjoy at 15FPS, and I think anyone who has played this game on maximum settings without frame drops would not trade the experience. When Crysis came out, you would be lucky to get 30FPS on maxed out settings on a medium-high end PC.  This probably is no longer the case and you can enjoy what was at the time about the closest thing to being in control of an interactive movie on your system. This game continues to push hardware limits, and today is probably much more accessible to the average gamer than it was when it was first released and barely playable without spending a mere fortune.  The graphics are just as stunning as the physics, and the CRY-engine is polished but can be laggy at times compared to more light-weight games (depending on your system specifications).  The most optimized platforms at max settings continue to respect real-world dynamics and rigid body interactions/physics in a more satisfying manner than most competitive games/engines do with respect to fluid/solid body motions and raycasting/tracing in my opinion. I did find the environments and modeling of terrain to be more photorealistic in Crysis 1 as compared to its sequel; however, my system still has trouble handling the DX-11 patches for Crysis-2 on max settings on HD6990 Radeon and IntelX990.  This game is fun just because it is hard to talk about it without discussing the hardware and graphics, but I do think the animation style, branding and abundance of environmental details are what carried this game into public visibility and have secured it a place in videogame history.  At the end of the day, it is a beautiful game with extreme longevity with regards to its visual presentation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game that had so awesome graphics when it came out that even now it stands the test of time. I remember back when I played it for the first time when I reached the Korean camp I was looking at slideshow rather than playing a game. Every time I did an upgrade on my PC I revisited Crysis to check how the visuals of the game.But important: the game is not only about the graphics. It is an open, strategic fps game that can be played multiple time each time focusing on a different style: from tank, to hitman to stealth.Pros:+ Awesome graphics especially, a visual revolution when it came out+ nice setting, open world, multiple possibilities to achieve goals+ large variety of vehicles to drive+ at instances it really feels that you participate in a greater war+ nice soundtrack and effects+ excellent physics+ some scripted moments that are awesome, especially with boss battles+ variety of enemies+ atmosphere close to the ""Predator"" movieCons:- ok, the initial wow factor especially of the visuals after so many years is not there, but still it looks beautiful- the second part of the game is perhaps a bit too linear compared to the first one- when it came out it required a monster PC to play at maximum- some vehicle combats are perhaps too generic compared to the fps part.All-in-all an awesome fps that excels in visuals but the gameplay part is also very nicely done.MASTERPIECE.As a note, in my opinion both sequels did not manage to capture the awesomeness of the first Crysis.  The second one, even if equally impressive in visuals, was too console-oriented, Halo-wannabe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is in depth and fun to play to the end. The online portion of this game is still active and really alot of fun! The graphics are amazing and might burn your graphics card to run this game at max. The enemies are great and you can kill them in alot of creative ways. The sounds in game are awesome and really make you feel like your there in the wilderness. There is a hidden shark in the ocean in the game that can kill you so watch out for jaws! The overall game feels like a benchmark for games to come. Its a great game and i highly recommend getting this game when it ever goes on sale. I loved playing to the end!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been itching to be the badass in the suit for some time, and as our protagonist is an uber-macho ultra-masculine Iron Man, it can be quite entertaining to tromp around in his NanoBoots. However I was disappointed by some of the glaring technical issues which have been left unattended by CryTek since its arrival on Steam.You wear the NanoSuit in the first iteration of the photorealistic experience, becoming the ultimate soldier. Prepare to Maximum your way through enemy forces, alien strongholds and countless gorgeously rendered trees and foliage.Crysis was for nearly a decade the gold standard for performance: ""Sure the server's fast, but will it run Crysis?"" Modern systems can still be tasked by the demanding CryEngine in its earliest release. Unfortunately it has not aged well, and graphical flaws can break the visual flow, such as spawning objects incorrectly and even breaking mission targets.Electronic Arts and Crytek issued their final patches in 2007, and it has not received any attention since, which casts a shadow on its asking price. Do not pay full price for this game. Instead, buy it as part a bundle or in a sale. It is a satisfying experience for the hardcore, and even casual shooter.Stone dumb AI amuses more often than frustrate, and once you learn their recognition patterns, you're nearly untouchable. All that said, this is a fun futuristic if somewhat thoughtfless romp.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best shooters in my opinion.Crysis is known for its beautiful graphics and realistic physics, and that's just what it is. Though sometimes a little bit buggy (e,g, stones disappearing after falling down a hill). The story is build up well, and the open war feeling is mostly real, and you can drive and fly most vehicles yourself. Sometimes I'm a little bothered with the mentioning of what happens, without being able to see it. The Nanosuit gives you great possibilities and the AI is mostly pretty smart. Sometimes I found the controls to be somewhat stiff, switching Suit Modes takes pretty long when you dont have a shortcut.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never thought a game where I wear a bulletproof armor suit that can throw cars, go sonic, and turn invisible would require me to think tactically. 10 deaths later on Normal difficulty required me to revise my strategy. This is an amazing game. It is a game made eight years ago, with still-impressing graphics, fun gameplay, and a surprisingly hard firefight mechanic. The lack of easily being able to see got me killed a few times, but I learned to have a sense of when I'm about to die. Overall, I give it a 8.7/10. A very fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If this game (and franchise) isn´t a CLASSIC, It will be in a few years.I recently received and finished ""Crysys 3"" on PS3 and it´s now one of my favorites games of all time. It got me genuinely interested to know how did it all started for this franchise, so in this last Steam Sale I got to buy the ""Crysis Package"" (10$) which came with the 1st 2 games and the (prequel/standalone?) ""Crysys Warhead"".I just finished the 1st game and (for the time it was released) the graphics and gameplay are superb. It´s as addictive to play as the 3rd entry (even though it´s way better) and the story is very interesting. I loved the fact that this game has a satisfying BEGGINING, MIDDLE and END.My final verdict for this game would´ve been an 8/10.It provides a very solid experience but I actually found a few bugs (regarding the enemies) in 2 of it´s levels that made me restart the missions where I was in. It provides a bit of variety in it´s level designs more at the end but it might become a bit boring for some people in the first few levels. The ""Nanosuit"" is an awesome idea but it´s not as strong as it could´ve been, since the ""jumping higher"" mechanic is barely used and the ""stealth"" mechanic never worked (for me at least) even on easy difficulty. The only mechanic I found most usefull was the ""fast running"" in order to get to the missions faster. Even though I replayed the last checkpoint of the final mission twice, I never got to see the ending cutscene because of a bug I guess.These are the reasons why my final verdict for this game is a 7.5/10.This IS (or will become) a great CLASSIC.

												I am somehwat twisted in regards to this game after having picked it up in the most recent sale.First things first it has a lot of flat out amazing components. Right now I feel like Crysis graphics are in a sweet spot since they are, ahead of their time as they were 8 years ago still great but, finally achievable on midrange computers like mione. FYI I played on a an overclocked intel pentium g3258 and an r9 280 and fas more than pleased with the results. The gunplay and gameplay generally are definitely top notch. One of the strongest points of the game is, the way it appears to me, that it offers a surprisingly high amount of replayability with different approaches, such as relying more on stealth, sniping or throwing. This wide range of possibilities in game coupled with a lot of destroyability makes up for an shooter that even after some years is unsurpassed in certain regards. The story may at times appear incohesive  but is most definitely one of epic scale.Despite all that i was for a moment on the verge of not recommending Crysis for pretty much just one reason. Bugs and glitches. During the last mission it occured to me not once not twice but over 20 times that I glitched through the floor to either die or get stuck. Afterwards I also crashed various times which allegedly madddened me a good bit more than I care to admit here. Those are however experiences that may have been individual to me. It may be, that you get to play this title without anything of that kind happening to you even once, leaving you with a 10/10 title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. Amazing visuals. Excellent play. State of the art, even when it no longer is. It deserves all the awe that it gets ... for its visuals. Otherwise it overstays its welcome with a story which, despite an engaging first half, is ultimately boring, empty and repetitive. Eventually, you stop thinking the carrot dangling in front of your nose for the entire duration is attainable, and by the climax which inexplicably ran terribly and needed to be tweaked, I didn't really want the carrot.

												This may be the first in the Crysis series but, IMO, it is still the best! A largely open-world shooter, with plenty of opportunities for approaching scenarios from different angles.  GREAT battles.  GREAT tropical scenery.  GREAT overall gameplay.  And NanoSuit is awesome, too.  A 'must play'! Highly recommended! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great graphics and single player campaign.  May not be able to get on multiplayer however due to server shutting down.  This and crysis warhead are the only crysis games that aren't totally console ported...  2 was held back by being ported from the consoles, and didn't even have high res textures / direct x 11 without special patches.

												Pretty good game, provided you have an ok gaming rig that can run it.  Great graphics of course, pretty much looks better than 90% of new games, despite being released in 2007.  Guns feel good.  You can choose to sneak by enemies, stealthily take them down Predator-style, or just Rambo it.  More then just a tech demo, and definitely worth picking up if you like FPS games.

												I like to keep my reviews short and simple so I'll just tell you what you need to hear to decide on buying this game.Graphics: 6/10 (It's an oldish game, but for it's time would of been good)Gameplay: 9/10 (It's a bit duck and shoot but you can use trucks/etc and of course the nano-suit which is very tactical)Balance: 6/10 (The difficulty levels vastly change in each stage, the crysis series is known for been abit die and restart)Music: 8/10 (Good sound, never gets to loud or too quiet and everything sounds realstic and not self created)Storyline: 8/10 (This is personal preference, but I enjoyed the storyline, you should be aware it's essential to play this game, crysis 2 in order to get the story for crysis 3Overall: 8/10, Good game, worth buying, good storyline and combat mechanics, fun to run around killing AI with trucks and military vehicle guns and so on, Replayability is 0/10 because the storyline is 80% of the sticking point, it's almost impossible to play again and enjoy unless you're trying to achieve a personal goal with a different difficulty.

												08-Aug-2016 :  Finished main storyEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :I never had a chance to play this game back in 2007 because I didn't have the hardware strong enough to run it. Now that I have, boy, the graphics quality still doesn't show it's age. Technically, I didn't have any problem running this with newer hardware in Windows 10 environment, but I have problems with the gameplay aspects. First, the difficulty. I play this on Normal setting but I felt like playing on Hard. The nano-suit energy battery drained really quick. The ammo is scarce. The enemies are everywhere. The stealth and tactical approach are broken. I tried going Predator when infiltrating an enemy base and the cloaking device auto-disabled before I even had a chance to do any stealth kill because the battery already drained. The sniper rifle doesn't have suppresor and really hard to aim enemy from far away, so tactical approach by cloaking and sniping almost always ended with direct combat. Second, although the game is a sandbox, you really don't have any reason to exploring the island. Third, some of the level are frustrating because the game doesn't give  clear explanation on what to do. The final mission for example, you have to survive swarm of enemies and kill the boss using a special gun, but no explanation given on how to use it (you can't just shoot it). So between shooting the swarm of enemies, salvaging ammo, dodging deadly flames and attacks, you have to figure out yourself how to use this new special gun and keep dying in the process. Really annoying.The story is mediocre, little bit boring for my taste. The multiplayer doesn't work anymore because the servers were closed in 2014. Overall, a really good and innovative game back in 2007, but for today, I suggest save your time and play newer games instead.CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												***Written in a nostalgic saturday night***I started playing it when I was 13 years old, back in March 2008, I had to buy a new graphics card for my computer, an nVidia 9600GT, to be able to run the game with almost everything at minimum. And well, that breathtaking HALO jump intro hooked me into an incredible game with features that I hadn't experienced before. My mind was completely blown with this game. I played hours and hours and I enjoyed it so much, too bad my parents wouldn't let me play as much I wanted :(**tears running down my face**I even enjoyed with the most simple things I could do in this game, like picking up a cute turtle or a chicken, and throw it hundreds of meters away. Or hiting those tropical buildings smashing them into pieces, or driving like a crazy driver, or having a swim on a paradise beach while the sun was setting and some northkoreans were yelling strange things...**maximum nostalgia**Now, time for my subjective and totally parcial review. I can only give this game a 10/10 because what it meant at that time: -no one ever had done a similar gameplay concept before-the graphics were very advanced, and even today looks really nice-The crytek engine, it was mind-blowing. At that time, who could ever think that it would possible to have so much freedom in a game? that it would be possible to pick up random animals and throw them away or even use them as weapons?-The multiplayer, it put very well all that freedom into an online gameplay with a fair amount of players and very big maps-To sum up, it became a reference in no time after release. Everyone would use it as a reference when comparing graphics , when building a new PC, when comparing gameplay features.... And the famous words ""NASA computer"" became one of the most used for years thanks to this game. Can the NASA computers run it today with all settings at max? :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very innovative at the time of release. Definitely a game that stands out from the crowd.The graphics were godlike when it came out, but by today's standards they're just ""pretty good."" The visual wow-factor is gone, but the gameplay is still entirely enjoyable. Storyline is pretty cool, too, but it unfolds in a fairly linear manner, and that's a bit of a turnoff for me.Overall, totally worth buying and playing. But certainly not deserving of the ""OMG YOU HAVEN'T LIVED UNTIL YOU PLAY THIS GAME"" kind of praise.///////////////////////BLACK3Y3 rating: 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My problem with Crysis was that for a really long time I wanted to play this game but I didn't have a PC capable of handling it. Finally, when I got one back in the day, I fired the game up and after an hour I was like… meh. Is that all? I kept thinking.This had probably much to do with the fact that I was so much of a 'Call of Duty kid' that anything even remotely less resembling a railway, heavily scripted, cinematic shooter seemed like something worse to me. That's just the way I've been shaped by starting my journey with Modern Warfare franchise.However, after several years I came to appreciate the 'sandbox' experience in Crysis and I think it's actually really good. Especially given the fact that most of us now have the PCs able to run it on high settings and the game is quite cheap as well. If you haven't played it and you're a fan of shooters, you definitely should. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While Crysis' story was never really anything special to begin with, it certainly gets the job done. It takes some unexpected twists and turns along the way, and it does lead to a fairly interesting conclusion, but all in all it's clear that this is a game of gameplay over story. If you want something with a story that will rival franchises like Half-Life or Bioshock, you're looking in the wrong place. The story of all the Crysis games combined serves only one purpose, and that purpose is to give you a reason for going from A to B if wanderlust alone isn't going to cut it.Now then, how is the gameplay?The gameplay is great. It's everything you expect in a modern shooter - Decent-to-good AI, a nice selection of satisfying weaponry, explosives and gadgets. The Nano-Suit turns out to be one of the most interesting features in any FPS since the Gravity Gun, and the game is ripe for multiple playthroughs thanks to all of your options and the, at times, huge maps that you can get lost in. Crysis is perhaps the flagship of what a liniear open-world game can be - No, you're never really 'free' but you don't feel like you're being pushed through a bottleneck - because you're not! What Crysis likes to do is to give you a fairly simply objective, a huge map, and then basically leave it up to you as to how you go about completing your mission. You can go in guns blazing, blowing up enemies left, right and center, or you can play it like you would any stealth game, capitalizing on your ability to turn invisible. Graphically there's not really much to say. You can pick up and play this game today, and you won't be disappointed. Even by our current standards, this game arguably looks better than a lot of new releases. The low pricetag also means that it's going to outclass a lot of otherwise very competent indi-shooters. Definitely an all-time classic for me, and in my opinion the best game in the series.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Graphics are still nice (of course, it's crysis after all), story is cool so far and combat is awesome with the interesting suit abilities (I recommend playing on hard as it forces you to use them and the environment more tactically, though the unfrequent autosave means you lose a lot of progress by dying).Bought it for $5 during the summer steam sale. 5 well spent bucks indeed!
