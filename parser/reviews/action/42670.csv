												Singularity is something of an underappreciated FPS from a somewhat underappreciated developer. Having already put out classics like Heretic, Hexen and Jedi Knight II, Raven again went on a solo effort with Singularity in 2010 and it was largely deemed 'pretty good' by reviewers. However, I think it's much more than that. Although hamstringed a little by a few modern FPS conventions, Singularity does a great job of feeling like a classic shooter, ending up somewhere awkward between Serious Sam and Call of Duty.To its merit however, the enemies are smart and strong despite being a little cliché, the weapons all have a lot of punch and character, even if they're a machine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, etc. and there's many secrets, upgrades, and places to explore despite being a mostly linear game. In short, Raven seemed to want to make this game much more than the sum of its parts, and in my eyes, they completely succeeded. The time manipulation mechanic, despite being vital to progress, seems more like icing on the cake than a core game mechanic however, so don't expect anything more spectacular than an amazing FPS with some additional superpowers!Average Game Length? I took around 8 hours to get through the story on the hardest setting, it could take more or less depending on your skill or desire to be a completionist.A Bit Like? TimeShift, BioShock Is It Fun? The TMD provides some serious fun, the story is engaging and the weapons make mincemeat out of your enemies, a big yes.Worth The Price? £14.99 is pretty much half the price of a retail title, fitting considering you'll be lucky to get a multiplayer game going given the game's age and lack of popularity. For the price, the solo campaign is more than worth it although consider carefully that that's all you'll be getting out of it if you're on the fence.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What do you get when you combine Half-Life, Fallout and Bioshock? Singularity!Even if you only liked one of those games, you will most definitely enjoy this.Singularity might look like a jump scare fest. Not to worry, it plays and feels more Sci-fi than Horror.A Few Features include:* Heavy on gameplay.* Light on ""cinematic experiences.""* Upgradable Character and Time Manipulation Abilities.* Around 10 hours to complete the game.* Highly optimized - It runs REALLY well.* Creepy Enemies.* TONS of secrets, lore and currency to collect.* 2 weapon load-out.******All weapons are upgradable and plenty of opportunity to play with what you prefer.Asking $30 for this title is a bit too steep.You might have to wait a while for the game to go on sale...I waited over a year for it to go 75% off.Check Amazon or Greenman Gaming for a better deal.

												If you like the Half-Life, Bioshock, and F.E.A.R. series, horror and military shooters in general, and have a nack for depressing, sometimes confusing (duh.) time-travel stories involving a pony, this fine ""best of"" remix is for you. The story isn't spectacular per se, but it does a great job of keeping you interested and guessing what's going to happen next during the roughly 8-12 hours it is going to take you to complete it, depending on the level of difficulty and how interested you are in reading notes and listening to audio logs and ponies, which is optional.I recommend starting to play this when you can play through it in one sitting, allowing yourself to get sucked into the world and its story about a pony that...Wait, pony? There wasn't a pony... it wasn't supposed to be in this... ruined the whole review... I need to travel back to the beginning and erase it... set things right... I'm sure nothing can go wrong. Wish me luck, comrade.			",193,24,0,4,4,0,6

												Bioshock, Half-Life 2 and Call Of Duty had a party, drank too much Vodka and had a gangbang. What was born after that party is Singularity. A decent shooter with an interesing mechanics that sometimes blatantly copies from each of the named games. It is fun, it is atmospheric and despite all the cliches and repetitions manages to have you play it without looking at the time, 7/10 for the decent game from 2010. URA!			",232,25,3,11,10,2,20

												Rating 8.5/10Overview: Underrated First Person ShooterThe Good:+ The story is about time travel and trying to change the past to affect the future. It doesn't provide anything new but it does make the game more interesting particularly when you travel between the past and present and see the changes in the environment. + Good atmosphere featuring a post apocalyptic setting + Creative weapons that feel great to use and can be upgraded by finding upgrade kits scattered throughout the levels. + In addition to weapon upgrades, you will find blueprints and experience to upgrade your character. It provides a nice rpg element to the game.   + Good sense of pacing - The levels feel different, the gameplay changes up every once in a while, it never feels like you're doing the same thing over and over again despite shooting down hordes of enemies. + Despite the linear nature of the game and the levels, exploration is heavily rewarded in the form of experience. + The main premise of the game is that you are given a time manipulation device used to age/renew objects for some light puzzle solving. It's a good premise but I never felt like they fully utilized it.  + Nice boss battles+ Good buildup to the end of the game and a solid endingThe Average:The graphics even for its time doesn't really stand out, textures are very bland. The Bad:- no sub title option- audio bug that needs to be fixed (check forum for soultion) - Multiplayer is deadConclusionThis game borrows different ideas from different games and puts it all together in one satisfying package. This is a very underrated game that deserved more success, too bad Activision thought differently and sent it out to die upon release. If you are looking for a FPS game and still haven't gotten Singularity then do yourself a favor and pick it up, you won't regret it. ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Just finally got around to playing this.  A bit older style game, reminiscent of Half-Life 2 or Timeshift, but very fun.  There aren't many FPS games like this anymore that have a good story and require gaming skills to play.  The interestesting story coupled with unique weapons (particularly the ability to create time slowing bubbles) make this a great game that doesn't feel like just another shooter game.  The endings were a bit disappointing, but all-in-all worth the experience.			",310,78,5,78,28,2,71

												Singularity, Singularity Singularity, what a gem of a game. Alright, I am not going to lie, I played this at a friends house and did not know what to expect, other than the fact the reviews were meh and the game looked cool. I have to admit, I REALLY like this game. Like, I liked it more than Bioshock Infinite.Gameplay: The gameplay is very fun and straight forward, the gunplay is intense and satisfying, you get a cool device that supports you in fights and puzzles, and while linear, you are rewarded well for exploring. You get the standard FPS arsenal with some extra twists, a revolver, a assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle (which slows down time when scoped), a rifle which fires spikes into your enemies and explodes on them, a grenade launcher that allows you to control the grenades, and a minigun. Two more weapons you get are limited in ammo but fun as hell to use, these are the rocket launcher (self explanatory) and the seeker rifle, which when fired, allows you to control the bullet which explodes on enemies. Weapons can be upgraded throughout the game to level up damage, mag size or reload speed, so you can pick your favorite gun and when tougher foes appear, it wont become useless. Now the TMD you get is a nifty little device, it allows you to control time in your advantage, so you can use it to solve puzzles, pick up useful items and bring them to you (like the gravity gun in Half Life), age enemies to the point they are dust, or change the environment (mostly used for puzzles, or to get extra goodies such as health and ammo) I did enjoy the gameplay more than Bioshock Infinite, since the games play VERY similarly, but in Singularity I find the upgrades for my guns and character a lot more fun then in Infinite, and the fact that the game has better ammo economy then in Infinite, and while I love myself a 'oh sh!t' situation, Infinite hardly gave me any ammo to work with, most weapons just carried a spare clip or two, while in Singularity you are given enough ammo to last a firefight or two, but its enough to where you should think about what you are using. I know it may be a small part of the game to nitpick but lack of ammo can really slow down the pace of a game. (also, this game can be REALLY hard at some points, not frustrating hard but challenging, this is on the normal difficulty too)(The game took me 8 hours to beat my first time playing it on the Xbox 360, then 5 hours through playing it on the PC, I am judging this game only on single player, as I have yet to play multiplayer)Graphics: The graphics get the job done, they look pretty damn good like any other game nowadays, explosions are magnificent and the sci-fi elements are colorful and cool to look at. Not much to say honestly, other then some areas where textures take a second to appear or kinda mess up but that is kind a small complaint from me.Sound: Same as in the graphics, not much to say really, the weapons sound powerful and the voice acting gets the job done. Also a nice shoutout to some creepy atmospheric sounds you hear when the game gets creepier.Story: While the story is not the best, the story kept me interested through the whole game, with a cool ending to boot. The story in a nutshell is you are sent to a Russian island of Katorga 12 to investigate some weird crap going down, your helicopter is shot down, and you are left to find your friends and gtfo the island, but some more crap complicates with a huge Singularity that has been on the island for quite some time that has been mutating people and creating rifts in time. Backstory on the island and what has been going on is told through notes to be found, writing on walls and tape recorders which are fairly interesting to listen to (Although I will complain they lack any form of subtitles) The things you find that give you story gives the story a good amount of life as you hear or read what the people think as the Singularity fails and the mutants and military take action. Like I said, the story may not be the best, but it is interesting and fun to go through. The game does remind me of Bioshock Infinite like I said before, with the game playing very much like it, the audio logs and time travel, but honestly I though the time travel parts and bits of the story were done better in Singularity)Conclusion: Honestly, if you want a fun FPS adventure, give this game a try. I know it did not review the best and not everyone has heard of it, but I find it as a nice little gem. The story is a nice medium length and interesting, and I liked the gameplay a lot. I'll give this game a 9/10, the story could be better, and the graphics kinda mess up at points, but I really enjoyed myself, I even played the game twice through (kinda back to back) because I liked it so much.EDIT: I strongly recommend you play on hard for your first play through, you progress through the game but enemies tend to fall off, but on hard the game stays consistent with your upgrades and provides a mostly fair challenge.

												Singularity is a FPS game that takes place in a small Russian controlled island, where they conduct dangerous experiments involving a new element called E-99. This is triggered by their fear of America's knowledge of Atomic Energy and in that island they found an element that greatly surpasses that power. The problems arise due to the Russian's overworking everyone on the island and with everyone handling a potentially dangerous new source of energy, an accident inevitably happens. That is when you, an American soldier named Renko and a second team are sent in to investigate. Before you can land, a shock-wave causes both helicopters to go out of control and leaves you as the only known survivor. You land in a small abandoned dock village and make your way into a building full of old timey Russian propaganda, map of the island's facilities and a statue of Joseph Stalin's head. Another shock-wave appears and suddenly the room is full of people and on fire. As you try to make your way out of the crumbling building, you rescue a man from death. The shock-wave wave reappears and you are now by yourself and notice that the statue of Stalin's head is now replaced with that of the man you saved. This is where our adventure truly begins.The environments are now off somehow, you can't put your finger on why but you know you are in danger. The opening scene has amazing atmosphere and a lingering sense of dread since you are unarmed. You go through quite a bit being unarmed and the tension of not knowing what is out there is used very effectively. Ghosts appear from time to time that show the last moments of the deceased and the stories of what happened to your surroundings. This game does a great job at pulling you in and getting you interested in the twisted world you find yourself in. Eventually you do get a pistol to defend yourself from the horrors that await, but it is very weak and there is limited ammo to be had. How I wish the game would have stayed this way, but atlas you run into both an assault rifle and a shotgun in quick succession, immediately destroying any fear you may have of what lurks in the shadows since you are now armed to the teeth with powerful weapons. That issue only worsens as you are granted more and more powerful weapons as the story goes on. You can only carry two weapons of any type at a time but ammo is very frequent and I never found myself lacking in ammo. Weapon kits are scattered about that allow you to upgrade your already powerful weapons. This game got very easy, real fast on the Normal difficulty. If you have decent experience with the genre or want to maintain the horror aspect, I would recommend going for hard the first time through.Besides your weapons, you will also be able to upgrade yourself with E-99 to allow you to run longer, hold your breath underwater longer and much more. Well since the fact that you being able to manipulate time is the game's first selling point I suppose it's not a spoiler to say that you will have other-worldly powers that you can also upgrade. These are a very nice addition to the game and gives you many more options during fights such as aging people into corpses or tossing an explosive your enemies’ way to name a few. Your powers are not unlimited however and are reliant on energy which slowly refills over time. It does add to the problem of being an overpowered killing machine with no need to fear anything, but it is a ton of fun to freeze time around a group of enemies, shooting them all in the face and unfreezing time before they knew what hit them. Thankfully one feature that helps alleviate you feeling like you can't be killed is that your health does not regenerate. If you are careless in fights your health will whittle down and you will run the risk of dying by what is usually a laugh-worthy attempt at killing Renko the Space Wizard. Health is recovered via syringes laying around that are used on the spot or health kits that you can carry around, up to five at the start. Health kits do have an animation of wrapping your wound before your health is regenerated making you an easy target for enemies.That is not the only old school feature Singularity has. Shooting without using iron-sights is a viable option for combat and allows you to immerse yourself in the environments instead of having your face pressed up against the iron-sights just in case an enemy appears. The levels are fairly open ended and with the combination of health kits, ammo, weapon kits and E-99 scattered about for upgrades, the temptation of exploring off the beaten path is great. This works far better to get us to explore creepy areas that will probably have something inside waiting to bite our faces off ,than having a random collectible that only completionists care about like most games coming out around that time would have had. Outside of useful items there are also notes and audio logs scattered about that add information to the events that have occurred in the game. The overall story of Singularity is fairly interesting but really lags during the middle of the game, it does pick up again near the end thankfully. For whatever reason this game does not have an option for subtitles, which is both very annoying and odd.That brings me to the biggest issue with this game. It is very common for users (myself included) to have no sound whatsoever until you go through this  workaround. That fixed the issue of there being no sound whatsoever, but cutscenes were still far too quite. With the lack of subtitles and being unable to hear what people are saying in cutscenes, even with my headphones at their loudest, I had no idea what happened in the ending of the game due to it. There are several endings and it is a shame that I had to go out of my way to search for mine on Youtube. Once you finish the game, there is no option to start the game over with any of the stuff you have unlocked and the multiplayer is also dead, which I sadly had no way of experiencing. There are no motives for replaying the game other than selecting a higher difficulty setting. It took me 8 hours to complete the game, so standard time for games of this genre and I left pleased with the experience but the lack of anything else to do may be a turn off to some. That aside, graphics are still decent considering the title is half a decade old and environments have a lot of cool yet useless interactivity like messing with phones, sinks and microphones. Enemy variety is decent enough and has you facing both humans and creatures that can be far bigger than you. Humans end up being far more dangerous than most creatures as they have quite an aim and effectively use cover.Boss fights are tense and feature the aforementioned giant creatures that will quickly murder you if you don't discover their attack pattern and weaknesses. Best of all there are no Quick Time Events to be found here. Your movement speed does hamper the enjoyment a bit since like most modern FPS games you move around at a snail’s pace and are only able to sprint for a few seconds. It's not all fighting though, you will come across an occasional simplistic puzzle or two every once in a while. One other modern aspect is that you will not be able to backtrack, so if you leave a ammo crate hoping to retrieve it later on when you need it, you will be unable to since doors inexplicably close and seal shut behind you. When all is said and done however, it is a nice blend of both the old school health system & useful rewards for exploration, as well as newer features of the genre such as story and upgrade systems. While not the horror game it could have been, it is a fun journey with a interesting story to tell. Singularity is a game fans of the genre looking for a single player experience will more likely than not enjoy, as long as they don't mind fixing the audio issue that may occur.

												I very nice hidden gem of game! ^-^Best way of comparing this game is to Bioshock as it has alot of similar themes and gameplay elements but its much more simple with a great story and gameplay. Any obstacles are sometimes too easy to figure out and the game is maybe a bit too simple but still very fun. I wont mention the story in case of any spoilers but it can be confusing but is really intresting and mostly well thought out. Upgrades are maybe a bit too simple to the point where I feel like there is massive room of improvement, you can only have 1 ""perk"" equipt which you buy using ""E99 tech"" as currency though you can use 2 later on ....but in all honestly alot of the perks are mostly useless, With weapon upgrades I can say the same too as all the weapons have the same minor damage, reload speed and magazine capacity upgrades that I tend to forget its even in the game. Lastly, there are a fair amount of weapons in the game....but again it feels like everything except shotgun + assault rifle is useless or at least a dowgrade but they can be fun to try out or mess around with.Minor picky ranting aside its an amazing FPS with very satisfying combat that I highly recommend getting, I wish I found it sooner! <3			",411,91,4,53,20,6,34

												Singularity is clearly inspired by Bioshock. Not as good though, however it is still a good addition to the genre and the use of time altering mechanics is very interesting. It's heavily scripted though and every level has tons of health packs and ammo scattered around - no a fan of that. Also, it feels as if the devs used Google translate for all the Russian in this game. The story was interesting at first, but by the time you get to the end and try to understand the whole plot, you'll remember Bruce Willis from that diner scene in ""Looper"". It's one of those time travelling stories where they make you intentionally confused. You went back in time because your future self made you go back in time - talking about a loop hole.

												An obscure Sci-Fi FPS that never got the recognition it deserves. In my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. It is a great piece of historical fiction as well, seeing as it uses Katorga-12 (an island that the Russians tested atomic weapons on in WW2) as the main setting of the story. If you like Time Travel and/or the BioShock series this game is definitely for you.			",47,1,0,3,0,0,11

												The game is solid, just solid. Everything is above average by which i mean that everything is standard but interesting. Gunplay has variety in different weapons and how you approach enemies. Story is your standard story but has interesting characters. The Island you fight on has been designed well and gives that WWII era feel where you would walk trough destroyed and abandoned cities.Overall the game keeps you playing but you'll forget about it because it is not capable of giving you the feeling that you experienced something awesome.

												Since the game is kinda short (it took me 10 hours to complete), I really advise to buy this game only when its on a sale.But nevermind the shortness, this game was really entertaining - the developers put some very nice ideas into this fps.I really never got bored within the 10 hours, since you get new powers and weapons frequently.Also the story is really well done and kinda tricky. You can get different endings, depening on the decisions you took in the game, wich gives the game some replay worthness.I really can recommend this game, if you like to enjoy a short but really well done shooter!

Teal DeerDevelopers: Raven SoftwarePublishers: ActivisionInitial release: Jun 2010Genre: FPS, Action, Time Manipulation, Horror, lite Puzzle Solving #Worth/NotWorth: #HellYesBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): TimeShift, Project SnowblindExposition, Concurrence and SummationSingularity is a hidden gem of a bygone era The mid to late Double Aughts is a era of semi generic saturation. Not only were there a bountiful number action/FPS games but they all had extremely similar vibes. Not to mention the few that were literally about the same subject. Time Manipulation and/or some sort of physics manipulation. Singularity is one that got completely buried, even more so on PC than the much smaller number of titles available each console generation. Just remember for a moment. Resistance: Fall of Man,  TimeShift, FEAR, Half Life 2, Project Snowblind, BLACK, Dead Space, Mass Effect, Timespltters, Psi Ops, Fracture.. Hell for the sake of brevity let us not forget the other end of the spectrum -- Darkest of Days and Legendary; and the list goes on. I list all these just to reiterate how incredibly saturated the market was. There was no one to save Singularity from itself. Keep in mind this list is omitting however many iterations of Call of Duty, Battlefield and Medal of Honor there were at the time. GameplayThis game still holds up. Granted, it is not as old as some of those others. The guns feel good. The powers feel good. They integrate in ways you may not expect from initial inspection. I only played this once on PC and have indeed played it back in the day so I admittedly have some nostalgia. You collect E99, a fictional substance required to power the TMD or Time Manipulation device. This has two types, one to power more effective means of dispatching enemies and one to spend on upgrades. These are however separate from weapon upgrades. The game also has some lite puzzle solving which will task you from throwing stasis fields, rapidly aging and restoring objects that have E99 present within them usually to remove some sort of blockage. There are a lot of elements from other games I still yet did not mention. It feels little like BioShock at times. Only in it's ”feel”. There is a weapon called a Seeker which allows you to in slow motion control the path of an explosive bullet. I'd mention Heavenly Sword here but I feel the power of referential definitions is starting run out. There is also a grenade launcher that allows you to roll a grenade on the ground under and through obstacles should you wish.  Inserts Insomniac weapon design. THE GISTSingularity is one of those like I said, is a semi generic FPS action game and if you'll excuse the unintentional pun. It's kind of like a time capsule. No one really has any reverence yet for these late 00's shooters. But it's essentially a dead genre. Singularity I think, captures the essence of this era while still feeling very modern.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,94,7,96

												To say that Singularity wears its inspiration on its sleeve is to put it very lightly. The game is almost shamelessly derivative, taking the both the style and character building of BioShock, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2, and throwing in a few nods to F.E.A.R. However, this mish-mash of other games' ideas is by no means a bad thing. If anything, Singularity manages to almost play as a ""best of"" collection of FPS trappings, the ultimate compilation of cool gimmicks and toys seen in the genre over the past five years.

												An immersive science fiction first-person shooter with time manipulation mechanics that I highly recommend to fans of the genre.You play as a soldier who becomes the wielder of the TMD (Time Manipulation Device). With it your mission is to rewrite history to repair the singularity and save mankind from utter annihilation.You have an arsenal of weaponry at your disposal, most of which have a secondary fire. Your TMD also serves as a weapon - as it can age items and humans/monsters backwards or forwards. You use the device to navigate your way through the hazardous environments as well as gain an additional approach to firefights. You can upgrade your person and weapons by exploring and collecting energy cells.Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties are available.Games of similar feel: Wolfenstein SeriesBulletstormQuake IVCall of Duty Series (Except with mutants).

												Summary: Fun game with an interesting time manipulation mechanic, and solid storyline. This game is getting a little older now, and the graphics aren't the latest and the greatest. With that said, it does look very nice in spots, and the graphics do a good job of serving the story and gameplay. The story is interesting and has some great plot twists. The time manipulation mechanic is what really makes this game interesting. You can use the Time Manipulation Device to manipulate time in ways like aging an enemy instantly (and killing them of course), restoring elements in the environment that were destroyed in the past, etc. The campaign was a little short, but honestly I don't mind that as I don't have time to sink hundreds of hours into a game. Overall Score: 7.5/10			",238,30,8,9,13,1,16

1-sentence Review :Surprisingly good game, thanks to its well crafted atmosphere, its convincing settings in an abandoned Russian scientific base where things went wrong, and a couple of original gameplay mechanisms, but unfortunately not great FPS due to its lack of rhythm, intensity and challenge, Singularity is overall a very decent experience if you manage to turn your brain off on all the little and bigger discrepancies of the game.Pros :- Nice atmosphere, intriguing and slightly oppressive- Decent variation of the enemies- 1 good boss fight- No save/load, but decent placement of the checkpoints (with a couple of exceptions)- Decent time to beat the game : around 12-14 hours, without speeding :)- Time based powers offering unique gameplay possibilities- Nice story, but...Cons :- ...But a lot of things in the story don't make much sense, especially the ending(s)- The time based powers have 0 reality logic, it's only game logic (eg: you can make environment older, but only the specific parts designed to do so)- FPS gameplay really lacks of impact & intensity ; it's significantly less engaging than the best FPS games- In Hard difficulty, the game is globally very easy for the average hardcore gamer, except for a few hard passages (which are welcome)- 1 small mini-bomb enemy is really painful (painful isn't same as hard ;-) ), especially coupled to the next point- Our character doesn't run fast enough, can sprint only for a very short time, and is easy to get stuck in crumbles or crate edges while doing so- Loot is somewhat random but it doesn't bring anything (except made me want to load the last checkpoint on a couple occasions)- There are 2 or 3 times more health-packs and ammunition than required to beat the game- You can upgrade each weapon point by point, which means you're very encouraged to always use the same weapon, especially as you'll never lack ammunition for it, which brings some lack of variety in the fights- No subtitles for the numerous video and in-game audio-logs- It misses a couple of special (and usable) weapons... eg: where is my plasmagun ?!? ;-)FOV & Resolution :the FOV in the game is quite narrow so it might not be of the taste of everybody ; moreover, the game doesn't support resolution bigger than 1920x1080.To fix these 2 issues, get this : https://www.flawlesswidescreen.org/ ; it's not ideal, but it's working.

												Average shooter that possesses exceptional atmosphere, detailed backdrops and a decent story. Worth a purchase at $5 or less, but it’s shortness (6 to 10 hours) creates value issues at higher prices (the multiplayer is dead).Total size on my hard drive: 7.7 GB.A large EMP pulse from an island blinds a United States satellite, so the US sends a team to investigate. The pulse originated from Katorga-12 – an old Soviet research settlement founded around the mines of a mysterious mineral, E-99. Even traversing the initial level, pulses occasionally appear, creating “time spikes” that suddenly take your character to a different time; then another “spike” sends you back to the present. The truth becomes clear: the Soviets were able to utilize E-99 to create a time-travel device (among other uses). The device and the two scientists who would control it become the centerpiece of a journey through multiple time-lines to prevent the alteration of history. Like in any good time-travel story, preventing one disaster makes other disasters possible. While the story is linear, there are multiple endings; none of them are specifically “good,” each requiring an element of sacrifice. A decent sense of closure, but it’s bitter-sweet because there was clearly the possibility for a sequel (which has never materialized). Decent voice-acting and character models only add to the experience. The soundtrack is serviceable, but not exceptional.If time-travel isn’t something you care about, and you just want a cool first-person shooter, well, you’ll get it. The fps part, anyway. The coolness isn’t really there. The game is linear. The combat mechanics work, there is a decent variety of weapons, and there are some upgrade choices to be made, too (remember to equip a perk, not just purchase it). The enemies comprise Soviet soldiers and strange creatures that mutated from all the E-99 radiation (contemporary timeline) – some of which are truly gigantic beasts. But the character movement feels heavy and slow, there is no cover mechanic, and chaingun + sniper rifle means you can handle all situations with little need to bother with other weapons. Some of the other weapons are really good – the grenade launcher which can launch a grenade that you then guide forward to the target was my other favorite – and the E99 weapons (where available) are over-powered as hell, but except for specific situations, there is little call to use them. And these “specific situations” usually have a weapon locker nearby, so it’s easy to switch to what is needed, then switch back when done. If you find yourself overwhelmed, pulse the wrist-mounted TMD (Time Manipulation Device). It’s got decent knock-back that can give you a breather when you need it. Multiplayer is dead.But the primary attraction of Singularity is the atmosphere. It reeks with it. Every area is incredibly detailed, whether exploring an old Soviet barracks in the current timeline (rust, dirt, cracked glass, smoke) or traversing a laboratory in 1955 (bright, clean, apparatus everywhere). The graphics help in this department: though occasionally low-res, Singularity is one of the best uses of the Unreal 3 engine I have seen. And because it is Unreal 3 (and highly optimized), it runs great at maximum settings on moderate equipment (I easily hit 120fps @1080p on an R7 260X). Singularity is a fun ride, no question, but you’ll have to really love the atmosphere and story to play it more than once, which hurts its overall value. Singularity rarely drops below $7.50 when on sale, but if it does, go ahead and get it.Notes:- A 3-button mouse is REQUIRED. Without the game-play mechanic tied to Mouse Button 3, some sections will be nearly (if not entirely) impossible to complete.- Frame-rate is capped at 120fps.- There are no subtitles for any language.

												While it's reminiscent of many other games, Singularity is greater than the sum of its oft-borrowed parts. The time & space manipulation in puzzle solving has a Portal-esque feel to it, the gunplay and sci-fi elements are evocative of the Half-Life series, and the alternate reality's sprawling landscapes filled with intricate details and satirical propaganda clearly show that BioShock rubbed off on the developers. In fact, the Time Manipulation Device (TMD) employed by the game is essentially a Plasmid from BioShock – equipped on your hand, you'll use it to do things like reverse or speed up the age of items and enemies to bring variety to combat and navigate the devastated, apocalyptic terrain.Though Singularity is certainly guilty of taking more than a few elements from other games, it puts its own spin on those elements well and creates enough of an original feel to consider it a legitimately good game in and of itself, making the experience an entertaining entry in the first-person shooter genre. The notes, recordings, and projector footage you find from the past (again, sound familiar?) range from amusing to frightening, and help to further illustrate the game's 1955 & 2010 versions of Russia which you jump to and from in order to rewrite history and correct time travel paradoxes. The consistently thick, tense atmosphere aside, this is the game's strongest asset, I feel, and could've been explored more thoroughly. This and its disappointing length are its greatest flaws, though the fact that the majority of players find the game too short shows just how enjoyable it is. When it was over, I wanted more of it, and I intend on a second playthrough – something the game encourages, as the plot twist at the conclusion recontextualizes the events preceding it.Singularity isn't the most original or creative game, and it only grazes the surface of deeper themes (the illusion of free will, the responsibility scientists have to mankind, the inherent paradoxes in time travel) in favor of maintaining a breakneck pace, but it does so many things right that its flaws are forgiveable and, in the grand scheme of things, minor. I consider this a good choice for anyone who enjoys action or first-person shooter games, especially the ones I mentioned in this review as well as others in that vein.			",379,123,5,39,23,5,49

												This is another of Raven's under-rated gems, one of those games that's better than it has any right to be. It's a solid shooter that riffs on BioShock's environment storytelling but with a little less depth, and has an innovative time-manipulation mechanic that's sadly under-used, mostly reduced to a lock-and-key mechanic. But there's also some great level design and fun weapons to play with, so Singularity is definitely worth your time.Still available on the US store, but sadly not on the AU store at the moment, which is a shame.

It has some things in it like the aging and making it young again that I find really cool, never saw that before in any game.Only thing I hoped for is to play with the gravity gun :D So if you like games like Half-Life, then this game is for your!

												So I delayed in writing a review for this game, and while I normally do it after I play a title, my procrastination took over.Singularity is an interesting alternate-history title, but is mostly under the radar due to general lack of attention. It sets the player in a timeline where the Soviet Union discovered a new compound under the designation ""E99"", but something goes awry and leaves the island a ghost town for decades.The only faults I see with this game that could have been ironed out is its difficulty. The game is too easy to me and a few others, and feels afraid to throw a challenge. Another fault I noticed is the music is too climatic for a title like this. In my personal opinion, if you want to get the best out of this game, cram that music slider all the way to the left.When this game goes on sale, I think you should pick it up. It'll definitely give you a nice 8-10 hours of gameplay.			",196,16,10,10,13,1,7

												The story is nice. The characters look good too. But what I like the most is the gameplay. The TMD device is fun to play with. There're a lot of guns but many of them suck. There're a lot of upgrades, but that lead to one major flaw of this game. You can't get all the upgrades through 1 campaign run, and you can't carry those upgrades to the new game. You have to start all over if you want to play again. Just why? It's so much fun that you start a new game without losing uprades.The multiplayer aren't that good. So you can uninstall this game after you finish it.So I say, get this game while it's on sales or it wouldn't worth your money.			",63,7,1,7,2,0,2

												Lowest recorded price at time of review: $7.50Worth that price: TotallySingularity is a game that can be summed up in one word: Adequate.Some quick pros and cons before I go in-depth:+ No regenerating health. Use medkits to heal+ Terrific pacing+ Doesn't overstay its welcome- Can only carry two weapons at a time- A lot of corridors, few open spaces- Really easyEverything else can simply be described as adequate. The story is decent, there are audio logs and notes that you can observe if you're into it, otherwise they can be passsed. Minimal cutscenes, story is mostly delivered via gameplay. However, the environmental storytelling doesn't really make a lot of sense. You'll see some messages written on the wall that leave you wondering things like ""Why would a person write that?"" The pacing is great, at least. The ebb and flow of tension is right on. Which is something that a lot of games like this underestimate the importance of and subsequently flub. But Singularity nails pacing.The shooting is fine. There's an alright variety of weapons. Pistol, machine gun, shotty, sniper rifle, plus some more heavy artillery. But you can only carry two weapons at a time. Which is not a mechanic I'm fond of. I know it's unrealistic that a person could carry a dozen weapons on their person, but this isn't a military simulation kind of shooter. Very much an arcade kind of shooter. Let us carry more guns please. That being said, there is a particular weapon that is seriously overpowered and makes the rest of the game a cakewalk. Not that it was ever particularly difficult to begin with. So once you pick up that gun, you really don't even need a second one.There's an upgrade system for both yourself and your weapons, which is adequate. A simple Damage+ and Reload Speed+ kind of upgrade system. Health+ and Stamina+ for your character, etc. I found myself purchasing a lot of upgrades simply because I had nothing else to spend the currency on. A lot of the upgrades just make an already easy game easier.Enemy variety is fine. All the humans are... well, humans. All the mutants are mostly interesting. Not always the most imaginative designs, but at least there are some diverse attack patterns to deal with. Unfortunately, the game tends to only throw one kind of enemy hoard at you at once. This game's unique mechanic is your ability to control the time of certain objects. And it's alright. You can move certain objects backward and forward through time, like taking a decayed, broken bridge and restoring it to new so that you can continue. And some interesting puzzles and gameplay are borne of this interesting mechanic. Unfortunately, there's only a couple interesting puzzles the devs came up with and they repeat them pretty frequently. So, it's a really fun gimmick the first time, and then a bit ho-hum for the rest of the game.It's a very linear game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes linear is alright. I can appreciate a tight, focused narrative/gameplay experience, which this for the most part is. And there is slight (very slight) exploration. The most typical kind of exploration you'll be doing is entering a room with two exits. One exit is the way forward, and the other exit turns out to be a closet with resources in it that you spend two seconds in before moving on to the other exit. My major gripe is that there's a lot of surprise locking doors that prevent you from backtracking to the previous room. Very frequently, you'll get locked out of a section of the map before you expected to. The F key will illuminate some footsteps showing you the correct way to go, so often I'd light up the correct way, and then go the opposite way so that I know I'm going down some brief explorative path before I continue. That all being said, linear games are fine, but this one might have been slightly too linear.Graphics and sound are, you guessed it: adequate. The game looks fine. It's detailed and interesting to look at. The graphics aren't mindblowing, they're just as good as they need to be. Not distractingly pretty or distractingly ugly. Just right. Audio, same story. Voice acting is fine. A bit generic. I hope you like token Russian accents. Monster noises are believable. Good ambience. The gun sounds are a bit anemic, however. I really wish the weapon sound design was stronger, because it really did detract from the experience a bit. But, y'know, it's not bad. It's just... adequate.All in all, I enjoyed my time with the game. It's good for about 7-8 hours, which is just right for this game. It doesn't feel padded or drawn out, nor does it feel rushed. It lasts exactly as long as it needs to, and it never lets itself get stale. I played it in two sittings. The second sitting was the majority of the game, and in the middle of that, I took a break to eat lunch. And all throughout that lunch, I kept thinking to myself, ""I really want to finish eating so I can keep playing."" Not a lot of shooters give me that experience. It's a combination of good pacing, good story, and not-exhausting gameplay that really makes that happen.Nothing is absolutely spectacular about this game, but nothing is boring, dull, or just plain bad, either. It's not earthshattering by any means, but I don't think anybody making the game expected it to be. They set out to make just a pretty good shooter, and that's exactly what they've done. So, as long as your expectations are in the right place, you'll probably have a good time.			",396,105,34,16,28,4,20

												I've played this game back in 2010 when it first came out, and I liked it. I bought it on steam few months ago and decided to replay it, and there's no wonder i liked it even more.First off, the gameplay mechanics are very interesting and well executed. Making♥♥♥♥♥♥crumble with TMD glove is great, and on the other hand you have around 10 weapons to choose in the game, and design of them is pretty good i would say. Atmosphere is good overall, there is noise all the time, you hear wind blows outside and moving♥♥♥♥♥♥ you hear monsters eating corpses and that makes you feel frighten. So like i said, good atmosphere overall, from the point of sound at least. The design of environment does not fall behind either. First act of the game stands out on that point especially. I'm not saying that the second act is bad with environment design, just that the first is a little better in my opinion. Destroyed Kathorka 12 island looks very creepy. For example, at the beginning of the game there's a primary school made for children whose parents came to work on Kathorka, which was destroyed and left to rot with rest of the island. You can find tape recordings all over the place. Some of them are from the period before the catastrophe, and some are after. Number of recordings makes you feel bad for people left to die there, you hear them talking about 'waiting for help to arrive' and then realize, that corpse lying by recorder is the person which recorded it on the first place.The story is good, it has a good plot, interesting details and multiple endings (which is great). I won't get further into the story 'cause of spoilers... At the end 7.5/10 for me, maybe even 8/10, but game has a few cons, and one of them is 6 hours campaign, which is short as long as i'm concerned. Short but really enjoyable experience.

												★★★★✩ {4/5 stars} Review written 16/04/2016 - I'm going to play through the game again, just so I can make my review more detailed and reference non-spoiler events. Please rate this review if it helped! :)►Overview:Interesting and fun, but relatively short. Considering this game was released in 2010, the graphics are really nice, and the map doesn't feel like you're going down the same path over and over again. Definitely worth a play, as it stands alone from the rest of today's cloned junk. Just be prepared to listen to a number of audio recordings and read notes if you want to get the most out of the lore.►Full review:At first I thought this was an awesome looking horror game, but it soon became apparent that it is indeed a shooter (The start of the game is more slow-paced and scary, which other horror/jump-scare moments spread throughout) Although short and sweet (Only took about 7 hours, which included time spent looking around the map as well as cleaning tea out of my keyboard), this game has a lot of lore and information stuffed into it's gripping single-player storyline. It's one of those games that actually makes you think about what's happening, rather than just going around shooting stuff 'because why the hell not?' - No, this game was clearly thought out, and requires the player to make a choice that will change history just before the ending of the game. Pros:▪ Interesting storyline that makes the player think about what they're doing and why.▪ Well-designed map with hidden rooms that ARE ACTUALLY WORTH DISCOVERING (and sometimes really fun to get in to)▪ The general layout of the levels is nice. The scenery as well as structures are often detailed and pretty to look at (So when you're not getting slapped in the face by mutants or shot at by angry Russians, take a look around!)▪ Ammo isn't *that* common during SOME parts of the game, which requries you to change weapons often, so you're not stuck using the same assault rifle the entire time.▪ Special weapons that have unique uses are extremely fun to use at first, such as the Seeker.▪ Fair amount of weapons, that can be re-accessed from a weapon's locker, or picked up.▪ Neat upgrade system for weapons, powers and player upgrades.▪ Although simple, looting feels fun.▪ In my opinion, a great ending that wraps up loose ends.Cons:▫ Some parts of the game felt boring or uninteresting. But I guess every game has those moments.▫ NO ACHIEVEMENTS.▫ Chances are you'll end up using just one gun about three quarters of the way through the game, right up until the end. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it just makes all the other guns look useless. Guess you could do what I did, and just not use it d:▫ Linear storyline path; meaning there aren't different ways to approach a situation. You'll just end up going in guns blazing.

												This game is a gem which i highly suggest picking up. The graphics may have aged with some textures not really looking great - this though really matters very little when you encross yourself in it's story whihch is told through recordings and notes scattered throughout the desolate and forgotten environment. There are many mini stories which where for e.g. you come across three dead bodies and suddenly you are transported into a vision of the past where you get to witness the final moments of these sorry dead folk. It really pulls you into the environment. The excellent weapon play is really exiting with your standard Pistol, Assault, Shotguns, Snipers, Grenade Launchers with some additional old favourites like the ""Gatling"" style Autocannon and the Spikeshot which reminds me of the half life 2 crossbow but has explosive spikes, all of  which can be upgraded - add to this nicely imagined power houses like the Seeker Rifle and the exquisite TMD which can age and de-age items, phase shift and pulse pound your enemies among other things. It really is a completely experience where your imagination lets you run free when getting into gun fights. I for mone thoroughly enjoyed using the TMD to catch rockets and grenades fired by the enemy and launch these back as payback (another huge reminder of the Half Life 2 Gravity Gun) - alkso enjoyable is capturing enemies in a time buddle and unleashing a volley of rounds into each ones head - wait for the time to run  out and enjoy their heads explodeGames this reminded me of are - Wolfenstein, Half Life, Bioshock, Fear, Red Faction (with the destroying and repairing environments with the TMD and Pulse to see where you go) as well as Dead Space. It honestly has it all and is really worth the $29 if you can afford it and feel like a game which will thrill you for the 12 odd hours of game play.			",95,36,1,6,2,2,4

												I absolutely loved this one. Like a perfect blend between Bioshock and Half-Life in terms of gameplay, in a setting which kind of reminds of Metro 2033 with a story as twisting as Bioshock Infinte. I heard of this game by mere coincidence, as some would say, or rather, echoes in the time-space; and decided to look it up. It is true as many people say, this is a game which has not really gotten the attention it deserves. Maybe a little overshadowed by the titles mentioned above. But anyone who enjoyed those games will love this one, as it is a awesome hybrid between them all. It also kind of takes you back (intended) to a time when gaming was simple yet satisfying. Not extremely complex mechanics and character leveling and ability systems. There are some character and equipment upgrades which can be done, and although they affect the gameplay a lot, it does not really take the attention away from the game. Secrets and bonuses are not that challenging to find, yet rewarding. And there are some really neat references, both subtle and blatantly obvious. You will most likely experience at least one 'jump scare' and one annoying puzzle mechanic. But other than that, it is more a 'aim, shoot, kill and reload' kind of game with a really intriguing story with several endings. Some parts of the story are actually possible to foresee and calculate beforehand, but the twists and time theory will get your mind blown at least once. Needlessly to say, it is a game well worth your attention and money. The game is of a satisfying length with all the classic elements and phases and will not consume too much of your time... he. he. I loved the ending which I experienced, with the subtle hints embedded. There are a major amount of red lines (or stars) to build upon, if one would ever find time to explain. Awesome game. Yeah, buy it.And the confusing usage of cyrillic script at some points were truly amusing.10/10, would love to visit 'Katoyaga 12' and pling the writer again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a shooter so no complicated reviews.Pros:-You shoot thingies with your badass guns.-Cool ideas with time warping (that's a pro) but instead of shooting thingies with it, it's given as a gimmick to solve some really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid puzzles. (that's a con)-Good atmosphere and graphics.-Hilariously bad Russian translations-Good guns for every taste.-Lots of gore and death animations-Non-scripted leaping attacks by zombie enemies that are not QTES and you actually have to aim to push them off (Wow they just don't make that anymore)-Shoot off hands and legs of the enemies and actually feel satisfied.-Multiplayer is really fun but dead, sadly.-Manipulate time with a deployable force field and shoot bullets, throw knives (or whatever you've got there) at your enemies and laugh at their faces when the time flows again.-You can get creative with your kills or play as you want.-There's this boss fight.Cons:-Not enough thingies to shoot sometimes.-Too easy even on hard difficulty.-Story is bad. (or mediocre at best)-Some perks are out of place, costs too much or either totally useless (Why not give them outright?)-Really stupid puzzles that are too easy, why puzzles instead of more thingies to shoot?-Short (Thanks to stupid puzzles.)-Final level is a dissapointment-ONLY 2 NINJA ZOMBIE FIGHTS? FOR REAL?????? They should be regular enemies.-Really low replayability(Though i played it 2 times, but that's just me), pretty linear. Also illusion of choiceThis game just cries for overhaul, but all in all, Raven software delivered a pretty decent shooter with a twist, like always. I'll give it a 7			",758,233,20,94,70,11,103

												This is such a good FPS game – I don’t know if it wasn’t advertised or what as it’s got only 1200 reviews – Just Cause 3 is only a month old and it’s got over 9000 reviews!Anyway, I remember when a friend recommended me Singularity back in 2010, I’ve looked at the official screenshots (I’m quite sure these were quite the same as here now on steam store page) and I’ve been thinking: “Nah, this looks like some cheap horror game where all you do is shoot some monsters” and I really didn’t want to play that game.However I gave it a go and I’ve been pleasantly surprised, the story is really good, it’s a bit similar to half-life in some way (there’s some kind of gravity gun but with different cool stuff), gameplay is great and it’s really an awesome game.I’ve just played it again now after 5 years and it’s still really good, the only thing you notice is low quality textures when you get really close to some objects (can’t see that from about 4 meters away). It’s one of my favourite FPS’s and it’s a must play game!			",140,17,2,10,3,1,4

It has its faults: Bland characters, only decent storytelling, kind of a weird type of ending, and just plain no desirable personality within the game itself; but it is a pretty alright story and a fun game, and you become a pretty strong death machine toward the end with all the weapons and upgrades. Decent 9 to 11 hour experience with v cool gameplay mechanics.

												Played the demo many years ago probably when the game 1st came out but was not a gamer then. Then when saw it on sale here had a flashback and picked it up. Glad I did for an older game playing well and having fun which is what counts for under $9 on sale worth the price. Might even be a better deal at Xmas sale but needed a new game to play now and it fit the bill. Can only carry 2 weapons which is a change compared to carrying everything there is and does add a challenge that way also need to watch ammo use which is nice. Will do an update further on in gameplay but good so far.Definitely worth the $8.50 I paid on sale. Played om Easy mode for 1st play to learn the game. Next game I step it up. I wil probably play it 4  times over the next few years so great value.			",76,9,2,10,0,0,6

												Singularity is an underrated FPS game from Raven Software released roughly 4 years ago. It is a story-driven shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on changing your environment - beside the conventional weapons (pistol, rifle etc.) you have the so-called Time Manipulation Device at your disposal, a device which enables you to modify your surroundings. You can repair objects which is necessary to progress in the story or simply use this device to stun or kill your enemies. It is a nice touch as the device comes handy when in a firefight.There is not much to say about Singularity. It is an OK shooter - nothing special but there's nothing wrong with it. I played it years ago and its multiplayer mode was already dead so if you pick this one up do it only for its story-drive single player option. The game looks good and runs smoothly at 60 FPS thanks to the good old Unreal Engine 3 so you won't have any technical issues with it. I only missed the achievements which are available for consoles.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												I just got done playing through this gem of a game. It took me around 9 hours to complete and I took my time exploring every nook and cranny. Not a long game by any means, but I sure did have a good time playing through this. The plot of the story is unique and takes place during 1955 and in 2010 (Time manipulation). This game is a good mix between Bioshock, Half-Life and Quake with the atmosphere, creatures and gameplay. This has more of an old-school shooter feel to it, which I liked a lot. If you want a great game with fun gameplay and a really good story that will catch you off guard get Singularity. I might even have to play through this again. Oh yeah, did I mention this has three different endings you can experience? Play through all three endings and you will understand the outcome of what it would be like after each ending. I think this game is right up there with other very story-rich FPS games like BioShock, Half-Life 1+ Half-Life 2, Dishonored and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. 10/10 would time manipulate again from 1955 to 2010 and 2010 to 1955.

												This is the first review I've ever bothered to write, but this game is the only one that's stood out to the point I figured I had to drag my♥♥♥♥♥into actually reviewing it.It's one of those games that falls under any radar because of a lack of advertising and buildup to its release, bit like Metro 2033.It's an awesome mash of everything that made the last genre of story-centric FPS games so great, would strongly recommend Singularity to any fan of strong and original stories in gaming.

												I have just finished the game and I am quite statisfied. Good story, cold war atmosphere nice game/weapon mechanic, good enemies, four different endings. The game was not advertised but is in my oppinion still an AA title. Deffinitelly worth the coin. Pros:+story+weapon mechanic+atmosphereCons:-texture streaming bug (often the game just turn of HQ textures on some map items, no solution for steam version)-humanid enemies could be smarter-playing with keyboard/mouse the game gets too easy after 50% completion (I played on normal setting I think) and I did not have the option to adjust the difficulty. -too many grab the crate and jump on it riddles. (decreases the immersion when the almighty hero is unable to climb an a hip-height map item)Overall a strong recommendation from me! (8.0/10)			",25,1,0,0,0,0,8

												Singularity is an odd game. It tries really hard to be good, but in the end only comes out decent. It just seems like they could have done a lot more with it. It had an interesting story, but the game overall was very lackluster. The combat was nothing special, but the TMD hand-device was fun to use, spicing the combat up just a tad. The story is very very short and rather very easy, difficulty wise. Dont expect anything too special with this game. The game falls short in too many different areas. Im not saying its a bad game, but im not saying its all that good either. It was just... aight.But would i recommend it? Is it worth a try? Despite what i said, yeah, why not. Experience what the world could have been like. 6.6/10---Note:  Bioshock clone? No. You can use some abilities out of your hand. Okay... so? Not enough to make it simular to Bioshock. The Gun and Upgrade vender machines? Dead space has them too. It aint no Bioshock either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary: [7/10] A solid shooter/RPG that draws inspiration from Stalker, Half Life, and most heavily from BioShock. If your expectations aren't through the roof, there's a good chance you'll find something to like here. The Good:- Generally solid implementation and integration of shooter and RPG elements- Quite a few interesting abilities, and upgrades are available to your character - Interesting story, fairly well delivered.- Good atmosphere- Soundtrack is excellentThe Mediocre:- Visuals remain decent after 6 years, so long as your expectations aren't too high, or your enjoyment too dependent on high visual fidelity- Difficulty curve not set very well; Singularity becomes too easy later on, due to a lack of balance between character upgrades and enemy threat level / numbers. Also, normal is incredibly easy, whereas enemy damage seems about 4x higher in hard, leading to some early frustrations- Weapon upgrade system is very bland- Can only carry 2 weapons at a timeThe Bad:- Some very frustrating difficulty spikes that will have you cursing at the screen.- Checkpoint saving, not such a big problem by itself, but there aren't enough checkpoints ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game out of all the games I have played from Half-Life 2, to PORTAL 1 (& 2), to Time Rifters is one of the more interesting but odd FPS game I have played in recent years, with a great concept that had a good execution in the conclusion, let's start off with the basic main setting, you are a soldier in what I think is either the Russian Military, US Army, or Marine Core, going to investigate a abandonned island near Russia to find a small town near the docks in ruins, to which, as you explore to see what happened, a big wave of energy then came towards you before you are transported into the past, which was the same area, except newly developed & on fire, but as you are running through the burning down facility, you come across a man trying to get out of a burning room to which you save him, & after so you are transported back to your time... But wait, there's more, the man you saved, has changed the world drastically, negative or positive? Not gonna spoil it, you have to play it.Now onto the gameplay, & mechanics, the hit detection always seemed okay, all my shots hit the enemy I was aiming at in  the right way, the guns are fairly different from real life guns, making them look interesting & new, but in all reality, they handle the same as real life guns, but this isn't a modern shooter as it includes medpacks, the sound effects of the guns don't sound all too impactful, but it isn't too bad, now onto the other mechanics, later on in the beginning you recieve this device known as the TMD, which can do many things, such as making objects age to new, or age to dust, but this doesn't exactly do this to everything, but it is still used while not feeling too much like a gimmick as you will come across new safe's that you have to age so you can get whats inside, or find a aged crate you can bring into modern age so you can get whats inside of it, & along side this you get whats called the Deadlock, to which you fire out an orb that expands on contact, & inside this orb time is slowed down, basically it's bullet time but only for a specific area, so it isn't too special, but it still is an interesting gadget incase there is a group of enemies, never gets old deadlocking a bunch of enemies in a area before blasting all their heads with a shotgun.My overall conclusion, the story itself is intruiging, but what always scratched my head is how under developed some characters feel like, to which, there are pretty much only four characters in this campaign you really meet, now as for the overall gameplay, it is non-stop action, & even when the game takes a break to tell story, it is usually short & fast, one thing I wish they did in this game is to maybe make it more challenging, there are some frustrating areas, but this game is overall easy, & if your an experienced FPS player, I'd highly suggest playing it on Hard mode, cause even on hard mode for me, a player who beat DOOM, & QUAKE, only beat this game in 5-6 hours, & yes, this game did needed length cause it is a short game, but for a short game, it is damn worth every penny (Atleast, on the sale, buy it on sale), as it is so fun, I overall give it a 7/10 Great Fun, but a few short ends that keeps this game from being ""Game of The Year"" Great. But to me, it is ""Underrated FPS of The Decade"" Great.			",339,22,1,18,12,0,18

												The game has an interesting story, has creative design and solid gameplay, it has so much potential to be a very good game, but it lacks polish, it looks like an unfinished piece to me.I like the game pretty much actually, the TMD and the guns are fun, love that Kasimov SNV-E99 Sniper Rifle. And the machinery design is just amazing, remember the TMD upgrading process? Also the story... I took some time to clear the timelines after finishing the game, and found out that the there're some major paradoxes, I always like paradox settings. I can see singularity had borrowed a lot from Bioshock, but I don't think the story was told in a good way like Bioshock. The characters are just stereotype, they come and go and talk, just to get me moving in the  game.  There's just one villain has a name. If you break down the story and see it for yourself, you'll realize it's something big. I hope i can say this is a great story, but it's just an interesting one.And come on~~~If by killing Demichev can solve the problem, why can't I just kill him in the past, why must I kill myself in the past if I can simply shoot Demichev in the head. I've shot Demicev 2 times in the head, and the last time I did it, he's still alive and talking!!! Then he even stood himself up and continued talking!!!...Totally ruins the ending.  Other Cons!The save system really sucks!!!!!!!!!! Especially in the first 1/3 of the game, some people would probably quit due to this, Autosave is understandable, lots of games use autosave. But singularity just saves in wrong places all the time!!! It's like the checkpoints are just placed there without much consideration. E-99 money, story notes, records, upgrade systems, they all pops up now and then to ""invite"" you to interact with them. But lots of those moments, while I was interacting with them, then the combat started, so I had to quit reading/upgrading, because there wasn't a pause in game when you're reading/upgrading.The puzzles are made for the TMD, so that you can use the TMD. All in all, I still finished the game, some moments were enjoyable, the story kept me thinking after the ending, so I would say this is a good game, a rare one indeed! If you like half-life 2 and Bioshock 1&2, you should try this one,			",222,69,0,14,13,1,24

												Singularity is truly a diamond in the rough of first-person shooters. It has a solid and compelling story with a nearly silent hero. It borrows elements from Bioshock, Half-Life and Doom. The game is quite short with only about 7-8 hours of playtime. I recommend you grab this when it is on sale. Here are some key points you should know before you purchase Singularity.  Pros: Fun and interesting abilities that let you manage every fightVarious enemies Dismemberment Engaging story Upgrades to weapons and equipment Great voice acting Cons: Low replayability Linear level design Some textures look quite datedThe game is a console port and has a very low FOV which takes a little getting used to or can be corrected with a mod. However, some mods don't work so you might need to search around to find which one works for you.  Note: There is a post-credits scene! Don't worry, even if you skip the credits you will not skip the scene!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very creative shooter with a cool story and interesting gameplay with some creative weapons. You play as Captain Krencho and you and your team of US Special Forces Soldiers are called to a small russian island to find out what happened there. At first it seems like your ordinary ""Kill all bad guys"" story like in other shooters or action movies, but the story is really interesting, especially later in the game plus there are three endings! Basically it´s an ordinary shooter, but the TMD gives you powers like turning back the time for a rusted explosive barrell. A few seconds later you have a brand new explosive barrel which you can throw at your enemies. The TMD is also used for some riddles, which aren´t really hard but bring some variety in the game. The arsenal is nothing fancy at the beginning, you have your pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, etc.But two guns are really cool: The grenade launcher where you can fire a regular grenade which explodes a few seconds later or you can steer it while it´s rolling over the floor.Then there is the rifle where you can steer the bullet, which is also pretty funny. The gore system is high. Raven Software made two of the most violent games in gaming history: Soldier of Fortune 1+2.Singularity is also gory, but not as much as SOF1+2. You can shoot of limps from the enemies and the human enemies suffer when you cripple them, but they die very fast and the gameplay is about as fast as in SOF1, so you really don't notice how much pain you´re causing. :D Overall Singularity is a very fun shooter and like Mark from the ""Classic Game Room"" always says:Highly recommended!

Especially some of the flashbacks are quite dramatic and add to the story. The game allows to develop yourself and your weapons in different ways, which allows for some creativy in how to fight. However, if you use a specific weapon and ability, the game has its moments, but never becomes really difficult, even played on difficulty hard. All in all, I recommend this game, it´s good.

												Updated review, updated on15/03/2016Amazing game worth buying.This is a underrated jewel, it was not advertised by the publisher much nor covered too much by the media, the publisher (Activision) wanted to pull the plug and gave the dev team a certain amount of time to complete the project, they did an excellent job to say the least but the publisher failed to cover this product and hence it could be called a sleeper hit and perhaps looking back a classic as it pretty solid.The gameplay and the game mechanics are really intriguing.The ability to play with time really adds to the game and you would think you are invulnerable due to this but you would be dead wrong.The aesthetic is striking and really adds to the game while the audio adds to the immersion.The story and characters are undercoooked but not going to complain much about that as i am aware of the constrains put on by the publisher.The multiplayer is dead and was tacked on but was not something you would miss.This game truly offers something unique in its game mechanics and with its striking asthetic and i strongly suggest you pick it up whenever you can.

												I have been really surprised by this game: I didn't expect it to be that good. Of course, the unreal engine helps a lot, visually, but the story is surprisingly good, the mechanics are solid, the gameplay sometimes challenging, the level varied. I did play the whole game without realizing it, and I enjoyed almost every single minute of it (there have been some minor issues, especially with linearity-with-checkpoints-that-prevent-you-from-exploring, but nothing game-breaking, just minor frustration).I did also not expect that much detail and commitment into the plot, which, overall, is coherent and interesting. The endings are also worth it, and the game lets you experience all of them without having to re-beat all of it to access another one.If you're looking for a visually appealing, pleasant to play FPS that is worth a few bucks, look no further, it is worth it.

												Singularity is first-person shooter where you are at a Russian installation and things have gone south.  But with the harnessing of Element 99 (Einsteinium? I don't think it is but let's just go with alternative universe) you can use special abilities (like aging a crate made from E99 to break it open, reversing the age of stairs with E99 in them to gain access to areas, or aging enemies into skeletons and more!) - you can also use E99 that you pick up to upgrade your weapons and augment your character (more health and whatnot)one gripe I have with the game is that the movement feels a bit sluggish (I felt the same thing when I played Dead Island but maybe it's just my preference to foot-speed) - and you might have to play with the mouse sensitivity, but the movement speed is the biggest gripe i have.I enjoyed playing the game, but I think I got it when it was on sale for $7.50 or some such - the game isn't burned into my memory so I don't know how memorable of an experience you might have, but for less than $10 I enjoyed it quite a bit.

												Attention: Technical issue can´t make me give it a recommendation. The game itself though is recommended. Sadly steam doesn´t have a proper system for something in between. So deciding between positive and negative becomes an issue of: Putting out warnings because of technical difficulties, actual bad gameplay or fanboyism. I recommend the game itself but I need to put out a technical dificulty warning with going negative. Don´t take it personally.I liked it in the first few minutes. A mix of FEAR, bioshockish russian something with a nice touch metro horror in the first level. But then.... first of all you can´t fix the Field of view which is set to something around 60, except with Flawless widescreen. A program which I used all the time to fix the FoV. Playing the game and enjoying it I noticed that at some point all of a sudden in combat, in roaming, or in general, I couldn´t sprint anymore. I thought it was my keyboard which it wasn´t. Checked if it was Flawless Widescreen. It wasn´t. Tried different keys, they didn´t work either. All other games in my library worked fine.Things I tried:- Switching keyboards.- Checking windows setting, unplug, replug keyboard on different USB hubs.- Uninstalling widescreen fov program and playing it vanilla- Reinstalling game- Rebinding sprint to different keysI tried to fight in this game without being able to sprint, but as most enemies are well designed and actually throw♥♥♥♥♥♥at you, evade and have a decent AI besides being fast, agile, at least the later enemies in the game give you a  reason to run a lot. You become a punching bag as ammunition is actually pretty scarce throughout the game on hard difficulty in certain levels, but also normal difficulty. I guess there are sections where you have more than enough ammo, but these are assault sections with a lot of enemies. When the blueish time warping enemies appeared, the game balancing switched to scarce ammo with, just 12 bullets in one single ammo drop available for the assault rifle valkyrie. I loved that part actually, it´s a plus. Still though... had to refund it because of that mysterious sprint issue. Right now even checked the windows settings and everything is on default. No issues there. Pretty sad that the game all of a sudden♥♥♥♥♥♥on my chest. Wanted to give it a worthy try as it really seemed intriguing. No recommendation due to bug.			",220,41,2,14,15,3,12

												I've been playing FPS games since the late 90s. This is on my top 10 list.The description of this game made me want to play and it was accurate. Unreal Engine, heart pounding and enjoyable - if you like killing bad guys and blowing stuff up. The added feature of time manipulation made it more fun. I played this game start to finish in 7 hours in one day (easy setting, because you never know). I think I died in this game more than I have in any FPS in a long time. It's not easy to complete the tasks even on the easy setting. Bad guys and mutants are all after you and they all have more power than I expected on 'easy'.[If you ever played Killing Time (old game) with headphones on in the dark late at night and got chills, this game may remind you have that time.]Graphics, sound, textures, gore - everything is amazing. I was surprised that I was allowed to go places with no point (no powerups, enemies, etc) since most games only allow movement within areas that are needed. You would think these extra areas would bog down the game or the computer but it didn't.Take your time in this one, even though it may seem like time is running out, it may be important, or at least interesting, to utilize everything the designers put into it.

												'Singularity' is an FPS that I would recommend to anyone who likes to have FUN when playing this genre, as it is the second most enjoyable shooter I've played in a long, long while (and I play pretty much all of them - 'Wolfenstein - The New Order' is the only one that's better IMO). That was my opinion at the time of it's release in 2010, and it hasn't changed since.You know how (whisper it) some of the ""classics"" like 'Halflife 2' / 'Bioshock' actually have slightly crappy gunplay (despite other great gameplay mechanics), or titles like 'Halo' have great shooting but little in the way of exciting setpieces - wouldn't it be good if there was a game with great shooting, great gameplay mechanics and exciting setpieces?That's where 'Singularity' comes in - I would say it has it all, but, um, I'd be lying if I said the story was all that....Everything else is superb. Funky weapons? Check! Perhaps you'd like a sniper rifle that slows down time, and makes for super satisfyingly gory headshots (the game is an 18 rating for it's violence) - it's a gun nicked from 'Resistance' on the playstation, but that's a moot point for pc owners. Perhaps you'd like a gun that allows you to steer it's bullets, and also does it in slow mo, so once again the effect is rather brutal as limbs gets separated, and heads explode - nasty!Maybe you'd prefer a railgun that lets you shoot through walls? Like most of the weapons they aren't totally unique (Red Faction had a gun like this, for example) but rarely has a game had such delightful ""toys"" all under one roof - or at least a game that doesn't have 'Wolfenstein' in the title......Then there's the standard weapons - pistol / shotgun / machine gun / heavy machine gun, that are all very satisfying thanks to a slick, hefty feel to them, and the afore mentioned viceral results.Then 'Singularity' adds in even more - in the form of a device called ""The TMD"" (time manipulation device) which does the obvious thing of, err, manipulating time. Would you like a time dilation barrier that stops projectiles and enemies in their tracks? Or to rapidly age enemies, or cover in the environment, into dust? The TMD also has a blast effect that knocks down enemies to provide a bit of breathing room, and can also pick up objects / enemies and launch them.And, yes! - that is exactly like the gravity gun from Halflife2.....I'm not gonna lie and pretend that 'Singularity' doesn't crib from just about every decent FPS ever made, but it does so with a skillfulness that many games lack. All those weapons and gameplay mechanics are beautifully executed, and the pacing and the feel of the game is flawless.It has spooky setpieces, blazing gun battles, and tense wave based standoffs - the only FPS staple it doesn't do is onrails vehicle sections, and I don't suppose many fans would miss those bits. The boss battles aren't hugely epic, but are satisfyingly tricky, and there isn't too many throughout - maybe four at most. There's also little puzzle bits, which whilst not especially taxing or varied, are nice enough diversions.Storywise it's all quite competent, and the voice acting / performances are all well done. But it lacks a little something in that department  to elevate it upto the likes of HL2 / Bioshock / New Order. Overall it's certainly much more fun to play than the various COD's / Battlefield's that have been released over the years. I already played it on Xbox 360, and was just going to have a quick look at the pc version to see how the graphics were - 6 hours later I had to make myself stop playing it!My previous playthrough clocked up around ten hours on the hardest difficulty, so it's not hugely long to get through - but there's no filler or duff bits, so for me the quality makes it worthwhile. At around £15 (when not on sale) I'd still say it's a bargain, and it looks fairly reasonable too - there's not many graphical options, though I doubt it would tax most modern graphics cards anyway.

												One of the most enjoyable shooters I've played in years! Half-Life meets Bioshock meets  Timesplitters: Future Perfect meets F.E.A.R meets C&C Red Alert meets Wolfenstein meets Timeshift meets Lost. The result isn't terribly original, but it's amazingly fun.The game constantly surprises with a change in gameplay and mood every 15 minutes. Unlike Duke Nukem Forever, it actually does a good job of blending ""old skool"" gameplay with modern game design.Pro tip 1: weapon lockers allow you to swap weapons, not just upgrade them. Pro tip 2: the upgrades for the ""Deadlock"" time-freezing bubble are incredibly overpowered and yet suprisingly cheap, so unless you want to make the game very easy, don't upgrade Deadlock, or at most only upgrade it once. Pro tip 3: if you have Windows 7 and the audio seems quiet, one solution is to Alt Tab out of the game, go into your volume controls, find the entry for SIngularity and boost the volulme.

												Singularly goodThis little-known title is a cracker of a game which, even though it borrows from several other games, does so in it’s own idiosyncratic and original way rather than simply ripping them off. There isn’t a dull moment in its 10 or so hours of gameplay and the always enjoyable combat is backed by a solid story, good voice acting, some cool enemies, and a decent AI. There’s a wide variety of weapons available and every one of them feels good to wield and most of them produce very satisfying results. However, it’s the Time Manipulation Device that’s the star of the show and this weapon/tool is impressively designed and implemented. It allows the player to manipulate both time and matter in a number of ways every one of which is great fun to use. Graphically the game is acceptable enough, although some of the textures leave a little to be desired (some people have experienced glitches but I had none), and you get to fight your way through a reasonably varied range of well-designed environments. As a story-driven, linear FPS SINGULARITY hits the nail on the head and does so with a refreshing streak of inventiveness and individuality. I just wish it had lasted a little longer, as I was having so much fun. 4/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												Most people that have played this game consider it a ""hidden gem"", I must say that I have to fully agree.  The atmosphere is terrific, the story line isn't sloppy, and it has a little bit of a bunch of different shooters all put into one game.  It's just an all around good shooter.  But, the only problem that I have with this game is probably one of the most important ones, price.  $30 seems like a bit of a stretch to pay for this game, but if the price ever drops or it goes on sale I would definetly reccommend picking it up.

(so annoying)Tension destroying shooting segments.Glowy yellow critical hit places on bosses. (seriously? Why does everyone do this now?)Ubiquitous stair repair. Unsatisfying ending choices.Overall a very enjoyable game. Should take you about six hours to get through. More if you take your time trying to find all of the little secrets stashed everywhere.

												Cranked out this single-player campaign in just under 7.5 hours. This game holds up well 4 years after its release. It's a solid Linear FPS experience, felt like a mix of Bioshock and Metro 2033 in terms of game feel and atmosphere. Time-manipulating powers were different and varied enough to keep me mentally engaged through puzzle-solving and combat. I should note that if you aren't quick on your feet in combat you can get overwhelmed pretty easily, so use of guns and TMD effectively is a must. Story was probably the highlight for me, it was intriguing (though it was basically powerhungry white men vying for power, the events that took place were fantastic).Would recommend for single-player, haven't played multiplayer yet.

												Great game a lot of fun. the story i found kept me interested for the most part. One of the things i liked about it was it was very much on rails type of thing. It seems like so many of the new games are so open world it was nice to just sit back and enjoy the ride, shoot some baddies with a fun power glove giving different abilities. It was one of those games that i never really wanted to play but once id convince myself to load it up id play it for a few hours having fun the whole time.			",48,12,1,15,1,0,6

												I can't believe this game went unnoticed. At first, I was like ""yeah, it's an ok FPS, with some jump scares. That's alright"". But when you get the TMD and the seeker, WOW! The game reveals itself and is freaking awesome!The style borrows from Wolfenstein, Metro 2033 and a little dose of Bioshock, but still stays unique.The action scenes are very well directed and give you a thrill.The enemies have different hitting zones and will die according to where you shoot them (head, chest, leg, etc.)The scenario is rich and adds up to this excellent game.Even five years old now, the graphics are still up to the par.Excellent game, well worth the money.

												I always wanted to play this game and having just completed it I give it a score of 6/10. These days many publications give the impression that 7/10 is average but I dont agree with that so an average game to me is still 5/10.I get the impression that this was a game that had a low budget and perhaps had budget cuts along the way -potentially cutting back on some ideas / scope of the game etc. The unique time altering abilities never quite live up to their potential as the game doesn't give you enough interesting enemies / scenarios to produce that crazy sense of power. It is a shame as in the end I wasn't really excited when presented with a new time control ability - it just felt like another weapon that I had collected. The enemy A.I is not one of it's high points, infact there were several occassions where I had to basically jump about infront of enemies to get them to interact with me. This was not that big a deal though as the level design is very linear which means that the majority of enemy interactions are heavily scripted and this works well enough!!Having said all this I still recommend this game to you as I had fun with it in the way that one would watching a fun action movie. The developers did a fantastic job in delivering a great sense of atmosphere. At times moments were built to a high level of scary tension which did give me a fright!This game had a lot of potential which perhaps could have been lived up to in a sequel but alas 6 years have passed since it's release so it looks like one will never materialise.

												Singularity: Good Video Games.Let's talk about what made me happy:Pride of place in an FPS: Weapons. They are your primary means of interacting with other entities, and damn are they nice. Many of them are neat spins on regular ol' bread and butter guns, and that's okay, but the look and feel of some guns is just great. The minigun has brake pads around the barrel. The shotgun has this neat locking top pump action. The rifle has a fan that spins as you fire. The Railgun has a timed delay explosive charge. Aside from looking neato frito, they all feel damn great and tear guys up very nicely. The other side of this is the TMD, which has powers and upgrades meted out to it through the course of the game and is great fun to oof at when you hit dudes with it. Seriously I was apologizing to AI for blowing them off their shins and leaving the feet standing. It's pretty grisly.Speaking of AI, the enemies are neat too. You have monsters and tough monsters and soldiers and tough soldiers, but that's boiling things right down to sump. They all have their neat features,  You can shoot limbs off the creatures and they'll keep coming, sometimes even after they're ostensibly dead. Soldiers will hide behind bigger dudes and try and flank you, though it's standard tactics it's still fun to play with. Between monsters and soldiers, there's a nice gamut of enemies, but though the groups have a nice variety within themselves, it's the way they're placed through the game that's cool. You'll be fighting some monsters and suddenly soldiers will drop in on cleanup, or the guy you're shooting will be clawed from behind, and infighting hell breaks loose either way. It's always fun to be the one in the eye of the storm, and Singularity does it wonderfully.Let's talk design elements real quick, since Singularity has a bunch I really like. Found Story? Check. Audio logs, notes, interactive items, flashbacks, secrets, all of the good stuff. Oh, what's that, you want wordless little vignettes? You got them too. If you like exploring the world in your FPSs and being rewarded for that with tidbits, you'll feel right at home. Tagging -horror onto your game's genre might have been the ""in"" thing, but Singularity does the horror elements right. The opening hour or so is filled with jumps and scares, but not jumpscares. You're dropped here and there's noises and movement and OH GOD WHAT IS THAT KILL IT ♥♥♥♥. Give it another couple of hours and you'll be topping those guys left and right, but there's howls in the distance that make you a little uneasy. Most mutant enemies go through this cycle of unknown-scary-identified-understood-kill with impunity. You'll get to know their weaknessess and strategies, but not before feeling a little uneasy that you don't. Another thing I'd like to touch real quick is the set pieces, the kind of ones where you'll be talking about games to a friend and you'll say ""Remember that one mission in Singularity, on the bridge, when you-"" and they'll go ""Yeaahhhh, that was so good!"" They're money, all I need to say. +Fantastic design all aroundNeat writing and backstoryMemorable encounters throughout, including bossesHeaps of little unf-worthy touches-Some genericity in places (playing it safe?)Gets progressively linear-erPhase Ticks and SewersExpensive as hell for it's ageSingularity is worth playing through if only to get a crash course in what FPS games in the mid-2000s were like, since it cribs stuff from all it's neighbours while managing to remain it's own beast and being very good for it. It also layers some of it's own stuff on top of that, and is, in general, very good. Time well spent (HAH).			",185,23,0,11,6,0,11

												Well, that was satisfying. This game liberally embraces and extends, and everything it copies, it makes better.At times, it looks like Fallout3 without the silliness (it also lets you inspect a metric ton of flavor notes and recordings); it has a bit of a Half-Life 2 feel (""scifi settings + mute protagonist + gravity gun equivalent""), but much better pacing (and you don't want to kill the Alyx equivalent), and because of the whole ""time"" shtick, you justifiably get bullet time (as a slowdown with the regular sniper gun, and as a harder to explain, but immensely satisfying ""slowdown + bulletcam + bullet control that lets you bend the path of the bullet around obstacles and corners"" with the experimental sniper rifle, the ""Seeker.""), and of course the combination of ""spookiness, Russia, anomalies"" suggests comparisons with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.Other than that, it has a late '80s/early '90s flair to it; nihilistic scifi played straight, by the numbers shooter with solid mechanics, etc.As for the ""time manipulation device"", that's a really nice addition to the game that sets it apart. While you can only use it to time travel when you find a ""rift"" (at which point you can travel back to the time it was created), you can use the TMD to age/youth objects (and later enemies) quite often, sometimes in the context of simple but satisfying puzzles. Some reviews imply that the TMD is under-utilized (making me expect something like Remember Me where they made a big deal out of the memory remixing which then only appears in the game four or five times) -- not so. Or arguably, so but only if you look only at time travel and ignore object manipulation.Things to consider:- The game isn't that long and can be finished within a day / two evenings. I appreciate manageable commitment in a game; you may not. (Even then the sale price of around $3 is more than fair.)- The number of enemy types is somewhat limited. I find that to usually make a setting more believable, you may find it repetitive.- The number of boss fights is also very limited (but at least one of them has a nice setup, even if the actual fight is a bit by the numbers).- The game feels extremely linear. It's not outright painful (a la ""I am alive""), but it's quite noticeable. Sure, it could be argued that that goes for all non-sandboxy games and that after the paradigm shift of open world, there's no satisfactory going back, but we don't even see much in the way of DN3D's ""do you want to take the left or the right air vent / the vent or the regular corridor to get to the same place"" kind of thing that doesn't slow the game down. On the upside this doesn't just go for maps, but for the plot as well: this means no side-quests (on which I've OD'd a bit), and the main plot uses that thing very sparingly where you're trying to do something, then it turns out you'll have to achieve a prerequisite first, then while trying to do that, you'll end up with a prerequisite for the prerequisite, et cetera ad nauseam, and instead of achieving objectives, you have a stack of half-finished objectives ten deep. So yeah, Singularity mostly avoids that, doesn't stack objectives too deeply when it stacks them, and the objectives they give you tend to feel justified rather than forced or an interruption.- This is a 2010 game, so the graphics are mildly dated, but I found them fit for purpose. I have no regrets. Your mileage may vary. On the plus side, even though the game is mildly scary in the beginning (it's night, you have no or no good weapons, and you don't know what you're up against -- or worse, you've found out what you're up against, but still don't have anything decent to defend yourself with), it never stoops to the whole ""It's scary only because you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; level. (If I never have to see a flashlight again, especially one that only illuminates 1/8 of the screen, it'll be too soon. If I pay for a whole game, 1/8 won't do.)- No Steam achievements. :( This is particularly sad as the console versions are said to have achievements/trophies.- I started this instead of surfing when my net went down. Game would freeze for a second every few seconds until net came back, not sure whether ""always online"" requirement, or initial activation, or what. Research this if that sort of thing is incompatible with your setup or principles.- I wouldn't have minded the option of a female avatar. Seeing as we're pretty much dealing with a mute protagonist here, it's not like it would've incurred much extra cost for voice work. In fact as we pretty much never see our avatar, it may not matter much, but then as we pretty much never see our avatar, it would've been all the easier to implement, simply by not making references at all and just calling you Captain, Renko, or a combination thereof.- There's multi-player (which I haven't tried), but no co-op.- No proper saves (""When you want, where you want, however many you want""). Game auto-saves fairly often so even if things go wrong, you rarely lose much progress, but obviously this way, you can't replay ""just that bit you really liked"" or show your friend ""that super cool scene"" to get them to buy the game too, so as in all other games with that defect, the developers are idiots for limiting replay value and word of mouth.VERDICTVery solid single player experience; hard to beat at current price point. If linearity doesn't put you off gameplay wise, or the lack of proper saves, female avatars, and possibly an always-on requirement doesn't politics-wise, go for it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Singularity is a visually engaging fps that does not try anything new.  The game is a good length, has a solid story, a hand-full of strong characters and a nice variety of combat.  The game undoubtedly feels like a side project but a finished one!  It  might not have the detail and love that one would expect in a CoD game, but I was impressed with Activision's ability to begin and end a story with the time that was given.The game takes many ques from other games.  While Singularity might not bring anything new to the table, it does bring a well blended action fps for any gamer to enjoy.  Nothing is taken too far with this game.  There is a good number of different enemy types, but not so many that the player isn't able to learn how to combat them before the game is over.  Also, there are at least ten weapons to choose from -- most of which can be upgraded and changed out at weapon stations.The ""TMD"" device that the player is given adds a shocking amount of combat options.  The different uses of weapons and ""TMD"" abilities with the added upgrading and leveling system could make for another good play-though -- maybe two.  Unfortunately, the fights are scripted, and that takes a bit from the replays.Over all, the game gets a good review because it feels ""humble.""  It isn't a ground breaking or epic title, and it does not try to be.  The game gives the player a gripping intro, good progression and good old fashioned boss fights!  Note: $30 would have been spot on the day this game came out.  Best bought on sale now.

												While the multiplayer aspect of this game is sadly extinct, Singularity thankfully still exists as one rare gem: As the greatest lovestory between two men ever told, without pandering to the usual cliches seen in representations of homosexual men in the media.Thats right. Singularity is the best, to date, representation of homosexual romance in a FPS.Are the pseudo-RPG elements gimicky? Yes. Is the story only slighty more existant than that found in the 'Metro' series? Yes. Is the 3-optional ending choice rather pointless? Also yes.But the tragic romance between our pseudo-silent protagnoist and James Devlin is truly one to be witnessed. A romance that, though as I stated IS tragic, is truly and literally timeless. You must simply experience it for yourself to understand.All provided with the soothing and not-overused-at-all voices of Nolan North and Steve Blum. Play it, and witness this tasteful homosexual romance story of loss and grief for yourself.			",78,9,0,14,4,2,8

												Although short, this game is worth a play through. The story doesn't offer too much to say ""wow"" about, but the way the developers played with time is pretty interesting and offers for some interesting game play mechanics. This is not to say they are mechanics that have never been seen before, but they do offer interesting puzzles and fun methods of fighting the baddies. Controls are decent, the art was decent for the time, and enemies can be somewhat challenging; that is not to say the game is incredibly hard - it won't be terribly difficult to beat if you have much experience with shooters.Alternate history is always fun, and the fact that this game centers around Cold War-era environs and shies away from the typical WWII trope that had become commonplace makes this game well worth at least one play.I can't say that it will warrant a second run through as once you've uncovered all the ""twists"" the game offers, there isn't much to go back to.

												This game is one of the most awesome first-person shooters I have ever played. I am a big fan of the Half-Life and Unreal series and I was in desperate need of a substitute. Singularity was just that. It's a thrilling and tense game. It has realistic gameplay in terms of hiding, running and combat actions, yet it features many horror elements that add that extra bit of excitement and unexpectedness to it. I loved it.

Different than the normal FPS games, it has some very unique elements to it and they were a gas.  I just finished the game a second time. Play is linear but you stay busy. This game ROCKS, pick it up on sale.			",305,43,5,26,14,5,32

												Singularity is a Sci-Fi FPS Puzzle/ time manipulation game. I recomend that you dont get it unless you get it cheaper than 20.00, I'd get it at games deal instead cause its not worth the price it is on steam.cons-not enough weapons (one pistol, one shotgun, one sniper, ect.) -Costs too muchPros-runs smooth-great voce over acting-Good Graphics			",57,1,1,1,1,0,0

												The last original IP from Raven Software, Singularity is a Bioshock meets Metro FPS. As a few games released around 2010, it's a troubled PC port, it takes a few tweaks to the registry to make it running at higher resolutions and it needs Widescreen Fixer to adjust the FOV, but the texture streaming bug still persist (you need to restart the game every hour or so) . Although a few guns lack weight it is a pretty entertainment 6 hour game, with upgradable guns and skills and old school medkit health system.PS: Multiplayer can still be played i believe (could not find 6 people to play with).

												Have yet to finish it, but if you can get this for $10 or less it's a great buy.  First 5 minuites feel like call of duty until it slowly turns into something way more unique.Edit after finishing:Deffinitly worth $10, gameplay is pretty good, graphics are good for it's time (somewhat better than mw1), with a futuristic yet old style you usually only see in games like fallout 3.  Gameplay is mostly the standard shooter, but very satisfying, and has a number of gadgets and gameplay mechanics, playing with time, that you don't normally see.There's  definitly some challenge to be had, it's probably an 8 hour game if you rush through it on easy though.  There are multiple endings, but not very much in the way of player choice (Still more than bioshock infinite).  The weapons are nice, and feel great, though gun specific upgrades are limited to damage, reload speed, and clip size.  You can uprade other charecter stats, though most of the good upgrades come too late in the game to be all that useful.			",1025,273,36,146,107,12,154

												Awesome linear cooridor shooter where you use a gun that warps and uses time to your advantage. Great game to power through on a weekend! PROS:Story is interesting and fun in an 80's movie wayOne of the coolest weapons since the Gravity Gun7-8 hours of gameplay that never really slows downGood selection of weapons to use that all feel good in their own wayCONS:Reeks of late 2000's shooter (Kicking doors to shoot baddies in slow motion, equiping 2 weapons only, the only color is BROWN) No subtitlesStupid easy half way through after a few powerupsI highly recommend Singularity if it somehow missed your radar if you liked games like Half-life 2, Bioshock, Timeshift, Doom 3, F.E.A.R., and Resistance.

												Excellent shooter. Highly recommendSet in a ""somewhat postapocalyptic"" soviet environment this is a classic First person shooter with some ""super-powers"" added besides the usual guns. Gameplay is reminiscent of Bioshock, while the setting and atmosphere are close to Metro 2033.You play as an american soldier sent to investigate closed down and abandoned Soviet facility, where you uncover mistery E99 element and events follow.What I really liked about the game:-The gameplay is very solid. You have good amount of different, well-designed weapons (the game keeps giving you new ones right until the end, that way it keeps things interesting). Also you have some superpowers (not from beginning but quite early into the game you get your first one) and the list of the things you can do grows. Timeshift bubble, aging opponents, impulsing all around you, telekinesis. All that good stuff. Overall, the shooting part is fun and makes you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ The 'puzzles' won't take -The setting. Very gruesome, graphic. Reminiscent of Metro but more ""paranormal"" stuff.What is not particularly great but holds up:-The story. It's pretty linear and straightforward for a game about time-travel and altering history/future, but still it is enjoyable and grips you until the end. The game even has 3 endings, but they are basically the same, just different cut-scenes in the end and you can replay last 1 minute of the game to see them all.What I disliked:-For a game that's been out for like 2 years already there's too many bugs. I've had to restart the game around 5 times due to game-breaking bugs (NPCs stuck or disappearing, doors not opening e.t.c) and the thing is - I've wasted good amount of time in each of those instances to figure out that something is wrong. Once there was a sequence where a girl opened some door and I needed to defend her from monsters. Well, the thing got stuck and the monsters spawned endlessly and I couldn't undestand that something is wrong until I wasted all my bullets, medkits, e99 energy and they just killed me (I wasted around 10-15 minutes I think) and after restart the process ended in like 3 monsters and 15 seconds.All in all, solid title. Recommend to play it if you like shooters, enjoyed Metro 2033 and/or Bioshock.			",125,56,2,16,6,0,12

												While there are not a lot of new mechanics that Singularity offers, they do hit all of the FPS checkboxes. The levels are linear but well planned and with enough hidden goodies that it is worth seeing them. Most of those hidden goodies are E99, the main currency of the game and the major plot device of it too. The human enemies have a decent enough A.I. and the non-human enemies tend to rush you like a giant bullet sponge. The weapons are all the general FPS weapons; pistol, shotgun, rifle, sniper rifle, and rocket launcher are all there. There is one weapon, the Seeker, that allows you to control the flight path of the bullet while slowing down time. Like the killshots in the game Nazi Zombie Army, the Seeker lets you lay out a plan of attack. The Seeker is also the closest you'll come to actually controlling time. The device used to control time feels underwhelming and pigeon-holed into a few uses. It eventually has two upgradeable powers, the ability to send out a pulse to hurt and push back enemies and a time bubble that greatly slows down anything caught in it that isn't you. For the bubble your bullets will go slow and so will enemy fire, but it will still be moving and able to cause damage. Exploding barrels (I mentioned this game hit all the FPS benchmarks didn't I?) don't explode until after the effect of the time bubble has ended. The pulse is essentially useless, even when at the end <spoilers> the device becomes ""uber"" and can rip off the limbs of unarmed enemies, the actual distance the pulse reaches is so small unless something is right next to you, it won't help.However the game has a great amount of detail and production and is similar to Bioshock both in style and mechanics so I do recommend it.

												Worthy.  Combination of the gravity gun of HL2 and the repair ability from Red Faction Armageddon.  Some nice shooter puzzles and decent combat.  Classic tension between guns (two at a time, limited ammo) plus some personal and weapon upgrades.  Good rewards for exploration!  (One hint on that:  Do press the ""glowing footsteps"" button to figure out which direction is forward:  The path behind you quietly closes often, and without warning, when you're moving ""forward."")

One weapon that is amazing is the tmd (Time Manipulation Device) is very neat you can bring things back from ruin and also pick things up like petrol containers and shock them at enemiesso they blow up and kill them. There are a good range of weapons to use in this game especically the rifle that you slow down time and guide the bullet to wherever you want it to hit which is neat.So all in all a great single player game.

 Singularity™ This is one of these, for today’s standards, uncommon Single player Shooter jewels, that`re not exploited too hell and back with sequels and micro transactions. Surely the Graphics are dated and it’s not flawless. But I like a good Story Shooter. And that’s what it does, no more, no less. It’s an interesting Story where I wanted to see what happened next. Interesting premise, not so cliché and 08/15. Gunplay is good, Framerate stable and no weird glitches or bugs. Abilities are good, pacing nice. And one thing so much shooter do wrong: At the higher difficulty levels, you don`t get simply insta Headshots (Yeah, I look at you Homefront).

												Beautiful graphics, great storyline, and a fun gameplay mechanic.Singularity is a hidden gem that sadly doesn't shine bright enough to be a 10 out of 10 game, but is a great one nonetheless.The game revolves around the Time Manipulation Device, or T.M.D. which one uses to travel between 2 eras in the same areas in the game. Depending on which time zone you're in, different things happen.The voice acting is pretty nice, and the graphics are phenomenal for a game of it's time.The storyline, while interesting isn't anything special, sadly, but is still well-written.The game provides several hours of fun and 2 ways to play the game based on your preference for the T.M.D. and manipulation of enemies or just a run-and-gun style.Overall it's a pretty fun game and a recommended buy, but maybe for $10, not $20 or $30.

The gameplay is very linear and time manipulation powers more restrictive than I would have liked, and you quickly overpower your enemies even on harder difficulty. However, the story and gunplay are excellent, and the mix in of horror elements liven-up the game. It's not the best shooter ever, but it's definitely worth the $5.00 I paid for it.

												I decided to pick this up at a steam sale but as a huge sci-fi fan I knew just how many ways there to mess up a time travel based storyline. singularity was amaizing well done. the game play mechanics really force you to rely on the time dilation because your health goes down alot faster than most shooters and the medkits are common but if you try to use one in combat youll be dead by the time you finish the healing animations. over all i would say it is a challanging game that surprising gets a bit easier later on due to the upgrades but you always need to be on your toes. as for the story line its quite imaginative however can be cliche at times. although you really need to look for all the notes and audio recorders to get the full details. One thing that really made me impresed and I Wont give any specific spoilers, but to date its the only game i have ever played that doesent have the player killed betrayed, or arbitrarally punished by karma for choosing the evil ending }:)>			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's just your average, run of the mill first person shooter, but I like it.My thoughts:- Graphics are good enough for me- Controls are mappable ( Mapped my controller like Halo)- Story is ok so far- Voice acting is good- Should have added grenades of some sort- Runs nice on low powered machine- So far full controller supportOne small quirk is that the 'Use' & 'Reload' actions are mapped to the one button. I love roaming in games... I try to  open every door. So when I check a door that is just scenery, it reloads my weapon instead... I keep running out of bullets.... Like I said this is a minor quirk.The movie projector films are funny to watch.			",163,14,4,8,7,4,7

												This is a hidden score in a vast trove of Sci-Fi shooters that flood the market. It takes elements from all the greats (Half-Life, Bioshock, even the eerie scenery of STALKER games) and brings an amusing twist of time travel, Russian banter, and an all around good story. I thoroughly enjoyed this game for all it was worth. Do yourself a favor and pick this up when you can, you're bound to enjoy it.P.S. As with all games, be sure to check out all the little things added into the game for your enjoyment. Explore. Dig through desks & lockers. There's lots to uncover in this ridulous world.

												I just picked this game up for $7.49 during this weekends Activision sale. It's just your average, run of the mill first person shooter, but I like it.My thoughts:- Graphics are good enough for me- Controls are mappable ( Mapped my controller like Halo)- Story is ok so far- Voice acting is good- Should have added grenades of some sort- Runs nice on low powered machine- So far full controller supportOne small quirk is that the 'Use' & 'Reload' actions are mapped to the one button. I love roaming in games... I try to  open every door. So when I check a door that is just scenery, it reloads my weapon instead... I keep running out of bullets.... Like I said this is a minor quirk.The movie projector films are funny to watch.			",163,14,4,8,7,4,7

												I decided to pick this up at a steam sale but as a huge sci-fi fan I knew just how many ways there to mess up a time travel based storyline. singularity was amaizing well done. the game play mechanics really force you to rely on the time dilation because your health goes down alot faster than most shooters and the medkits are common but if you try to use one in combat youll be dead by the time you finish the healing animations. over all i would say it is a challanging game that surprising gets a bit easier later on due to the upgrades but you always need to be on your toes. as for the story line its quite imaginative however can be cliche at times. although you really need to look for all the notes and audio recorders to get the full details. One thing that really made me impresed and I Wont give any specific spoilers, but to date its the only game i have ever played that doesent have the player killed betrayed, or arbitrarally punished by karma for choosing the evil ending }:)>			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had been wanting to purchase this game for a while after reading that it was somewhat like the first Bioshock. Finally catching it on sale for 7 dollars I grabed it and wow. This game is amazing, flew straight under my radar. It's not much at all like Bioshock imo but its a fantastic scfy shooter/action game. The story is amazing, combat is fun and challengeing. The game borrors from many other games and combines it into one fresh idea that is a ton of fun. The game is just fantastic for 7.50 but after playing it  now I would have gladly paid retail for this game. If you're into science fiction universes, like aliens, old war settings with experiments gone wrong, enjoy shooters mixed with rpg elements, upgrade systems, and various other elements, and most importantly love a good story then purchase this game! Easily 9/10 for me and I'm not even half way through yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, you have played all the 'big' FPS titles around, looking for something else to play and you want a reccomendation.. get Singularity.  I have played through this on both 360 and PS3 before picking it up on PC, it is one of the few games that truely deserve the title of 'hidden gem'.  So whats it like?  Well, its a sci-fi FPS, along the same lines as half-life and with just as much interesting cool puzzles and lore.  Furthermore, the story is great, which is unusual for a FPS.  It would hold its own with the classics such as Bioshock.  I won't go into too much detail but it involves time travel and it is quite well thought out, sure like every time travel escapade in recent memory it has slight plot holes but hey your carrying huge guns and blowing things apart on every turn.An added extra is the atmosphere, its a well thoughtout game and the setting is amazing, especially when things get changed by time and you see the same environment but from a different era.All in all, if you want a romp-gun fest.. get this game.. if you want a cool sci-fi adventure... get this game.. if you want a game you can highly reccomend to your friends and feel good when they also love it.. get this game.

 Singularity™ This is one of these, for today’s standards, uncommon Single player Shooter jewels, that`re not exploited too hell and back with sequels and micro transactions. Surely the Graphics are dated and it’s not flawless. But I like a good Story Shooter. And that’s what it does, no more, no less. It’s an interesting Story where I wanted to see what happened next. Interesting premise, not so cliché and 08/15. Gunplay is good, Framerate stable and no weird glitches or bugs. Abilities are good, pacing nice. And one thing so much shooter do wrong: At the higher difficulty levels, you don`t get simply insta Headshots (Yeah, I look at you Homefront). No the enemies simply do more damage and you have less health. Ammo and Pickups are fewer and far between.

												Beautiful graphics, great storyline, and a fun gameplay mechanic.Singularity is a hidden gem that sadly doesn't shine bright enough to be a 10 out of 10 game, but is a great one nonetheless.The game revolves around the Time Manipulation Device, or T.M.D. which one uses to travel between 2 eras in the same areas in the game. Depending on which time zone you're in, different things happen.The voice acting is pretty nice, and the graphics are phenomenal for a game of it's time.The storyline, while interesting isn't anything special, sadly, but is still well-written.The game provides several hours of fun and 2 ways to play the game based on your preference for the T.M.D. and manipulation of enemies or just a run-and-gun style.Overall it's a pretty fun game and a recommended buy, but maybe for $10, not $20 or $30.

The gameplay is very linear and time manipulation powers more restrictive than I would have liked, and you quickly overpower your enemies even on harder difficulty. However, the story and gunplay are excellent, and the mix in of horror elements liven-up the game. It's not the best shooter ever, but it's definitely worth the $5.00 I paid for it.

												Surprisingly good. Although you breeze through it in 5 hours and it's not very hard (unbalanced even - if you use the time slowdown sphere and some tmp upgrades you can just run through most parts). It starts off quite weak but once you get a hold of the TMP it gets really good. The story is rather straightforward but I have to say that I really enjoyed it and it was refreshing to play a linear FPS that was this entertaining.Singularity really resembles half life in quite a few ways and it is really good in teaching you the mechanics. The controls are also really intuitive/good (except the default bind for healing)my issues:One note on mechanical side - I lost a lot of E99 money because in tmp you actually have to equip something to the slot. I missed that and treated it as other upgrades so I had a ton of upgrades for tmp that did not work and I spent the currency for.The lore is expanded via notes and tapes but there could be more of the ""show, don't tell"" visual narrative.Overall it seemed like there was more potential than what the game showed and the puzzles could include more variations (i,e, you need to use the grenade launcher exactly once and then forget about it, modifying time in later sections is mostly used for opening boxes and restoring tape recorders compared to strong first half where it was used for various objects, turning soldiers into husks was fun but rather inefficient shortly after it was introduced etc).

												Excellent, atmospheric FPS. The beginning of the game is delightfully spooky and a slow burn. You're given time to explore for a bit, without a weapon, building dread and expectation. It could pass for a first-rate horror game for the first twenty minutes. It thing segues into more predictable shooter territority, but the shooting is quite solid and the plot interesting enough to keep you moving forward. The time manipulation powers are a lot of fun if you take the time to learn when best to employ them. Lots of audiologs to find as well. Highly recommended for any FPS fan who is more interested in atmosphere than mowing down waves of enemies.			",77,20,0,15,1,0,6

I was a huge fan of TimeShift, a game you should also check out if time control is something you are interested in. The wrist device mechanic was very fun and I liked being shifted back and forth between pre and post-disaster time periods. It was like switching between a horror and a general action atmosphere. You get used to just fighting baddies with guns, and then suddenly you are thrown back into the island after everything went to crap, and you have to remember that terrible things can pop out at you again.

												Singularity is probably the most underrated game I have ever played, and it is, among other things; the most atmospheric game I've ever experienced.I first bought Singularity on the Xbox when it first came out, played it about halfway and loved it, but then my Xbox broke and I couldn't continue the journey. Ever since then I've longed to get back to the game and finish it. As time progressed though, I started to think to myself that the game wasn't that great, and I was just imagining it as some sort of contender Half-Life 2; the singleplayer FPS king. Fast forward to present time, when I found it on sale and instantly bought it, eager to relive the memories. I was ready to get dissapointed and my expectations were actually quite low, but as soon as I booted it up I realized that I hadn't imagined anything; the game is just as incredible as I remembered.You start the game in the boots of Nathaniel Renko, Captain in the U.S. military, on a mission to the remote island of 'Kartorga 12', which, in the 1950's, had been home to various scientific experiments conducted by the Soviet Union. After a terrible crash due to some unexplainable explosion, you quickly realize that said experiments hadn't really gone according to plan and 'Katorga 12' wasn't quite the Soviet Utopia it was advertised to be in the 50's...What follows is an incredible journey with amazing looking vistas, interesting characters and mechanics that, to this day, feel fresh. A game that rivals games like Half-Life 2 and Bioshock in atmospheric, story driven FPS's. It might not have the utmost polish, like HL2, but nothing that gets in the way of what this game does best; atmosphere.Techinically, compared to new games (i.e. BF4, Crysis 3) the game might look a little bit dated (in 2014), but the graphical design makes the game still look incredible, with some of my most memorable locations in video gaming.As far as sound design goes, the developers has worked wonders, the score is just right and every weapon sounds just like you want them to; powerful and distinctful. If there is something to complain about it's that the voice acting can, on some lines be, a bit cringe-y, but for the most part it does the job well and even the Russian accents sound believable for the most part.Even though is game is several years old, the mechanics used still feel fresh and like something new. Without spoilering, you can manipulate the environment to quite a big degree which keeps the combat feeling fresh and it ties in very, very nicely with the story and story telling.In the end; if you're a fan of story driven games, don't mind a good FPS or enjoy post apocalyptic stories like Fallout or Metro 2033/Last Light, you should definately give Singularity a chance. It might be a couple of years old, but it still holds up very well and is one of the most underated games ever made.WARNING: The PC port is unfortunately absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥though. BUT, it is fixable, at least to a degree. The game runs fine at my system (AMD FX-8350 4,0GHz, AMD R9 290, 8GB RAM) with over 60 frames per second during the whole game at 1920x1080p, with everything on. There are not many graphical options to speak of tough, so it might not be tailorable to your computer, if you're running a lower end rig.The FOV was the biggest problem for me though, with it being locked to console FOV (~60). This is however semi-fixable with a great program called ""Flawless Widescreen"". Be warned though, increasing the FOV causes the playable characters arms to clip, making you be able to see thru them at the bottom of your screen while using some weapons and during some events. It is very slight and to me, it's not a very big deal, but to some people it might be immersion breaking, so; you have been warned.			",750,173,48,96,107,12,105

												Excellent, atmospheric FPS. The beginning of the game is delightfully spooky and a slow burn. You're given time to explore for a bit, without a weapon, building dread and expectation. It could pass for a first-rate horror game for the first twenty minutes. It thing segues into more predictable shooter territority, but the shooting is quite solid and the plot interesting enough to keep you moving forward. The time manipulation powers are a lot of fun if you take the time to learn when best to employ them. Lots of audiologs to find as well. Highly recommended for any FPS fan who is more interested in atmosphere than mowing down waves of enemies.			",77,20,0,15,1,0,6

												One of the most understated games ever. Had this on the Xbox 360! Well worth the money, the story is epic, gameplay is fun and never gets boring. Halflife with a horror/action feel, I really cannot recommend a game story like it so freekin epic.Really sad this game didnt get a full press release, I hadn't heard of it, till i walked in to PC world and saw this on sale for £8... thought it looked okay, thought I needed a new game to try... BEST £8 ever spent!! The Story is maybe 4-8 hours of gamplay depending on how much you hunt for E-99 and what skill level you are on. So its a bit of a short story but wow did the make it good. This is my most recommended game of all time!			",184,24,4,8,27,3,21

												Well what can I say? It was pretty to look at, the story intrigued me, and the zombies made me jump on two occaisons. However, it lacks a quick save function, which prevented me from completing the game. Now I'm no save ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I don't need to save every five seconds because I'm prone to dying - no, I need to save when I feel things are about to get serious because it's very possible I've missed something and would like the chance to go back if it turns out I have. Basically I found myself with next to nothing ammo in a colourful room full of teleporting zombies. My knife is made of plastic, I have 3 bullets on my pistol and about 12 bullets on my rifle. There's no ammo anywhere, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game wants you to kill your 6 ( i think) attackers. After doing some digging, it turns out I walked right past a refill point. My fault for not seeing it, but the game has locked me out of that area so now it's pretty much saying ""Your fault for looking at the pretty scenery and not the glowing box thing a second ago, sucks brah"". My only option? To replay.This game is not good enough to earn a replay. The frustration factor vs the OH WOW factor is just too one sided for that. It's probably a good game, and I did enjoy it until the mishap, so I would recomend it to someone who wants to kill the time. Maybe I'll revisit at some point. Probably not.			",171,22,0,31,20,0,32

												I wanted to play a game in which I shoot stuff. I also prefer my shooting games to have something quirky or fun or special to set them apart from all the other shooting games. I bought Singularity and it delivered, for the most part, at least.Singularity is a very basic shooter. It's story is nothing really special (it's a very predictable time-traveling mess), the voice acting is standard, the guns are regular guns (except for the seeker, which the game occasionally hands you so you can have some fun) and the enemies are russians who shoot you and mutants that slash, punch and bite you.So what sets this game apart?The TIME MANIPULATION DEVICE! While the game occasionally seems to forget that the thing exists, and while the mechanics on which it operates (story-wise) are confusing as hell and while it's mostly just a gravity gun with a ""kill enemy"" function, it DOES set Singularity apart from all the other shooters. An enemy giving you trouble? Age him/it to dust! A bunch of soldiers giving you trouble? Revert a couple of them into feral mutants and watch the madness. The TMD also allows for some fun puzzle design, which is a bonus as far as I am concerned.Singularity is not a long game and it's not the best game there is, but it's competent and well worth a few bucks and an evening or two.Playtime: 5+ hours (single playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 7Audio: 7Story: 5Gameplay: 8Overall: 7			",267,75,5,30,35,2,54

												Singularity is a quality, fairly short blast of silliness. It aspires to be comparable to 'Bioshock', a worthy aim that it comes admirably close to fulfilling. Although Gamespot said that the game's visuals were a little lacking (their overall review was positive, giving it 8/10, and a 'Great') I thought the environments were pretty awesome. Highlights for me were when you saw a location in the present, only to be flung back in time 50 years, to see the same place in all its shiny freshness. I was surprised that they didn't actually do this more often in the game really. Another iteration of this visual effect was walking though a ship where sudden time-pulses would age it, as you stumbled onward. A wall of rust and corrosion would move like a wave over every surface, an original and interesting idea. Furthermore, the gunplay of the game was slick and satisfying, suffering from none of the 'sludginess' that some FPS's can have. Comparisons to that of 'Bioshock' are again tempting - the enemy body physics, the art design of the guns, the damage effects of your weapons: all were oddly similar. But there were more obvious similarities. For example, the character enhancement and gun customization elements seemed like brazen copies (perhaps I should say 'respectful homages'?) to the 'Bioshock' franchise. The 'secondary weapon' in your other hand (here, the so-called Time Manipulation Device, Singularity's answer to Plasmids) was identical! While these elements worked well, they were all ultimately a little limited because the game is so much shorter. As regards developing a credible 'alternative world' and engaging in deeper philosophical questions, Singularity only dabbled the fingers of its TMD-adorned-hand ever so slightly in these areas. Ultimately the game puts playability and humour first - think Red Alert crossed between Metro 2033, and you're warm - and there is never any shame in that.  It's a short game - even if you're a thorough completionist, like me, it will still all be over in about 10 hours - but the price reflects this. The game offers a fun, silly and satisfying ride. There's no doubt that a Time Manipulation Device would be useful in reclaiming all those wasted hours frittered away on medicore games, but here at least it's time well spent!			",82,7,0,14,2,0,13

												A hiden gem. This game has a great plot that will suprise you at the end. I hate to say this but this game remeinds me of bioschock in a sense. This game took me about 5 hours to beat on easy. But im sure it would take up to 8 or so hours to beat on the hardest difficulty. Also if you read all the notes and listen to all the voice recordings that may add more depth to your story like it did mine. This game trys to scare you at some points, but it isnt a scary game. This is a wello crafted hiiden gem that nneds to be experienced. I rate this a 9/10 only becasue I wish the story was a little bit longer and it had more options for weapons. they only have one gun per type for example only one pistol. Also if you are going to play this game with a controller it does'nt tell you the controls so you have to learn them or look them up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Price / hour: 1,49€Price / hour with sale of 5€: 0,37€Yes, it took a little longer than other but that's because I really looked everything what it had insides of it; good little detailing and recordings and such. This game is little bit like Bioshock, but more enjoyable and darker. I'm not a huge fan of  horror games (this is not a horror game), but this game still gave me some horror which is rare for me. Even that it's short, it's a masterpiece. My recommendation is to buy it in sale, like I bought in a big sale of bunch of games from Activision, and I could say this was the first one I completed since it wasn't too hard to understand and most enjoyable from the start!tl;drPros:- Awesome detailing + graphics- Good story- Well designed weapons- Unique- Dark feeling, epic feeling and taking it with you.- SHOW IT TO YOUR FRIENDS! Like I did when my friend visited me, he liked it so much as well. And your friend can help you at puzzles.Cons:- Short, this is why you should but in on a sale- uhm ye, I played this a while ago, but I can't rly think any other cons. Propably going to play it again someday.			",164,33,6,18,5,0,2

												Singularity is a pretty solid FPS game, though it's not worth its asking price. If you can get it at 75% off, then it is well worth your money.To me, Singularity feels like a blend of ideas and influences from other FPS games, but it is done very well, and the end product does feel like a game of it's own, and it makes this multiple directions work well.You play as a US soldier sent to investigate an energy surge on an island off the coast of Russia where secret experiments were performed with the fictional mineral E-99, until a massive explosion destroyed the island in the 50's. Once there, another energy surge sends you to the past, and once you return, you realize that you changed the present and that Russia rules the world. From there on, you try to fix the present by once again changing the past.The story wants to be complex, but ends up being relatively simple and kind of falls flat, with the twist not really being a twist(and can easily be deduced 5 minutes into the game), which is revealed a moment before the final decision which leads to 3 different endings which all felt rushed and cobbled together, and none felt like a satisfactory end to the story. Still, I did enjoy it most of the time, especially when it hinted at something more intruging that the straightforward route it ended up taking.Graphically and visually, the game felt a lot like Bioshock to me. It doesn't resemble the environments of Bioshock, but the overall atmosphere of you in a place where something bad happened prior to your arrival and the way it uses environmental storytelling with audio recordings, notes, and movies you can find felt a lot like how I explored Rapture. The HUD is almost a direct copy of Bioshock's, the best way to describe it would be to call it ""Bioshock with a slightly different skin"". The island design is pretty good, and I enjoyed exploring it for upgrade materials almost just as much as I did in Rapture.Also the game frequently sends you back in time, so you get to explore the environments both now and in the 50's before the xplosion, similar to the principle used in Prince of Persia Warrior Within.In terms of gameplay, this is where the game shines, and again, feels a lot like Bioshock, with a pinch of FEAR in the mix. You have a decent arsenal of guns, all of which can be upgraded with tech found on the way. You can also upgrade yourself, gaining increased health and other perks, some of which are very unbalanced and can potential break the game flow. You can carry two guns at a time, and can pick up weapons and ammo from fallen enemies, as well as change your loadout at predestined locations. Some weapons offer you the ability to slow-down time while you aim, though this does not last long and has to recharge before being used again.You are also given a TMD(time manipulation device) which grants you a small array of time powers used to solve simple, yet clever puzzles and aid you in combat. You can age your opponents to dust, freeze everything in an area, or create a large energy pulse to knock them back. Also, the TMD has all the capabilites of Half-Life 2's gravity gun, allowing you to throw explosive barrels at enemies or catch their grenades mid-air and return them.The gunplay feels great, and the powers add enough variety to keep things interesting as you gun down russian soldiers and various mutants, though there were some enemy types which were really annoying, which is the only issue I have with the gameplay.Overall, the game is relatively short, lasting about 3-5 hours depending on you speed, but very enjoyable experience. I do feel they could have done a little more with the game, especially in terms of the story and it rushed ending, but still, I would recommend buying the game if you can get it at a discount.

												Singularity held up pretty well as an old-school shooter that has no cover-shoot, and no autoheal. What it does have is the TMD, a time manipulation device that you can deploy both in combat and merely to solve environmental puzzles. The setup is pretty cute... a major radiation event on an abandoned island near the Russian border lead to a special US response... a spec ops team moved in, but an EMP event have them crashed on the island and the team scattered. You, Renko, must traverse the island, attempt to reunite with your teammates, and figure out what's wrong with this island, as the singularity whipsaws you between 2010 (game's ""present day"") and 1955. You screwed up history in one of those whipsaw transitions, and you have to spend rest of the game trying to undo what you have done, as you fight your way through soldiers (both 1955 and 2010) and monsters, horribly mutated humans and whatelse left on the island also horribly mutated. What really sets the game apart is how your special power, the TMD, can be deployed in combat. There's a ""shockwave"" command that blasts all enemies back, and by endgame it is upgraded to limb shedding slam power. Enemies that phase shift (blinks in and out) can be ""blasted"" by the shockwave back to the present for you to shoot. The device is also a personal tractor beam for grabbing and throwing. Grab an explosive barrel (either on the ground or in midair, such as one thrown at you), and throw it at the enemy.  Many objects can be aged (turned into ruined version) or deaged (return to pristine condition). You will end up de-aging a lot of things. Busted boxes that contain medkits and ammo can be deaged. Regular boxes can be aged so they can fit through gaps that they would not otherwise fit, like under a door, then de-aged so it acts as a jack to lift the door up, or use as a platform for you to jump onto other places. Enemies can be aged, safes can be aged (technically, just the safe door). The TMD can also throw a protective bubble shield to freeze time for a few seconds. The game offers various upgrades for your TMD and your weapons, and there are a nice selection if a bit typical: pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, then it veered into the exotic, like a grenade launcher that alternately launches a guided ""rolling ball"", a spike launcher that launches explosive spikes, a sniper rifle with time-dilation (i.e. bullet time) when scoped, and the autocannon (a gatling gun, actually). You can discover ""weapon tech"" points that you can spend on upgrades (each weapon can be upgraded in reload speed, clip capacity, or raw damage) during your travels. You can also accumulate ""E99"" energy containers that acts as currency that you can spend on additional TMD upgrades (betware as you can only equip one TMD upgrade at a time), as well as other perks like ""better projectile damage resistance"", or ""recharge health per kill"".  You can access those at the various TMD upgrade stations and Weapon Stations. Combat is pretty frantic as the game throws new challenges at you all the time, and some of the environment puzzles are genius. If you are stuck on where to go, there's always ""chrono-ping"" which tells you which way you should go. The game involves time travel, so it should be no surprise that there are plenty of causuality loops, and there's a big reveal near the end that sets up for a sequel, which has yet to happen, but a tweet earlier in 2015 seem to suggest that the developer is working on such. And there are at least three endings (and two fail-repeat semi-endings) that you can attempt to get. The graphics are quite good (you almost can't tell it's a 2010 game) and sound effects very well done (proper stereo effects as you turn the character around and the sound source does localize). Music tempo increases with combat and ends when all enemies are defeated. All in all, Singularity is one of those games that few people have played, as it's so oldschool, but it plays fine today, which is a lot of praise for a 5 year old game (released 2010, reviewed 2015).

												Amazing experience and a totally overlooked gem. So much fun, inventive, deliciously sadistic weapons. Totally linear, but a good story, great set pieces. Well-designed levels never get too frustrating, it's never samey because the art direction keeps the visuals fresh. Boss fights are epic. Honestly, I enjoyed it more than Bioshock. I don't think it's as well-developed as a world and characters, but I'm talking about pure entertainment value. Graphics aside, it doesn't feel particularly aged. Most current FPS games are no better, just a little prettier.Only annoying thing is, when using a gamepad, the buttons aren't shown in on-screen prompts, only keyboard keys. An oversight which will never be remedied now, but it hardly ruins the game.			",503,114,16,8,16,2,8

												Singularity is one of those hidden gems that seem to only attract its real fans long after its demise and relegation to the scrap heap. Don't misunderstand that as the game being bad, because it most certainly is not. Singularity is everything that used to be fun in the FPS genre, before mainstreaming took it over. Essentially, Singularity is a popcorn shooter with fluid non-stop combat, lots of enemies, a great story, a lengthy singleplayer campaign and a neat RPG-lite character building system that borrows from System Shock/Bioshock without completely ripping them off.Your average shooter fan won't like Singularity since it speaks more to the 90s gamers out there, so be warned if you're expecting something modern. That being said, If you want a solid FPS with a clever gimmick, an entertaining story and some great level design....here you go. Thank me later.			",101,22,7,54,1,0,2

												Singularity is a really awesome game, which you could compare the most to FEAR in my opinion. It has a creepy atmosphere at the start and although the game focusses more on action overall it still has a dark and threatening atmopshere in some levels. Additional to that you also find notes and audiotapes throughout the game, which provides you with background information about Katorga 12.The developers made a good job to keep that time travel theme in your mind. During your journey you will see visions of former citizens of the island how they talked to eacxh other or you see the scene of their death.The gameplay itself is pretty fun and besides the standard shooter weapons there are also some sci-fi guns like the Seeker, which allows you to control your bullets after a shot. The Singularity powers are also fun to use. I have to agree that there are not much of them, which gets compensated by the fact that every enemy reacts different to your aging ability and the ""time sphere"" can be used in an agressive or defensive way. In short I can say if you liked Bioshock and FEAR I think you will have fun with this game as well. And if you are concerned about the time in which Singualirty play you don't need to worry. The game is set in 2010, but you also make some short trips to 1955 and fight WW 2 Soviets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Katorga-12. Nevar 4get ;_;In all honesty though, this is a ""Hidden Gem"" game if ever I've played one. A great selection of unique and fun weapons that all have weight to them (dat sniper rifle), a great gore/gib system, frantic combat with competent AI, a half way decent story, and unique time bending abilites that give you the edge you need in combat. Words can't describe how fun it is to put a squad of 4 or more enemies into a stasis bubble, walking into the bubble, taking aim and firing a bullet right between each enemies eyes, then collapsing the bubble and watching all 4 mean go flying backwards as their brains leak out the back of their foreheads. Or dropping a grenade at their feet and watching them explode inside the stasis bubble in super slow motion. Good times. And in the end game, when you get your final upgrade, you're literally a god amongst men. This game represents what Activision COULD have given us- fun, unique, and well designed shooters, that encouraged fun over realism, weapons that all had unique functions instead of ""This rifle shoots really fast, this one shoots in 3 round bursts, and this one fire slowly but deal lots of damage."" Instead we're stuck with a new Cawwa Doody every year. Our sins our great, and we gotta carry that weight. No amount of rewinding time will fix this now.			",208,39,0,20,6,0,11

												Singularity is a fun game, it's gameplay feels like a mix between Bioshock and Half Life 2The atmosphere and art style looks great. This game has some really good creepy moments at times.I was however able to finish it in 7 hours including all endings. So don't except allot of depthWould i replay Singularity again soon?  No, not a lot of replayability. Maby in a few hours when im walking in Nostalgia Lane.Raven Software did a good job on this game, it has a lot of potential.Too bad Raven Software only makes CoD DLC's nowadays ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not as great as Half-Life or Bioshock as some people claimed when it came out.But it's still pretty good.  Cool weapons and powers, decent story, fun action and a great setting and atmosphere.Lasts just long enough for you not to get bored.  Doesn't look great on PC (some really nasty textures) but looks good enough.$30 is a bit much for a 4 year old game, but whenever it pops up in a sale, it's absolutely worth it.

												Fantastic game, despite its age. There's nothing quite like anihilating a room full of soldies with a sniper rifle that lets you steer bullets.The game has a really creepy atmosphere. Dried out corpses are all over the place, and once in a while you get a time shift into back when they were still alive and see their suffering. You fight against monsters who used to be humans but got messed up by time radiation. You also fight against modern day soldiers. You also fight against 1950s soldiers.You have a TMD, a special device that lets you age things (or soldiers) or revert old things back to new, among other things, like shooting time-slowing bubbles. There are quite a few ""puzzles"" where you have to think how to age or unage containers and power boxes, among other things, to get further.The story... I wasn't really following it. It felt like some scientist was just telling me what to do (similar to Half-Life) and I just trudged along. I kept thinking he was about to screw me over the entire time. But the impact of what a time-altering technology in the wrong hands can do is tangible throughout the game.So if you can handle feeling the dread of inexorable death waiting for you around the corner as you watch things decay, this game is for you!P.S.: the game is ancient, so for obvious reasons the multiplayer is dead. You can't even start it up and wonder around the map alone.			",120,5,6,11,11,0,8

												Singularity takes different video games ideas, it's undeniable! (Doom 3, Half-life 1&2, Dead Space series, Portal, Return to Castle Wolfenstein (RTCW), and more). The good thing is that the Scenario is good. Not great, but good. The ambiance is interesting also. Some people would say that this game is way under-rated, I would say no because it is linear, there is some repetitive actions, you can't go where you want because of tons of boring invisible walls, but at least you can find some secret areas and there is many predictable situations.I recommand you Singularity if you are a fan of FPS's in general! But now, if this game is one of the greatest FPS ever? Of course not, but at least it is very interesting and entertaining! So yes, you can purchase it now!Singularity is based on Epic Games - Unreal Engine 3.  Graphics / Mapping: 7/10  - Invisible walls and some ugly and blurry textures! Action / Scenario: 7/10  - A little bit of deja vu. Musics / Sound: 5/10  - Good... but not great. Programing: 9/10  - Why 9? Because I prefer ID Software 3D engines for many reasons but Unreal Engine is amazing too.			",193,30,0,23,6,0,5

												Нельзя никак менять прошлое, ибо это может привести к непредсказуемым последствиям. Чему нас, собственно, и учит Singularity. В результате лишь одного действия заброшенный островок в Охотском море становится источником энергии, достаточной для захвата мира. И только один человек - капитан Натаниель Ренко может предотвратить катастрофу в прошлом, потому что все нити сюжета указывают именно на него. Человека, который и сам хотел бы распутать этот клубок тайн и узнать, почему только он может всех спасти.От себя лишь хочется добавить, что это добротный, но немного подзабытый шутер, в котором все аспекты работают, геймплей держит до самого конца, подкреплённый неплохой графикой.И, хотя до содержания финальных твистов можно дойти и самому, концовка не разочарует.P.S. И да, в игре нет хэппи-энда, даже несмотря на то, что концовки три. Потому что у этой истории просто не может быть хорошего конца.			",202,22,2,17,11,2,24

												Of course, you already know what Singularity is like: it's like a hundred other games. You slow down time. You freeze time. You have a highly advanced piece of kit that allows you to break things and repair them again (not a spanner). Press a different button and you can lift things, use them as shields and throw them at bad people. Did you say Gravity Gun?Graphics are courtesy of Unreal 3 for the last console gen, which means bad. Hardly any detail and lo-res shaders like everything is smeared with vaseline. There are no settings to turn up. The plot is also gibberish. You go forward in time, you go back in time. You shoot a man in the head then he starts having a conversation about causality, so you have to shoot him again. It's almost as bad as Bioshock Infinite. Almost. Still, the big spiders were nice, the guns were alright and it was £2.50, so that's a thumbs up. 5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Singularity had the potential to be something truly great. A promising concept (time manipulation) combined with an interesting sci-fi plot, Singularity instead doesn't use its chosen gimmick to its fullest, relegating it to mild puzzle solving (with some occasional gigantic logic holes - why can't I just climb over this collapsed door instead of crawling through yet more sewer pipe to get to the same place?) and some moderately useful combat abilities, most of which can only be used a handful of times per engagement; I ended up forgetting I had them. In addition, the game has only one proper boss fight and basically gives you God Mode near the end, making the difficulty not so much peak as plunge. You can get through practically the entire game with the assault rifle and the shotgun (the game conveniently provides a nearby sniper rifle whenever the situation calls for it).That's not to say Singularity is a bad game. It isn't. The shooting feels tight and the ability to upgrade the damage, capacity, and reload times of your weapons is neat. It just could have been so, so much better if they had used their tools more effectively, given us more to do with the time manipulation mechanic, and hadn't tried to crowbar in some Bioshock-esque ""twists"" near the end. Missed opportunities, but still worth getting on sale.7/10			",30,7,0,10,1,0,1

												First off, I need to state to not be put off this game is made by same makers of Call of Duty because this game is amazingly perfect. Now for the real review. How I first heard of this game was when I googled ""games similiar to The Last Of Us on pc"". Now you may wonder, what does this game have to do with The Last Of Us? Its not even Post Apocalyptic. While this is true what I believe the answer is both are Story Driven games. So once I read about the game, I became interested in the concept, the idea, of the TMD and the Singularity. I also want to add I thought I was fighting Nazis which to me would be cliche but you actually fight soviets. So anyways, if you enjoy Story Driven FPS and enjoy The Last Of Us, this is a must play. Half Life 2 may be classic, but this game surpasses that. So go buy this game and fight the past to save the future! Fight the Singularity!			",271,37,0,17,6,2,15

												Singularity is a First-Person Shooter made by Raven Software, it is designed in a similar vein to games like the Bioshock series.. There's very light RPG elements, and a fair amount of story, much of which is told through audiologs spread throughout the world.Gameplay wise, Singularity plays like most modern FPS titles, with a few minor exceptions. For the most part, you'll only be able to carry two weapons. On the otherhand, outside of some of the upgrades you can buy, there's no regenerating health, meaning you'll have be on the lookout for health packs throughout the world. The level design consists of your fairly standard corridors with enemies with the occasional larger arena designed for combat. The game decently rewards exploration, with E99 Tech (the games currency for upgrading weapons/your character), health packs and ammo and audiologs. Asides from the standard running and gunning, you'll also find yourself solving a puzzle every so often, those these are mostly straight-forward, and shouldn't cause much trouble. From a gameplay standpont, the big gimmick is the TMD, or the time manipulation device. As you might guess, it is a device that allows you to maniuplate time in a multitude of ways. The main ability of the TMD is being able to age certain objects. A broken stair-case can be sent back to a time where it was no longer broken etc. Enemies can also be aged, slowing them, damaging them or in some cases outright killing them. This mechanic is cool, but I found it to be under-utilized in the game. Most of the time you'll simply be reparing a stair-case or similar thing, and then continuing on your way. While the combat implications are interesting, the resource cost of being able to age enemies way too high for me to justify using in most combat scenarios. In additon to the TMD's aging abilities, you get a half-life 2 style gravity gun, where you'll be able to pick up barrels and what not to throw at enemies, and finally you have the ability to create spheres where time is slowed down. It's a cool mechanic, that spices up the combat of the game. The weapons in the game are mostly your standard fair, you have your pistol, shotgun, automatic rifle etc. There's a few more interesting weapons, one weapon allows you to control the bullet midfliight, and another creates a ball that you can control directly, but these are mostly gimmicks that you won't use more than once or twice. After I got the Autocannon, I probably used that weapon 90% of the rest of the game. Enemy design is decent, with a fair amount of different ranged and melee attackers. There's a few boss fights, but they usually boil down to shoot the glowy spots on the enemy. There's an upgrade system for both your character and weapons, but these systems felt mostly inconsequential, outside of increasing my max hp. In the end, Singularity is a short (I clocked in at a bit less that 5 and a half hours), but solid FPS with some sorely underutilized mechanics that could of made the game amazing.Story wise, Singularity takes places in an alternate history world where the Soviet Union rises to power by utilizing an element known as E99. It is your job to to set the worlds time-line straight. The story utilizes standard time travel tropes decently enough, and the twist at the end is done well. The audiologs and flash-back scenes do a good job at creating an interesitng world. In the end, it's not the most orginial story, but it kept me interested and entertained until the end.Raven created a decent enough game, that's well worth buying at 5-10$. However in the end, Singularity is no Bioshock, and I would say it's not even as good as their earlier Wolfenstien title.			",569,117,13,95,22,3,82

												Singularity is an ok game I guess, but without steam achievements there really isn't much fun beyond a single play-through. Plus almost no one ever plays online (Multiplayer) so you'll have to track down a few buddies who have the game as well in order to try out a 4-player 2-on-2 match. And that isn't even enough people to get the full feel of how the multiplayer mechanics work. In conclusion, you should at least play Singleplayer once, and make the choice at the end of weather kill---hold on a minute, you'll just have to play it to see what I mean there.

												This game is Bioshock.Everything from the engine/graphics, the enviroments, the story, and the gameplay can be compaired to Bioshock.What they share:Medkits (no regen health)Upgrade system for weapons and abilitys (though watered down compaired to bioshock)A device to alter objects through time/carry/throw/push back or destroy enemys (Kinda like certain plasmids)Mutated enemys (Only harder to kill... in the beginning)A desolated place/horror feelStory told through tape recordingsMysterious writings all over the walls forshading... things... (cough.. Would you kindly)Ghosts detailing unfortionate deathsMultible story endings ect. ect.You get the idea.But at the same time it all works. Everything it does it does well, and it is very much fun turning your enemys into dust particles, and traveling back and forth from 1955 to 2010. This game would be a perfect buy if it wasn't for the price. $29.99 is way too much to spend on this title and just isnt worth it.

Reviewing Singularity. A game about crazy Russian scientists.When I first started this game a while ago, I didn't really like it. Because of the slightly scary setting. But once you get used to the setting, it stays about the same and slowly decreases. But what is really interesting about this game is are the levels and the story. But the game also comes with a slight sense of humor. Sssia all the characters speak really broken English. Which made me giggle while playing through this mildly horroresque themed game.If you're a fan of the british TV series Doctor Who. You're really going to like this game. Because this game makes you travel in time. However linearly this game may be, you still can make one choice. But that doesn't really affect the games main story in any way. Though you cant really change the story, it's not really that bad. Because the story in itself is still really interesting. And makes you think how your actions could have led to this scenario.As an overall rating I whould rate this game 7/10 and whould definitly recommend it to a friend. Since this game plays like Call of Duty, but has a story like Half Life 2.			",120,5,3,17,10,2,19

												really, an intersting game to say the least. singularity is a first-person shooter that incorperates elements of different games in it. its hard to explain but it felt like at times i was playing gears of war, bioshock, and half life 2. its a really good game its got a good story which took me around 8-9 hours to complete on the medium difficulty. its certainly a good game if you can pick it up for the right price. really underrated and is definetly worth checking out.

												It was a good game but a kind of short game. It took me 7 hours to complete the single player. It was a great single  player game though. The graphics were great and gave the immersion affect. The sounds were eerie and kind of nerve racking at times. The story was easy to follow and fun to play through. The online portion of the game is dead. The special powers you get in game are fun to play around with and use to your advantage. You can kill the bad guys in unique and fun ways. The guns were very well done and there is gun were you control the bullet flight which makes for some good fire fights.The Russian language in the game was fun to read and understand what place was what in the buildings.There are 2 types of endings. The AI are standard but nothing really special, so you shouldn't need cheats to beat the game. The overall game was great but too short. When you pick this one up make sure its on sale. Its a great game and i recommend it.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

Solid 6/10I recommend this game when you can get it during Steam Sale. It is a short but lot of fun game and a very well made shooter.Nice gamemechanics and puzzles that are easy to solve but fun to experience.Environment, weapon and enemy designs are very well made and the setting of this game feels fitting and plausible.The weapon upgrade system is well made and rewards the player for spending time to search for upgrade points.The game is very short though and therefore not worth more than 10$ in my opinion. It does not really offer any replay value dispite having multiple endings and is absurdly easy even on the highest difficulty setting so it does not offer any kind of challenge.The story is a mess... it's all about time traveling, is filled with plot holes, does not make any sense and struggles with its own identity.See time travel stories are either:1, you create an alternate timeline because you are able to change the pastor2, there is no way to change the past because all the events have to happen in order to create the timeline you knowthis game wants to be both... for whatever reason.Some lore elements of the world you play in are actually very interesting and provide you with nice detail, but the core of it is confusing and without logic.If you can forgive this game for the strange time travel story and all the mistakes it contains you are left with a very well made but sadly way to easy shooter that is actually a lot of fun to play at least once.It should take you 3-5 hours for your first playthrough.

												Singularity is Raven doing what Raven is known to do - delivering a solid first person shooter experience. Singularity takes elements of Bioshock [audio logs everywhere, similar-looking UI]; Timeshift [manipulate time]; Dead Space and Bioshock [machines everywhere to upgrade your equipment and skills]; and STALKER [takes place in Russia]; and Half-Life 2 [FPS games w/ puzzle sections]. Singularity is a game w/ lots of variety that often really hits or just misses its mark by a little bit. In the end, Raven delivers a solid experience that is worth your time - though, it just isn't anything special. Grade: C+.			",893,314,36,138,76,13,111

												Singularity is often overlooked because it didn't do so well when it was released back in 2010, which is a bit of a shame because this is a solid shooter with a pretty nice story, satisfying combat and a cool time shifting gameplay mechanic. It's also not hard to see that the game is heavily influenced by Half-Life 2.The graphics hold up well despite it's age and it runs smooth as butter without issues on modern systems like Windows 10. FOV is a bit of a problem though, being way too small, some people might experience motion sickness because of this. Luckily there are programs like Flawless Widescreen that will fix this easily without any tampering with the game files.The game is a little short though, it will take you about 7 to 8 hours to finish it and the ending is a bit lackluster. That said, this is Raven Software's last game before being swallowed up by Activision and being the developers of such classics as Hexen, Soldier of Fortune, the Star Wars Jedi Knight series and Wolfenstein, you know they can provide an action packed game and that's exactly what Singularity is, short but sweet, and well worth a purchase for any FPS fan.

												I first heard about this game roughly six years ago when I was first getting into FPS games. It was described to me as some sort of mashup of Half-Life and Metro. I looked up some videos and chalked it down as some generic activision broshooter.I was wrong.I don't really remember how this game ended up in my library. I think I'd last played it sometime in... 2013 or 2014? All I knew is I ended up liking it. I was scrolling through my library reorganizing all my games earlier today when I saw this game on the list and I thought to myself ""somehow I don't remember anything about this game other than it being cool"".I'm a couple hours into my second playthrough and yes, this game is as cool as I remember. I think if you want to more accurately describe it compared to other games, it's Half-Life meets Metro with a sprinkle of Bioshock and RE5/6. All in a good way. At it's core it's something of an action horror game. It's got a few jumpscares and the voice acting is hit and miss, but the level design, though linear, is well-paced and entertaining and the setpieces are beautiful. Just remember. Train boss. Remember. It's a good setpiece.Visually... It's a bit dated for a game released in 2010, considering it's an Xbox 360 port, but on a technical level, despite the lack of very advanced graphics settings, the game looks clean and crisp and it's not hard to look at. (I've picked a few screenshot-worthy scenes already.) Optimization is fine, can't say a lot on that front.All in all, I think this game has sooorta fallen out of the spotlight and just like me, I don't think a lot of people even remember it exists. Definitely a hidden gem at this point. Pick it up. ",172,16,4,22,5,1,7

												A really great, yet fantastic game. IF, yes IF it had used all its potential. Obviously the developers decided to neglect all the good ideas, but keep all the bad stuff. I'm somewhat in the middle of the game so far, but I'm already bored and I don't think I'll ever finish this one.Good things:- Time manipulation! Always has and always be a win!- The story, which also unfolds via notes and recordings you can find (and play / read) throughout the game.- The weapon lockers throughout the game, which lets you chose / change weapons. Awesome! Especially for a game which let's you keep only two weapons at a time.- A device which lets you degenerate / regenerate objects, slow down time, distort gravitation and other stuff. This is why I like videogames.And here are all the cliches that break the game for me:- I felt like I've always run out of ammo.- I dont' normally judge a game by it's graphics, but this game looks at least five years older than it actually is.- Protagonist can only sprint for about three meters, and even that feels super slow. Because we're playing as a elite soldier, and soldiers can't do more.- Strong, boss-like creatures only have one spot on the body where they are vulnerable. Because we all like bullet sponges!- I felt that it was depending on luck if you score a headshot or not. I have no problems in other games, but here it's like they're all sponges.- Escort mission! Yay. Can't make a game without it, right?- One of the absolutely best weapons I've ever seen in a game (which lets you guide bullets and has a massive impact on enemies) is only temporarely available. Because screw the player and the fun, right? We don't want him to have too much fun, now won't we? So better take this weapon away from him after using it.- ""Defend the area / tower while some other dude tries to activate something and enemies spawn all over this effin place"". Ah, an undying classic. A mediocre game is never complete without such a mission!- Forced stupid puzzles which are only good to prolong gameplay. I hated everyone of them.- The shotgun is extremely boring.- Bug-like enemies, which are fast, attack in hordes and are hard to hit. A, I love this one too, like every player does! Thanks for including this!It's really sad, because if they would have chosen to concentrate on the potential this game has, it had been a killer game.			",224,20,13,20,11,1,19

												A great action fps that probably not many people know about. Great levels, enemies, weapons, and powers, and a great story. The gunplay is excellent and the game runs perfectly with no technical problems whatsoever. A great gem that you should catch on sale if you are a fps fan and not a queer moba player. Steam never has it on sale so check www.isthereanydeal.com ",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												i'm really p*ssed actually! half of the textures are totally messed up or even completely missing!so i searched for solutions and found a patch the developers made to solve the problem. now that i have installed the patch i can't even launch the game anymore because my PC can't find the singularity CD!!!!! YEAH!!!!! THE CD!!!!! you know... guys from ravensoft - people who buy games on steam, normally don't get a f*cking CD!!!!!the game itself seems to be very good actually, can not tell exactly BECAUSE I DIDN'T PLAY IT VERY LONG... why are so many steam games f*cked up sooo badly? if this one would be the first screwed up port i ever have bought from steam i would say - ok, sh*t happens - but i almost can't count them anymore! it's a god damn shame!!!

												Singularity is one of those fun little gems that hides away in the corner of the steamstore which never really sees the light of day, when really it should have more recognition than its got. All i can say is thaqt this game is immencely enjoyable from start to finish; I it is one of the only game which has kept me entertained and intrigued throughout. Seriously there is rarely a dull moment in it, mainly I think because you're always slightly scared and creeped out by this mysterious island of Katorga-12 where it is set. Mind you this is no horror game, but it will give a nice dose scares throughout which will keep your toes most of the way through. Of course game can be frustrated sometimes when trying to work out puzzels, and a couple of enemy's may halt your progress for longer than is ideal, but still it rarely slows down with the action and intresting story.My recommendation is:If you want a game which tries something different, and gives a sort of breath of fresh air, pick it up when it's on sale, as £15 is a bit on the steep side. But is you want something fun to play, then just pick it up if you feel like it.			",82,14,10,0,3,1,2

												Singularity is in some ways very similar to Wolfenstein 2009, a FPS game with minimal rpg elements (upgrades: character, weapons, tmd and tmd equipment) and an amazing story with characters that feel alive.The game starts as a normal FPS, but as soon as you reach the item that makes singularity unique, the gameplay changes and you are given some freedom like exploring to collect e-99 tech (currency) blueprints and bioformulas.An underrated gem that didn't get enough attention, probably because of bad marketing.

												Finished the game in 11 hours, so it's not very long. Feels about as long as Bioshock 2. Although the game feels like a mix of BioShock, Metro, Prey,  It stands on its own very well. It features game play that slowly takes you through the start, explains the story and builds to full on combat,  The sound design is top notch and should be played with headphones to experience all it has to offer. Creepy atmosphere to start, detailed world, time travel, ever changing environments, action, suspense, puzzles, killing, weapon upgrades and mods, lots of hidden items to find, good story, great sound design, smooth controls. It's a game you enjoy taking your time to explore and play. Yes, it's linear game play, but the design makes you forget about it. There are extra rooms and areas to explore to find money, ammo, health packs etc. The only CONS I can think of 1. Too short Only about 12 hours2. No trading Cards3. No Mele combat abilities. 4. Few weaponsIt's a fun game and I enjoyed it so much I finished it in under 12 hours. Only a few gams have been able to suck me in to complete them and Singularity is one of them.

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.I don't understand how this game passed so desaperceived. It's a good game.Very innovative (I will not explain how. Try it!) FPS with a correct story line and correct (but not awesome) playability.Drawbacks are automated savings, lack of freedom (♥♥♥♥ing invisible walls) and lack of weapons and medical kits in some tough parts.It's tough and hard at the beginning, even in normal mode. You run out of ammo really fast and, the reloading time of all your gear is a real mess. This changes later in the game.But the innovations and surprises that this game introduces keeps you interested on what's going to come later and, that's a good point.Same disturbing sensations as when I've played Half Life 1 for the very first time.It takes some from other mythical FPS games but, adds a lot of new stuff.

												This game surprised me with all it's amazing innovations, especially in gameplay. The story, while somewhat confusing, is still really interesting and cool. The setting is awesome and the atmosphere is really scary, the whole post-apocolyptic thing is great. The graphics are alright, they do their job. But the coolest part is definitely the gameplay: slowing time, gravity-gun style physics, time travel on SPECIFIC OBJECTS, the concepts are just so amazing. I expected this game to be just another boring console port, but I was proved very wrong. 8.5/10			",296,67,5,19,14,2,17

												You know, this game doesn't get enouugh credit.  It flew under the radar I feel, and is quite a nice gem in amongst the CoD games.  Dark, somewhat creepy, with monsters that did catch me off guard a few times, was a good, solid game.  Storywise, leaves a little to be desired, with what I think is a clunky ending, but with three possible endings, allows you to think back through the story a few times to make your decision.  Good game, a little under rated.			",141,3,20,12,14,0,12

												""In Soviet Russia they had some really awful textures to look at back in 1955.""I read quite a few user reviews before I bought this, like I always do. Some ppl call it hidden gem, masterpiece, etc. but to be honest it is somewhat average FPS with some interesting ideas here and there. I'm not someone who would care much about graphics but I think they were not considered very good even when this game came out, as I mentioned textures are pretty bad. The story, yes it has one, is vaguely interesting at least at first glance. But later on it slowly slips into swamp of time travelling bullcrap so I wouldn't say it's good. Maybe I'm just biased because I don't like time-travelling/alternate dimensions stuff. It actually features 3 different endings, none of them is particullary interesting and the one which could be considered a good ending doesn't make any sense due to involved paradoxes that are presented to you, Red Dwarf's ep. ""Ouroboros"" makes more sense and is more entertaining.Shooting itself is ok, nothing to write home about. Your arsenal consists of standart pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc. There are few interesting pieces like rifle with homing bullets, which isn't standart arm since it is given to you only in certain parts of the game, or a grenade launcher with RC-like grenades (cool idea but sadly I didn't find it any good). You can also upgrade your weapons as long as you find weapon kits, but the impact of said upgrades is hardly noticeable, well you will obviously notice increased clip size but you don't really need increased dmg or reload speed. And I almost forgot that you can only carry 2 weapons at a time, personally I ended up using AR and minigun, this fact makes gimmicky weapons like that grenade launcher much less desireable.The game also has it's currency scattered throughout lvls, it's called E99 tech. It's spend on character upgrades, these are somewhat more impactful than weapon upgrades, or you can buy ammo with it but it's unlikely that you will ever find yourself low on ammo.What else? Oh right, Singularity's signature TMD. You can use it on enemies with various effects. It's used to solve ehm ""puzzle"" for the lack of better description and you can also use it to trivialize every enemy encounter once you aquire ability to make time-slowing bubble. This leads me to the fact that the game isn't difficult at all. Enemy soldiers have potatoe aim and you can easily avoid almost any attack from creatures. There is just one part which gave me a bit of trouble, it featured suicidal bugs.Overall it's slightly above average shooter, but only because few good ideas and the freighter level I really liked. It took me roughly 10 hour to beat on the highest difficulty.Buy it when it's on sale if you want to play FPS and can't think of any better than this one. Here's my reserved recommendation.

												You know, this game doesn't get enouugh credit.  It flew under the radar I feel, and is quite a nice gem in amongst the CoD games.  Dark, somewhat creepy, with monsters that did catch me off guard a few times, was a good, solid game.  Storywise, leaves a little to be desired, with what I think is a clunky ending, but with three possible endings, allows you to think back through the story a few times to make your decision.  Good game, a little under rated.			",141,3,20,12,14,0,12

												This game is amazing. You have a choice of using I think 9 or 10 different weapons ( a FRIKKIN MINIGUN IS ONE OF 'EM), good enemy variety, interesting story.They executed the concept of time manipulation so well that I never forgot about using those powers, and I never felt annoyed to have to use those powers. The Story is easy to get into, it's not vague or over the top.You might think it's attempting to be a horror game after the first 20 minutes of having played it, it's not. There are maybe 2 or 3 jumpscares in the entire game, just tiny instances that wouldn't really bother you.The level design is amazing, going back in time to the same place you're currently in, which was rusty and falling apart, then 50 years ago it's lookin' slick and futuristic, it's got a Wolfenstein: The New Order feel to it. The bosses are fantastic, they aren't hard to beat, they aren't pure BS in the sense that they attack for 2 minutes then have an open spot to shoot for 10 seconds. You're constantly fighting the bosses. You're constantly on edge.10/10. The price tag is a bit steep, but I'd recommend this any day. If it's ever on sale, you won't have to think twice about buying it (I hope).			",77,4,1,4,6,1,3

												""In Soviet Russia they had some really awful textures to look at back in 1955.""I read quite a few user reviews before I bought this, like I always do. Some ppl call it hidden gem, masterpiece, etc. but to be honest it is somewhat average FPS with some interesting ideas here and there. I'm not someone who would care much about graphics but I think they were not considered very good even when this game came out, as I mentioned textures are pretty bad. The story, yes it has one, is vaguely interesting at least at first glance. But later on it slowly slips into swamp of time travelling bullcrap so I wouldn't say it's good. Maybe I'm just biased because I don't like time-travelling/alternate dimensions stuff. It actually features 3 different endings, none of them is particullary interesting and the one which could be considered a good ending doesn't make any sense due to involved paradoxes that are presented to you, Red Dwarf's ep. ""Ouroboros"" makes more sense and is more entertaining.Shooting itself is ok, nothing to write home about. Your arsenal consists of standart pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc. There are few interesting pieces like rifle with homing bullets, which isn't standart arm since it is given to you only in certain parts of the game, or a grenade launcher with RC-like grenades (cool idea but sadly I didn't find it any good). You can also upgrade your weapons as long as you find weapon kits, but the impact of said upgrades is hardly noticeable, well you will obviously notice increased clip size but you don't really need increased dmg or reload speed. And I almost forgot that you can only carry 2 weapons at a time, personally I ended up using AR and minigun, this fact makes gimmicky weapons like that grenade launcher much less desireable.The game also has it's currency scattered throughout lvls, it's called E99 tech. It's spend on character upgrades, these are somewhat more impactful than weapon upgrades, or you can buy ammo with it but it's unlikely that you will ever find yourself low on ammo.What else? Oh right, Singularity's signature TMD. You can use it on enemies with various effects. It's used to solve ehm ""puzzle"" for the lack of better description and you can also use it to trivialize every enemy encounter once you aquire ability to make time-slowing bubble. This leads me to the fact that the game isn't difficult at all. Enemy soldiers have potatoe aim and you can easily avoid almost any attack from creatures. There is just one part which gave me a bit of trouble, it featured suicidal bugs.Overall it's slightly above average shooter, but only because few good ideas and the freighter level I really liked. It took me roughly 10 hour to beat on the highest difficulty.Buy it when it's on sale if you want to play FPS and can't think of any better than this one. Here's my reserved recommendation.

												Solid shooter.  Great shotgun.  Interesting story.  Some nice combat powers such as slowing time, force push and limited ""gravity gun"" abilities but other than that the time manipulation is limited to lame interactions like restoring stairs, restoring storage boxes and the restoration of clues.Surprisingly enjoyable shooter.

												Wanna find out what happens when Half Life 2 meets Call of Duty? Raven Soft did.Pros - Legitimate Time Travel Plot- Secrets throughout the game- Dead Space style upgrade terminals for weapons and character- Optimized very well- Immersive- TMD is useful- Good characters that are for the most part fleshed out- Puzzle Gimmicks- Fun Boss fights- Multiple Endings- Time Stop/Slow-Mo GimmickCons - Generic Russian Enemies- Hardest Difficulties make the enemies feel like sponges- Felt very short- Press F and the puzzles are gone- Lack of control and ingame video optionsNot going to lie to you guys. This is a gem, a true gem. One of the best shooters from ""Last Gen"" and I am glad it was Raven Soft that  brought it to us, too bad the game is so short. The game itself revolves around the main character polluting the past and corrupting the future, obviously for spoiler reasons I won't say anymore about the story other than that. One of the biggest draws for me was the secrets. The secrets in this game feel very much like Bioshock. The customization reminds me so much of Dead Space, both of these, the secrets and customization, are NOT complaints. This game also has puzzles much like in Half Life 2 and the games special tool, the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) is used to solve many of them, this does lead into one of my biggest complaints about the game, when you press F the TMD displays foot prints on where to go next if you are lost, while nice, this ability has no drawbacks to prevent you from constantly using it, basically trivilizing one of the gimmicks this game has to offer just by pressing F. Pressing F also leads into my next point, control options and video options. This game has basically none of either, you can change a few basic controls but things like reloading are tied into the USE button as well, so things get very confusing, very quickly. Lastly, I would like to talk about general game design. In terms of actual character design and appearence everyone felt very generic, this is actually a bit ok though as the story itself is a big enough draw to keep you going, rather than the characters, who themselves have great personalities, just terrible designs. In terms of boss design, the few bosses this game has are ♥♥♥♥ing sweet, they all are very different and they are really fun, one of the ones in mid game felt very unique, I won't spoil it, but it involves a train. 10/10 - Despite the flaws, most specifically its length, the unique story, gameplay, and the time travel gimmicks help keep this game at the top of my list, I highly recommend this to lots of people, not very often a give a game a 10!

												Only just recommend - maybe 7/10. It's OK, and the general story is standard experiments caused baddies. Doors close behind you. Everything needs press 'R' to pick up. Generally annoying. Good action shooter though. On my first run the action aspect was so regularly broken up by being lost, picking up stuff, etc. Second play I didn't read any notes, and knew where I was going. Good action like the sniping headshots never get old.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Refreshing survival shooter with an engaging story about secret soviet experiments and time manipulation...Even the weapons, especially the time manipulation device fit nicely in.  (sniper rifle + time dilation = amazing headshots :D )I would say its kind of a mixture between dead space and portal. Everything is very polished, the story is engaging the graphics and physics are nice, weapons can be upgraded as you like. All in all way more fun and engaging than all those boring world war shooters lately.Haven't played it through yet so cant say it its worth the full price, but I got it as a weekend deal and so far it was very much worth the money!

												Singularity is a great game, very under appreciated, it really deserves a sequel. It first comes out as a Bioshock rip off but I actually enjoyed a lot more than that game, it's a crazy mixture of that with Half-Life 2. And maybe inspired the end of Bioshock Infinite? This would not be the first time that a imitation inspire the original franchise.What it really needs improvement is the PC port of the game because this is obviously a direct X360 port, to confirm this  you just need to look at the low resolution of the textures outside of the main areas and, off course, the ""Saving, do not turn off"" warnings.The game don't have a lot of graphics options forcing you to go to REGEDIT to tweak the few extra options like Volumetric Light and Anisotropic filtering (Don't try to run it with the DX10 enable, the game don't support it , I don't even know why there is a option for that) and if you want anti-aliasing you need to force it in your graphics card options. And if the game suddenly don't want to start anymore just reinstall PhysX and will probably fix it.This needs a least a re-release with improved graphics, advanced options and with full steam integration.

												This is the FPS you should be playing. It's fantastic. An FPS/RPG style hybrid where you find resources to upgrade your weapons and abilities. Abilities? Yes, you control TIME. Not just the cheesy slow bullets time either, but you can rapidly age doors to rust them off their hinges, reverse time to reconstruct a rotted bridge, etc. The center of the story is time manipulation, so you can kind of assume the story is all about time travel and the complexities of how that might work. The story isn't revolutionary, but it is well done. The shooting is fun and most of the combat feels very well balanced and executed. This is one of those hidden gems that simply did NOT get the attention it deserved.			",196,18,0,17,10,0,14

The game lacks subtitles and fov options (locked at 65, this is absolutely awful) however this can be fixed with 3rd party programs.

												I just purchased this game for $7.49.  It was on sale for 75% off.  It's normally $29.99.  This is a great game, I remember playing it back when it was released.  This and Time Shift are 2 of my favorite games.  It's a pretty solid shooter with some fun elements to it.  The game runs great and looks great for pushing 6 years old.      At this point in time, I would NOT have purchased it if it weren't on sale, only because I've already played and beaten it before.  If I had never played it, I MIGHT consider paying the $30 price tag, but in my opinio that's just too high for a game this old.  It needs to drop considerably.  At least $20 or less... Maybe even down to $10.  I've seen amazing games only a few years old that are half the cost of this game.  Either way, this is a fun game to play, it's held up over time and runs great.  If you are interested in this game, buy it.  It's worth it.      From my understanding the multiplayer is kind of dead, can't really blame that on the devs.  They can offer the service but can't force people to play.  But don't let that stop you from playing a great game.I hope this review helped someone decide if they want to buy the game or not.  CK			",746,238,13,79,72,7,99

												Looks good plays well and the control system is simple and easy to use its a fun ride and thats what it is a ride... The plot and story is great and is really fun to discover the various twists of what really happened although I cant go into to much detail without spoiling the story.The TMD device is fun and interesting but is really underused, there just isnt enough to do with it and the upgrade system although useful is not relevant enough that you can just bypass it totally.  Ammo is never an issue as there is just endless boxes and crates with ammo, similarly with med kids you will never run out they seem to be around every single corner and you can carry 5 with you (more with upgrades) so its really almost impossible to die or be stuck in a situation where you creep around with almost zero health praying for a med kid.Weapon loadout is varied although once you find your favorite weapon you will probably stick to it for most of the game.

												Missed it when it came out (2010).Recently bought & installed it and find it to be just as good or better than the early METRO 2133/Last Light games (in terms of making progress). Its like the newest Wolfenstein game with the excessive cliche German bad guys.Its got an interesting storyline, and its an atmospheric game.Next time its in a half-decent sale, its a must buy. Heck; its as essential a game to try as Half-Life 2 with the free HD update.Installed and ran first time.... Unlike Alien: Colonial Marines..... now that was a messed-up fergeaddabardit.Summary:`Singularity` reminds me of an adult Game version of what you find in Vietnamese War Museum pickle jars, due to Agent Orange.

												This is such a hugely underated game. It has taken a lot of elements from Half-Life 2, Dead Space, Resident Evil 4, and combined them really well into a game based on time travel and the Cold War.Complete with character and weapon upgrades, the ability to physically pick up and move items, the ability to age certain objects around you, and special abilities (such as instantly aging someone to death, or mutating a soldier into a disgusting creature, which will instantly attack other enemy soldiers).The engine is decent, it's clearly a console port, as the options are very limited, but it all looks fine and runs perfectly smoothly. The sound effects and music are great, and the weapons range from generic assault rifle and shotgun, to a sniper rifle that lets you move the bullet around in real time (like the Redeemer in Unreal Tournament). Which means you can snipe someone in the back of the head, despite being in front of them, and behind cover. It also features a grenade launch, which lets you manually control the grenade, almost like a remote control car (that blows up!).The plot is really impressive, with plenty of great time travel elements, horror, and decent characters.I really highly recommend getting this game. The only downside is that the game is very short (about 10 hours), so you may want to wait for it to go on sale. It does have a multi-player mode though, which may extend the lifespan.

												Singularity has some great thoughts to it but ultimately the circa-2007 graphics & lack of multiplayer kind of kill the fun for me. The graphics are reminicent of the classic FPS called Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, which i've racked up several hundred hours on, but, Singularity is essentially Single-player only at this point in time (multiplayer is dead). Much like Quake4, the graphics are actually too chintzy to forgive & look past & the gameplay doesn't make up for it enough to be worthwhile to slog through. Doom3, even though it is of the same era, has an immediately engrossing 'scary horror thriller' type storyline going on that really takes you into the action. Doom4, of course, is a new classic, but that is unfair to mention since that game came out in 2016 so it has all the razzle-dazzle special effects that are possible in this day & age.The story is just too lacking in feminine influences to me.. are the guys homos or something? where are the broads... Anyways, what really put the nail in the coffin for this particular ""scary FPS thriller"" is the recent purchase of the remastered Metro 2033: Redux, which basically solved the things I thought were annoying about the first game of that series & it is a fun game again. In that game, there are both male and female characters who are active participants in the gameplay, & that makes it WAY more fun. No offense, but no chicks after a while just seems like a sausage-fest. just sayin'! The main protagonist is a guy & this isn't Tomb Raider or anything but it is a little more even-handed & there are couples flirting with each other & people trying to settle down & all that. Oh, and the storyline is excellent & you really get a feel for the events going on. It really takes you into what seems to be post-apocalyptic Russia of the year (you guessed it) 2033 in the future.Rating: 5/10 there are better sci-fi / scary FPS's out there to play instead. OK for it's time, but pretty bad graphically by modern FPS standards. Oh well. The Chipotle burrito & NOS soda I had with the game was good! That's gotta count for something. It was more fun to travel by ZX6r to the fast food restaurant & back to get some food while waiting for the game to load than the actual game.			",56,1,0,5,0,0,3

												There is a big design flaw right at the beginning. There's a point where if you don't grab the shotgun from the weapons locker, you'll empty all of your bullets in the next section. Then have no way to get more ammo or a different gun, and then for the section after that you have no bullets and no way to go back and get more. The only fix is to re-start the game from scratch if you don't make the right choice at that point. The design stinks, with bullet-sponge enemies and stingy ammunition drops. I've looked around on-line, and this is apparently a known problem. I don't see why this is so highly reviewed. Perhaps I did not get far enough into it to get to the good stuff, but this flaw so early in the game totally turned me off. I probably won't re-start and have to go through all of that again.

												Less like a game, more like a fun house ride where you move along a track and things jump out at certain spots.  Except being locked in an area and having things beat on you 'til you run out of ammo and die isn't so much fun.  Seems like they are trying to make something like Bioshock Infinite, but this really doesn't even hold a candle to that game.  Feels forced and stilted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This might be one of the worst ports to PC of a game I've ever played. FPS is locked to 75 (Which isn't really a problem since 60 fps is plenty in my opinion, but it's still just unnessecary)Also there's no subtitles, or way to change the fov, and the fov is REALLY bad, locked in at around 65, it's impossible to see anything in front of you unless you're 2 or 3 feet away from it. Also the game itself is just boring and bland, the guns have no impact or recoil (And whenever they do the recoil moves my aim down....... DOWN! FREAKING DOWN!) and the hit detection is horrible (I shotgun a ""zombie"" to the head, it doesn't die so i shoot it again, and it dies normally, later i shotgunned a ""zombie"" to the torso, it died instantly and it's head exploded) As far as time manipulation goes it's just used to fix broken stairs and walls so it's just a ""Coninue Playing"" button. You can also use it on enemies by making them older which is just a ""Press button and they die instantly"" button. Not that it's even needed since the game is VERY easy. the only good thing about this game is the graphics, which look really good, especially for 2010. Thanks to the good graphics the atmosphere is good too, but that's where the quality stuff ends.Overall the game is generic, boring, and to top it all off the PC port is abysmal.1/5 (Hey, atleast it's not a 0/5) :P			",188,29,3,10,9,0,8

												Singularity is ambitious. Singularity wants to play all sides of the field. Singularity wants to create an engaging and comprehensive FPS experience. Unfortunately for Singularity, it seems far too hollow to be great.This game isn't just a FPS. It is THE FPS. It is quintessential in all ways. Everything that embodies modern first person gaming is here and accounted for. The only notable exceptions are  chest high walls and turret sections. If you've played half life, or call of duty, then you've seen all this game has to offer. Nothing at all will surprise you here. You're better off looking elsewhere if you want an interesting first person shooter.Everything is just so standard. Singularity doesn't take any risks with the formula we're all familiar with. In fact, it seems proud of its influences. The protagonist is silent but gifted soldier who must save the world from countless monsters, the big bad guy, and droves of opposing soldiers. But wait, this protagonist has the power of a magic doohickey that can grab objects and alter the environment to solve basic puzzles. And also there's a scientist, and a secondary female character that shows up sometimes.Nothing is interesting about this game. It seems unable to make up its mind. Its hard to give complements after braving the constant, and I mean CONSTANT audio logs & mundane written notes lying around, the enemies that repeat the same two battlecries, a myriad of jumpscares; (or what I only could assume were supposed to be jumpscares,) a handful of unique enemy types, and a story that left me confused and annoyed. The game tired, I guess. But how many times can I see ghostly scenes of generic russian man #34 screaming, running away from something, or dying randomly before I just get bored and play something more effective at horror and a first person shooter experience. By the end of the game, I just wanted it to end. Not only did I stop paying attention to the plot, I had taken to throwing myself head first into enemies, which was just about the most significant source of fun this game has to offer. There are many better first person shooters to play.			",137,20,0,33,11,1,38

												I played the game for about 3 hours so far and from what i can tell i cannot recommend the game based on what i have seen, only time it is recommendable is when its on severe discount.  First of all the hit detection is off, I blast enemies with weapons and unless im either using a sniper only time that i actual kill normally is in CQ.  The russion version magnum cant shoot crap outside of 5 to 6 meters otherwise I just make my target dance around but thats it, wasted two clips on a single russion soldier with no armor and all that happen was he flinched a few times and went right back so shooting me after i pumped clip after clip into him.  Story is interesting but still am working my way through it.  The time effect ability with objects is pretty cool, especially when it has you take a destroyed box and move it, regen it to make a portable staircase, then destroy it again and plop it under a half closed door and regen it again to make an entrance is pretty good.  Visuals are obviously dated, its a 6 year old game so that makes sense but it does its job well.  The game does the background introduction very bioshocky which is a nice touch but feels copied.  Random tape recorders and projection screens literally are pulled straight from Bioshock as if they blatantly stole their ideas!  Haven't fully completed the game but if the game is on sale for less than 10 dollars its a worth purchase if interested but dont buy it for any more than that!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: October 29, 2015
												I'm into this game for about 4 hours now and I can clearly paint a picture of what I am dealing with here, and it is not pleasant. I will categorize my praise and critisism as far as possible - hopefully without losing focus.Game menue - Skip if not interested. But it gives you an initial idea of how lazy this port was.a) GraphicsIn the graphics menue you will be surprised to find only a choice of resolutions which will all leave your view narrow. With no option to manipulate FOV, since it is not for you to change, this sensation intensifies and gives even me headaches. And I honestly never had problems with FOV before this game - never felt I needed a slider. Additionally, you are able to change minor settings (depth of field, bloo, ""high quality decals"" - I'll get into this later) which are merely cosmetic but the developers do not seem to trust you with relevant stuff like AA or filtering. You can change your Vsync option, though.b) AudioYou will be faced by two possibilities: change your SFX and music volume. That's it. No way turning on subtitles, no choice of sound quality whatsoever. This is just poor!c) ControlsWhile you are able to change certain buttons, you will find yourself in the situation, that *reload* and *use* are assigned to one and the same button. No way of changing that. I am asking: Why? We own keyboards with more buttons than only 12. Laziness strikes again! There also seems to be a rudimental port option featuring aim assist. Other than that, there is no way to lie down or to check a box if you want to be in ironsights permanently or while clicking the RMB.Game worldFirst of all, I have to mention the horrible texture work all over the game,  especially when you're in the year 2010 and see abandoned structures . This and the fact that some textures are not in place at all makes me furious about the obviously lazy devs. I would, without joking, compare those textures to Half Life 1, which came out in 1998! Remember, that Singularity came out a few months after Metro 2033 in 2010. Neither from an atmospheric nor a graphical aspect I can't understand people who compare those games. They have nothing in common. In fact, it is an insult for the devs of A4 Games. I mean, Singularity has its atmospheric peaks here and there ( e.g. research labs, bug's layer ) but they are immediately destroyed by following ""level design choices"". I am talking about absent dynamic lights or objects (not even a flashlight,  which every modern soldier should have ), washed-out sky textures, which look frozen and unreal and cheap weather effects (e.g. rain). It's the same with the leveldesign. It is okay for the most part, nothing extraordinary. But there are so many moments where you will encounter unfinished structures and missing details (e.g. cut-off cables stop mid air and aren't modelled correctly). Unfortunately, there is some kind of physics engine, which is presented rarely. But when you encounter it, boxes will be flying around if you touch them or objects will get stuck and so on. It is super frustrating and happens at random! Other objects, like curbs, debris, bunsen burner nets, door handles, etc block you constantly. Mid-fight this is deadly and overall it is very disturbing to just get stuck in the middle of a room. You will get stuck randomly 1/3 rooms on average. This brings me to the games linearity (LOTS of poorly scripted events though), which does not have to be a bad thing. But this games crams it so far down your throat, that you just want to spit out. Invisible walls every other step, you aren't allowed to jump simple obstacles (like railings), there is no back tracking (doors magically close, invisible walls appear, etc) and there is massive hand holding, when following a fellow NPC. Just terrible and annoying. Unexcusable. On the other hand, you might be allowed to wander off the trail for a few paces: Take a corridor with several doors and one additional opens up for you to have ammo, health or E99 (coming to that later). So, searching in a very limited fashion is rewarded and present. Fighting/Guns/EnemiesThe game is a FPS in a classic fashion which has a focus on arcade gameplay (lots of medipacks, ammunition, buffs, guns, loads of enemies) that reminded me of Serious Sam and Wolfenstein at moments (just the arcade aspect!). If this was executed well, I would not have a problem with that. But the main thing that is terrible, is the KI. Enemies move as slow as if they were in slow motion, they run into walls for seconds and can see you through same. Why  soldiers from 1955 have the same guns as soldiers from 2010  will stay a mystery to me. Many enemies ( mutants and monsters ) are literally bullet sponges, including bosses - this is just something you should avoid, except for boss fights. They spice up the gameplay! At least there is variation in enemy design (at least optically), but fighting feels dull. You can wait in any corner you like for enemies to approach and pick them off one by one (dying animations do not vary a lot with most enemies) without being in real danger. It only gets dangerous when you need to heal, because you will slow down even more (yes, sprinting feels like you are dragging your boots through mud) and only heal 33% of your helath with a forevertaking animation, often leading to death by default. Besides standard guns (shotgun, pistol, assault rifle, etc), there are specials. One of which is the time traveling glove (see below) nourished with  newly discovered  atoms (called E99), which also serve as a means of payment for upgrades. Yes, you actually can upgrade yourself (health boost, accuracy, etc - also from blueprints you find) and your guns, which is an admirable system, although it has been in games (Dead Space) before. But a nice feature nonetheless. Unfortunately, weapon sounds and animations are not at the technical level of 2010 when the game came out and sound/look just awful (again: HL1 like). Story - pretty much a spoiler! The idea of time travelling has been done, of course, but I don't think, there was ever an approach comparable to this game. It is a great idea with nice implementations like portals (rip in the space-time continuum) and even little puzzles. Not like in Portal or Talos Principle of course, but I wished for something more like Half Life 2, since your time traveling glove can lift objects, drain enemies lifes, push them away, etc. Speaking of the ""push effect"" (basically an EMP) I need to say that it feels just so weak. Humans are pulverised into pieces which is surprising and satisfying, but mutants and monsters are merely pushed away a few meters. This is disappointing to say the least. The story in its entirety feels urged and flimsy. The voice acting does its part, because the actors often exeggarate and overemphasize their speaking parts. Stuff like letters, protocols, tape recorders or even movies try to keep the player interested but fail most of the time. The movies are the only thing interesting and even funny to an extent. Now the tough question after all that what feels like negative superiority. Would I recommend it? There is just so much clunky mechanics and minor mistakes combined with visible laziness that adds up to an infuriating melting pot of emotions. On the other hand, if you are only out for mindless and average designed FPS action, this might be something for you. As I expected more of this game, especially because of its praise in magazines and by other players, I can not recommend it. There is just too much missing, which I saw in games like Metro 2033, Half Life 2 or other story driven experiences with a character of linearity. I am not gonna put points on this game, because interest of players might differ too much.			",163,24,0,4,4,0,3

												THE ONLINE IS DEADdo not get this game unless it is on salebut for all intents and purposes this is a rent-beat- return kinda game.I was taking my time triying to find hidden things and still beat the game within 6 hours. -Gameplay(7/10)Call of Duty with Time manipulation. controls are pretty smooth and simple. You can make a slowed time bubble shield, age SPECIFIC enemies and items, and get a force push ability that uses up a TMD meterYou get many passive perks (like holding breqath longer, more sprint, more health) and one avtive perk. for example: restore a little health/TMD every kill.The game is linear, only real choices are at the very end. There is a checkpoint right before the ending so you can see all three results.Dont get me wrong though, this game is really fun. Main flaw is needed more POWERS-Story (non specific spoilers) (4/10)(1st hour)There is an island with a special element that you go to investigate as a part of the US forces. once there you discover russia has time travel. you are flung back im time to a burning building and save ascientist. you return and find that that guy, Demichev, was SUPPOSED to die, and now he is the Russian Dictator trying to take over the rest of the world(bulk of game) You get this device called the TMD. it shifts time, but like the portal gun, only effects specific things in specific areas. You find two people aware of its exisence and help them through many linear levels gt to Demichevs base to stop him. (ending soft spoiler) kill demicev, kill scientist, kill both and become new ruler. No ""Good guy ending""Lots of plot holes along the way there tho but it is rather hard to fill plot holes when you have time travelGraphics (7/10)Look nice and not demanding. Particle effects do their jobONLINE (0/10) There is no online because no one is still playingFinal Verdict (5/10)I use angry Joe's scale; 5 means that this game is average. but interesting to say the least			",71,0,2,7,1,0,0

												Sigularity is a beautiful game with intuitive controls and great effects. The only thing better than all of that is the sound design, which perfectly emulates the vacuum of space.No wait, the game is so old that on windows 7 there's no sound. I spent 7.50 on this game, can we at least have it work with the operating system that came out a whole year before the game was out. I refuse to play a game in a substandard format for no real reason.And yes, I checked the mixer sliders and changed to ""do nothing"", it still doesn't work. If anyone can make the game work without me having to replace my shole sound card, maybe I'll change my mind.			",140,21,1,14,30,0,26

												Singularity is probably a game you've played before with a different title. It kind of feels like a Metro/CoD mashup with too low a budget for any hope of living up to Metro's immersion or CoD's replayability. The combat is unrefined, NPCs are glitchy, weapons are unsatisfying, graphics are downright bad and moving your camera in a normal fashion expected of FPS gameplay might just give you a migraine. That last part could have just been me. I get what they were going for, but sadly this game is exactly what you'd expect based on the trailer and screenshots. If you're into playing an FPS a day, this one might be worth it, assuming it's cheap as heck. In general, though, SIngularity ain't worth your time. Oh, I almost forgot. At exactly 69 minutes into it I experienced a game breaking glitch that would have required me to restart the game since the ""reload checkpoint"" option didn't take me back far enough. I might have tried again but I decided 69 minutes fit well as Singularity's epitaph in my library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I waited a long time for this game to go on sale and I should have waited longer.  It wants to be Bioshock but fails on so many levels that I've just about given up on it.The story is decent and has some interesting concepts, but the mechanics are entirely inconsistent.  In the beginning you are given a knife, as you are given in all modern FPS's, but a few hours in the knife is removed and replaced with an Ironman style repulsor hand thing.  Sounds cool, right?  Not if the repulsor has a recharge delay and can only be used 3 times.  WIthin minutes of losing the knife I wanted it back.  Ammo is plentiful but there are no weapons to be had, so you spend hours collecting bullets for a rifle you had for about 20 minutes at the start and never get back.  I wanted to like this game.  It looks nice, it plays smoothly on my less-than-stellar machine, and it has a decent alternate history story like the recent Wolfenstein game.  But the lack of options when it comes to combat kills the momentum.  I can only shoot the same 4 guys in a corridor before I run out of the ammo I'm given before I quit.			",212,70,5,35,26,2,25

												I finished this game in under 4 hours and is no way worth the £14.99  price tag even if the game is well over 5 years now. [*} The controls are badly done as there is no way to know what buttons done what if you use a controller and the port seems to be from the Playstation 3 and is locked to 30 fps which slows down the responces of the game.[*} The gun models are far to big as they take up a good thrid of the screen and the ablity to only carry two guns quickly become a real pain as they are so slow to upgrade that is not worth it. The monsters are basic types split it to two types the first is all purpose bullet sponges and the second is the boss or stage monster which requires it killing in a very special way but this becomes redundant as they show up again as an all purpose bullet sponge later on in the campaign.So please don't but this game as its still over priced and not worth your time.

												You can only reload at the last save and you can predict but not actually know where the game will save.  So miss something and you can never go back and get it.  You can only carry two  guns so pick the wrong two for the next mystery battle and you may be SOL expecially when playing on high difficulty.    Otherwise it is generic and derivitive but could have been worth a play through and maybe even a hidden gem.  But the save situation makes it not worth the aggrivation.			",52,2,0,8,1,0,3

Posted: September 6, 2015
												I think it stands as testament to how many years I've spent playing first person shooters that I can pick out all of Singularity's techniques that have been lifted from other games. Singularity's first person shooting mechanics are by and large influenced by Call of Duty with a hint of old-school flair. The time powers are largely bits of Bioshock dressed up with a time-travel vibe. System Shock 2 did its ghosts the same way Singularity does its ghosts. But the problem is with all these lock, stock, and barrel 'inspirations' is that the developers didn't bother to see what made them work, and so the game turns into a ♥♥♥♥ing mishmash of things that don't really work well together.There's all these cool weapons! But I ended up sticking with the assault rifle/shotgun duo because they are the most expedient at killing soldiers with guns/melee-focused brutes. There's an awful pistol, but I jumped away from that as soon as I got the assault rifle. There's a sniper rifle that acts like the one from Bulletstorm, but you can't store it in your weapon locker for some ludicrous ♥♥♥♥ing reason. There's a railgun with exploding rounds that's way less accurate than a standard railgun. There's a grenade launcher that you can secondary-fire to take manual control of the grenade, but Jesus Christ, I didn't spend all this time in Quake bouncing grenades off of walls and into ugly faces to be nannied by my own gun! These are all weapons with solutions in search of problems that never really materialize.While this game tries to innovate, it drops the ball in areas where it really shouldn't have. The game is adept at giving you a bunch of help messages and then being completely useless at pointing out exactly where you have to go! Audio logs are 'revolutionized', in that you have to wait in front of an audio log in order to hear it all, which breaks the flow of the game quite a lot. For a game focused around fast-paced running and gunning, it sure has a lot of ♥♥♥♥ing long-winded memos strewn around the place! And they're all information-and-flavor-light variants on ""Something weird happened, technobabble technobabble technobabble, ow a mutant ate my arm, humans are the real monsters"", etc., etc. The game sure has problems telling its own story, burdening down the player with a half-hour's worth of boring, poorly paced and told exposition before the player finally gets to shoot something. But since nobody pays attention to the story, let's focus on the real problem: The difficulty curve. Bioshock, the game that Singularity is drawing little hearts around in its notebook at school, has a proper difficulty curve and it requires you to stay competitive by ingesting plasmids and upgrading them. And by doing that, you slowly become one of the lunatics of the underwater insane asylum. Singularity, on the other hand, has a flat difficulty curve and its upgrades are just token bonuses. You are still the same old American Kick♥♥♥♥♥SuperCool Super Marine that's getting all the MLG 360 NOSCOPE HEADSHOTS, but you can choose to shave a fraction of a tenth off of your reload time on your shotgun. But if you don't choose to, no biggie! Just plug away! No stakes to raise, you're doing good! Everything is fine, just plug away until your shift's over!Singularity is a competent game, but it tries to be other games without understanding how those games became their own thing, and then subsequently fails to become its own thing. It's yet another plodding, mediocre mess from the fine folks at Raven Software.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												This is a linear  fps game with a  Soviet setting, an easy to understand plot, and very standard mesh of  gameplays of the era it was made. There is light rpg character building elements.The ""novelty"" is there are a lot of ""puzzle"" sections with solutions which require you use your abilities to progress to the next checkpoint. Generally there is only one way to solve these sections.Most of the ""choices"" this game offers are not needed. Most sections of the game already have a prescribed way in which they are best solved. So making one of your guns slightly better, or giving yourself more health can only really give you the illusion of choice. I don't reccomend this game because other than it's setting, it doesn't offer anything superior over Half-Life 2. A game which also  uses the same physics engine to manipulate objects in the world to solve puzzles.    You can use your ""magic"" abilities to fight the enemies as well. Though this is rarely needed unless it's the ""point"" of the particular puzzle section you are in. Overall this game got the reception it deserved for having such low expectations of itself.

												Do not pay more then 5$ for this unfinished game with a slapped on ending!this is an ACTIVISION game made by raven not a raven game.This game was not worth the 20+$ i paid for it!!!!!!Lazy programming galore. Mapping done by creating terrain then dropping squares/rectyangles on it and putting in doorways. Several locations you can see the bottom of wall(s) in perfect straight lines because the terrain dips below the corner of the building and they didn't even bother filling it or texturing the bottom of the walls to make them look like something other then a ""forge"" mapping system.Then you have the enemies. they ALWAYS spawn in EXACTLY the same place every time so if you die 2-3 times you usually have it memorised so you can headshot them as they spawn. Sneak has no effect because the spawns ""plate"" triggered so as soon as you step in a doorway, cross an invisible line trigger or hit a ""use"" trigger they automatically come at you ...Storyline MORE then just reminicent of halflife and half life 2. Take halflife 2 .. add portals back and forth in time (always same year) tweak your gravity gun and add ""bullet time"" and localised ""bullet time"" ability weapons. and you have singularity. Depressing since the storyline was actually intriguing up to the point where they wedged in the ending instead of finish the game.			",135,4,1,23,3,0,23

												My major dislike about Singularity was the sudden spikes in the difficulty curve.   In a couple of the set pieces the difficulty spiked to being rage-quit-inducingly hard.Second to that the charecter voice acting was really, really quiet, making it almost impossible to follow the exposition being delivered by the game charecters (this is particularly bad for a time travel based game like Singularity).It felt like the time-travel/time manipulation mechanic was under-used and could have benefited from a more complete Portal-like exploration of the mechanics available to the player.The art and weapons are on par for an Unreal engine 3 game and solidly implemented.The plot felt weak and the finale nonsensical and un-satisfying.  Yet this game is still better than Bulletstorm.			",84,21,0,4,12,0,19

												I honestly do not understand what everyone finds so endearing about this game that I've read from the other reviews.  This is a horror game that mostly only uses jump scares, gross (but generic) monsters and eerie music.  This game has obviously aged and not particularly well which is a little sad for something only from 2010.The shooter mechanics are boring and unoriginal the guns aren't balanced even slightly.  The gunplay itself feels so unsatisfying as you will constantly wonder if you're making contact with the enemy as the usually never react to shots until they're dead or almost dead occasionally.  The secondary mechanics become repetitive very quickly and the age of the game really shows here because you will constantly see things you should be able to use with these mechanics but won't be able to so you can go through the exact script that the director had in mind.  The game is at least a little buggy I had it freeze on me just by reading a note.  It was at that point I just could barely take it anymore, but I kept going on for a little bit.The last straw for me was the suiciding insect enemies that come in waves and are more annoying than zoobats, you will get hit, you will die because you will have no idea where they're coming from until after 5 of them are hitting you from that direction at the same time.  Which is a hilarious contrast to the Russian soldiers you will fight which shout out where they're coming from and who go down quicker than star trek red shirts.  Maybe this one just wasn't for me, I don't know but I could find a lot of flaws here and the plot was intriguing it wasn't good enough to keep me interested past its flaws.			",140,55,0,40,8,1,23

												It's a decent game, but it has a lot of technical problems and is missing some key features. If you liked Half Life 2, Bioshock and Timeshift, but for some reason don't want to play them again, you could buy Singularity. I would say it's not a good game, but a fun game. 4/10.Let's start with the bad. There are no subtitles. Just none, at all. Considering there are usually a lot of sounds and music in the background, and all characters speak with a Russian accent, this is a gigantic problem. Also, it's just rediculous for a game from 2010 to not have subtitles. The second problem are the options. There barely are any graphical options, and even less for audio options. The lack of the latter makes the subtitle problem even worse; you can't just lower the SFX or Music so you would hear the voices better. The graphical options might be a result from a (bad) port. Another minor result of this might be a problem with the controls. In the beginning of the game, you can use a melee attack. However, at some point you get a new power, which is binded to the melee key, and from this moment you can no longer use your melee attack. My guess would be that it's because it was the same button on console, they made it the same button on PC as well. This sucks, since the new power you get on that button is vastly inferior to your regular melee attack.Another control-related problem is the Use/Reload key. For some reason, they put both on the same key, and you can't change that. That means that you either don't have E as Use key, or the R as Reload. You get used to this quickly, but there is still no reason for this to be inconvienent.  The graphical options are bad, and possibly as a result, so are the actual graphics. The style is OK, but the texture quality is decent for the best objects, and it's terrible for some. There are some other problems that bothered me in the beginning, but I got used to fairly quick One of them was animations that would get interrupted by other animations, making it look rediculous. For instance, the recoil animation on your pistol is actually longer than the minimum time between shots, resulting the in recoiling animation ending halfway to display the shooting animation. They either should have made the animations as long as the action that they belong to, or they should have made them go over in eachother better.Another graphical problem is a minor problem with a specific weapon: You are sort of invisible. There is a special weapon that lets you guide a bullet, and it uses a bulled-mounted camera to do so. If you turn the bullet 180 degrees, and look at the position that your character is standing, there is nothing there. Nothing at all. In the meantime, your enemies do see you and keep firing at you. This looks rather rediculous; the enemies fire at thin air...That were most of the big complaints. It's quite a list, and it's the reason I would never call this a good game. I did however finish the game, and most of the time spent I enjoyed myself. That means there must some redeeming qualies.Actually, there is one. The gunplay. It's a shooter, and in the end the most important part is the combat. Which is very enjoyable. There are quite some weapons and they vary greatly. That is, however the only good part, and it's still not perfect. There are many weapons, but I used most of them only for a little while, before realizing it's vastly inferior to my main weapon: the Shotgun. It's so strong that it kills almost all enemies in one shot. With your sprint you are fast enough to avoid most damage, get up close, and one-hit them. This is fun, but it also means that it's not possible without thinking ""This is so much weaker than the Shotgun"" on most other weapons. The only other 2 weapons that I used sometimes were the Sniper and the Minigun, both to deal with enemies from afar. Apart from the gunplay, there's not much to the gameplay. You can use Time-powers in combat, but it's pointless. Depending on the enemy, it's either a useless slow, or an instant kill, and even if it's an instant kill it costs a ton of energy (you can only do this twice in a row, three with upgrades I guess), while you could also just use your shotgun for the same effect. I never had any ammo problems while I did have energy problems, and this is while I always used guns and very rarely the energy powers. The story is enjoyable, but predictable and full of plotholes and half-explained events. For instance, there are some occasions that you change things in the past that change the future (in big and small ways). The problem is that all characters seem to know this while there is no way they could know. The explanation they give has to do with leaving notes, but it makes no sense, and it would imply that everyone believes something because it's written on a wall somewhere. Another big problem with the story is a spoiler for the ending, so skip it if you want to.  In the end the big reveal is that you are the one who changed the past and messed up the world. You saved some scientist from a burning building, and the scientist became a Russian dictator controlling the world. They act like it's a big reveal, but it's glaringly obvious and if you payed any attention to the game you would have know it an hour in. That's not the only problem: the 'solution' they give for this problem is that you go back in time to when you save this scientist, and kill YOURSELF. So you can't just kill the scientist (for no reason whatsoever) and have to kill yourself from the past, creating a time paradox (aka plothole).  That were just some examples of mistakes in the story, and overall I would say this makes the story very forgettable.There are some more problems related to both story and gameplay. The first is the Time-Slow thing you can do while zoomed in with the Sniper. It's quite fun, but for some reason you can use this before you character ever comes in contact with Time-altering powers. It is a real Time power, and not just holding your breath or something, since it's called something like Time Dialation. There is no explanation given for this, whatsoever.The last thing I want to point out is the pointless use of the time altering power on objects. You can make objects yourger and older, which is used for puzzles and hidden areas. It's quite fun, but you can also use it on ammo chests, audio logs and stairs, in which case it's often just pointless waiting. If you find an audio log, instead of just listening to it, you have to repair it by making it new again (i.e. press the Q button) and wait for the animation. The same with ammo chests, and stairs; you just have to wait a second before you can use the object. The idea is fun, but if you have to wait a second before using any object it's just tedious and annoying. So overall, there's not much to this game. Nothing is exceptional, and the fun part (the shooting) get's harder to enjoy because of missing features and technical problems. In general, I think a 2010 game by Raven, published by Activision should have been much better, and it's just unacceptable to not have subtitles in this day and age. The concept was OK, and if they put a bit more time and effort in, I think it could be a very good shooter. Alas, now it's just a below-mediocore shooter. The only reason to buy this would be if all the things below are true:1. It's on sale for $5 or less. 2. You really liked Half Life 2, but have no desire to play it again.3. You really liked Bioshock, but have no desire to play it again.4. You really liked Timeshift, but have no desire to play it again.5. You don't like to listen to music while playing games (since if you do you won't hear a word from the story)6. You know you can get over major and minor problems in graphics, contols, and desing for the sake of enjoyable shooting.			",439,109,3,46,50,4,69

												I didn't expect much, but I was surprised to find a ton of cool game mechanics. The ability to selective age objects, create time warp felds, slow down time when scoping, and use telekinesis opened up a lot of cool gameplay doors. These aren't, perhaps, new features - other games have tried it out before. But this game makes an effort to let you interact with tons of environmental objects, which is nice - it turned an otherwise standard shooter experience into something that felt pretty interactive.But the game's flaws outrank the fun. In order to get the sound to work, you need to disable any recording devices in Windows. The sensitivity bar won't allow you to go lower than a certain amount (which is still way too high), so instead of trying to find a config file, I just halved the DPI on my mouse. The FOV is artifically low (we're talking probably 65, here) so you get a claustrophobic sense of the world.I might have been able to forgive these shortcomings (and I did, for a few hours), but the real killer was the unbalanced gameplay. I handled giant mutants, blinking mutants, hordes of russians, and twisted undead with no problem. But at a specific point in the game, you're placed into the position of dealing with enemies who kill you in 2-3 shots, and which you're unable to really fight back against. The swarm of suicide bugs who, with three different hits, will kill you. The blade-armed assassin mutant who could take a literal dozen sniper shots to the head (!!) without being visibly damaged. These encounters took about half an hour to get past (a long time to spend in one encounter), with lots of frustration. And worst, they're surrounded by other no-problem encounters. I had thought to crank down the difficulty and cheese my way through these speedbumps, but you can't even do that.Add that to the game's general low-res appearance, uninteresting environments (someone said it was all brown - that's true), and unsatisfying sound; and the result was that I simply couldn't find a reason to continue playing.

												5 hours was about right for this. The gunplay was weak, the time powers were underwhelming, and the upgrade system had little in the way of meaningful impact. Except for specific locations where I was required use to particular weapons I blazed through this using an upgraded assault rifle and the sniper rifle. The sniper rifle's time dilation capability was ridiculously overpowered and made most encounters laughable. The storyline was uninteresting and the characters boring. Buy this super cheap for a quick distraction, then go play Bioshock or Dishonored.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is another terrible game made by activision. First reason why not to buy this trash, the mentioned ""time manipluation device"" is one of the most annoying things in this game. second reason with your tmd you go though with your ""advanced weapony"" that basically is on every human enemy in the game after and before you save the doctor. The main reason you would play this game is downcast by the fact that it is used in the most agrivating way, say you come across your typical copy and paste garage door that you open with what? Oh yah a crate you have to use your time powers to get this mighty crate to place under the garage when you can clearly just go under this got me stuck at the begging of the game for some time and I was supposed to open it with a crate I thought you would look for a button or something, later on things get ""explained"" to you. The save are so bad I wish there was a save slot where I could save myself (I dont save often in games so I suffer from this but this is unbearable) lets explain so I was fighting a mini-boss so I died a couple times as you would expect but where I respawned was the bad part that mini-boss wasnt too hard but I had to redo a puzzle and rewatch a cutscene before i could fight it again. Still reading good, im about done now, so you are forced to forced to build your relationship with a girl with a gun who has you shoot everything for her she gets kidnapped and you rescue her with a minigun. later you fight a boss with said minigun and I havent got passed that part nor do I care but for the being able to have more reasons to hate this game and tell you not to buy this garabe that your friends actvision who shouldn't make singleplayer games made for your displeasure! well turns out in this game you have to equipe your upgrade so basically all your first upgrades are useless you only need one!

												Not really a bad game, it's just kind of an ugly, boring shooter that doesn't know what it wants to be. It starts out reminiscent of Bioshock, where you are in a facility where something has gone wrong and you only have notes and film projectors and such to seemingly place together the story. However, you then are introduced to the time travel mechanic and the game becomes a lot more plot heavy and ""shootbang"".  There's about a 2 hour interlude of sorts where everything slows down and there's a drastic darker tonal shift which makes the game resemble something more like Metro 2033. I suppose it's interesting to have a game that blends different styles together but instead of being its own thing, Singularity ends up just seeming rather incoherent. There's also plenty of sections where you are simply running down corridors and shooting up nameless goons, where it really doesn't resemble anything other than maybe Call of Duty, only without any real spectacle.The weapons are interesting, but I ended up using the assault rifle 90% of the time. Sure, I suppose you can say it's up to the play to spice up their loadout, but none of the enemies really suggested that anything else would have been a better option. The vigor/plasmid type powers are actually pretty cool and, unlike Bioshock Infinite, I found it pretty cool to not only rely on gunplay, but to also use the TMD abilities in the firefights as well. There's really only 2, maybe 2.5 ""boss fights"" in the game, which are interesting enough. The game doesn't look the greatest and there are a lot of bad bad textures.So if you've already played all of the Bioshock games and the Metro games and you want something vaguely similar and have a few days to spend on it, sure, grab this. Otherwise I can't really recommend it over any of those.			",99,12,0,27,2,0,17

												A boring game drowning in its own narrative nonsense. Prepare your mouth and throat, because you'll be chugging a constant colonic stream of exposition via cutscenes, audio logs, notes lying around, and projector videos. This game throws 1000 words at you in the first hour, and for what? Clearly to convince us that we should shoot the blue zombies in the face before they punch us to death. Still hopeful? The FOV is locked at 65 without external fixes. To Raven's credit, it's fiitting that a game that drowns you in words also gives you sea sickness.			",335,47,0,34,13,3,37

												Don't believe what everyone is saying about this game. When you get down to it it's another cookie cutter shooter. It's got all those really annoying support characters as well as annoying enemies. The gimicks aren't fun and they certainly aren't fluid in combat despite certain enemies being designed around them. Ammo frequently becomes a problem even with pinpoint accuracy because some of the most basic enemies can take several shots to the head keep coming. Even with a fully upgraded sniper you need to double tap basic ghouls in the head. The enviroment is packed with generic story collectibles that don't serve much of a purpose and frequently will be drowned out by ambient screams. Like most generic shooters the music keeps playing even after the action has stopped.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm going to be very blunt in my review: Singularity is Activisions version of Bioshock. So Russia is involed.So, you're a black ops agent in an op in Russia and you decided to save a guy in the past. The butterfly effect therefore tells you to bend over and bow down to the soviet union as this new element, Adam- I mean, E99, has time manipulation abilities. You use your plasmids- I mean TMD, to freeze people and shoot them, age them, turn them into monsters, or teleketically grab objects to improve your abilities. You find shiney metal ""Power to the People""- I mean, weapon boxes, to upgrade your weapon that absolutely no one has heard of, but are remarkable similar to the AK-47, a shotgun, a rail gun, a sniper, and other guns.The game is very liniar and eventually leads to a paradox that is just absolutely looked over. I'm sure there's multiple endings but the one I got was ""You killed the Russian leader and the guy that was helping you. Then you disappear and become president of the US with the hand of God. cuz FUGGIN 'MERICA!!!""Is it worth $29.99 after 4 years of it's release? ♥♥♥♥ no. Is it worth $7.49 during special sales? ♥♥♥♥ no. Wait till it's... like... $2.49. Or find the console version in the shitbins at a local game store.			",1048,364,27,181,126,13,182

												A generic Sci-Fi FPS that distinguishes itself by having a Time Reversal gameplay mechanic. Basically at a certain point in the game, you will get an equipment that lets you reverse or forward the effects of time on objects and enemies.Its an interesting concept that works well in some of the puzzles it presents, and the various interesting ways of dispatching your enemies. The basic FPS element in this game is however nothing special, and is as generic as the next FPS on the market.Sound is acceptable, with the usual standard clunks and effects one would expect. Music while good, is not particularly memorable and you will not be talking about it anytime soon after finishing the game.The story is interesting, if abit cliche. Its pretty short however, at only about 8 hours. While its a competent game in itself, it brings nothing special or revolutionary to the FPS genre.Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10An average run of the mill FPS with a few tricks. Give it a try if its on sale.			",301,40,3,48,14,0,22

												Being a fan of pretty much anything cold war, I'm probably not the best to write an impartial review on much based on it. However, I can't reccomend this game to anyone else.While the graphics are definately impressive, that's pretty much where the goodness stops. Gameplay is hideously repetitive, with the same old enemies in the same old waves. The story is hilariously bad, full of holes and poor twists and things that are brought up only to be immediately dropped ten minutes later, if the plot remembers it exists at all. The voice acting is laden with fake Russian accents, blown completely over the top. The fake RPG elements are pretty much pointless, with the upgrades doing little to affect much of everything.But the ability to shift stuff through time is pretty cool, but it also doesn't make up for the gaping holes in the rest of the game.

												A Mix bag of: Bioshock meeting Crysis, who both makeout with Dead Space, who's, in turn, seeing secretly Half-life! This epic romance made this child called Singularity! This game is strange in the sense that you'll feel that you've played it before ( if you played the other games then you did!!). The setting stage for this entertainment piece of software, its  a kind of ""Cold War"" roller coaster were you are a hero strangled  between past and future, and in the present(s) of both past and future. You will have to find a way to correct the past (Cold War), so that your future (Post Apocaliptic Cold War) will turn out great and then your present (Today i hope) will be fine! which makes this plot kind of messy!The Soviets antagonists are the  ""Rambo III movie"" type: super heavy accent, shoot to miss first, and ask no questions later, well... 'cause they haven't got any! The game is linear , but the annoying kind of linear, like you can't jump over a rock with the height of your knees, invisible barriers and debris who push you away from interesting sets. Mid game allies also are the only ones who can open certain doors. The soldier enemies have a set clock agenda to when to strike, some rush and then stay... and stay, until they are gun down!The female ally is a rip-off of Alyx from Half-Life 2, only eastern european, the doctor is the typical unconscious scientist (seen many times in James Bond Movies and Mission Impossible 2) who never thought the thing he created could possibly mess the world more than the Cold War itself! He gives a task and there you go, all the time, all the game.Were this game excels:The TMD - AKA ""the mechanical plasmid""- that lets you control time, degrades boxes, electrical boxes and turn humans into monsters later on. Visually and graphic wise its very impressive when you turn a oxidated torn apart train to its ancient glory.The Monsters - AKA ""the soviet splicers/necromorphs"" - hyper deformed former soldiers and habitants of the isle, who are agressive and fight in packs (sometimes), some have nice ""powers"". The mini bosses are tough and challenging. The Seeker Rifle - AKA "" Curved bullet Wanted movie ability in a stick"" - the description speaks for it self, slow pace bullet in slow time. The Ending- 3 possible endings! Were is not very good:The setting - Cold War? Seriously!?  The sounds - Soldiers have only 3 phrases, they speak 2 and repeat the last one until their deaths or yours, and in every room there is a sound for every a balcony bell, for dead phones and typewriters, wich make no difference in the game or plot wise Visually - The graphics, seem rushed and random there are glitches, the hero has a tendency to get stuck.The upgrade TMD\Hero\Weapons system - only 10 - 30 % of upgrades  are actually usefull, the others are thrown just to keep you occupied.The Endings - the endings could be something epic, but its disappointing, because in the 3 possible ending its focus in the same mistake, when the solution which is quite obvious its ignored... some say its on purpose because a sequel was in the works for this game... still very bad choice!Not worth to buy, but reasonable to play, if only to use the TMD			",36,0,1,2,2,0,3

												You know those games that create a unique, compelling, immersive world?  This is not one of those games.This game reminded me strongly of the Russian-created game, ""You Are Empty,"" which also sends you through a destroyed world created by Soviet super-science gone horribly awry - AND involves time travel.  One detail - ""You Are Empty"" came out in 2007.  Hmm.  Funny, that.Anyway, though ""You are Empty"" feels like a game created by a small indie studio, the super-Soviet world they created felt more authentic than the one in Singularity, created by big studio Raven Software.I am still playing it, but my biggest pet peeve so far is when they have English text with silly things like backwards 'R's, I suppose to make it seem Russian.Anyway, the gameplay is reasonable, though not particularly inspired, so if you get it cheap enough, and you aren't expecting much, you should have some fun. My ""thumbs down"" is based on the current price of $29.99.			",101,17,1,10,15,0,8

												Couldn't get into it. Singularity has a lot of interesting ideas, but takes advantage of none of them. The game's big gimmick, the TMD, is nothing more than a contextual extra ""use"" key. While it has other abilities to use against enemies, none of them I encountered were entirely necessary to use. This is mostly because the game's assault rifle is the greatest weapon ever created in the history gaming. With plentiful ammo, high accuracy, low recoil, and able to take out most common enemies with one headshot, there is no real reason to use any other weapon. It's effectiveness causes the novelty of the games ""unique"" weapons to wear off very fast. Sure, you can use the gun that allows you to guide bullets into enemies around cover, or slightly out of your line of sight. But in the time it takes for you to guide that bullet into a single enemy, you can kill that same enemy and his 5 comrades, and the rest of his reinforcements in the same amount of time with that godlike assault rifle. There is nothing else to the gunplay, just shoot them in the face with the AR and gg. You can't even throw grenades. You'll find more depth in a CoD game, which is an impressive feat I must admit.Beyond the boring gunplay there is not much else of merit. The story suffers the same logical inconsistencies of any story involving time travel. My favorite part was going back in time to stop the evil Russian general from killing the good scientist, and after bursting into the room, unloading 10+ bullets into his face and blasting him through the window several stories above the ground, he ends up surviving and going on to rule the world. ♥♥♥♥in Russians man. The characters are dull cliches ripped off from other, better games. The evil general, the good scientist, and the random woman helping you are basically the Russian copies of Dr. Breen, Dr. Kleiner, and Alyx from HL2. There's also the incredibly generic soldier buddy that you'll find by the dozens in any CoD game. You spend about the first 30 minutes of the game with him until he gets shot in the face by the general because he's a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing moron. This of course is after you get randomly sent back in time and accidentally save the general because you're a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing moron as well. The only interesting attribute of any of them was the well modelled♥♥♥♥♥of the woman, but I digress...Overall, Singularity is an incredibly bland shooter with some well conceptualized yet poorly executed ideas. If you absolutely must try it however, or you think I'm full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the very least wait to buy it when it's on sale for $5 or less.			",151,7,2,17,19,2,41

Game was published by a greedy game company called Activision, and developed by puppets Raven Software. There was never a good game developed by those idiots, trust me.There was one of hundred stupid moments in the beginning, when you watch russian tutorials or whatever it is, they are so fake and made american way, i nearly puked.

												Corridor shooter with all the modern FPS garbage checkboxes marked off. 2 weapon limit, boring ""realistic"" weapon selection, virtually unlimited ammo and health kits, clausterphobicly linear, and enemies that range from boring to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Tries to steal all the best elements from recent releases but ends up feeling more like someone tried to glue together a jigsaw puzzle instead of solving it. There are some beautiful sets with great texture work & models but the glaringly awful random bad textures cancel out most of them. Probably the most infuriating part is that even with multiple endings they are all BAD END. Multiplayer is consolified ""Quick Match"" matchmaking only with no lobby system or friends-only private games. There are upgrade systems for your weapons and character but if you are thorough (which it isn't hard to be in a corridor shooter) you will have everything maxed by the end of the game anyway.This game is the cancer killing the industry. Don't bother.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												I sat down to play Singularity AND engage in the ""Bioshock drinking game"" at the same time, which is, to take a drink every time the game references or shamelessly rips off Bioshock. I don't remember much as I passed out somewhere around the end of the first level due to being massively inebriated. When I awoke several hours later, the two paramedics now standing over me, took very little pleasure in informing me, than due to almost unbelievable levels of intoxication, my liver was now damaged beyond all hope of repair. To summarise, if you played Bioshock and thought to yourself ""This game is too good, I actually prefer my gaming experiences to be far more generic and around four-fifths ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than this"", then my friend, Singularity, is for you.

There are literally 4different game mechanics designed to just keep you from getting utterly lost and disoriented. It borrows in very obvious ways from Bioshock (with its steam punk atmosphere and pseudo magic) and Half-Life (Alyx occasional sidekick) It feels more like a cross between whack a mole and pac-man with cut scenes.  The story and setting is genuinely interesting, but the execution is awful.			",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												When I first started playing this, I thought that it was an interesting concept for a game. However, the further I got, the less I liked it. The reason why I don't like it is because it tries to be several different games at once. To the best of my knowledge, it tries to be Half Life 2, Bioshock, Timeshift, and Modern Warfare at the same time. If implemented correctly, it could be an interesting game but it just doesn't work. In fact, I was so bored by the game that by the time I got to the end, I didn't even care what happened to any of the characters anymore. That's pretty much why I didn't like this game; it's because it's boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Are you sure you want to quit...How stupid is that...?I gave it another try, 'cos it actually isn't a bad game...Then next next issues: I got captured... all my weapons and upgrades were gone...I got only pistol afterwards according to game script... got that updated (more damage, bigger clip)...However, I need 10 shots to kill this mutated enemy and there were 5 send at once to make my life heavy... i don't have enough ammo for them even after weapon upgrade...But what is helping is to uninstall then game, not to lose more nerves on game logic...As said, not a bad game, but also nothing for me as it looks...

												Game has multiple plot holes which can easily be explained away by the fact that time travel in this game is dependent on the element E-99. If a subject (living or not) does not have any amount of E-99, then time changes upon said subject is nil.Now, depending on the amount of E-99 in a subject (we are talking particles here), then the more ""powerful"" the time changes is on the subject.That's a big premise to the game. You just can age or make new every and any thing in the game. Graphics are fine. Weapons are nice. You can upgrade your weapons, your time manipulation device, and Renko, which you play as.Story is...meh. Multiple endings. Missing one in my opinion.			",137,46,0,15,23,0,19

												I have been a long time fan of Raven Software ever since discovering Jedi Knight 2 when I was a wee 9th grader. Last year's Wolfenstein was a bit tedious after you got into the meat of the game, yet was still quite entertaining to me. Starting Singularity, I was immediately captivated and interested in where the story was heading, invoking a cheesy albeit charming science-fiction-B-movie feel. The pacing is great and the game mechanics heavily remind me of a hybrid of Half-Life 2 and Bioshock. I was honestly taken aback by how much I liked this game, though the $50 pricetag is steep for a June 2010 release (I bought it in October for the full $60!). I say it was still worth it though, they deserve my money, they did quite well!			",330,75,3,39,19,3,44

This game is fun any time of the day, it's just a blast. Like in Timeshift, I don't find myself pushing toward the game's conclusion, but rather enjoying every second of the journey to it.

Time “puzzles” are very simple. Maybe worth a two playthroughs.  ",130,10,2,16,14,0,13

												I love time travel stories - and this delivers!*minor spoilers*Yes, it is very linear. Yes, the story is not *that* original. And yes, in normal difficulty the game throws medipacks and ammo at you continously so that you never need to worry. There are some easy-to-solve switch puzzles that make for rather quiet situations, followed by explosive killfests with mangled bodies flying around. The weapons are awesome, especially the ""experimental"" stuff like the steerable bullet that make your targets explode in a fountain of flesh and blood. Very satisfying :)Although the story isn't outstanding, it is brilliantly told! Scripted events, explosions, dialogues, story twists... the Half Life-Formula is working great. The level design is good enough to let you dive into the world - which is disturbed by invisible walls you often walk into. Overall I was entertained from start to end - and that is what I want when I play a science fiction FPS ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay. I am going to start this out by saying something: THIS IS A HORROR GAME.I personally picked it up because I enjoy games with interesting twists, like using time in combat. Nowhere said that this game is scarey. It ♥♥♥♥ing is.That said, lets review:THE GOOD:Time and combat work very well together, you can (once you get the right upgrades) slow/nearly stop time, blast people's legs, arms and heads off, age/reduce in age objects, people, and mutants, as well as shoot them up with a big♥♥♥♥♥shotgun, or whatever else you fancy.If the game is meant to do horror, it does it well (for me), with various jumpscares that are very nicely implimented (ie. scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you since you don't expect them), and the atmosphere is one of uncomfortable ruins.The shooting works. You shoot people, if you shoot them enough, they die. The guns sound quite weak, which is normal for modern shooters, but people react to some extent when shot (especially with the shotgun)Basic upgrade system for guns, with some customisation for your time powers, and various perks you can get.New mechanics are added constantly through the game, so you never feel like your game is stagnating.Although the game is completely linear in its story until the end (2 endings and a 'hidden' ending), there are plenty of areas to explore that can add 1-3 hours onto the game (its about 6 hours if you just follow the footsteps)THE BADThe plot is a little hard to follow at times, and there are some questions at the end I just want answering, and don't seem to be answered. I won't leave them here as they WILL spoil the game for you.The AI is a little off. People with guns will generally either stay where they are (which is typically in the middle of a corridor with no cover) or just run to their set position and start firing. Mutants just run towards you on the shortest trajectory.Not many bosses as such, only a couple of points where you meet more powerful mutants that are annoying to kill. To make up for that, you have a couple of timed RUN AWAY sequences. Yay.One of the time powers is really annoying to set off, as it involves pressing the button for another power twice quickly, which rarely works. I guess this is probably a legacy from consoles, where you have about 8 buttons for everything.The description on the store page isn't quite telling the truth. You do no 'travel seamlessly between 1955 and 2010'. The game pretty much orders you into a rift so you can go back in time, do something to alter the future, then go back into the present to carry on as normal. You don't get the choice of when you want to go back, you just have to.The UglyThe graphics are quickly aging, and not terribly gracefully.Those mutants are not going to win any beauty contests any time soon.Overall score: 74/100. If you like horror FPS games, pick it up, if not, then its probably for the best to leave it. I got it on sale and it was well worth the cost, even if it did leave me with a couple of nights when I regretted playing it in the evening.			",161,38,11,36,36,2,38

												Despite of being mostly a linear first person shooter, the game has so many interesting things on its story and gameplay mechanics, that for me it ended up being and amazing game that no fps fan nor a lover of good stories should miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall 5/5One of the best FPS games I've ever played. Amazingly fun weapons, and abilities. Tons of replay value on this game, with three possible endings, one of them being hidden. Fantastic storyline, with great twists that mess with your head. The game is constant action, with tons of opprotunities to switch weapons, and upgrade your abilities and guns. The time reversion and advancement make this game very unique for an FPS and open lots of strategies for some of the harder opponents. A must buy for any FPS fan.			",104,7,1,5,0,2,0

												A great gem of a game.  Flew well under the radar.  The single player keeps you drawn in with plenty of surprises, upgradeable weapons, and the ability to buy perks with ""E99"" that you find around the game.  It is a bit linear, but you will be searching every nook and cranny for blueprints and money.  A definite buy for the FPS fan			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Singularity is a decent little spectacle shooter. Typical controls, decent graphics, a solid scifi plot staple. Nothing impressive, just a decent little game.The only problem would be the multiple endings, and how one of them is extremely contrived.All in all if you like fps shooters, pick it up.

												I just beat this game (got it during a steam sale for $10) Well worth the purchase!I would say the graphics themselves are only about a 7.5... (but they used them well!)It was a very atmospheric game, (very immersive) It draws you in very easily. Story is good, and ending isn't all that typical... (music adds to it and is pretty good, nothing that noticably stands out on its own though)The performance of the game is pretty Stellar, I mean its smooth (Max @1080p, 8x AA, 16x AF, 4xSSAA transparent surfaces) kept a constant 60 fps (minus one or two areas, not noticable to 99% of gamers out there) The weapons (although the selection isnt massive, meaning there isnt a lot to choose from, but there is enough) They are unique, and the actual gunplay is fun, and the ways to kill using your special skills and technologies! It was a fantastic game and Highly recommend it to any of my friends who are fans of FPS. This is based solely off of the single player campaign!			",155,6,0,10,4,0,30

												Ever wanted to change the course of history? Now might be your chance! Singularity is an exciting, high-paced strategic first person shooter. The atmosphere and general ambiance of this game are fantastic and eerie, creating a great environment for a gamer to feel right on edge. Allow a multitude of bizarre mutants to try and slash your face open, all the while penetrating deeper into the story presented within the game. Unveil layer upon layer of magnicifent insanity until you are at last presented with an important choice that will alter history as we know it, forever.In short: a great game, A++ graphics, SUPERB storyline and well, stop reading! Go play!			",45,9,0,7,8,0,0

Dr. Barisov is actually Leo Trotsky dat wants u to save his old friend Stalin, from being killed from the back by crazy one-eyed typical James Bond villian. Also u can make those inhumans old and transform them into worst inhumans dat were never seen by hitler. So after many drunk fights u will find urself in a tough choice situation.

Add in a good story and varied enviroments and its not a bad romp through once or twice good to kill time and controle it also.			",131,14,1,19,13,0,27

												A Bioshock clone in all the right ways, this title borrows heavily from all the recent heavy hitting action games. The story is adequate though a little predictable, but this gem shines through most with its gunplay/gameplay.  Animations are spot on, and all the enemies excel at entertaining you with the way they interact with your bullets. Weapons are diverse and satisfying, and the time bending abilities you gain make a big impact in your combat strategies. This is a highly underrated game.			",323,46,3,29,12,2,21

												This game is great, it really nailed it in terms of atmosphere and story. Singularity may not be extremely well known and didn't sell very well, but I don't see why. This game is like a military-style shooter at times with some ""Bioshock"" mixed in. It aims to be a horror game and if played with a headset and in a dark room it can achieve this at times. This game greatly exceeded my expectations and is definitely worth a buy when it's on sale!			",247,32,7,19,10,1,9

												One of my favorite games to just sit and play. The aesthetic is great, there's a small but varied set of weapons, and an upgrade system with several different perks. I can't really describe it in any other way, but this game is FUN. I love a bunch of triple-A titles, but sometimes I'm not in the mood to play them. This game is fun any time of the day, it's just a blast. Like in Timeshift, I don't find myself pushing toward the game's conclusion, but rather enjoying every second of the journey to it.

												Pros- gameplay is satisfying and relatively fast paced. Story is… well shooter story material, interesting but nothing to write home about. The suspense at the beginning of the game is well done. Time manipulation is interesting yet straightforward. Cons- suspense cuts out very quickly after the enemies change, but combat picks up a bit. Time “puzzles” are very simple. Maybe worth a two playthroughs.  ",130,10,2,16,14,0,13

												I love time travel stories - and this delivers!*minor spoilers*Yes, it is very linear. Yes, the story is not *that* original. And yes, in normal difficulty the game throws medipacks and ammo at you continously so that you never need to worry. There are some easy-to-solve switch puzzles that make for rather quiet situations, followed by explosive killfests with mangled bodies flying around. The weapons are awesome, especially the ""experimental"" stuff like the steerable bullet that make your targets explode in a fountain of flesh and blood. Very satisfying :)Although the story isn't outstanding, it is brilliantly told! Scripted events, explosions, dialogues, story twists... the Half Life-Formula is working great. The level design is good enough to let you dive into the world - which is disturbed by invisible walls you often walk into. Overall I was entertained from start to end - and that is what I want when I play a science fiction FPS ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd say that Singularity is underrated considering I've not heard much about it; I decided to buy it during the summer sale.  It took me about 8 hours to complete and I enjoyed the gameplay. I was probably about two hours in before the game picked up so if you're feeling bored at first, don't be too discouraged to continue on. You're given the Time Distortion Device and are able to upgrade it throughout the game. The TMD lets you solve puzzles and perform combination attacks on enemies. The combat was fun and the boss fights were also fun; you're given at least a couple options for killing things so it is entertaining in that aspect. There are notes to read and audio logs to listen to throughout the game that will help fill in the story.I enjoyed the audio and the graphics were decent but consider that this game was made in 2010 so the visuals aren't just awesome. There is no anti-aliasing setting in the game's options but you can simply override that in the NVIDIA Control Panel and it should work. I likely won't replay the game since I read everything the first time through, but it was worth the sale price.			",245,31,5,11,4,1,5

												Good graphics, very distinct almost alien landscapes at times.Good gameplay (although NPC AI is basic, the idea is generally to kill enemies asap not marvel at their cognative abilitys, am i right?)Decent story with multiple endings, several shocks to be had but more creepy than horror for the most part.The time control mechanic is well implimented and fun as is the game in general, as well as having several functions blatantly ripped from valves ""gravity gun"" mechanic.Play time clocks in at around 6 - 9 hours of solid gameplay, which is about average as far as FPS' go.no bugs to report on my playthrough, however i did at certain points get 10 second freezes (around 6 or so in complete play through) however that could be a problem on my end as easy as it was the games. A far better effort than generally to be had from russian developers and more polished to boot.... like metro 2033 but not pants			",169,10,0,9,1,0,18

Short AnswerShould you buy it - $30 is a little bit much for a four year old game but it is a good game and if you really like FPS's, YesShould you buy it on sale - AbsolutelyLong AnswerSingularity is a standard FPS with just a little bit more that sets it above the norm.Visuals : The visuals in the game wont destroy your graphics card or anything but it does tax it a little bit. The scenery and set pieces look very nice, sometimes really pretty. There is no reuse of areas that I can tell ( aka same corridor syndrome ) and you will get a good feeling of progression ( you can visually see getting closer to your goal). The enemies look nice but dont change much in the looks area but at least you dont get the same guy but his time hes red! Overall - Good looking game that helps to visually immerse you into the world.Story and Setting : (Spoiler Free) The setting is an Island off the coast of Russia that has some dirty little secrets and as a US special forces soldier you have to infiltrate the island and find out what is going on. As a base story it is just like most of the other FPS games out there but Singularity adds a nice twist on the basic formula that makes it feel new and refreshing. Overall - The story wont break the bank on amazing plots but it will engage you very well and help to keep you playing to find out what happens next.Gameplay : This is were the game really sets itself above a normal FPS. It has a slight rpg feel with upgradeable weapons and skill selecting although neither is a game changer or breaker. It has good gun play and the powers that you use are fun and work well but what this game does really well is that it lets you play the way you want to. No, there is no stealth or anything like that, it is all action and if something is in your way it has to die but the game gives you incredible freedom on how it dies.   You can play and complete this entire game with nothing but guns or once you get your powers you can complete the entire game with those. It never limits you and it gives you plenty of ammo or easily throwable items no matter which way you want to play. Overall - The gameplay is great and gives you a great feel of freedom that never tells you how you should play it Replayability : While the story does give this game a little bit of replay ( you might want to play again just to see all the clues you didnt understand in the first playthrough ) and the gameplay lets you play it again in differnet ways, there is really no reason to play it more than a few times.Personal overall enjoyment - This game was a good change of pace to me for normal FPS's. I enjoyed playing the game and was glad of the purchase I made. I will probably play it again sometime down the line and have no problem recommending it as a good game.			",154,47,0,58,11,3,63

												A very good game. A bit easy on ""normal"" but had some difficult parts even then.You are a member secret military strike force with a mission into the heart of Russia. They have discovered a very powerful energy resource and a bad guy has taken it over. As your birds approach a blast in the distance produces an energy shockwave that knocks you out of the sky and you crash on the island.You are trying to be evaced as the story unfolds, and the story is pretty good. :)You follow a tight path with little exploreing. You can search some areas for hidden items and power ups. The game play is arcade like with power and ammo drops.You find new weapons at key times- just before a new type of baddie. Even though most of the monsters are really cool and one or two gave an okay challange.As you find canisters of ""E-99"" you use it to add powers to your character like slowing time in a makeshift bubble or blasting back creeps with a blast of plasma.The ending gives you a few differant wrap ups depending on the path you choose- I sugjest checking the alts out ;)The multi-player is dead nobody is playing it but seems to be a team deathmatch with ""flag"" capture points versing the monsters against the soldiers.All in all I feel it was worth the cash I spent... It was on sale but hey....If you like games like Bioshock and Metro chances are you will like this one.-GrAnD™			",459,78,1,67,18,1,38

												I really liked it. I am surprised it was published by Activision as all they really do now is COD. A much better shooter than COD has ever been and liekly ever will be. Shame we didn't get a sequel. I am not going to give it a score but I will give it pro's and cons.+Nice lighting effects and pretty descent graphics esspecially for it's time.+Nice fairly original story+Fairly interesting characters+Good monster and enemy design+Fairly interestign guns+Nice not in-your face progression+Good level design, also good puzzle design. Puzzles are nto stupid hard btu nto really easy either and there are not too many of them either.-Gun sounds need more work. Not very punchy sounding. The Magnum style gun in particular and the sniper rifle.-A bit short hwoever if you want a short game this is perfect. I completed it in 7 hours. I explored everywhere as well.-Gun's could have been a bit more interesting. Mabe a secondary ability on the autocannon would have been nice adn the shotgun.-Progression system and weapon upgrades are very boring. Would have liked to have seen some E-99 infused guns like the autocannon rounds fired E-99 shells, fires slower but packs a hell of a punch. That would have been cool.-No side quests.-Linear game but encourages exploration.-Difficulty is a strange one. I would have liked to have seen a setting between Medium and Hard. Hard is stupid difficult and Medium is just too easy.There arfe probably more pro's and con's but I cannot think of them all.I decided to give it a score in the end but at the end so you ahve to read it all......hahahah.I give it an above average of 6/10. In comaprison I would give BF4 a 5/10 so thats pretty good. Average is a 5 and this game is not average in anything. An overall great game if I am honest and is great value for only £2 soemthing.EditThe game is a great PC port. There are a descent amount of settings. Nice sound assets other then the guns. Frame rate is wanderful. FOV seems to be ok with this game in retrospect I play all my games at at least 95-100 if I can. This game is probably 80 around that but it feels very pleasant to play for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I beat it in about six hours, so if you can get it at a sale price its totally worth it. I really enjoyed this game :D I reccomend anyone to go and pick it up!			",172,25,0,60,20,1,20

												A very good game. A bit easy on ""normal"" but had some difficult parts even then.You are a member secret military strike force with a mission into the heart of Russia. They have discovered a very powerful energy resource and a bad guy has taken it over. As your birds approach a blast in the distance produces an energy shockwave that knocks you out of the sky and you crash on the island.You are trying to be evaced as the story unfolds, and the story is pretty good. :)You follow a tight path with little exploreing. You can search some areas for hidden items and power ups. The game play is arcade like with power and ammo drops.You find new weapons at key times- just before a new type of baddie. Even though most of the monsters are really cool and one or two gave an okay challange.As you find canisters of ""E-99"" you use it to add powers to your character like slowing time in a makeshift bubble or blasting back creeps with a blast of plasma.The ending gives you a few differant wrap ups depending on the path you choose- I sugjest checking the alts out ;)The multi-player is dead nobody is playing it but seems to be a team deathmatch with ""flag"" capture points versing the monsters against the soldiers.All in all I feel it was worth the cash I spent... It was on sale but hey....If you like games like Bioshock and Metro chances are you will like this one.-GrAnD™			",459,78,1,67,18,1,38

												I'm big on story. So, with that said, I loved this game.  Very engrossing, atmospheric, sf/horror. Has the feel of Metro 2033 with a little more fright.  Great graphics, cool concepts like a weapon that causes things to age (either direction). I'm a philosopher, so stories with rich concepts (moral, technological, etc...) really grip me. Anyway, I recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I awaited a bit long for a sale before buying this game; I must say that I shouldn't have awaited so long and just bought it at full price, because it worth it.Around the internet you'll see some people comparing Singularity to Half-Life 2 and Bioshock, so I'll compare too, but I'll show what points those games has in common with Singularity, so you can form your own opinion. Story You play as captain Nathaniel Renko, who comes to a misterious island called Katorga-12 after the military has received some signs of radiation while its radar was passing by the Eastern Russia; when you arrive at the island, it is a desolate place, abandoned long ago for unknown reasons, while some kind of military reasearch has gone completely wrong when the russians discovered a new element called E-99. Gameplay Some people say that this desolated island has some resemblance with Bioshock's rapture or even Half-Life 2's City 17, because of the abandoned post-apocalyptic feel it has; but Katorga-12 has its own charm, you can think it as a second Chernobyl (if you played the Stalker series you'll know what I'm talking about). People who used to live there abandoned their normal lives for good, leaving papers on the tables, schools are full of children drawnings and kitchens are still filled with canned food and pots. It's a wonderful game, full of places to explore and learn about what happened in the island, and Singularity really rewards exploration, so please, don't rush while playing this game, take your time because you'll be rewarded with secrets that only the devs at Raven could have done so well. Most of the plot is explained by notes you find scattered around the buildings and audio logs. Some are well hidden, requiring even a bit of thinking before you can reach them, which I myself think it's just awesome. This is a feature that you'll find in Bioshock, but in Singularity I find it particularly better, because the voice acting is just perfect (at the beggining of the game you'll hear some audio logs made by the children themselves, trust me, it'll give you some chills). There is a couple more features that will bring Bioshock to mind, for instance the way you collect items in the game: you must interact with them pressing a key, only ammo you can actually pick up running above them; the health system isn't regenerative as in most shooters, you must collect aid packs to use later pressing another key, as with Bioshock. Singularity has kind of the same pace as Bioshock, that is having you searching the place for clues, secrets and items, then entering in some fire-fights. During the action scenes you can use a very well selected variety of weapons, and it doesn't limit itself with the everyday shotgun and machine gun: you have weapons that let you literaly guide the bullet, and even a grenade launcher that let you ""drive"" the grenade around the environment; even the usual sniper rifle has a feature that let you slow down time to aim well at your targets. Unlike in Bioshock, in Singularity you really feel the 'oomph' of the weapons, they aren't just pea shooters and the enemies aren't bullet sponges who just loves to break your immersion. I wouldn't call Singularity a shooter, because it has more to offer; but when you have to shoot somebody, it does well, with solid shooter mechanics, reload animations and weapon upgrades.The main feature of the game is presented by the Time Manipulating Device, or TMD, which works as a glove that you wear in your left hand. With it, you can solve puzzles buy aging and renewing some objects, like crates, stairs and machinery. As you progress within that game, you can upgrade it with new powers, just like you do with the plasmids found in Bioshock, but as I said, Singularity has its own charm, it only takes inspiration in Bioshock, although sometimes I felt as it was the other way around, because everything Singularity does, it does better than Bioshock. These new powers let you launch pulse explosions, create bubbles that stops time within it, age enemies until they're just a pile of dust and manipulate objects just like the Gravity Gun (again, Half-Life 2).Singularity has a total of three endings that conclude the narrative in three awesome and distinct ways, that you would finish in something like 8 hours or so. Sounds Everything in this game sounds good: the voice acting, gun shots, explosions, the russian lines spoken by some enemies, the soundtrack that changes accordingly... It's everything well done. Technically I saw some people saying it runs badly, but it is one of those games that was completely polished and well optimized; I could reach 120fps (it doesn't have fps limit as most games out there), and my PC is kind of mid range: i5 2400 3.10GHz, 8GB ram, Windows 7 64bits and a GTX650 1GB.So, if you are the kind of gamer who likes plot oriented games, with a good shooting mechanics and full of out of the ordinary places to explore, just like Half-Life and Bioshock, you definitely should give SIngularity a go. But don't expect a rip off, because this game was well done, it has all of the Raven style that old gamers love and it's really one of its kind.			",158,10,0,11,1,0,8

												I totally recommend this game. This is a great Raven Software game that didn't get the attention that it deserved. I think many people saw the trailers and saw the ADS features and thought they were going to get a Call of Duty type game. (nothing wrong with CoD however). This is more of an older style FPS with a fixed health bar. Without giving away spoilers, you get a device that allows you to control time to a certain extent. If I could give it a comparison, it's like a modern Hexen game without the huge levels with no handholding. The experience from start to finish is great. I wish it were a little bit longer, but this game is totes worth it.			",140,6,1,15,6,1,17

												Obviously has aspects from other games, most notably Bioshock, and doesn't look that great when compared to them. However, taken on its own it's a solid FPS with good controls, solid weapons and a decent enough storyline.Singularity isn't groundbreaking and now I've completed it I doubt I'll replay it any time soon. What it is is a fun FPS that is well worth playing through.Oddest thing for me is that many aspects of the game mirror Bioshock, which is a game I both love and loath. Singularity simply doesn't quite manage to pull off the atmosphere or the immersive world that Bioshock does, on the other hand I find the controls for Bioshock horribly clunky  while Singularity is beautifully smooth. In a year or so if I'm looking for an 'experience' I'll load up Bioshock... if I'm looking for a bit of FPS no-brain violence I may well choose Singularity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Singularity is a fantastic singleplayer FPS. In the tradition of all the B-tier shooters in the 90's this game, like Bioshock, takes solid shooting mechanics, wraps in a unique gameplay twist and presents an interesting setting for the game to unfold.The setting is an abandoned Russian facility that did experiments on a mysterious substance that affects time. That's the gameplay hook, you explore by dilating time and the age of objects around you. You can make enemies decay right in front of you. It's a fun experience.Unfortunate for the developer Raven, Activision sent this solid gem to die at retail with no advertising support and so the game was religated to obscurity. I'm sure the multiplayer is dead at this point but the singleplayer alone is worth the price of admission.			",293,65,4,36,11,3,39

												A fantastic shooter with great mechanics, story and satiesfying gunplay.In some way the story goes down the bioshock infite route, but is more interesting and you can have different endings as well. It is a much better shooter than Bioshock infinite though except the fact that the world of Bioshock is truly special. Singularity also goes down the horror and atmosphere route quite effectively.The graphics of this game on the other hand are really good despite its age, except that it can be a tad bit ""brown"" even though it suits the setting. It is a quality game with great detail and animation.The only big negative (which can be fixed quite easily) is that the FOV is truly awful and can't be changed in the game itself. I guess the game was developed with a consoles in mind. I would say it is actually unplayable unless you fix this. I installed ""flawless windescreen"", a free program who easily remedies the problem. There might be other ways as well. Really, don't play this game without the fix.A truly great game that for some reason seems to have gone a bit under the radar. One of the better shooters I have tried so far.Well reckommended.

												singularity while a strange story that chases itself is an overlooked FPS that draws from the cabinet of bioshock combining technology with weaponary to deliver a past time you wont be disapponted with.I would say this takes from a lot of games and does well doing them while you face off with both humans and E99 created monsters alike. The weapons on offer are fair although limited but your find the favourites get selected more than often, a credit to the accuracy of controller to VDU i think. You get a nifty bit of wrist tech that supplies an array of complimentary effects from time bubbles to forced ageing that when combined with weapons makes you an stoppable force.While hardly one of the greats, it still neatly presents itself as a good one, worthy of note.

												A solid FPS which doesn`t show too much its age for a 6 years old.  This game feels like a good combination of F.E.A.R , Bioshock, Half Life and Wolfenstein the New Order. A nice blend of sci-fi, uchronia and horror, packed in a shooter. The atmosphere is great and immersive. However it's not a challenging FPS because ammo is not scarce like it should be on a good old FPS.The few critics I'll make are about the FOV which is the narrow one of a console and get some time to get used to, and the mouse sensitivity which is far too high if you have a high DPI mouse.

I could say more but then they'd be spoilers. a double storyline *would* have been an excellent addtion to the game for a secoind playthrough but I guess they were on a budget, fair enough, but overall I can't recommend this enough.. it has all the elements that annoy me to near greifing about games.. like invisable walls, linier storytelling.. but it was worth it. peace.

It's a fun experience.Unfortunate for the developer Raven, Activision sent this solid gem to die at retail with no advertising support and so the game was religated to obscurity. I'm sure the multiplayer is dead at this point but the singleplayer alone is worth the price of admission.			",293,65,4,36,11,3,39

												I love these Russian post-apocolyptic games. About as good as the Metro 2033/2034 (Last Light) series. The difference is that there are 3 endings instead of 2 (in Metro). You can continue from the last save point and try all 3 ending scenerios in Singularity. I personally like the one where you choose to kill both. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The little brother of Half Life 2 - but with an ending. Like HL2 this is a most linear game but a really great and intense ride. The Story, the monsters, the weapons, the shooting is all so much fun. Though the AI is not the brightest and you cannot use your super powers even halfway as often as you want. The only actual gripe I have with this game is that it is way too short and you that you cannot return once you leave an area and quite often this isn't obvious when you do, so you most probably are going to miss some vital upgrade-points. But other than that this is a really great game!			",694,319,6,89,13,2,47

												The story was interesting and unique, despite the characters who you never really feel any attachment to.  A variety of weapons was nice to see, but the weapons system could've been better handeled--specifically the upgrades.  Rather than having upgrades to counter the weaknesses that the weapons all had, each weapon unfortunately all had the same upgrades of Clip Capacity (hold more ammo overall), Reload Speed, and Damage.  The system could've easily taken into account the charge factor for the railgun and decreased the amount of time that it took to charge, for instance, or it could've given the grenade launcher a higher range--different upgrades depending on the weapon, to overcome the respective weapon's weaknesses.  It was also nice to see a variety of enemies.The overall singleplayer campaign is roughly 10 hours long, but it is an interesting game, and I certainly recommend it if you can overlook its flaws.  I'd give it an 8/10, only because of the seemingly lazy implementation of weapons upgrades (as opposed to character upgrades), and that they could've fleshed out the characters a bit more and made you actually feel some sort of sentiment or attachment to said characters.  Also, the suicide-bombing swarm bug enemies (I think they were called Phase Ticks).  Seriously, screw those guys.			",208,43,0,26,4,1,11

												I have been a long time fan of Raven Software ever since discovering Jedi Knight 2 when I was a wee 9th grader. Last year's Wolfenstein was a bit tedious after you got into the meat of the game, yet was still quite entertaining to me. Starting Singularity, I was immediately captivated and interested in where the story was heading, invoking a cheesy albeit charming science-fiction-B-movie feel. The pacing is great and the game mechanics heavily remind me of a hybrid of Half-Life 2 and Bioshock. I was honestly taken aback by how much I liked this game, though the $50 pricetag is steep for a June 2010 release (I bought it in October for the full $60!). I say it was still worth it though, they deserve my money, they did quite well!			",330,75,3,39,19,3,44

												Okay. I am going to start this out by saying something: THIS IS A HORROR GAME.I personally picked it up because I enjoy games with interesting twists, like using time in combat. Nowhere said that this game is scarey. It ♥♥♥♥ing is.That said, lets review:THE GOOD:Time and combat work very well together, you can (once you get the right upgrades) slow/nearly stop time, blast people's legs, arms and heads off, age/reduce in age objects, people, and mutants, as well as shoot them up with a big♥♥♥♥♥shotgun, or whatever else you fancy.If the game is meant to do horror, it does it well (for me), with various jumpscares that are very nicely implimented (ie. scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you since you don't expect them), and the atmosphere is one of uncomfortable ruins.The shooting works. You shoot people, if you shoot them enough, they die. The guns sound quite weak, which is normal for modern shooters, but people react to some extent when shot (especially with the shotgun)Basic upgrade system for guns, with some customisation for your time powers, and various perks you can get.New mechanics are added constantly through the game, so you never feel like your game is stagnating.Although the game is completely linear in its story until the end (2 endings and a 'hidden' ending), there are plenty of areas to explore that can add 1-3 hours onto the game (its about 6 hours if you just follow the footsteps)THE BADThe plot is a little hard to follow at times, and there are some questions at the end I just want answering, and don't seem to be answered. I won't leave them here as they WILL spoil the game for you.The AI is a little off. People with guns will generally either stay where they are (which is typically in the middle of a corridor with no cover) or just run to their set position and start firing. Mutants just run towards you on the shortest trajectory.Not many bosses as such, only a couple of points where you meet more powerful mutants that are annoying to kill. To make up for that, you have a couple of timed RUN AWAY sequences. Yay.One of the time powers is really annoying to set off, as it involves pressing the button for another power twice quickly, which rarely works. I guess this is probably a legacy from consoles, where you have about 8 buttons for everything.The description on the store page isn't quite telling the truth. You do no 'travel seamlessly between 1955 and 2010'. The game pretty much orders you into a rift so you can go back in time, do something to alter the future, then go back into the present to carry on as normal. You don't get the choice of when you want to go back, you just have to.The UglyThe graphics are quickly aging, and not terribly gracefully.Those mutants are not going to win any beauty contests any time soon.Overall score: 74/100. If you like horror FPS games, pick it up, if not, then its probably for the best to leave it. I got it on sale and it was well worth the cost, even if it did leave me with a couple of nights when I regretted playing it in the evening.			",161,38,11,36,36,2,38

												Gratuitous Cyrillic is bad, mkay? It can be understandable if you put it in the title for style (though I still grimace at that), but you really shouldn't put it all throughout your game, to the point where you objectives are, ""Fiиd Katheяiи aиd escape."" Every time, through the entire game. It gets old really, really fast.Now that that little grievance is out of the way, Singularity is fun. It's an interesting tale of the Butterfly Effect and the instability of time travel. The story itself isn't exactly groundbreaking, and some of the narration-particularly the end sequence, which talks for a minute or so and just sort of ends-is poor, but it gets the job done. You're an American military spec ops dude who goes to a Russian island for something they never really specify, and find the island was an old Soviet research facility for an element called E-99 that has time changing properties.♥♥♥♥♥♥goes wrong real quick and you're sucked into the past, where you change history by accident, and come back to find a world run by a brutal dictator who was formerly one of the researchers on the island, which is now overrun by strange abhuman beasts. Now you gotta fix it. There's a sort of twist at the end, too, and while I didn't really see it coming it wasn't exactly M. Night Shyamalan levels of ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥"" Still not a bad story by any means, but you really aren't playing Singularity for a riveting tale.What you're playing for is the action. In a similar setup to Bioshock's plasmids, you acquire the TMD (Time Manipulation Device), which allows you to age/de-age objects and people as well as do some other neat♥♥♥♥♥♥ like telekinesis. There's really nothing quite like snatching an enemy RPG out of the air and throwing it back at him. You also have guns. You're honestly going to use the guns a lot more, but the TMD is very useful in interacting with the environment. There's a particular puzzle involving age-crushing a box that the developers really, really, really like. The TMD can one-shot human enemies, instantly aging them to mummies, and has various other effects on the time warped monsters throughout. It takes a lot of energy to do those, though, and while you're constantly swimming in ammo for both your guns and TMD, having to reload after every 2 agings when there's a billion dudes around kinda puts a damper on the useability. So you'll be using your guns a lot, which you can find ""weapon tech"" to upgrade and get larger magazines, faster reloading, and higher damage. This is where the game makes its biggest mistake. It gives you the Autocannon. It's basically a minigun, and you get it maybe halfway through the game. This isn't a mistake in that it's a bad thing-in fact, quite the opposite. The autocannon is so good I almost only ever used it after getting it. For about half the entire game. It's useful against any enemy, it's high damage, high rate of fire, and the ammo is plenty. Towards the end of the game, **Mild Spoilers** you even get a TMD upgrade that eliminates the use of energy, allowing unlimited use of the TMD's aging attacks against the Russian hordes **/end spoilers** I still used the autocannon anyway. It's just that good, and you feel like a Terminator implacably advancing towards the enemy and cutting them down in a hail of gunfire. Especially with damage reduction and max health upgrades, you feel unstoppable.  There's also the Seeker, an E-99 powered gun that lets you control the bullet mid-flight and is probably the coolest gun in any video game ever. Sadly, you don't get to keep it since switching weapons drops it and the ammo only appears in select areas, but it's always fun while it lasts.Singularity is a good game. The story is feasible enought to provide a backdrop for the action, the gameplay is solid, and autocannon autocannon autocannon. Would recommend.			",62,14,0,5,5,0,9

												As far as I can tell, even though the story is linear up until the end it's decent enough.  I enjoyed my time in the game and beat it in one sitting.  I found that more levels are linear and any 'secret' or 'side' parts to them simply contain some more ammo/health/tech points.  By the end I'd narrowed my style down to the auto-gun and the sniper rifle with liberal use of the deadlock zones.  What the sniper rifle can't kill in one hit, a burst from the auto-gun in a deadlock zone usually will.If you're looking for a solid single player FPS that has an interesting storyline to it and some interesting mechanics, go ahead and give this a try.  I did not encounter any bugs what so ever during my play through, but that doesn't happen for everyone.			",164,32,0,75,24,1,59

I'd recommend this game to anyone that wants a good 14 hour campaign filled with time travel, Explosions, wierd creatures, Odd Guns.			",83,2,2,3,5,1,4

Good points:Intriguing storycool enemies, weapons and powers.good pacingLooks really good to this dayGood audio qualityBad points:Game feels very rushed at the endWeapon upgrade system is just badNo real explanation of what upgrades doNo subtitlesvery unbalanced difficulty levelstory has many loopholes and leaves you with so many questionsStoryThe story has a lot of potential in this game, and I'd say they pull of the story about halfway into the game. After that a lot of things start to happen kinda without explanation. So I strongly feel that this game was rushed at the end and that the game kinda suffered for it, this is something I will come back to several times in this review. CharactersYou yourself is much like a Gordon Freeman, voiceless and even faceless in this game. I honestly think this is a bit of a shame, they could have made the story more intriguing and interesting if they character you were playing had feelings and thoughts on the situation. The other characters are pretty standard. There's the good guy, bad guy and the cute girl, these are the three NPC characters you interact with pretty much. They're not well written and you don't care about them but they do their part. Perhaps if the game wasn't rushed this wouldn't have happened.enemies, weapons and powersThe enemy design is really cool in this game, the monsters are scary, gross and challenging to kill. They do lack a bit of variety so you won't see to many different kind of enemies. But the game isn't super long so it's okay. In between fighting monsters you will be shooting at Russians, they are standard NPC's with guns, not much to discuss there. The weapons in this game feel great, look great feel very balanced. The problem I have with them is that there are like 6-7 weapons in total at the end of the game, and I only touched the first three because the others were just introduced to damn late and you have already spent so much upgrade points on the early weapons that it doesn't feel worth it switching to the new ones, this might be a side effect of the game being rushed as well. The weapon upgrade system leaves a lot to wish for, each weapons needs 9 points to be fully upgraded. I'm not even sure if I find a total of 20 upgrade points through the whole game. The powers are probably what carries this game, You have a device on your arm with lets you age specific objects in the world, stop time in an area, levitate and throw objects (kinda like HL2 gravity gun). It's just a ton of fun and the effects look fantastic. They come up with some interesting puzzles with it as well.Difficulty and upgradesMuch like most games this game lets you choose between easy, medium and hard difficulty. I tried normal on my first play-through and I honestly don't think I died a single time. I'm now playing it again on hard and I still have a very easy time. I can play through some parts without any problem and then die seven times in a row in the next area, so the difficulty level feels a bit unbalanced. You can also purchase upgrades for you character and your ""gravity gun"" in this game, which I think is really fun, The bad part is that you have to find the blueprint for the upgrade in the world and they're sometimes a bit hidden. Meaning that you could potentially miss out on some essential upgrades for you character simply because you didn't look around the room enough. They also don't give you enough points here to upgrade everything but that's fine, it makes you have to choose what to prioritize and what you feel is more important to you. ConclusionThis review might have sound really negative overall but don't get me wrong, I genuinely enjoyed this game a lot and would recommend it to anyone. If you play this game you won't get mad or irritated at all the bad traits I've pointed out, rather you will acknowledge them and perhaps, like me, realize that this game with a bit more time and polishing could easily have been a 10/10.

												I remember first reading about this game in an issue of Game Informer.  This was roughly 5 or 6 years ago.  To this day, this game is one of the most fun FPS games I've played in a while.  Interacting with your environment by manipulating time was an awesome concept, and it's executed extremely well in Singularity.  That, coupled with your very Bioshock-like grab-bag of powers like pseudo Telekinesis and the ability to slow down time in a certain radius and it makes for very refreshing gameplay.Also, I can honestly say that I haven't had as much fun playing a weapon any game as I have playing with the Seeker.  Seriously, that weapon is some fun♥♥♥♥♥♥			",106,8,0,12,10,0,9

												This game held my attention far better than most of the newer games I have bought on Steam.  It is the traditional game-on-a-rail type of play, but it has a great story that keeps you wanting to find more notes and get more information.  It reminds me of a combination of Fear, Metro 2033, and Bioshock 1.  Prior to finding the TDM the game play was more engaging.  The TDM just makes it too easy to kill but it does present more interesting puzzles late in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probabaly one of the best Stories I have ever played, well it falls a step behind Half Life 2, but it's hard to bear that.  The way the story unfolds keeps you guessing to what will actually happen at the end of the game.  The ending itself (not going to spoil it) is a shocker none the less.  I'd recommend this game to anyone that wants a good 14 hour campaign filled with time travel, Explosions, wierd creatures, Odd Guns.			",83,2,2,3,5,1,4

Good points:Intriguing storycool enemies, weapons and powers.good pacingLooks really good to this dayGood audio qualityBad points:Game feels very rushed at the endWeapon upgrade system is just badNo real explanation of what upgrades doNo subtitlesvery unbalanced difficulty levelstory has many loopholes and leaves you with so many questionsStoryThe story has a lot of potential in this game, and I'd say they pull of the story about halfway into the game. After that a lot of things start to happen kinda without explanation. So I strongly feel that this game was rushed at the end and that the game kinda suffered for it, this is something I will come back to several times in this review. CharactersYou yourself is much like a Gordon Freeman, voiceless and even faceless in this game. I honestly think this is a bit of a shame, they could have made the story more intriguing and interesting if they character you were playing had feelings and thoughts on the situation. The other characters are pretty standard. There's the good guy, bad guy and the cute girl, these are the three NPC characters you interact with pretty much. They're not well written and you don't care about them but they do their part. Perhaps if the game wasn't rushed this wouldn't have happened.enemies, weapons and powersThe enemy design is really cool in this game, the monsters are scary, gross and challenging to kill. They do lack a bit of variety so you won't see to many different kind of enemies. But the game isn't super long so it's okay. In between fighting monsters you will be shooting at Russians, they are standard NPC's with guns, not much to discuss there. The weapons in this game feel great, look great feel very balanced. The problem I have with them is that there are like 6-7 weapons in total at the end of the game, and I only touched the first three because the others were just introduced to damn late and you have already spent so much upgrade points on the early weapons that it doesn't feel worth it switching to the new ones, this might be a side effect of the game being rushed as well. The weapon upgrade system leaves a lot to wish for, each weapons needs 9 points to be fully upgraded. I'm not even sure if I find a total of 20 upgrade points through the whole game. The powers are probably what carries this game, You have a device on your arm with lets you age specific objects in the world, stop time in an area, levitate and throw objects (kinda like HL2 gravity gun). It's just a ton of fun and the effects look fantastic. They come up with some interesting puzzles with it as well.Difficulty and upgradesMuch like most games this game lets you choose between easy, medium and hard difficulty. I tried normal on my first play-through and I honestly don't think I died a single time. I'm now playing it again on hard and I still have a very easy time. I can play through some parts without any problem and then die seven times in a row in the next area, so the difficulty level feels a bit unbalanced. You can also purchase upgrades for you character and your ""gravity gun"" in this game, which I think is really fun, The bad part is that you have to find the blueprint for the upgrade in the world and they're sometimes a bit hidden. Meaning that you could potentially miss out on some essential upgrades for you character simply because you didn't look around the room enough. They also don't give you enough points here to upgrade everything but that's fine, it makes you have to choose what to prioritize and what you feel is more important to you. ConclusionThis review might have sound really negative overall but don't get me wrong, I genuinely enjoyed this game a lot and would recommend it to anyone. If you play this game you won't get mad or irritated at all the bad traits I've pointed out, rather you will acknowledge them and perhaps, like me, realize that this game with a bit more time and polishing could easily have been a 10/10.

												I remember first reading about this game in an issue of Game Informer.  This was roughly 5 or 6 years ago.  To this day, this game is one of the most fun FPS games I've played in a while.  Interacting with your environment by manipulating time was an awesome concept, and it's executed extremely well in Singularity.  That, coupled with your very Bioshock-like grab-bag of powers like pseudo Telekinesis and the ability to slow down time in a certain radius and it makes for very refreshing gameplay.Also, I can honestly say that I haven't had as much fun playing a weapon any game as I have playing with the Seeker.  Seriously, that weapon is some fun♥♥♥♥♥♥			",106,8,0,12,10,0,9

Quite short single player campaign, but that's not really in the mind when you finish the game ...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can upgrade these weapons as you progress throughout the game. Comes with a compelling story line with different endings based on your choices.

												Im going to start off saying my favorite type of games ever are sifi/doomsday/apocalayptic genres. When I bought this game I thought I was just gonna get a game similar to RAGE, a fun FPS with a decent story and plot. However, I got much more than that with singularity. I found myself on the edge of my chair enjoying a great narrative about time travel and how you can re-write the past to change the future. Dont worry about this game aging poorly either cause I played all of it recently in 2015, and still found this game more than acceptable (coming from a guy who loves graphics a lot). So heres a listPros-Great Narrative-Interesting Gameplay mechanics with a device found in-game-Aged very well (basically meaning it doesnt fell old)-Cool Guns-Awesome Level Design and Themes-RPG level up elements with currency (level up guns, stats, and your TMD)Note that gunplay is average, but I believed designed that way due to the fact that once you start getting upgrades, you become the grim reaper destroying everything in your path, feels like Wolfienstien gunplay. 9/10 Would Travel in Time Again			",175,18,11,16,16,0,13

												When this game was released i thought nothing of it mostly because it came out when the plague of sub par fps games started. I only decided to try this game once i  saw it on a top 10 hidden gems countdown. I did enjoy my time with the game but i do have a few problems with it that may ruin the game for some people. For starters the game is a measly 5 hours long with little replay value. Yes the game dose have multiple endings but the game saves your progress right before your chose what ending you will get. My next problem is the difficulty. The game in my opinion was way to easy. The tmd made combat interesting but it also made you unstoppable. And the amount of medkits you get are insane. there were many times where i would pass up on 5 in one room because i was maxed out. I only died once and stood there and let 5 monsters chomp on me while i spun around. The few bosses that are there honestly just feel like normal enemies with giant ♥♥♥♥ me blisters on them. The only thing that stuck out in my mind was the weapon selection. you have your basics like a revolver, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. But then you start getting guns like the spikeshot that is a railgun with a delay or a grenade launcher that has grenades that you can move on your own. However you are limited to two guns that you can carry except for super weapons. I went through most of the game with the assault rife as my primary for most of the game. and if the is a situation where you can use a gun to its fullest there is convinently a dead body with on laying right in front of you. The super weapons bring the most flavor to the table. The seeker fires an explosive round that you can control in a cool bullet time scene. And then there is a rocket launcher. Ok they may have run out of ideas at that point. The game is fun however and if you looking to kill some time (no pun intended) i recommend picking this game up only on a sale though.

												Ever wanted to change the course of history? Now might be your chance! Singularity is an exciting, high-paced strategic first person shooter. The atmosphere and general ambiance of this game are fantastic and eerie, creating a great environment for a gamer to feel right on edge. Allow a multitude of bizarre mutants to try and slash your face open, all the while penetrating deeper into the story presented within the game. Unveil layer upon layer of magnicifent insanity until you are at last presented with an important choice that will alter history as we know it, forever.In short: a great game, A++ graphics, SUPERB storyline and well, stop reading!

It's storyline flows at a great pace, featuring enough fights to keep it interesting while not making it a run-and-gun game, as well as great variation with enemies.If you prefer your FPSs to have a great story and/or you love all things time-travel, I would most highly recommend this fantastic game!

												An interesting experience akin to Prey, Timeshift, Dead Space and BioShock. Although the acting and storyline leave much to be desired the concept of time manipulation is always enjoyable in first person shooters, especially if you add some puzzles much like the Portal series to them.

												This game is so amazing, it is truly a ""hidden gem"". I can't believe it didn't get more recognition.Being a Cold-War and time travel fan, the game makes a really creative story with elemental power and flash backs. The environment is extremely detailed and I guarantee you'll♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants multiple times from the mutants. The game itself is more of a playable movie really, with cinematic scenes and battles.For a sale of $7 right now, its a steal. Highly recommend this if you're into first person shooters with an in-depth campaign, gameplay and story wise, by far one of the best campaigns I've ever played, up there with Bioshock.Keep in mind though that there are very few players to play with online in multiplayer, but check out the forums to coordinate with other people to play together!

												So Sure it pulls from almost every great FPS in the last 5 years, but it does it well. Time maniplation, pulling itemsin and out of one state. time bubbles that act as a shield, and a host of the standard guns. it has the feel of Prey, meets half life 2, but is  in between both of those. I did find it to be rather easy on Hard with the Gatling Gun and the accuracy Perk, and a Fully upgraded TMD. And the Few quibbles I had about the apparent Console port I got used to, except the lack of keybinding. It is apretty good SP experience.7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game has multiple plot holes which can easily be explained away by the fact that time travel in this game is dependent on the element E-99. If a subject (living or not) does not have any amount of E-99, then time changes upon said subject is nil.Now, depending on the amount of E-99 in a subject (we are talking particles here), then the more ""powerful"" the time changes is on the subject.That's a big premise to the game. You just can age or make new every and any thing in the game. Graphics are fine. Weapons are nice. You can upgrade your weapons, your time manipulation device, and Renko, which you play as.Story is...meh. Multiple endings. Missing one in my opinion.			",137,46,0,15,23,0,19

												Im going to start off saying my favorite type of games ever are sifi/doomsday/apocalayptic genres. When I bought this game I thought I was just gonna get a game similar to RAGE, a fun FPS with a decent story and plot. However, I got much more than that with singularity. I found myself on the edge of my chair enjoying a great narrative about time travel and how you can re-write the past to change the future. Dont worry about this game aging poorly either cause I played all of it recently in 2015, and still found this game more than acceptable (coming from a guy who loves graphics a lot). So heres a listPros-Great Narrative-Interesting Gameplay mechanics with a device found in-game-Aged very well (basically meaning it doesnt fell old)-Cool Guns-Awesome Level Design and Themes-RPG level up elements with currency (level up guns, stats, and your TMD)Note that gunplay is average, but I believed designed that way due to the fact that once you start getting upgrades, you become the grim reaper destroying everything in your path, feels like Wolfienstien gunplay. 9/10 Would Travel in Time Again			",175,18,11,16,16,0,13

Singularity is also really damn pretty to look at and the aesthetics and the over all look of it ooze with a good amount of creativity. It's good for a shooter.			",284,82,0,11,7,0,11

Fantastic storyline, with great twists that mess with your head. The game is constant action, with tons of opprotunities to switch weapons, and upgrade your abilities and guns. The time reversion and advancement make this game very unique for an FPS and open lots of strategies for some of the harder opponents. A must buy for any FPS fan.			",104,7,1,5,0,2,0

												Singularity is an odd game. It has some gameplay and puzzle elements similar to half-life 2, and the story reminds me of bioshock. Someone just feeling their way through a destroyed world getting a little taste here and there of what all went wrong to create such a catastrophe. The gameplay is good, the guns are fun, and the story is a bit of a mind %#@!.  If you like stories like that, and you aren't afraid of a few horror elements, I highly recommend you try singularity. Unfortunately, steam rarely if ever puts this on sale. I recommend watching Amazon.com. Through them I picked up the game for 7$ instead of the 20$ it usually hits during steam sales. ~PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

The story is adequate though a little predictable, but this gem shines through most with its gunplay/gameplay.  Animations are spot on, and all the enemies excel at entertaining you with the way they interact with your bullets. Weapons are diverse and satisfying, and the time bending abilities you gain make a big impact in your combat strategies. This is a highly underrated game.			",323,46,3,29,12,2,21

												Wow, Singularity was actually pretty good. The game was released around the same time as Timeshift, both dealing somewhat with using time-changing combat abilities. But hands down, Singularity was a much better game. PLOT - above averageLet's be fair, for the most part of the game, you have no idea why you're running around killing people and charging up some bomb. The basic premise is your character, Renko, saved a dictator in the past, and now the present is under totalitarian control. So now you try to go back and right that wrong. Very linear story, BUT you are presented with 3 possible ending cutscenes, depending on who you shoot at the end. GAMEPLAY - very goodYou have a choice between some very generic guns (assault rifle, shotgun, pistol), but also some very interesting weapons. Here are my favorite:1. Sniper Rifle - has a limited ability to slow down time to let you line up the shot. 2. Seeker Rifle - special weapon with limit supplies that lets you control the path of a sniper bullet. 3. Autocannon - combined with the time-stopping Deadlock, this is hilarously over-powered. I stuck with autocannon and sniper rifle for the majority of the gameplay. The Time-Manipulation Device itself doesn't have very many abilities. I think Deadlock is what everyone uses, just to freeze all the enemies in its bubble. Impulse sends a short-range shockwave, and is very satisfying when enemies get up close to you, and you either blow them away or apart. VISUALLY - nauseatingIt's an old game. Everything looks beige in color, and texture resolutions are very low. The geometry also makes you feel a little sick. SOUND - lackingThere is absolutely no music, just creepy ambient sounds. There's no music even for the title screen! The only music is in the CCCP propaganda films! Gunfire sounds average at most. The voice acting is also mediocre. You don't get attached to anybody. OVERALL - more enjoyable than I thought. A little on the long side, to be honest. Rating: 7/10			",113,17,4,8,4,0,9

												At the beginning I though, ""Wow! this game looks like it will be really cool!"" But then after some timeline splitting, story stopped to make sense, and things were not the same. I understand paradoxes are difficult to handle. But they should've at least tried to make them less noticeable. The gameplay itself is ok, some interesting mechanics, mildly interesting characters and one or two good weapons. The premise of the game is completely awesome, at least for me, as I like time travel stuff. However narrative errors and little regard for how timelines work(As old Doc Brown told us XD) lowered my hopes. Anyway I'd still recommend the game on sale, as it looks really cool (I took a lot of screenshots, everywhere) and got some nice and/or spooky moments. But don't expect too much, remember it's average.			",207,32,10,12,7,1,15

												The plot is as follows: You're a marine sent to investigate a deserted island when suddenly, you find yourself caught in a blast that sends you to an alternate reality. Now you must fight to restore the natural order.Prior to my purchase, I had no idea this game was under the horror genre. While it is occasionally scary, my biggest gripe is that Singularity mostly pulls of ""cheap"" scares, pumping loud and abrupt music in the face of danger.Singularity's gimmick is its time warping tool. With it, you can restore certain items to its prestine condition or decay it (amusing when used on enemies). You're given a few puzzles to solve and while at first it may seem fun, the gimmick quickly wears thin. The problem is that much of the game mechanic's potential stays untapped. There are about two different puzzles that are recycled throughout. So much could have been done to make this a thinking man's game, but alas, I can only brand Singularity as another generic shooter.Grade: B			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												this is an fps. this is similar to an MMS, but it isnt quite one. the tdm aspect works, and the few weapons and weapon abilities that are unique to this game make it different enough to be above average. the story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but it does the job. overall, its ok, worth a play, and has some replayability by using a different guns, but its not much. buy it on sale if you can.

												An FPS with a great singleplayer campaign.  It combines relatively common FPS guns with very interesting powers, such as the ability to freeze a group of enemies in time, create a shield that slows bullets, or turn enemies into monsters you can use to fight for you.  Probably not work the current $29.99 asking price, but if you can get it on sale around $10, it is well worth it.Have played the single player campaign twice, once on Xbox 360, once on PC.  PC playtime is listed as 6.7 hours for one campaign run on Normal.  Multiplayer was never touched.			",262,158,2,63,21,1,44

It's also nice to see weapons other than your basic rifle, handgun, and shotgun.  The story is actually quite good but you have to look out for it and pay attention.

												Ever wanted to change the course of history? Now might be your chance! Singularity is an exciting, high-paced strategic first person shooter. The atmosphere and general ambiance of this game are fantastic and eerie, creating a great environment for a gamer to feel right on edge. Allow a multitude of bizarre mutants to try and slash your face open, all the while penetrating deeper into the story presented within the game. Unveil layer upon layer of magnicifent insanity until you are at last presented with an important choice that will alter history as we know it, forever.In short: a great game, A++ graphics, SUPERB storyline and well, stop reading!

												A fun FPS with good but not quite top-tier graphics, solid controls, and an interesting story. There are several additions to the standard single-player FPS abilities that are fun, and everything in general is well implemented.My only real gripe is the limited replay value. The story is only about 8 hours long, and the ending is entirely determined by your final choice (which is right after the last autosave point), so there's not much motivation to play through the whole game again.Definitely worth buying, but wait for it to go on sale.

												A stripped down version of Bioshock, the game mechanics for using the time manipulation device to fight enemies and solve puzzles was actually quite fun. The story took a bit of a header near the end, and wasn't as dramatic or thematic as Bioshock, but in the realm of single player campaigns in shooters, this is one that actually merits the price of admission.

												Much better than I expected. The atmosphere and environment of the game really draw you in and the story has its moments of greatness. Some pretty unique enemies and powers are a selling point for gameplay as well. Some negatives would be that the player can get temporarily stuck on some objects and the first time it really became annoying was in a gameplay sequences where I had to run away, of all things. Another drawback is that some weapons seem to not phase enemies in regards to their approach/actions whereas others do. All in all, I bougth the game for like 10$ awhile back and it's worth that price now even if I never come back and play it again (which I plan to).			",922,273,29,162,111,10,171

												From the get go it is obvious this is a straight up console port. The game doesn't support proper widescreen video resolutions and comes with some serious sound issues. When you get to actually playing the game you'll find the weapon selection lackluster, with a few exceptions. The upgrade functionality feels tacked on and many of the enemies are more annonyances than anything else. The time manipulation mechanic is okay, but I feel they could have done more with it. Multiplayer is a crapshoot and dead.Even so, Singularity does have some redeeming qualities. The story is a real head spinner with 3 seperate endings; although which one you get has nothing to do with your actions throughout the game and instead comes down to one decision at the very end of the game. The plot will have you guessing to the end, and then some. Some of the set peices throughout the story are really amazing, and the boss fights stand out as high points. Overall, I'd give it 5/10. Wait for an under 10$ sale			",193,10,2,9,7,0,15

												Yes, I'm writing to get a piece of coal.  But no matter, this game deserves more love.  You're a soldier sent to investigate an abandoned research station off the coast of Kamchatka.  Wouldn't you know it, you crash and the place is not as abandoned as it looks; in fact it's full of things that want to kill you.There's three  very neat things about this game: 1) the art direction, a wacky combination of Soviet propaganda art plus steampunk; 2) the superpowers you get, which all have to do with time; my favorite is the sniper rifle with bullets you ride; 3) the various endings, all seemingly designed to mess wtih your mind.It's something like Half-Life 2, in fact-- mostly shooting, a few physics puzzles, some cool toys to play with.   I think they could have done a little more with the time mechanics, but it's still a fun ride.			",95,30,0,13,10,0,3

The over-the-top abilities the Time Manipulation Device (TMD) are always entertaining, and umerous enough to always give you a few options in the heat of combat. Also, enemy types are numerous and unique, so you'll never feel bored. The story is entertaining in a way that will please Sci-Fi lovers with its great use of cliches, but is also just deep enough to keep you thinking. It's no Bioshock, but it's extremely underrated.

												Now this is a nice suprise a bargain on steam at the time I got this game. I read a lot about this game. Like there is a huge budget for this game and there were worries that it wouldn't sell that well. The storyThe game is about a secret Soviet weapon that has been fueled by an element called E99. That can be used to temper with time on a very local scale. It is travelling foreward and backwards in time that eventually clears the reasons and causes of all the troubles and combat you are in. There are some good suprises in the story and some very good ""shock and awe"" moments. I really enjoyed it all I must admit. I couldn't really stop playing till the end of the story and thus the game. The theme ""time travel"" always fascinated me from the time I saw the movie and read the book Time Machine by Orson Wells. So that of time travel is a very big plus or pro for me. Way of tellingThe story telling is being done with ocassional cutscenes that reminded me of Call Of Duty in a way. You start out with a search of a secret Soviet base on an remote island close to the Russian border. You search the base or island I must say for clues what happened in the past and why there such strange mutated creatures roaming around the island? This gave me the feeling of the game Stalker where a nuclear accident also created strange mutations among the wildlife or even to the human inhabitants. Ocassionally you see ghosts from the past acting out scenes of mayhem that happened years ago. Those scenes reminded me of the game FEAR somehow. Where you also had flashbacks via ghostly like scenes. That sented chills down my spine. Film and sound footageThe story is good and even backed up with some very amusing films and sound footage that have been scattered around the base. Those recordings you can listen to or even see in film projectors still functioning at the base. Most of the time the have that eerie looking sound or damaged footage of aging of some other violent event. Graphics and soundsThe graphics are superb and the sounds are very well done. Although the story is very amusing to say the least. It also makes the maps a little linear in a way. There is no free roaming around the maps like you can with so many roleplaying games. But do not let that spoil the fun. There are still plenty of places to search for loot like ammo and the E99 fuel metals. You have to find certain characters in the game. Get this tool or this element find it take it somewhere and all backed up by a more or less logical story line. Do I recommend it? Oh yes you should try this game if you like the elements of timetravel and some scary horror moments in a game. A game for mature playersSo I must add this game is for the mature players that like some gory scenes from time to time. There are a lot of dead corpses  some even impaled (like in games like Doom) and bloodbaths. When you shoot enemies they lose limps and other body parts by the impact of the bullets. There is even an time weapon where you can ""age"" people very fast. A very good game & get it if you canSo be warned or informed what ever you like. This is a good well done game. You can see there has been put a lot of effort in this game. So I do recommend this game. Go for it if you like the things mentioned above.			",234,2,7,4,27,0,42

												Let me preface this review by saying I waited 4 years to play this game. I liked the look of it when it released in 2010 but could never bring myself to buy it at full price. I picked it up on sale from Steam for about $8 and for that price is it probably worth it.The Singularity isn't a bad game in any way but it relies to much on being derivative of it's peers and often makes the classic modern FPS mistake of using a brown color pallet and heavy industrial level design.The shooting itself is good if not great, the enemies are varied (shades of Doom, Wolfenstein, Half Life and even COD can be seen here) and weapons and your TMD (read Half life 2 gravity gun mix with some other stuff) can be upgraded. Towards the end of the game you can do some really neat things with your TMD/weapon combos that keep combat fun and lively.The story is a little convoluted and the characters are muddy. Much like the TMD rips off Half Life 2's gravity gun in some respects so the cast here are retreads of the characters in the older game. The female lead is a poor man's Alyx Vance but does a serviceable job guiding you through the story. I just had a hard time connecting with the characters, although I will say the multiple endings to the game is a nice touch!The TMD does also allow for some minor puzzle elements that can initially seem taxing but once you have seen one of about the 3 or 4 puzzles that are used through the game you can quickly identify and solve them. In the end what strikes you as an “oh wow nice touch” trick the first time ends up feeling played about by the 25th.This leads me onto my biggest gripe with the game: the level design. The Singularity has some amazing potential and wastes it utterly with brown industrial environ after brown industrial environ. The levels set in the past are, varied, bright, colorful and full of unique little touches that made me want to explore this cold war era lab (it really reminded me of half life 1, a living breathing facility I wanted to inhabit not just visit). It is a crying shame that you never visit them for more than 10 minutes at a time. These levels are also filled with Russian soliders that act half way intelligently and are fun to fight. The modern levels by contrast are by the numbers brown boxes that remind me of quake 1 or painkiller with less character. The enemies that inhabit them are varied and some are fun to fight but too many simply charge at you. Once you acquire some decent weapons and TMD upgrades they become a chore to fight.The split between old and modern sums up the Singularity well for every good moment there is something dull and bland. A unique feature or moment here is followed by a dull 30 minute sepia section shortly after. If only Raven had stuck to using the 50's setting throughout the game we may have had a truly unique and classic game on our hands. It's still a decent shooter and well worth a blast through if you can get it for under $10 but I came away feeling happy I played it but sad that it wasn't as good as it could have been.7/10 ",280,32,2,25,26,0,48

												Like most other reviews here, I can only say that this is one of the most underrated shooters in recent years.  The plot, whilst slightly underwhelming towards the end, is well thought out and easily better than most shooters.  The gameplay itself is brilliant, with weapons that feel interesting to use, and solid mechanics.  The time mechanic is used to create some interesting puzzles.All in all, this is one of best purcahses I've made this year!			",202,89,2,70,19,1,40

												A lot of people say it's like Bioshock. Let me be clear, it's not as good as Bioshock, not nearly. Not in gameplay, story, graphics, nor anything. OK, perhaps combat mechanics; that's pretty good. So, it's not Bioshock. BUT, it's still worth the money. Others say it's overlooked and underrated, but I think it gets just the attention it deserves. Something about it doesn't feel like an instant classic like Bioshock is (among many others). Still, a good few hours of great fun for (let's be honest) a small price (especially when it's on sale). I can't complain.			",103,5,2,3,2,0,6

												Obviously has aspects from other games, most notably Bioshock, and doesn't look that great when compared to them. However, taken on its own it's a solid FPS with good controls, solid weapons and a decent enough storyline.Singularity isn't groundbreaking and now I've completed it I doubt I'll replay it any time soon. What it is is a fun FPS that is well worth playing through.Oddest thing for me is that many aspects of the game mirror Bioshock, which is a game I both love and loath. Singularity simply doesn't quite manage to pull off the atmosphere or the immersive world that Bioshock does, on the other hand I find the controls for Bioshock horribly clunky  while Singularity is beautifully smooth. In a year or so if I'm looking for an 'experience' I'll load up Bioshock... if I'm looking for a bit of FPS no-brain violence I may well choose Singularity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Join one AMERICAN man on his quest to become a time wizard who can cause death through willpower alone! It's Russian Call of Duty-Shock! Very linear, story that completely falls apart, but damn fun. Singularity would've been much better if it didn't take itself as seriously.Your character is completely throw away, half of the other leads hardly do anything, and level design is hamfisted and forced. You get amazing guns, but you can't carry around the most original one (allows you to curve bullets in slow-mo). Nice items are placed in action sequence areas, forcing you to stop combat to collect them.And yet the combat is gleeful. Every gun is ridiculously strong, but enemies still swarm well enough to make hard mode challenging. The sniper rifle one-shots everything no matter where you hit and lets you slow time. Controllable rolley-polley grenade launcher. Stasis bubble lets you shoot 3 guys in the head, and watch them all tumble to the floor simultaneously. A fun romp.			",262,67,2,28,19,0,34

												I love time travel stories - and this delivers!*minor spoilers*Yes, it is very linear. Yes, the story is not *that* original. And yes, in normal difficulty the game throws medipacks and ammo at you continously so that you never need to worry. There are some easy-to-solve switch puzzles that make for rather quiet situations, followed by explosive killfests with mangled bodies flying around. The weapons are awesome, especially the ""experimental"" stuff like the steerable bullet that make your targets explode in a fountain of flesh and blood. Very satisfying :)Although the story isn't outstanding, it is brilliantly told! Scripted events, explosions, dialogues, story twists... the Half Life-Formula is working great. The level design is good enough to let you dive into the world - which is disturbed by invisible walls you often walk into. Overall I was entertained from start to end - and that is what I want when I play a science fiction FPS ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros- gameplay is satisfying and relatively fast paced. Story is… well shooter story material, interesting but nothing to write home about. The suspense at the beginning of the game is well done. Time manipulation is interesting yet straightforward. Cons- suspense cuts out very quickly after the enemies change, but combat picks up a bit. Time “puzzles” are very simple. Maybe worth a two playthroughs.  ",130,10,2,16,14,0,13

												I awaited a bit long for a sale before buying this game; I must say that I shouldn't have awaited so long and just bought it at full price, because it worth it.Around the internet you'll see some people comparing Singularity to Half-Life 2 and Bioshock, so I'll compare too, but I'll show what points those games has in common with Singularity, so you can form your own opinion. Story You play as captain Nathaniel Renko, who comes to a misterious island called Katorga-12 after the military has received some signs of radiation while its radar was passing by the Eastern Russia; when you arrive at the island, it is a desolate place, abandoned long ago for unknown reasons, while some kind of military reasearch has gone completely wrong when the russians discovered a new element called E-99. Gameplay Some people say that this desolated island has some resemblance with Bioshock's rapture or even Half-Life 2's City 17, because of the abandoned post-apocalyptic feel it has; but Katorga-12 has its own charm, you can think it as a second Chernobyl (if you played the Stalker series you'll know what I'm talking about). People who used to live there abandoned their normal lives for good, leaving papers on the tables, schools are full of children drawnings and kitchens are still filled with canned food and pots. It's a wonderful game, full of places to explore and learn about what happened in the island, and Singularity really rewards exploration, so please, don't rush while playing this game, take your time because you'll be rewarded with secrets that only the devs at Raven could have done so well. Most of the plot is explained by notes you find scattered around the buildings and audio logs. Some are well hidden, requiring even a bit of thinking before you can reach them, which I myself think it's just awesome. This is a feature that you'll find in Bioshock, but in Singularity I find it particularly better, because the voice acting is just perfect (at the beggining of the game you'll hear some audio logs made by the children themselves, trust me, it'll give you some chills). There is a couple more features that will bring Bioshock to mind, for instance the way you collect items in the game: you must interact with them pressing a key, only ammo you can actually pick up running above them; the health system isn't regenerative as in most shooters, you must collect aid packs to use later pressing another key, as with Bioshock. Singularity has kind of the same pace as Bioshock, that is having you searching the place for clues, secrets and items, then entering in some fire-fights. During the action scenes you can use a very well selected variety of weapons, and it doesn't limit itself with the everyday shotgun and machine gun: you have weapons that let you literaly guide the bullet, and even a grenade launcher that let you ""drive"" the grenade around the environment; even the usual sniper rifle has a feature that let you slow down time to aim well at your targets. Unlike in Bioshock, in Singularity you really feel the 'oomph' of the weapons, they aren't just pea shooters and the enemies aren't bullet sponges who just loves to break your immersion. I wouldn't call Singularity a shooter, because it has more to offer; but when you have to shoot somebody, it does well, with solid shooter mechanics, reload animations and weapon upgrades.The main feature of the game is presented by the Time Manipulating Device, or TMD, which works as a glove that you wear in your left hand. With it, you can solve puzzles buy aging and renewing some objects, like crates, stairs and machinery. As you progress within that game, you can upgrade it with new powers, just like you do with the plasmids found in Bioshock, but as I said, Singularity has its own charm, it only takes inspiration in Bioshock, although sometimes I felt as it was the other way around, because everything Singularity does, it does better than Bioshock. These new powers let you launch pulse explosions, create bubbles that stops time within it, age enemies until they're just a pile of dust and manipulate objects just like the Gravity Gun (again, Half-Life 2).Singularity has a total of three endings that conclude the narrative in three awesome and distinct ways, that you would finish in something like 8 hours or so. Sounds Everything in this game sounds good: the voice acting, gun shots, explosions, the russian lines spoken by some enemies, the soundtrack that changes accordingly... It's everything well done. Technically I saw some people saying it runs badly, but it is one of those games that was completely polished and well optimized; I could reach 120fps (it doesn't have fps limit as most games out there), and my PC is kind of mid range: i5 2400 3.10GHz, 8GB ram, Windows 7 64bits and a GTX650 1GB.So, if you are the kind of gamer who likes plot oriented games, with a good shooting mechanics and full of out of the ordinary places to explore, just like Half-Life and Bioshock, you definitely should give SIngularity a go. But don't expect a rip off, because this game was well done, it has all of the Raven style that old gamers love and it's really one of its kind.			",158,10,0,11,1,0,8

												I bought this game as a cheap deal with no knowledge how good or bad it is, it looked good though. It was a good buy. Singularity features good graphics, simply gameplay and the element of time travel and time alteration, two things that can make things awesome. With a special device you can instantly kill enemies, repair or destroy items by sending them through time and even travel back in time sometimes to alter the future, with the consequences visible only moments later. It's interesting to find out what happened on the island, how things came the way they are and at the end of everything you can make a choice to alter the future the way YOU want. Though the endings are all a bit lame, the gameplay is good, the developers could've made more out of the time travel aspect, but maybe we see a sequel sometime.Overall a solid title.

												Surprisingly enjoyable game. Singularity borrows a lot of elements form Half-Life, Bioshock and even the piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Time♥♥♥♥♥♥but manages to turn those elements on it's own special thing.It's a fun, solid shooter with good pacing, kept me hooked till the end without being repetitive and it actually scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me on one occasion. It's sort of like FEAR 2, but decent.The actual time bending thing is rather limited, you can use it to pulverize some enemies and restore some destroyed elements but that's it, though there are some puzzles that make use of them that are rather clever. You level up by purchasing abilities in stores around the world, and by the end of the game you can become an indestructible killing machine (which for once was fun).The story was pretty good too, the ending was ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, I cant remember the last time I was this pleased with a game's ending.Warning: The FOV is♥♥♥♥♥♥and cannot be changed.Veredit: It's good!

												For a time travel story, it was overly simple. It had so much wasted potential. Same thing with the puzzles in this game, too simple. The first puzzle is OUTSTANDING, but then they recycle that same exact idea over and over and OVER again with nothing new. There's a part in this game where you have to fight a ♥♥♥♥♥ of infected with a pistol. That was unholy difficulty, even on normal mode. INTERESTINGLY enough, that's the ONLY difficult part of the game. The entire time you basically play as a god, completely destroying everything in your way. Overall, it wasted many good opportunities, and was JUST ok. Cross Bioshock with Fallout 3, with HL2, dumb down the story and difficulty BAM! You got yourself Singularity. Not that it's bad, it's just not nearly as good as it could have been.			",253,85,4,32,8,2,19

												Paranormal sci-fi horror with temporal-weaponry. 2nd playthrough. Definitely worth playing again. Story revolves around a newly discovered (ficticious) element, e99, and the island Katorga-12 where it is exclusively found. E99 holds enormous energetic potential, but is unstable, mutates organic life, and distorts time where it abounds. You are a captain in the u.s. military sent to the island; thought abandoned, to investigate an energy signature which is blinding u.s. spy satelittes. Upon arriving, a temporal wake engulfs you, sending you back in time to 1955. There you find yourself in the same lab facility as it burns. Without hesitation, you rescue a scientist, Demichev. Only before a 2nd temporal wake brings you back to 2010. Demichev was one of two lead scientists heading research into the element and its application. He will continue recklessly pursuing his controversial research without regard for life. His research results in the development and collapse of the singularity, it kills 1000s instantly and mutates any remaning survivors on the island. The result is a paranormal, atemporal mess, torn by violence. Failing to be disuaded, Demichev develops e99 weaponry and quickly rises to power, empowering Russia to conquer the world. The game is primarily about restoring the timeline, but throughout the game you encounter cryptic warnings, written in messages only you can reveal. Perhaps left by a future-you? or by MIR-12? A mysterious organization with knowlecge they couldn't possibly posess, and whose intentions are unclear. As far as enemies, the mutant survivors of the island, warped by the energy of singularity collapse are almost alien. They move incredibly fast, in and out of phase, or can teleport. Others have heightened hearing, but are blind. Still others have become incredibly large. Temporal rifts frequent the game where you can witness events in the past occuring concurrently with the present; revealing the tragic deaths of the inhabitants. Recordings also build this story and reveal what happened in the time since you traveled to 1955. Mostly detailing the exodus of survivors and their horrific deaths attempting to leave. Weapons are also e99 based. Guided rounds, sniper that can slow down time for precise shots, and standard-shooter semi-auto shotgun, assault rifle, and minigun. The most fun is with your TMD, a device you are led to early in the game which embues you with great power. You can create time manipulation fields that age/rejuvenate items or people/mutants, timelocks which freeze time, you can pull things between time-periods, and jump between the years 1955 and 2010. Futher more, you can unleash a blast of energy from your palm that will send enemies flying or will rip them apart. Graphics were out of date even for it's time, but it's just bloody fun to play. And the story line is eery, but enjoyable. Short, but worth your attention, especially if you're into paranormal or sci-fi horror games. Fans of the metro or STALKER series would enjoy, although the feel is much more arcade.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, Singularity was actually pretty good. The game was released around the same time as Timeshift, both dealing somewhat with using time-changing combat abilities. But hands down, Singularity was a much better game. PLOT - above averageLet's be fair, for the most part of the game, you have no idea why you're running around killing people and charging up some bomb. The basic premise is your character, Renko, saved a dictator in the past, and now the present is under totalitarian control. So now you try to go back and right that wrong. Very linear story, BUT you are presented with 3 possible ending cutscenes, depending on who you shoot at the end. GAMEPLAY - very goodYou have a choice between some very generic guns (assault rifle, shotgun, pistol), but also some very interesting weapons. Here are my favorite:1. Sniper Rifle - has a limited ability to slow down time to let you line up the shot. 2. Seeker Rifle - special weapon with limit supplies that lets you control the path of a sniper bullet. 3. Autocannon - combined with the time-stopping Deadlock, this is hilarously over-powered. I stuck with autocannon and sniper rifle for the majority of the gameplay. The Time-Manipulation Device itself doesn't have very many abilities. I think Deadlock is what everyone uses, just to freeze all the enemies in its bubble. Impulse sends a short-range shockwave, and is very satisfying when enemies get up close to you, and you either blow them away or apart. VISUALLY - nauseatingIt's an old game. Everything looks beige in color, and texture resolutions are very low. The geometry also makes you feel a little sick. SOUND - lackingThere is absolutely no music, just creepy ambient sounds. There's no music even for the title screen! The only music is in the CCCP propaganda films! Gunfire sounds average at most. The voice acting is also mediocre. You don't get attached to anybody. OVERALL - more enjoyable than I thought. A little on the long side, to be honest. Rating: 7/10			",113,17,4,8,4,0,9

												An interesting experience akin to Prey, Timeshift, Dead Space and BioShock. Although the acting and storyline leave much to be desired the concept of time manipulation is always enjoyable in first person shooters, especially if you add some puzzles much like the Portal series to them.
