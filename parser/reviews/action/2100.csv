												I love DM of M&M so much. It is a fantastic action RPG that had a rough release due to glitches and bugs and it never got the love it deserved. I really am saddened a bit that a ton of gamers out there missed out on this game because of all the bad PR over issues that have been fixed through patches. The game still holds up even today. The combat is so satisfying and puts other 1st person RPGs to shame. The use of physics is amazing and really alows you to approach fights how you want, as a fighter, mage, archer or a mix. If you're looking for a hidden gem, then this is the game for you. It'll be bitter sweet when you end up having so much fin with it, and then you realise how you missed out on the multiplayer that the game offered. But at least you got to experience the single player.5/5			",384,54,8,12,17,5,16

												One of the best games I (re)played this year.In fact, if not for what Valve did to VTMB, I'd be happy to sing GABEN's praises for Valves creation of the source engine.++Deep and well thought out melee combat system, that rewards players that look to use their surroundings to their           advantage.++Interesting story that's not the usual save the world because you have to business.++ Excellent level design that doesn't force you to fight everything in the game if you're the stealthy type (Although with the kick function, I'm not sure if anyone wants to play stealth anyway)++ High replay value to see the different endings and the different choices available to you in the story as well as the different play styles.++ Demon for a conscience and guide.- Short, so very short. (Although I assume 14-15 hours is ok these days...)- limited RPG leveling system.Overall this is an excellent game well worth the asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started this game up expecting something along the lines of Oblivion, seeing as I recall them being released around the same time, but I got something entirely different, but not unwanted. Despite putting you on a linear path, there are just so many different ways you can go about handling yourself along the path, and I personally enjoy that. In addition, there are plenty of awesome secrets that leave me looking around for any kind of secret buttons or breakable walls along the way, and I just love how this game rewards you for it. Upon launching, I noticed this game is run on Source Engine, which had me delightfully surprised. DMMM Utilizes the technology wonderfully and the combat alone would leave me thinking it was a different engine entirely.Downsides consist of crashes, which are long beyond being worked on due to the game's age. However, if you're able to fix those loading crashes, then I guarantee that a great game waits for you on the other side of those loading screens, however cheesy some of the characters and dialogue are.Basically, I'm giving this a 10 outta 10, because I haven't had this much fun with a singleplayer RPG since Oblivion and Skyrim. Definitely on par, and plenty of variety to keep you going.			",281,20,4,22,11,4,22

												I've heard about this game before. It was probably the first fantasy FPS I've seen. Got it on a sale and boy was I pleasantly surprised. I've played the whole game through in one sitting.Despite the story, characters and voice acting being rather generic and the game being very linear, the combat and mechanics of the game are really good.The game features multiple weapon types such as swords, daggers, bows, axes, staffs and shields. Tools such as hammers and pickaxes can be used as weapons too.The game has 3 (small) skill trees that all can be leveled independently (though it is recommended to stick to one at the beginning) and unlock new combat moves, spells or increase your basic stats.Combat is pretty simple but can be approached in different ways. You can throw props at enemies and kick them into hazards. Use a frost spell to freeze the ground and watch them slip off into a pit. Priceless.Because it runs on the Source engine you can expect decent physics. The game has a lot of destructible objects lying around that you can use to throw at your enemies. The game even has half life 2's gravity gun (reskined into a telekinesis spell) that you can use to mess around with.Another thing worth mentioning is that you can grab and climb up ledges, ropes and chains. Later in the game you also get a rope bow that lets you attach ropes to wooden surfaces and climb up them.I'm not arachnophobic but god damn the spiders in this game. The game seems to have a serious spider fetish. In fact the whole story is linked to spiders.Speaking about spiders, they are absolutely terrifying. Reason being that the character and npc design in terms of models and textures is great. Stuff looks interesting and quite believable. From dull gray castle guards and bald necromancers to sexy demon ladies. All really well made.When specing into the stealth build the game suffers from the same problem Skyrim does. You can stand in darkness or crouch in semi dark areas and just backstab enemies one by one as others come to check what happened. It becomes ridiculously easy to kill enemies. Not to mention just shoot your bow from a hidden spot and enemies will not know what hit them. If you get spotted however you'll have a hard time as the game is pretty darn hard. I started on the hard difficulty and had to start over because it was too hard, especially because I didn't spec the right skills at the start.TL;DR:Pros:-Fun, diverse combat-Good physics-Kicking things-Great npc design in terms of models and textures-Kicking things into other things-Optional quests that change certain story aspects and the final outcome; multiple endings-Kicking things off things-Rope bow-Kicking things into other things-Gravity gun-Replay value-Source engine; runs great on old pcs while looking relatively good-Multiple routes in some cases-Lots of worthwhile secrets.Cons:-Generic characters-Predictable story-Boring voice actors-Linear levels-Little RPG elements; no stores, no open world, no backtracking-No mod tools (considering it's the source engine); dead multiplayer as a result-Conveniently placed spiky plates to kick enemies into everywhereGreat game overall. Really underrated. Definitely gets a must play recommendation from me.			",213,24,1,10,9,3,5

												I'm confused as to how this game received mixed reviews. This is simply one of the best videogames I've ever played. Sure it's story is generic but it is executed pretty darn well. What really stands out in this game is it's combat mechanics and I love games with an in-depth combat system. In all my experiences with combat mechanics in games, nothing tops this masterpiece of a game. It it truly satisfying to pull off different moves and have variation in what you do all of which affect your enemies in the slightest but most unique ways. Harness the potential power of your environment with throwable objects and traps to use against your enemies which is the most enjoyable part of this game. All of this is made possible with the SOURCE ENGINE! So not only do these abilities and such sound good but are executed equally as good!What I also admire is it's Immense replayablility for a game that seems so linear. The game presents you these three playstyles that you can go full out on one or try and experiment between them and create cool hybrids. There are no boundaries, no ""choose your class"" type ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it just gives you the game and goes ""go nuts"". And the repayability that this creates is awesome! Speaking of replayability, you can also find secret areas along your travels and the game also sports multiple endings!All of this is played in FPS which adds onto the immersion. Not many fantasy games play out in FPS which makes this game pretty unique in that sense.The game is more feature rich than you would think. But my only gripe about this game is the voice acting. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING...at least from the main protagonist. If you can get past it like I did, you'll have a bomb of a time.Note: Do not buy this game for the multiplayer, I've tried it and absolutely NOBODY plays it.9/10			",52,10,2,6,3,1,7

												Dark Messiah of Might & Magic puts players in a first-person perspective, allowing them to immerse themselves in the legendary Might and Magic universe as never before. It is also the world's first fantasy action game to feature a complete first-person combat system. It takes full advantage of the Source Engine's exceptional technological enhancements in areas such as character animation, advanced AI, real-world physics and shader-based rendering. - UbisoftI have played this game during my early childhood and I must admit that once I started playing this game I felt stuck to it and completed it over and over again multiple times.A game that despite being released in 2006, it’s yet fully capable of taking down some modern games within the same genres.A fine example of what a good adventure and a first-person action game should be, Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is a remarkable example at its finest.Overall aspects of Dark Messiah of Might & MagicAdventure combined with the storyline: The adventure that this game is capable of, is reasonable with the addition of secret places that contributes to a careful exploration of each area players find themselves in. Despite being strictly locked only to its main quest and some other minor side quests, it also contains a short amount of role-playing and key decisions throughout the game.The storyline isn’t the best, it lacks a strong backbone or a base to begin from, and it is based mostly in surprise elements and new elements that will always shape players way of thinking and seeing things as they progress further in the game.Graphics and game play mechanics: The graphics Dark Messiah is capable of projecting with its Source Engine, despite not being the best for its time, are still pretty good and well-balanced with the game play mechanics and user interface.About the game mechanics, it is focused not only to give players a very pleasant first person melee/ranged combat experience with many different styles and opponents, but also a strong presence of the use of the surrounding game atmosphere and items during all sorts of conflict.Combat: Despite the rich game combat moves the game allows players to execute, you might feel that most conflicts you face will be ultimately resolved by the use of front kicks combined with the use of the game surroundings and objects around to terminate your enemies.This can be easily a 'Pro' for most players since it is quite enjoyable to watch enemies being kicked off to spikes or to be kicked off against fragile wooden crates, but maybe a 'Con' for some.User interface: The user interface in this game is simple, clean and again, it does match well with everything else giving players a very good gaming experience.There is only one way to access your character info, skill points, and quick toolbar which is located at the right top side of your inventory that offers a very simple and easy way to access everything you want.Music and the voice acting: Despite this game containing more sounds related to the atmosphere of each part of the game than music itself, both are pretty much reasonable in the end I would say.The voice acting is decent I believe, but sometimes it just feels that it doesn’t fit whenever there is music being played during a cut scene and voice simultaneously.Game difficulty: The game difficulty is very well balanced to meet the tastes of those who wish a enjoyable adventure without struggling that much, to those who want it hardcore with difficult opponents.Price: The game price that has also been the same for the last few years is incredibly worth it, with or without sales, the content and adventure this game has to offer is totally worth its base price.ConclusionI would rate this game 79 out of 100 or 3.9 out of 5.0 stars. An enjoyable adventure with a fair amount of content and a vast adventure with decent graphics and game play for a very good price.			",147,18,7,14,14,2,20

												Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is hands down one of the most entertaining games I have ever played in my life. To be honest, the story is lame, the levels are pretty linear, and after one or two playthroughs you aren't likely to find any new hiding spots for super-secret treasure(though there are quite a few of them).But this game's combat makes up for all of its flaws, story or otherwise. I have never played a game with more engaging, interesting, or balanced combat than this one. It's the only reason I come back to this game, and as you can see from my logged hours, I have come back to this game time and time again.The combat is fairly basic to begin with, you can hit things hard or not so hard, you can block with a shield or parry with a one-handed weapon, you can shoot enemies from far away with a bow. However, as you progress into the game and start earning skill points, combat very quickly becomes a deep experience. The game carries three classic releplaying game archetypes: the mage, the rogue, and the warrior. But the part that makes it so wonderful is the complete freedom you have to spend your skill points in any way you please. You can be sneaking up on your opponents wearing heavy armor and slinging fireballs if you want to.Just play the game, that's really all there is to it. It's well worth the meager investment.

												Played this bloddy thing like 3 times, in 3 different styles, and I also got the extended port for Xbox360. After that much time playing this game, I can safely tell you, it's worth it on a sale. Here's why:Ever wanted a game with a story as good as the first Half Life, that's as linear, but more RPG-Like? Then, this is your game. The only difference, is that the main character speaks, and you have legs as your crowbar.Made with the source engine, the graphics of the game still look great today. The story, even though not being a f#cking master-piece, it's decent and entertaining, and the gameplay...Well, ♥♥♥♥ing love it.You can be, whatever you want to be. You want to be like Havel from Dark Souls, a huge armored rock that slays everthing in one hit, but it's slow as progress with Half Life 3? Want to be a camping sniper who can trickshot someone in the balls in slow motion? Want to be the medieval Adan Jensen, and use stealth to the max, executing people from the back? Or just want to be Leonidas, and kick everyone on the balls, and throw them to the pits of hell? I'm not kidding, I did that already, even sended the video to a famous channel long time ago.

You also have offensive and defensive magic, and they're also fun to use...But I always end up taking stealth. The game has a few endings, and counting that this is as linear as modern FPS's (but with four times thework on the actual game), it's good!The game also has multiplayer. Now, I don't know if the multiplayer comes already with the full game, or you buy it stand-alone, but sadly, it's almost dead. You have to understand, the game is really old...But there are still a few servers, most of them russian servers. And if you're able to play without getting banned by ""hacking"" (turns out, I'm superior, must be the afro hair), you'll have fun. The matches are team-based with 5 classes, mostly being the Spy-backstabbing-son-of-a-wh#re, the archer-sniping-MLG-kid, the SUPERIOR-REAL-SOVIET-DAMAGING-Black Mage, the White-Medic-Mage, and the generic Melee-HOLDMOUSE1TOWIN-Knight. You win XP in the matches, to get extra skills and stuff, and each match is entertaining...Even though some stuff is a bit over-powered. There's variety, though. Just think, for example: Healing magic also damages enemies, and you can set how much you want it to heal, and how much to damage!This game is, like I said, like a RPG-Half Life. And a good one, at that. Since the multiplayer is almost deserted, I'd say it's worth 5-8€ at max, but the money will be well spent.AND DON'T BE A ♥♥♥♥♥ IN MULTIPLAYER, SPAMMING THE GOD-DAMN RAISE ON WHITE MAGES. THIS IS NOT GOD-DAMN FINAL FANTASY, YOU KNOW!Edit: Forgot to put this here, made this video a few months ago, me trying to go through most of the game glitching sh#t and mainly using kicks. It was as hilarious as it sounds.

Posted: March 9, 2015
												In a nutshell: a very good (and different than the mainstream) game, with some flaws. Highly recommended, and the price is very low; give it some initial love, and you will be rewarded by several hours of enjoyable gameplay.Want details? Read below.When I first heard about this game, I thought ""Come on, melee fighting in... first-person view only? Ridiculous."" It turns out it is way better than I thought. The game actually manages to be very enjoyable, despite the fact it has its flaws. Yes, the first-person view is a major flaw because you can't see much, as a big part of the screen is covered by your shield, your daggers, or even your own hands when using some spells. However, in practice it is not as bad as it sounds, and in some ways first-person view makes things more interesting, provided you get used to the hitboxes of your weapons.The learning curve is rather steep in the beginning, but it gets better soon. The game is not an RPG really, but has some RPG elements. There is no experience or stats; you earn skill points as you complete your objectives, and you can use those skill points to learn some abilities or spells; neat and simple. There are no classes; instead, there are three skill trees, somehow representing the typical fighter, rogue/archer, and mage classes. However, the player is free to distibute skill points as he/she pleases, so it is quite possible to be a warrior with some magical or stealth abilities, and such combinations actually work very well in practice. I personally found the sword fighter + archer combo quite enjoyable, and probably the easiest way to play this game. A ""thief"" build is also interesting, and it is actually quite possible to go stealth for the most part of the game.Melee fighting is probably the most interesting aspect of Dark Messiah. You have some fighting moves, and using them you can make your opponent walking lame, or you can decapitate him. Fighting is far from being the usual, boring click fest. It needs player's skills instead.As usual in similar PC games, the controls are clunky, and some players will probably quit playing early because of this. For example, hold left mouse button ""for a second"" to activate power attack; hold direction keys while holding down the left mouse key to activate alternative power attacks; additionally, hold space bar for a jump attack. All that when you have a bunch of enemies in front of you. Seriously, if that's not clunky controls, I don't know what ""clunky controls"" means. Things would be way better if you could use a controller instead of mouse and keyboard. Nevertheless, once you get used of the controls, melee fighting is really enjoyable. It has not the nice controls of Dark Souls, but it is still quite enjoyable. Most players will probably pick a warrior combo because of this, despite the controls.As in Half-Life 2, you can use the environment to get rid of your enemies. Shoot a loose supporting beam so that the barrels above fall on a bunch of bad guys; cut a rope so that a rock pendulum hits a mighty cyclops that blocks your way; kick your enemy so that he falls off a cliff, etc. Physics reminds Half-Life 2, and that's not a coincidence, as Dark Messiah uses the same game engine. Using the environment is just another nice aspect of the game.The plot is nothing innovative, but it is certainly interesting. You are a guy, trying to get an ancient artifact from the bad guys. Nothing new so far; however, there are two hot girls hitting on you. Leanna is the ""good girl"" who will fight on your side in many cases, and eventually falls in love with you, although she is too shy to admit it openly. Xana is some kind of a succubus, a demonic creature that lives inside you, gives you useful information depending on the situation and, most importantly, comments on what's going on. Xana's commentary is actually the funniest part of this game: she is jealous about Leanna, and always has some ironic and quite funny comments about her.A spice of humor is spread all over the game. It's not only Xana's comments mentioned above, but also NPCs talk to eachother, quite often in a funny way: enemy soldiers talking about their boss ironically, goblins discussing if they should eat the orc they just killed, and several other things that will make you smile.There are some nice cutscenes, but luckily the developers didn't overuse them. I am really tired of today's ridiculous ""AAA"" games with a cutscene every few seconds and zero gameplay. Dark Messiah is definitely not one of them, and I am quite happy with that.Eventually, you will have to take decisions, which leads to a few different endings of the game. However, the game is basically linear; personally, I prefer that instead of the chaotic gameplay of Elder Scrolls, for example - although a lttle more non-linearity in Dark Messiah would be nice. Not to mention fighting in Dark Messiah is actually way better than the simplistic fighting in Elder Scrolls. Hard to remember a similar, but non-linear game, that managed to keep me playing till its end.Graphics are typical for the Source engine used. Although not that realistic as in modern games, graphics certainly serve their purpose very well. I also liked the music of the game, and in general sound does its job: no complaints, no awards. Voice actors also do their job, with Moon Dailly performing very well as Xana.There is also a multiplayer mode for Dark Messiah. I imagine this would be quite fun, but sadly it is non-existant in practice. Official server is down, probably because this game was first released 9 years ago. Unless you have friends interested to play, forget about multiplayer.I read some people had techinical issues with this game. This was not the case for me; no issues in a mediocre laptop running Windows 7 64 bit. No FPS drops, no tearing, with maximum quality settings on - very good performance, typical for the Source engine used in the game. I had a few game crashes, especially when running other programs in the background, but nothing really serious, and probably caused by the laptop's low RAM.The game is rather easy in ""normal"" mode - provided you pass the steep initial learning curve. There are some annoyingly hard enemies, but in general you won't have serious problems beating the game, including bosses. Expect a 20-30 hours of gameplay in your first playthrough, if you want to explore everything and find all secret places in the game. Replayability is rather low: once I beated the game, I started over using a stealth build and tried a different ending but, other than that, there is no more replayability to talk of.Final verdict: I don't give a positive review easily, but Dark Messiah definitely desrves it, despite the flaws mentioned.  Taking into account its price, I'd say it's a bargain, and highly recommended.			",4,2,0,2,0,0,0

												Incredible game.  I have no idea how I went so long without playing this one.  The mechanics are good.  The graphics are decent.  The gameplay is phenomenal, and theres plenty of replayability.One of the coolest things I've ever seen done with the Source engine.  Also a decent ""This is Sparta!"" simulator.10/10 would kick again.			",206,17,2,29,9,1,31

												NOTE: I bought it on retail, played and finished this game BEFORE I had a Steam Account. I only recently Activated it on Steam. As usual, SEE CONCLUSION if you find this review too long.INTRO:Set in the UBISOFT world of Ashan (Heroes V world), you play an adventurer named Sareth who sets out on a quest to stop the ""Dark Messiah"" from releasing the imprisoned Demon Lord who was prophesied to return.Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is one of the earlier first person magic/melee games of Arkane Studios who would later go on to make Dishonored. This game has a completley different game mechanic from the original Might and Magic games of 3DO and New World Computing.PROS:+ Decent Graphics: - This game utilizes the Source Engine. Although, It may not be the most graphically advanced game, it brings, a decent enough atmosphere and pretty environments with a commendable quality texture work.+ Combat Mechanic: - Also a CONS (See Below). This game has a good blend of magic, melee and ranged combat. Dealing with different kinds of foes may require you to adopt different tactic to efficiently dispose of your target. Stealth mechanic works fairly well. (Not even close to Thief or Dishonored, but enough to satisfy a more stealthy approach on the missions.)+ Story: - I personally liked the story which is directly related to the Heroes of Might and Magic universe that I'm a fan of. The plot twists and conflicts are well delivered along with some interesting characters. As usual, this is my own opinion and some people might disagree with me.+ Lengthy Campaign: -Long enough to deliver the story in a satisfying manner. This game also features  multiple ending scenario where your actions would directly impact the game's ending. It Suffers from the Mass Effect 3 Syndrome though. (Feel free to ask me on what the ME3 Syndrome is.)CONS:- Combat Mechanic: - Also a PRO (See Above). Despite the availability of different items, magics and tactics, they are all trumped by your might BOOT. Kicking your target either to stun them or send them to spikes (which are conveniently placed) defeats the purpose of having different kinds of weapons, magic and equipment. It becomes repetitive at times.- Unnecessary Multiplayer: - There are games that were meant for Singleplayer, this is one such game. Unfortunately, for us, a poorly implemented multiplayer is present which most likely diverted some of the developer's money which would have been better spent on advancing the Singleplayer experience.- Cheesy Voice Acting: - I did enjoy the voice acting but that's me, most people will probably get annoyed with it and so I place it here as a CON.CONCLUSION:Though I generally RECOMMEND this game, I, however, think that new players or people new to the Might and Magic lore may not be able to fully appreciate its true value. This is best played by people already familar with Might and Magic. This game is underrated in my honest opinion.NOT RECOMMENDED if you're looking for an old school Might and Magic (VI to VIII) experience. For that, check out Might and Magic X or Legend of Grimrock. Also not for people looking for an Elder Scrolls experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												A cult classic from the creators of Dishonored, Dark Messiah is an interesting game.  It's listed as an RPG but that's misleading; it's like calling Dishonored an RPG.  Both have skill trees, both have a very small amount of decision making which results in low chaos vs high chaos in Dishonored.  Without spoiling anything, Dark Messiah is similar in that regard.  It's not truly an RPG, you don't have control over your character's physical and personality attributes and there are no dialogue choices or anything like that.  There are simply three major plot decisions.One particularly interesting aspect in this game is that you don't necessarily play as the good guy.  I'll just leave it at that without spoiling much.This game is known primarily for its gameplay mechanics, combat in particular.  It's a first person action game that has separate skill trees for melee combat, magic, archery, as well as some miscellaneous skill trees.  Furthermore, there are different types of melee weapons to choose from: twin daggers, swords, and staves.  Each has different properties, pros, cons, and combat animations.  One of the best features of this game's melee combat is that you have different swings/strokes depending on your movement.  Holding W and releasing a power attack for example delivers a different attack than holding A + power strike.  This is something I've demanded for years, and this is one of few games that offers it.Most spells are offensive and elemental based but there are some exceptions.  The player is expected to go down every weapon skill tree apparently, since archery is too useful in boss fights.This being a source game, it's almost entirely physics based.  Arkane Studios took advantage of this and emphasized using the environment to kill your opponents.  Knock down a bunch of heavy debris on them, kick them off of a cliff, impale them on spikes, you name it.  Combined with the ability to chain spell effects and other things together (e.g., spill oil on an area and light it on fire with a fire spell or arrow, or shoot a lightning spell into water to electrify it), Dark Messiah seems to provide more ways to kill opponents than any other game, and you can see from my library that I've played a lot.  Even more ways to kill people than Dishonored, which lacks the environmental emphasis.People often say that The Elder Scrolls games should have this game's combat.  They are absolutely right.  Conceptually, this game has the best combat mechanics of any action game.  However, despite everything I just said, the gameplay/combat is riddled with flaws/oversights, the game lacks an engaging story/plot (RotFodder's pizza analogy is spot on), and it may be a bit too long for its own good.  The combat is fantastic on paper but has flawed execution.  First of all, the game is quite rough around the edges and clipping issues are fairly common which is extremely annoying.  There are some stupid delays when blocking attacks and counter attacking, or using daggers, and other situational things like that.  Also, unlike most first person action games, you actually have to be very precise with your swings.  It seems like the player's hitbox with melee weapons is actually the weapon itself; this makes sense, however it's not good in practice.  This type of thing only works in a game with very precise swinging and more fluidity, like Shadow Warrior and Dark Souls games.  Reach/range is really wonky in this game.  Goblins seem to have the same reach as humans and orcs.   At the end of the day this game comes across as quite clunky by modern standards, but by 2006 standards it must have been a gift from God (I didn't play it in 2006 but I've played plenty of 2006 games in 2006, Red Steel was the best action game I had played at the time).  Because of it's clunkiness I find it less enjoyable than Dishonored as an action game.  Dishonored's mix of advanced action mechanics and unbelievable, flawless fluidity is only matched by Shadow Warrior and Shadow Warrior 2 as far as first person action games go.  But then Dark Messiah has so many advantages like the environmental uses, spell/effect combos, and more varied melee attacks than Dishonored.  As usual, we'll never get it all.Dark Messiah is known to be challenging, but it has that old school unbalanced challenge where if you raise the difficulty, enemies just deal far more damage than you even when using the same attack.  It will take around ten flame arrow spells to kill a regular human opponent for example, but they can kill you in four (and that's with upgraded max health).  If you like unbalanced no holds barred difficulty then perhaps you'll like this, otherwise I recommend sticking to Normal mode which is more balanced.  I favor balanced difficulty with smart AI.  This game's AI is functional enough although hilariously bad at times.Dishonored is known for its stealth, and that's one area where this game lacks.  It's far more linear than Dishonored, the climbing system is awfully clunky and barely works (clunkier than Thief Gold's even), and you're generally unable to one hit kill enemies from behind even with backstab.  This game is clearly meant to be an action game first, stealth game secondary. Dishonored and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided are the only games I've played that are equally proficient at both.In terms of atmosphere, this game bears an uncanny resemblence to Thief at times.  Some sections even tricked me into pressing Thief's key bindings!  The resemblence is so strong at times, particularly in crypts.  This game also has a Rope Bow for shooting rope arrows into wooden surfaces... sound familiar?  Although Thief's rope arrows are less restricted and work more often.It's no secret that this game relies entirely on its combat.  The plot and all of the dialogue are pure cheese.  It's cliche after cliche.  Character development is mostly non existent.  This is all intentional though, the game is not meant to have an enthralling story or serve as a drama of any sort.  It's just meant to provide a challenging but very fun killing experience.  It mostly does that, although its clunkiness and lack of polish makes it frustrating at times.  Plenty of times this game would get tiresome and repetitive, but then I'd unlock a new ability and all of a sudden it's fun again until I use that ability many times.TL:DR - This game is all about killing things and it has very good killing mechanics overall, the best on paper as far as action games go but the fact that it's somewhat clunky and very unpolished can make it annoying.  It's meant to be fun and challenging, and it mostly succeeds but with a number of hitches.  It drags on a bit and gets tiresome toward the end.  Decent game, I'd love a sequel on Source 2.I did not proofread this review.			",133,24,3,22,2,1,12

												imagine the perfect game with the perfect gameplay, world and lore from the might and magic series (Heroes of Might and Magic V) physics engine using the Source Engine, this Hack and Slash FPS is the eqivelent of half life 2 as a childhood masterpiece of game criminally under-rated (FU gamespot) and the spritual predecessor of Dishonored this game hits all the spots from a gaming perspective too bad it's a tad bit short, but has IMMENSE replayvalue i've finished this game 15 times on the elements version on console and now i've finished it on the 16th on the steam version and my god, what a nostalgia trip! i wish i could erase my memory and replay this gem again and again... this game has 4 main styles of gameplay, with the PC version you can mix em up on console you're stuck with whatever you started with so you have:Strength and Endurance -Sword and Shield with heavy armor playstyle Stealth and burgerly - use of daggers, allows to 1-hit kill from behind while undetected, also to open doors and chests without keys (via automatic lockpicking) Magic and Mana:spells spells spells! get yer spells here, don't bother with staves, they're boring and unispring i personally perfer the ""utility"" magic over the elemental magic, because you have the ""Charm"" ability which makes enemies allies for a period of time, very helpful and you can get it pretty early on last but not least... marksmanship and critial hits: bow gameplay, essentially turning this game into a medivil FPS, i don't like this playstyle because it relies on you camping from a distance and aiming for the head, if you want this playstyle mix with a couple levels of stealth i personally went with the dishonored build a lot of stealth and crit, a bunch of magic, some endurance and a bit of strength (on hardmode enemies can definitely take a beating) and i would DEFINITELY recommend you to play this game on at least hard (normal is the EZ mode of the game) ask me what to level up first if you're in a bind and if you're really into the story,i'ed recommend watching the story of Heroes of might and magic V and it's expansions on youtube (i can link you to a channel) Dark Messiah concludes the might and magic series before Ubisoft went to milk the ""past"" of the series with terrible sequels as of now this is the last year of the seventh dragon (989), meaning this game was the planned to end the series (either giving Ashan eternal peace, or unleashing all Shough upon it) TLDR: this is a great game and i would recommend you to play it.

												Even being as old as it is, Dark Messiah still has, hands down, one of the best combat systems I have ever seen in a video game. Few other medieval fantasy games have the amount of fluidity and control over a character's actions as DM does. Your character takes into account whether you are moving quickly, what direction you have moved your mouse, and how long you have pressed the attack button in determining what attack will be done. The physics in the game are great as well. Ever wanted to kill a horde of orcs by only throwing crates and barrels at them a la Donkey Kong style? In this game, you can! Ever wanted to mess around for a while watching Necromancers play slip and slide on ice traps you've laid down? In this game, you can! Want to fight dirty and kick an enemy  off a cliff? In this game, you can!Other games such as Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim may have an open world with a more developed lore surrounding it, but they absolutely pale when it comes to their combat systems. Any person who has played Dark Messiah will agree. On another note, this is still one of the few games in which you can enjoy a full view of your character's body when looking downwards. Games being made today still don't have this option, which is somewhat embarassing since this game had it implemented perfectly since 2006.Lastly, this is one of the few games that genuinely feels as though you have actually taken down something massive and dangerous. The colossal size of some of the creatures, such as the wyverns and cyclops in this game, are genuinely huge, and require out-of-the-box strategizing to take down. For comparison's sake, I'll use Skyrim. Let's be honest, Skyrim's dragons are somewhat pathetic, if they seem to have trouble even dealing with common folk and can be taken down by common every-day arrows and fire spells. In DM, these creatures are actually quite dangerous, even towards the end of the game, and when you've killed a boss creature, you feel like you've earned it; it's an actual accomplishment that you look back on with pride. You owe it to yourself to play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you love screwing with enemy AI and physics, like throwing a crate at an orc's head, then kicking them down a bottomless pit before they can get up from the blow? Do you want to see what it would have felt like if Elder Scrolls games had decent melee combat and some actually nice level design? Perhaps you also enjoy the old FPS style of looking for hidden secrets in levels, which in game's case can give you some pretty neat toys?Then give Dark Messiah a shot. At 5€ it'd be stupid not to.

												Pro:+great stealth mechanics+many different ways to go trough the stages and kill your enemies+great melee combat system+many secrets can be found troughout the game+good level and enemy design+cool use of physics (if you like the gravity gun in HL2, you will like this game)Con:-the story is kinda mediocre-the later stages aren't as good as the first ones-the last boss and the endings aren't as climatic as i wished them to be-short playtimeConclusion:Dark Messiah is a good and underrated game. If you can overlook the story and you just wanna have fun with the physics or you wanna play it for the stealth mechanics, i recommened giving it a try.			",55,1,2,13,1,0,0

												I cannot count the amount of playthroughs I have done with this game, but to date one of the best RPG's ever made. The review scores really baffle me. While the story is generic and the voice acting sort of meh the combat and campaign are incredible. Imagine an RPG where skill progression doesnt just give you number increases, but tangible abilities, spells, moves and perks. Every encounter is like a battle arena sandbox with ledges, spikes, stairs, objects, oil jars, traps, and other things to exploit, you can play this game however you want, because xp (skill points) is awarded through progress rather than kill count, so stealth is viable. As you can see by my hours played, I can affirm to its play value, you'll want to try all the abilities in all sorts of combinations for sure.All in all, its like oblivion/skyrim but linear and the combat is miles and away more fun (not a E.S. hater), and the perks and locals are far more fleshed out.Pro tip: with all quests + or - side quests, you can get anywhere between 1 & 1/3rd to 1 & 2/3rds sections of perks filled between the 3 perk lanes (Warrior/combat, Magic, Stealth/misc.)

												I've played through this game more times than I can count. Every playthrough brings a new mix of skills and playstyles. Light everyone on fire! Shrink them down then step on them! Throw them into spikes! Cut various bits of their body off in a glorious spray of blood! Hit them in the face with a barrell! Whether you use stealth, magic, or brute force to challenge your enemies is up to you. I find the gameplay to be engrossing and challenging, yet rewarding. Despite the age of this game, the graphics still do just fine. Dark Messiah is my go-to for hack and slash fun!			",57,6,0,9,12,0,10

												This is such a great game.  Everything about it is so cool!  I'd place it near the pinnacle of first-person fantasy combat in all three archetypes: melee combat, stealth combat, and wizardry.  The movement is rather unique among fps games in that your character has weight that you can see and feel, and it makes you have to think as you move through combat.  Also, YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF; your body is rendered, and your choice of armor and equipment show.  It looks nice for an older game, and, since it is older, it runs beutifully on a new system.  The atmosphere is excellent, and the story is clever and well paced too.  You even have story changing choices!  Player agency!  I can go on and on about how much I love this game!  The environment is interactive.  The character progression is great, picking perks in the different archetypes: melee sword and sometimes board, Legolas archery, ninja stealth, and powerful sorcery.  You can specialize or mix and match to suit your playstyle.  This adds so much replayability.  I'm playing through again as a Wizard after a cool run as a Warrior type, and I'll go again.   It's such a great game!  Buy it!  Play it!  10/10  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!This is a gem of fantasy fps gaming.			",115,18,0,31,12,1,38

												The 72 metascore is a joke as this game is way better than that.Amazing combat system that (i think) still works around 9 years after release.Upgrade system gives a bit variety and offers different playthroughs. Personally I’ve played it through like 10 times or more just because it’s so damn amazing and each time made different choices.Morale choices (good/bad) also adds to the variety and I highly recommend doing more than 1 playthrough.Quite interesting story that takes you many different places (orc island, crypts, artifact hunting…).Overall this game is extremely underrated and deserves more credit than it has received. So if you like going on an adventure this is the game for you.11/10			",220,15,4,21,26,1,61

												This review is for the single player, might try the multi-player once I return to land of good internets.Great game, it might be a bit dated, the physics might be ridiculous at times but it is still well worth playing. And if you are wondering about my hours this is a retail version that I will go for yet another playthrough of soon but I only started using steam properly in the last 2 years and I have this game 8 years or so.A little history, this is, in essence, the predecessor to dishonored. Yes they are completely different game worlds but it is made by arkane stuidos, the company who also made dishonored and arx fatalis. They don't make many games and there is one thing in common with all of them, the environment is great <--- this is coming from a guy who will rarely even notice, nevermind applaud environment.If you havent played any of these games then let me give you a quick breakdown.You play sareth, midevil apprentice to old wizard man who goes on a wonderful adventure filled with swords and spiders and undead creatures playing tag. The story is predicatable and cliché but not badly told.You being the standard multi-talented rpg character can choose to become the most powerful (headless) warrior/mage/assasin of your time.So why is the environment so good? Why would I reccomend this at least as much as the much smoother and more polished dishorored? Because you have one of the first games to try realistic physics and while it failed magnificently in some ways, it is still one of the best attempts going. Sure you kick someone within ten yards of a cliff/spikes and they go flying over it after tumbling forever and ever. But alot of objects can be played on both by you and the enemy, even combining in interesting ways with certain spells.One of the nicest things that is so rare in games is that you REALLY feel different depending on what skills you choose. Stealth is ridiculously OP to the point of breaking the game at stealth 3, while magic only playthroughs are as challenging sub 10 deaths in super meat boy 106%.The game is completely linear (which I like), even when you make a choice it barely affects any outcomes. Save this guy or not, heres a potion, or a sword, or a chance to kill the annoying one. The most significat differences are the 4 different endings and even there the actual difference is nothing at all, not even really worth exploring.The enemies are one of the nicer parts, every enemy plays differently. Bigger, smaller, stronger, weaker, come in groups, come alone, have certain elemental weaknesses or can only be hurt in one spot. On the counter side the AI is stupidly exploitable, (this can be fun), but the hardcore player might be very dissapointed.			",80,13,0,26,3,1,9

First, it should be said that like Crusaders of Might & Magic, this is not part of either of the two Might & Magic series (The strategy games and the classic RPGs). While it does take place within that continuity, it plays nothing like them. It does have a level progression system and character building, but more than anything it is a first person corridor shooter, just with swords, bows and magic instead of guns. In fact, the closest thing I can think of is Hexen. However, while the idea of a melee-oriented FPS may sound questionable (Although consider that Condemned: Criminal Origins came out around the same time), Dark Messiah's combat system is nothing short of fantastic, at least when swords are involved. I highly recommend that any potential players spec melee with just a bit of magic, as the sword fighting system is easily the best part of the game and is what the environments are designed for. Magic, particularly healing, is a nice addition, but focusing on it gets dull. Stealth is just tacked on and serves little purpose. In addition to a number of melee moves, Dark Messiah also features the fantasy version of Duke Nukem's mighty boot, and to be honest, this gets way more use than it should. This is because the levels are liberally covered with spike traps, long falls, fire, and so on that you can punt the enemies into. It's an absolute blast to send an orc falling to his death with nothing but a swift kick, but it does tend to be used far too much. This is because it kicking enemies quickly becomes the most efficient method of dispatching enemies, particularly when fighting a number of enemies in a closed environment.Overall, the level design is fine, if linear. At certain points, in fact, it could even be called inspired. Like the later Mirror's Edge, platforming is incorporated liberally, and also like that game, you can see the main character's body to help. Rope arrows help you scale the environments and contribute to the sheer numbers of ways you can dispatch your enemies. Towards the end, however, the action moves underground. At this point, most of the environments become incredibly boring, and due to the darkness, most of the game will be played through one of the most obnoxious night vision shaders I've ever seen. Also, while the combat shines when fighting humanoid enemies, this game is way overfond of spider levels, and these bounce between annoying and tedious, depending on how many poison curatives you have. No number of potions, however, can make these sections fun.The story is entirely forgettable, with absolutely no outstanding characters. While there are multiple endings based on a particular choice, the logic of this choice is simply pathetic. The protagonist, Sareth, is accompanied by two female characters, a young mage and a succubus that lives in his mind, and his persona bounces between boy scout and creepy edgelord depending on which one happens to be the focus of a particular level. Literally no character in this game is particularly interesting or well developed, and the story simply serves to move the action forward.Dark Messiah is far from perfect, but it has one reason to exist, and that's the combat. At times, the game feels like a spiritual successor to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, and that's nothing but a good thing. It isn't as good as Jedi Outcast, but its as close as you'll come. Despite its many flaws, as a combat sandbox Dark Messiah justifies a place in any action gamer's library. However, it should be avoided if you want a well-constructed story, non-linear or open levels, or deep RPG mechanics. Make no mistake, Dark Messiah may look like its contemporary, TESIV: Oblivion, but the two couldn't be more different. Dark Messiah is a competent action game, and if that's all you're in the market for, I recommend it.			",170,12,4,31,24,0,39

												This is the first Might and Magic Game I've played. So my review will be based on that.First of all, THIS GAME IS SHORT. You can probably beat in < 10 hours meaning one day of zoning out on the computer and bam, the final boss is down. The game is divided into 10 chapters with each chapter representing an area. Secondly, this game is as linear as it gets - there is an order for every place and you can't go back - just like FFXIII. The leveling system is also a bit weird - everything is done in skill points which are obtained by going through the storyline. There are a few optional skill points as well - for finding secret areas or completing optional quests but those are few and far.  You determine your characters ""class"" by spending skill points. Another thing to note - THERE IS NO TRADING. You can keep items in your inventory, use them, or drop them. That's it. The only healing you get is either through magic or healing items and mana restoration is only available via mana items which can only be found. So be very careful on how you use what you have.On an overall note this game is different, it's short, linear, and kind of limited, but it was still fun to play. So if you are looking for something and this game is on sale for under 10 bucks then this may be the game for you.RATING: 6.5/10.			",113,38,0,76,2,0,3

												Dark Messiah received mixed reviews after its release. There are two camps it seems. There are those who get tired of all its bugs, poor programming, and loading times, and overall lack of polish, and hate the game. Then you have those who endure; stick with it despite its shortcomings and love the game. This is reflected on ModDB (Mod Database) where the game has an overall score of 9.5 out of 10 at the time of writing. Ironic then that the game doesn’t have much in the way of mods – only small ones which are more like fixes that aren’t highly publicised. But I can’t think why anyone would want to mod it actually. Because even though it is flawed (and completely bearable compared to the console version developed for the Xbox 360), it is a fantasy-themed action role-playing gamer’s dream come true. It couldn’t really be improved that much more gameplay wise if you tried. If you’re the type who ate up the likes of Diablo and its sequels, then you should probably try this. It's highly underrated.There’s a very good reason why it goes on my list of best games I’ve ever owned. Because it is a bloody blast to play. And that’s what really matters in the end.

												TL DR: Dark Messiah is a really great action game with solid gameplay which sometimes gets ridiculous with its use of physics, but it does force you out of stealth and into combat later on. Still, there's just an insane number of hilarious ways to kill things.Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is a first-person action game with some RPG elements developed by Arkane Studios and Floodgate Entertainment.In the game, you play as Sareth, the underling of a mage, in a quest to find a powerful item. The plot is pretty bad, with the only remotely funny thing about it being that there are two women constantly stroking your ego on proportions that the Half-Life 2 devs wish they had achieved. It's so much that I actually found it funny unlike Half-Life 2 which was plain annoying.Anyway, there are 10 levels, all mostly linear, though with some wide open spaces throughout. The game provides you with an extensive assortment of tools with which to murder you enemies (ghosting is also possible but not in the entirety of the game, as there are too many well-lit areas where you can't hide.) There's physics, weapons and magic. ""Wait, physics?"" Yes. Dark Messiah uses and abuses the Source Engine with weakly-supported structures whose weak supports can usually be brought down by sword, arrow or fireball. You also have a mighty kick which can be used against high drops and spikes to instantly kill enemies. Most objects are also grabbable and therefore throwable. You have a freeze spell and bow which when used on the ground can create a surface where enemies will slip and maybe fall to their deaths.By now some people already realized the amount of insanely entertaining♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do in this game and are playing it. Have fun!Apart from that, there's a great melee combat system. The direction of your movement affects the type of attack you can power up, and upgrading the Close Combat skill allows for charges, jump attacks and whirlwinds, bringing your number of attacks per weapon to seven. There's also an adrenaline meter which when full will mean your next attack is slow-mo and instantly kills and dismembers/beheads the enemy. The adrenaline meter also has special effects on each spell. You've also got bows, which can usually instantly kill with a well-placed headshot out of hiding (though the hitboxes are somewhat clunky), and even sometimes nail and enemy to the wall, which is pretty fun. There's also a rope bow like in the first two Thief games, which makes vertical exploration pretty fun. Weapons beyond the basic usually have skill requirements whch restrict you from equipping them.The aforementioned skill system is divided into Combat, Magic and Misc skills. You get skill points for completing objectives, which means you don't have to kill everyone for an optimal character. The amount of skill points lets you max out a skill tree and then more, though it's cooler to make a jack-of-all-trades kind of character. I started with a sneaky assassin (Archery and Stealth), and then started building more into open combat (Close Combat and Strength.) I managed to get through some areas undetected with wall-nailing headshots out of darkness, which was pretty cool. As for stealth, there is a meter indicating how well you are hidden but the parameters for being seen are never explained and sometimes it seems you're invisible in pretty light spots, which is strange.As fun as the game is, by chapter 9 I was already done with all the fun. I did finish the game but the repetitiveness of it was pretty evident, and the fact that chapter 9 does throw a lot of the same enemy at you at once, making it pretty hard to get through it without anything but straight close combat doesn't help. There's also not a huge variety of enemies in game, and by about half of the game you've seen all of them, even though that's compensated by the variety in killing methods that you have.Overall Dark Messiah is a pretty fun and silly game, and prefectly replayable if you don't feel you got enough on the first run.

Posted: November 29, 2016
												I first played Dark Messiah way back when it first came out and it's a game I have constantly revisited over the years.While I've sunk more hours total into any given Elder Scrolls game I've played, Dark Messiah by far holds my personal record of total completed playthroughs at too many to count but at least several dozen.I keep coming back to it to try out new skill/weapon combos and novelty character builds and keep finding new little hidden stuff even after years of replaying and knowing the game essentially by heart at this point.Therefore it's my personal nominee for the 2016 ""Test of time"" award.By the way, this review is solely for the single player part of the game. The multiplayer part was a publisher-mandated hackjob that nobody wanted and I don't think anybody ever played or mentioned ever, period. Except maybe to highlight unneccesary publisher-mandated multiplayer mode hackjobs that nobody asked for.On the technical side of things, Dark Messiah is an first-person action game in the fantasy setting of the turn based strategy games Heroes of Might and Magic, which I know bugger all about apart from this game.Not that you need to anyway, if you've consumed any sort of fantasy media in your life, you are familiar enough with the the setting.The game runs on Half Life 2's Source Engine and takes the same almost fetishistic joy in physics shenanigans and environment elements ready to be used to your advantage.To my friends I often semi-ironically refer to it as the best game ever made based solely on the fact that it's an ego-perspective game where you play an actual character with a full body rather than a floating pair of hands attached to an invisible hitbox.However this actually does hold some water. If you play other first-person games lacking full player character body after this, special mention going to Dishonored from the same studio (essentially an immensely watered down version of the stealth approach to gameplay in Dark Messiah, down to the same bugged up rope climbing controls), you'll see just how much immersion a full character model adds.The game has RPG elements, allowing you to earn and invest skill points rather freely into classic Fighter/Mage/Rogue skills to finetune your playstyle. I find nearly every character build to be viable although some are definitely more broken than others.There's several weapon classes (sword, daggers, combat staff, bow and arrow) with distinct combat differences, 10 spells (including Gravity Gun telekineses) many of which have additional or secondary functions (ice magic can freeze enemies as well as create slippery slopes on the floor if you feel like re-enacting Loony Toons routines with your enemies), stealth is almost always a possible option and then of course there's the environment kills and your almighty kick to the enemy's groin. You know what, I'm not even going to talk about those last two, just watch five minutes of a compilation on Youtube or something.""Class mixing"" is easily done and viable, but the real nice thing is that in any case one skill path doesn't neccessarily exclude you from anything else. Focusing on fighting also gives you access to decent daggers and staffs and the other way around, any build can use magic through collectable one-use-each scrolls, some weapons have magic extra effects, etc.The levels are varied and decently sized with tons of hidden areas and bonus objectives, although the route of plot progression in itself is rather linear.Speaking of plot, it's nothing special and about as unconventional and surprising as a harlequin romance novel.The game is definitely not without problems. While the most glaring ones from the early days have since been patched out there's still numerous bugs concerning crashes, glitching through walls, (occassional) framerate problems, save data not being found, exiting the game resulting in a crash which basically means you might as well exit through the Task Manager to begin with, and more. The entire reason I own this game on Steam is that in the original version there were some issues that were easiest resolved by re-installing which I ended up doing so often my disk just gave out (however, this in turn is just another point towards the game's immensely addicting qualities).The balancing can be wonky, weapon variety could be better and the sporadic platforming might turn some people off (being able to see your feet does help immensely though).At 5 bucks and even less when on sale it's an absolute steal for an unjustly forgotten gem of a game.Oh, one last thing:Everybody always talks about bad console-to-PC ports of games but if you ever want to see the reverse look no further than the horrendously butchered console version of this game. Damn, feels good to be PC Master Race.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has the best melee combat I've experienced, but it's also sad that no other game has gotten close after more than 10 years. I played this game with nothing but the sword and shield, because it was so much fun. Most youtube videos show people killing enemies using magic or the bow, which only goes to prove how many different play styles this game allows for. During the Steam Awards, I nominated this game in the ""choose your own category"" section for The Most Creatively Silly Gameplay Award (and wrote this review to get a badge :P), since this is truly a slapsticktastic game. You can make orcs fall on their asses using an ice spell focused on the ground. You can throw enemies around like puppets using the Telekinesis spell when your Adrenaline meter is full. You can throw barrels at them to knock them on their asses. If you get a kick out of that, also know that you can kick enemies. The only thing more ridiculous than all of that, is how replayable it is. I played the demo like 20 times and still didn't get tired of it. While the game isn't always great, the fun parts are really fun to revisit.			",70,15,0,11,1,0,0

												[h]Review for Dark Messiah of Might & Magic[/h1]  Game soon will be 10 years old and i can say that it has dated pretty good. Combat feels fluid, it's fun and doesn't feel repetitive. Story was okay, can't say it was amazing or bad, no it was simply good and interesting. Locations are very well made, there are ton of secrets which i absolutely loved, i wanted to check everywhere just to find something useful. There isn't much to tell about this game other then that you should play it for yourself. 15 hours of awesome combat, secret finding and playing 1 moment as assassin and other as mage or warrior is awesome.8 out of 10, aged well, recommended for those who want something short but nonetheless fun experience.

												A very good and very underrated game in my opinion! I bought Dark Messiah because it is a game related to one of my favorite strategy game franchises; Heroes of Might and Magic. The game itself does not much in common with the strategy ones, apart from the storyline, but the gameplay in general was really satisfying. The engine allows for some really neat mechanics and physics to be used (and even exploited in some situations) during combat, which is, for me, the best part of the game. The difficulty is trickier than some other first person RPGs I've played - in most situations you can't just click a button and slash through enemy lines, you have to utilize different strategies versus different enemy types. You have to take note of the environment and use it to your advantage! The story is mediocre, but an easy one to follow. There are a few choices you'd have to make and pick sides as the story progresses which I thought was a neat twist, but again it does not affect the game in a major aspect. I love this game, definitely recommending it!			",9,0,0,5,0,0,2

												Wow, I'm really glad I found this gem. I've had it on my wishlist for quite some time, but I had some leftover money, and I thought, hey, why not buy this game, it's really cheap! And oh my god it was worth it. The gameplay is really fun, the combat feels really nice. In RPG's I like going the magic route, but it is very hard in the beginning of the game, since you use up all your mana on one guy. And also if you don't go leveling one spesific skill-tree, the game can be really hard. But aside from that's it's pretty good. And sure the game can be buggy sometimes, and the story can be a little cringe worthy, it's still worth a buy. Oh and it's first person,  you can even see your arms, legs and body when you look down, which is astonishing from a game in 2006!			",183,27,0,15,10,2,3

												This game without a doubt has the best sword fighting in a game I have ever seen. There is a weight to the combat, and the enemies react in a believable way to getting hit and kicked. Arkane Studios is now known for Dishonored, but this game is completely incredible and should not be missed. It also has better sword combat than Dishonored. Kicking enemies off cliffs and into spikes does not get old. You will laugh endlessly when enemies fall through floors when you break them or set up other traps. The magic system works well too, and you don't have to be completely locked into just magic or just a melee character. An example of a spell, you can cast an ice spell to make enemies slip off cliffs or freeze them. The game also has stealth options that work pretty well. But again the real show is how well the sword system works. It just never gets old. I started playing this game in 2006, and have never stopped. I still can't believe how good it is. The storyline is good, and even if you haven't played the mainline Might and Magic games like me, you won't have trouble following the story. I can't find fault with any of the levels, they are fun to explore and by now, most of the bugs have been worked out. A non-issue with the game, is you will desperately want a sequel.

												Arkane Studios and Floodgate Entertainment basically took the Source Engine and decided to make a game around its physics capabilities. The game wants you to utilize the environment as much as possible. Spikes, traps, barrels, cliffs, cranes, you bloody name it, you can use it to kill someone. It's pretty great. Progressing through areas is generally* linear, but you've got options on how to tackle content. You're rewarded for completing story objectives, so if you want to utilize a build that's light on combat, you're more than welcome to do so. *certain segments of the game are on-rails events, which kinda suck.The game understands dungeon crawling very well. If you've got a keen eye for detail, you'll spot lots of secrets. They're fairly well hidden and well presented. There's a few non-secret things you won't really find unless you get two certain talents, which kinda detracts from the experience, but at least the devs made sure they weren't secrets. The story and voice acting is...there. It exists. Don't take it too seriously (but do pay attention because there's a few interesting quirks). Soak up the awesome dungeon and world A E S T H E T I C S and use the physics engine to cause mayhem. You'll occasionally encounter some platforming, which isn't really all that intuitive considering you're playing in first person. Quicksave like a champ.It's got one really dumb and odd peculiarity: in certain parts of the game you'll need to open doors and porticulli. This basically requires you to hold down your use button (default E) for like 30 seconds, if you move around or release it too soon you're screwed and need to start all over again. You just sit here holding a button down for like a half a minute staring at walls. Otherwise the game is a very solid and fun experience. Would recommend.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: I'm getting a lot of comments telling me this is not a ubisoft game, this is in fact an Arkane studios game. Apologies for the mix-upOne of the best games Arkane Studios ever made. The design of the weapons,armor,characters, and architecture are all beautifully done. This is the closest you will ever come to having a fantasy adventure, that being said the game doesn't hold your hand but in that way you become much more immersed.I always have an itch to come back and play this game from time to time and considering it's on sale at the time of this review it's well worth the asking price. This game is for people who want to take on that role of the daunting hero because it's hard but I've never played anything more immersive.

												I've played this game about a dozen times (not in my account I've played on my brother's PC and his account when he was in the army). This is the first game I ever saw a creative use of the environment. You can pick up a barrel and throw it at the enemies and make them fall or you can kick them on a fire and they get set aflame. The possibilities are endless (well not endless but there are a ton of things you can try). There is a large variety of skill and spells that you can pick up that increase replayability. Unfortunatelly it's not an open world game but there are a lot of hidden areas you can find with cool weapons you'll find later			",50,3,0,9,0,0,0

												Sure, the combat is loose and floaty. You can't really tell when any particular piece of steel of your own or that your enemy's is going to make contact. But that's not your primary ammunition -- it's your leg.They picked the right physics engine, because while the ornate traps they tried to create may have fallen flat, watching an orc's rag doll physics model tumble down a flight of stairs or off a cliff, is enough to forgive any faults in the game.And I've never kicked an orc down a flight of stairs in such beautiful, lush environments -- the graphics have aged well and still convey a sense of mystery and wonder.Conversely, the entirety of the story and its artifically branched endings feel bland and tacked on (particularly so for an RPG-ish title). But as I kick another orc off a mountain, I realize.. I just can't say mad.			",1046,485,27,120,92,10,178

												One of the most fluid combat mechanics in all of first person sword fighting games, its better than 90% of games that are out today, even games like Skyrim, Chivalry, etc. Graphics are not like Crysis but are a 8/10 probably a 10 in 2006. Physics in game are amazing, I remember playing this on my 1024x768 monitor on low/medium graphics, oh man those were the times. The story and voice acting are cliche, like 90% of stuff was back then, you might get irritated by it now, but the combat just makes all the negative stuff dissapear, at least for me! This game is amazing! What are you waiting, buy it. COME ON! BUY IT!			",148,16,7,26,11,2,15

												Really REALLY good, like seriously good. Probably one of the best games I've played in quite a while.Do you like swords and high action combat?Did you enjoy Dishonored but didn't like how the game chastised you for killing people?Do you like paper thin plots that allow you to get to the action quicker?Do you like Ignoring weapons and using physics objects to kill people?Do you like kicking people off of cliffs?Then I've got the game for you, right here, this one.The swordplay is by far the best in any game I've ever seen, its very similar to Dishonored's swordplay (same devs) but it feels a lot more satisfying, and you can also throw almost every object in the world to completely ignore that great swordplay, also kicking, lots and lots of kicking. If there would be any comparison to make, Imagine thief, but with dark souls levels of combat, in first person. That is this game, this game right here, so good, so very very good.On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it an 8.5, while the gameplay is really, really good, it doesn't give you quite enough downtime to make the mechanics not feel stale after a while. Also enemy variety is sorely lacking.(enemy with sword, enemy with sword and shield, archer, zombie, mage, faster zombie and spiders.) There's a few neat boss monsters, and by a few I mean like 3, despite there being 6ish boss fights in the game, meaning that they get re-used often (I swear i've fought 4 cyclopses by now, once you figure out that only their head takes damage, the fight gets a little less epic. Also the plot is almost complete garbage, the only meaningful choice you get is one where you decide on whether or not you want to use a demon form (useless outside of very narrow circumstances) or a SLIGHTLY better sword than the one you already have.There's a perk based leveling system in the game that gets in the way of having fun more than it helps, you have to UNLOCK the ability to do a jumping attack, which is literally you just holding your sword upwards and slashing down. You may as well just give yourself all the upgrades at the beggining with cheats. Besides those two things, the games is pretty much perfect. All the maps are neat and unique (although the ""orc tunnels go on a little longer than I would have liked) and up until the very end you're going through a very nice dungeon crawl.So yeah, this is a good game, pick it up when you can, even if you have to wait for it to be on sale, it's worth it.

Hail to the king, baby!No, it's not Duke Nukem, but the second-most mighty boot in all of gaming.Join Sareth and companion - his size 12♥♥♥♥♥♥kickers - on an adventure to rid the land of evil, carried forth by kicking orcs from ledges, into burning pits, or into plentiful and strategically placed walls of spikes. So much orc kicking even Boromir came back from the dead and shed a tear.Released in 2006, Dark Messiah takes full advantage of the Source engine, giving us plenty of fun physics to play with. Anything and everything becomes a weapon; whether you throw around crates, push enemies into the path of a swinging chandelier or just make them one with the floor with a well-placed freeze spell. Nine years later, it's a wonder why not more developers have taken advantage of this type of combat system.The typical RPG archtypes are all here, whether you choose to play as sword and board warrior, dress-wearing wizard, or♥♥♥♥♥♥ass thief. The skill tree keeps things fresh and gives you some variety as you progress. Unfortunately for the Elder Scrolls fans, there is not enough skill points to allow you to be proficient in everything, meaning you will have to plan your playstyle out in advance and stick with it.The plot is fleshed out well enough, but won't win any awards in storytelling. The combat is exciting yet frustrating as you load save for the tenth time trying to hack your way through another difficult bottleneck. The multiplayer aspect is unfortunately almost non-existant.If you've got a few bucks to spend when this game goes on sale, it is a highly worthwhile title worthy of multiple playthroughs.

												Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was an attempt to branch out the otherwise stagnant Might & Magic franchise, and it should be remembered as one of the better attempts by all of those that played a little of Might & Magic's foray into the real time strategy genre, now that was a bad idea if I ever saw one. It's a Source engine action RPG. Unlike the usual Might & Magic RPGs it takes a much more mainstream approach to just about everything and anybody that's play even a little of modern RPG's will quickly find themselves at ease with the simplicity of it all.Gone are the exploration and everything else that made Might & Magic unique. Only the name and some of the lore remains. Not that I am completely opposed to ignore part of the Might & Magic lore, I was never that excited about the whole space aliens bit. Unfortunately this leaves the game feeling shallow. It's a game that saw what everyone else was doing and thought, ""Hey, me too!"".In terms of gameplay Dark Messiah is the worlds most premiere kicking simulator. It's an odd thing really, Dark Messiah has weapons, skills and magic but you'll find yourself using nothing but your boot to dispatch the vast majority of foes. The harder the difficulty is turned up the easier and more tempting it becomes to kick your enemies into spikes and off ledges simply because it's an instakill maneuver more often than not and your weapons and magic will never be able to match it for damage except in that extremely rare location where there is no environmental hazards to kick enemies into.The storyline is fairly decent, a little predictable at times but nothing worth complaining about. There is a pretend storyline choice or two that does have a little impact so that helps greatly.In terms of graphics and sounds it's the source engine and that all comes down to style and Dark Messiah falls squarely into the ""Okay"" range. Nothing too impressive but nothing that'll ruin your experience either. You'll never be in awe of it but you'll never get annoyed with it either.The multi-player component is fairly decent although it was always a graveyard so without friends it was impossible to play.Besides all the kicking Dark Messiah ranks as a not too bad game. It does nothing stellar, it doesn't even try to, but it does provide a decent enough experience that it's worth it to play through the once. And if you're feeling particularly feisty, you can challenge yourself by making a hard ""No-Kicking"" playthrough and watch the difficulty skyrocket.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												2006, arguably the heyday of PC gaming. Few first-person games got the mechanics so right as Dark Messiah did.  Built on the Source Engine, it pulls everything Half Life 2 had going for it into itself.- You have a body visible in first-person view! Look down! I have feet!- Telekinesis allows for ""gravity gun"" fun! And other spells for messing with the locals!- Duke Nukem's Mighty Boot, for punting Goblins off cliffs to your delight! Ahhh the screams!- The Rope Bow! When most games were consigned to stairs and ladders, you could go anywhere!*- Scripted events done right! With huge monsters and huge weapons!- Combat any way you want! Stealth, magic, a massive sword! Did I mention the Mighty Boot??-Mild RPG elements like upgrading your weapons/armour and spending skill points in skill trees (more like Bonsai trees, but still fun!)- Be Good or Evil! Multiple endings based on your choices throughout the game!- First-Person combat unmatched before or since! This is how the Elder Scrolls should have done it!!! Watch the vids, kids!Pros:LOTS! (It's five bucks as of this review too!)Cons:A matter of opinion. Find them all! Don't forget your jaded self is living 10 years into this game's existence. Everything seen here was first!** Full disclosure: I owned this game before it came to Steam and have a couple hundred hours in it through three playthroughs...TL;DR? No it isn't!

You can use a bow for ranged combat, daggers for close and stealthy kills, a staff, or you could use the classic Sword and Shield. Or a 2 handed sword. Whatever you like, it's your skills to choose.In the story there are some optional quests that you can complete. And you will also find yourself in places where you have to make a choice which changes the story (and not in a poor way).Great game for a cheap price. 10/10 ",80,1,0,2,5,0,6

												The core first-person melee combat is incredibly solid and the exploration, storytelling, and character growth are integrated brilliantly to create a unique and compelling experience.You won't remember Dark Messiah's busty-woman character guide, but you will remember the sheer joy of mutilating the orcish, undead and assorted monstrous hordes in a variety of imaginative ways. When mass slaughter is as imaginative as this, it can't help but be memorable.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												A well made first person hack-and-cast that will make you play through it again and again just to find out how many ways you can kill ""that one goblin"" with the enviroment. Eviroment kills, Ragdolls, Magic, Secret treasure, and the most usefull tool in any game; the Rope Bow. This game will keep it form getting dull even after years with its fast pace combat, magic, and stealth to get you through the interactive story line.Edit: Ten years later and still waiting for a game to have a combat-cast system up to this game's standards.

												Admit it, how many times you wished to explore every single nook and cranny even in a linear game, but the game itself stopped you from doing just that?How many times you wished to just behead your enemy and then kick their head around like a football? Pick them up with Telekinesis, then just toss them straight up, relishing in their screams? Having Sword Clashes (""Contests of Might"" in game language) where the enemy gets Disarmed if you win and yet they still try to fight you using only their bare fists? Freezing up the floor in front of the enemy and then watch them just slip and fall with absolutely no grace?Making friends out of Goblins and even an ORC as long as you don`t hurt them?Then this game is for you. Maybe it`s linear and still has its own share of glitches, especially if you tend to ""sequence-break"", which will happen a lot if you absolutely despise escort NPCs, but the combat system, interactive surroundings (throw rocks, ignite patches of oil, break barrels, trigger traps and more!) and a big replayability factor all make up for it. A fair warning for players that absolutely despise crypt levels tho, this game is LOADED with those and since we also acquire the Rope Bow as well as Master Thief outfit, the latter demanding your character to be the ultimate sneaking machine, you probably know which game franchise is being referenced there. ;) :,D Only that in this game, we can shoot heads off the undead with a single arrow if being skilled enough, ha ha ha! >:DAbsolute classic and a must-have game to play, even if it`s only 10 years old nowadays when compared to its older spiritual predecessors like Arx Fatalis. Too bad its Multiplayer part is pretty much dead tho, but well, some things just cannot stand without help from the devs and anti-hacker protection. :(			",18,2,0,1,2,0,1

												When this game was released then i haven't good enough hardware to play it so I have finally started with this game in 2014 after I saw it in some sale here...quite long time after release and I was surprised that the original game mechanics still works so great and this game have still (to this date) incredible versatile, catchy gameplay and freedome of choice how to solve combat issues (i liked most to use physics & environment) and its fun that it's actually much much better than most of recent first person FPS/RPG like shooters.

												The best first person combat in an RPG to date. The best first person dungeon crawling to date. While games like the Elder Scrolls series focus on developing a large sandbox to explore, Dark Messiah presents a a narratively linear, but focused experience. This is what traversing a D&D style dungeon should feel like, though the alternate paths within individual levels are few and rarely break far from one another.Not the best overall RPG by a long shot, but it really knocks the viscerall aspects of play out of the park. More than worth your time and money.			",375,65,2,41,28,4,36

												Well worth picking up on sale, as the combat is enjoyable, though it gets repetitive. The story is ok, though the 'big reveal' was rather easy to see coming. Also, I had a lot of issues with the game crashing - not sure if its because I was using Win10 or because the game is buggy. Overall I enjoyed the game and feel it is well worth picking up while its on sale.			",443,95,10,76,44,6,65

												The most under-rated game of its time. This game was released shortly after Half-Life 2 and uses the Source engine. When it was first released it had a few bugs and was given horrible reviews, also partially because apparently back then games were expected to have their own custom engine and this one used Source, obviously a problem of the past these days. Within a month the developers had all of those bugs fixed and unfortunately it never got the following it deserved. Perhaps partially due to their releasing it earlier than it should have been.What makes this game special is its melee combat system. There are 3 combat types, melee (broken into sword & shield, sword, daggers, and ""other""), archery, and magic. Other first person games have probably done better in archery and maybe magic, although I haven't seen any to that effect. It pains me that other game developers haven't taken this game's mechanics into consideration for their more mainstream titles. Skyrim for example has a system which appears as similar, but ultimately an incomplete and bad copy of DMoM&M. Since if you're reading reviews you probably haven't played it yet, so I'll just say get this game. It's one of the funnest games I've ever experienced, and the replayability is very quality due to its different archetypes, all of which hold their own. Plus, special rewards for exploring the environment fully, a hard mode that doesn't rely on luck to beat, and some crazy weapons that will make you say ""I can't wait to go back through and play as someone who can use this"" if you resist the urge to look through guides beforehand.When you're done with a few play-throughs and explore each of the unique endings, you should start trying some of the cheats. Using adrenaline telekenesis to toss soldiers (Usually Duncan) 500ft straight up in the air is maybe the funniest thing I've ever seen (or heard) in a game. Also highly recommended is pitting NPCs against each other and seeing who wins. Not cheating, but another one of my favorite things to do is see how many people in Stonehelm I can backstab without anyone noticing.Over a hundred hours of fun can easily be had in this game.

 Dark Messiah of Might & Magic Developed by Arkane Studios, the game runs on a modified version of the Source engine; the famed engine that powered Half-Life 2 and its episodes. As much as the world of Ashan is fairly predictable fantasy fare, the game itself plays a lot like your typical Elder Scrolls game.  Physics-based environments are heavily emphasized - far more so than even Bethesda's Oblivion. The puzzles are far better implemented and occur much more often. That said, beyond the physics, few other comparisons to Oblivion hold water. Unsurprisingly, Dark Messiah sticks to a fairly linear plotline. This is no bad thing since, in the space of twelve lengthy chapters, the pacing rarely wanes and you're never stuck pondering your next objective.  Story: The story explores the well-trodden, 'recover the mystical artifact for your mentor who may not be all that he seems' scenario. The heroic player, Sareth, is an orphan raised by the mysterious Phenrig. A magician who fuses Sareth with a decidedly kinky guardian entity, Xana, and vests him with a mission to recover te Skull of Shadows. Of course, like a good book, the story takes a turn for the worse for poor Sareth.The Sareth/Xana relationship is pretty entertaining. She is effectively a jaded voice in Sareth's head, acting as an occasional hint-giver and guiding him on the path to his objectives. Beyond this, there's her oft-spoken allusions towards rewards of a sexual nature and her constant jealousy of Leanna a Witch in training. She is the obvious love interest whom you'll be spending plenty of quality time with by the end of the game. Gameplay It's not surprising in the slightest that the latest iteration of the Might and Magic series draws heavily from multiple sources both book and game alike.Thankfully, the adoption of a first-person perspective makes for a wholly absorbing experience, and the clever integration of several different skills trees for each class and some unique gameplay features keeps Dark Messiah feeling fresh and genuinely exciting years after the games launch. Puzzles-wise, many of the game's more thoughtful and interesting moments are cleverly scripted. A rooftop chase sequence early in the game is fast and just precarious enough to be thrilling without becoming aggrovating. In pursuing a scurrying Gollum-like creature in pursuit of a key quest item, you have mere moments to scramble across awnings and through open windows in a deft combination of platforming skills and problem-solving. Autosaving is very well implemented too - saving at key moments to avoid bouts of severe frustration. Multiplayer In addition to the single-player, there's a decent multiplayer mode to Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and it's fairly different from the campaign. Here, you can choose from different character classes and go into battle via a few different modes. Deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag all work as expected.The crusade mode provides a bit more depth than the other modes. This is a humans versus undead mode that uses respawn tickets and control points, similar to something like Warcraft's Arathi Basin battleground or Team Fortress 2's CP_Dustbowl gamemode. The game's multiplayer maps are connected in crusade, so if you win a map, you move one map closer to the opposing team's home base. You also gain experience points and levels in this mode, and each time you level up, you can assign skill points to enhance your abilities like World of Warcraft.You can switch classes each time you spawn, so if you're tired of clashing swords as a warrior, you can switch to a more projectile-based character, like a mage or an archer. Priestesses can heal and resurrect players, and the assassin acts as a standard MMO stealth character. Experience points carry over from one map to the next, provided you stay connected to the same server. Sadly, the only way to connect to servers nowadays is by inputing the IP adress into the command console using the ""Connect"" command found in most source games... Verdict: 9.4 / 10 	Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is a decent game, it has awesome multiplayer and a decent story filled with content.It may be completed in a matter of 6-12 hours, but the multiplayer is what has kept the game alive since Launch both on Xbox and on PC.

												I never played this game back in '06, but I picked it up a few days ago and started on Hardcore difficulty. Immediately I was amazed at how fluid the combat felt for such an old game, even surpassing many recent titles of the past few years. You have different attacks for what you choose - magic, sword, staff, bow or daggers and each have their strengths and weaknesses. You can also block, do finishing blows and kick opponents into traps like fire pits, spike pits and off cliffs.This is an Action-RPG in first-person perspective. You are within the Might & Magic universe and it is gloriously wicked. Fight spiders, skeletons, ghouls, goblins, trolls, orcs, zombies, dragons, demons. It is insane. Also insanely hard.You earn skill points to spend on a skill tree, which is where the replayability comes in. There is no new game plus, however I highly recommend you focus on maxing one style of fighting that way you have a reason to play again. I am focusing on upgrading my magic. It is very punishing for mages.10/10With today's standards it still holds up. It holds up hard.			",176,8,2,13,3,3,8

												Arkane - the guys that brought You Arx Fatalis, and later Dishonored, probably have the best mappers in the industry. Dark Messiah is a fantasy FPS/slasher, like Heretic 2 or Thief; with a RPG tree and simply crafting. There are 3 main strategies of combat: backstabbing, slicing and roasting. One minus: magic is strong at the beginning, and disappointing as You progress. What it does really well is flow; feeling and pacing - I personally believe it is better, or same as good as in Half Life 2. Vertical maps, rope bow, demon ladies, huge spiders, arson, Kick In The Face® attack... what You would need more. I played it many, many times, and it is still quite fun.			",275,90,7,36,17,4,44

												The storyline is more annoying than anything, though I guess it might not be bad if you've never read a book before. The scenery is pretty cool, but the real reason to play this game is the combat. You feel a lot more in control of the combat than in most similar games, and instead of trying to just get by a group of enemies I find myself playing the same battles again and trying different strategies. The fact that the damage you so is different depending on where on your enemies body you hit (Head shots do massive damage, esp. with a bow.) is great. And the skill purchasing trees as opposed to classes is great too. I wasn't very impressed with most of the magic though.The biggest problem with this game? It is hard to go back to the pathetic combat systems of many other games after so much freedom and control.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having played all the other Might and Magic (M&M) titles (Heroes included) I'm ashamed I haven't played this until today. It's definitely a game that fully deserves to bare the title of a M&M game. It's a first person RPG very similar to Dragon's Age (DA), obvioulsy this game is much older than DA thus not as polished and big. One thing I would love to have in this game are side quests in open-world manner and more interactivity with random NPCs. Dark Messiah focuses on first person combat and does it wonderfully, whether you decided to use Magic and toast your enemies with fireballs or masterfully slice your enemies with daggers or even go the third route and simply toss boxes, kick enemies into spikes and use various in-game objects to kill them, the combat will make you love this game. If I was writing this review upon the release of the game I would rate it 10/10, for today's standards in RPG games I rate it 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Learn Magic spells, find weapons, prepare to battle mercenaries, bandits, ghouls, and much more. Dark Messiah uses the valve Source engine, which was cutting edge in it's time, allowing you to battle through multiple levels in both Melee and Spell-based combat. The story seems interesting and despite the age, I would recommend it.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												In ages past an RPG either distinguished itself by exceptional story or by great customization. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic does neither of those very well, and I doesn't need to. Dark Messiah's strength is in its gameplay and level-design, its freedom of choice in the completion of challenges set before you. Dark Messiah sports possibly the best melee combat in any First Person game to date and supplements it with a wide variety of environmental interaction.Impaling your enemies on spikes, chopping their limbs off, burning them to a crisp or making them slip on ice, a smart player has full control over the battlefield. Every approach is viable, every environment suited to take on foes in different and interesting ways. You can master Archery, Melee, Stealth and Magic to become a force to be reckonned with.Of course nothing comes without flaws and with Dark Messiah it is unfortunately the engine which often crashes or produces (often hillarious) glitches. Still, if you are looking for a game that will challenge your creativity and mastery, this game is for you.In the realm of content the game provides around 6-8 hours of gameplay time depending on how vigorously you explore the levels and their branching paths and secrets. The story, while nothing to write home about, with a twist telegraphed from miles away, is enjoyable in a corny adventure B-Movie way. Anyone that ever took part in a pen and paper tabletop will enjoy it as a throwback. Furthermore, it never gets in the way, the cinematics are kept to a minimum and never interrupt gameplay for longer than a couple of seconds. Dark Messiah is all about good old fun through gameplay, no carrots on a stick, no grinding and no pretension to be something more than it is.Don't be fooled, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic might be old, but it is classic worth both your time and the price of admission.---Read more game reviews, news and editorials at gatheryourparty.com ",128,10,1,16,8,0,11

												There's something in the back of my head that says Dark Messiah Might and Magic shouldn't be that good for what it is, but I've played through it multiple times and thoroughly enjoyed it each time. The story is decent, and the game handles nicely. The graphics are starting to look a little dated, but they're still passing pretty well considering the game is 6 years old now. Dark Messiah is immensly fun, but I wish they'd given the option to replay through the story on harder difficulty settings while keeping the abilities and gear from completing the game previously - it just feels like you only get to do the really cool stuff towards the end. It's worth replaying the single player to explore the different skill trees, but multiplayer is pretty much not worth bothering with - it doesn't feel at all like the single player, which is pretty disappointing. The bottom line? Buy this for the single player game and you're gonna have a fun hacking, slashing, smashing, and spell casting romp.			",507,127,7,26,23,2,37

												Another underrated game that wasnt so well received at the time but have many fans today, for the ones who played Arcane Studios previous title, Arx Fatalis, it comes to no surprise that Dark Messiah is improvement over that game it does many things right, like a story interesting enough to keep you attached to the game, complemented with a strong gameplay were you can choose your playstyle and build your character accordnaly, be it a Mage, Warrior or a stealth thief.Using the best of the source engine, the physics and gameplay mechanics help the immersion in the world of Dark Messiah, and voices actors did a good job to present the story with many turn arounds along the way.The game have good lenght, if you like to explore and find everything, you have something like 10 to 12 hours of entertainement, if you rush to it, i dont know but maybe 6h, never really tried it bc i just like the gameplay and always have blast playing it still today.Its a must for lovers of the genre and also a nice way the see how a developer improved his works over time until their last work that was Dishonored.

												This game is awesome !!!! BUY it when 75% definately !! The melee combat and such are awesome and lots of types of weaponry. Lightning, fire, poison, it's all there !!! The only bad thing might be the not so challenging boss fights because you can defeat the monsters from far away not having to do any close encounter ( apart from the spiders :p ). The ending wasnt that hard too but the game and storyline is pretty awesome. If you like RPG or oldschool games like Hexen, Heretic you probably will like playing this too !!! Arkane done a great job on this version of SOURCE engine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another underrated game that wasnt so well received at the time but have many fans today, for the ones who played Arcane Studios previous title, Arx Fatalis, it comes to no surprise that Dark Messiah is improvement over that game it does many things right, like a story interesting enough to keep you attached to the game, complemented with a strong gameplay were you can choose your playstyle and build your character accordnaly, be it a Mage, Warrior or a stealth thief.Using the best of the source engine, the physics and gameplay mechanics help the immersion in the world of Dark Messiah, and voices actors did a good job to present the story with many turn arounds along the way.The game have good lenght, if you like to explore and find everything, you have something like 10 to 12 hours of entertainement, if you rush to it, i dont know but maybe 6h, never really tried it bc i just like the gameplay and always have blast playing it still today.Its a must for lovers of the genre and also a nice way the see how a developer improved his works over time until their last work that was Dishonored.

												This is a good game with some great ideas. I love kicking and shoving enemies into spiked traps, or off high cliffs. Odd that all those spikey doors are laying about to take advantage of, though.My only complaint: DMMaM does not quite live up to the ""play it your way"" promise. I tried, really tried, to play as a stealth-based character. There are spots in the game, though, where you must win in arena-style combat. The only way to succeed as a thief was to game the A.I. and kite with arrows. Not realistic, not satisfying.Also, please note, there is no ""of"" in the title of this game. It drives me crazy how often i see, even at professional game review sites, this game called ""Dark messiah OF Might and Magic."" WTF?Still, this game is a lot of fun and a good value.

												Definately not a traditional Might and Magic game, this first-person boot-of-awesome simulator is an enjoyable game. While the multiplayer is pretty lame, the singleplayer campaign is interesting enought that a run or two through can prove to be enjoyable, especially when your epic boot of ragdolling is introduced into the mix.A simple kick forward can result in enemies stumbling back into various hazards such as fire or spikes, all of which are amazingly hilarious to use. A mediocre game, but still enjoyable to those that won't take it seriously and don't have strong ties to the Might and Magic series.			",653,134,32,120,86,3,104

												It's easy to see why people enjoy Dark Messiah of Might & Magic so much. The gameplay, although linear, is pretty impressive once you get into any form of combat. The combat in Dark Messiah not only involves just magic and basic weapons, but also the enviroment; thus making any fight pretty creative. Want to kick someone into the spikes? Go for it. Want to knock someone off a balcony? Have at it. Want to hit someone so hard that they get closelined by a wooden beam, thus causing them to flip and land on their neck? This game allows you to do that.Dark Messiah is a crowd pleaser. Definitely pick up this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is an awesome First Person RPG filled with tons of action, a decent storyline, great graphics using the Source engine and loaded with fun-filled combat. The campaign is pretty lengthy at ~10 hours long with fully voiced NPCs and cutscenes. As you complete the primary and optional objectives you are given skill points to allocate in 3 different areas and it also allows the player to play a certain playstyle/class: fighter, mage or rogue. The combat is pretty awesome with some in depth actions (for example the sword has multiple ways to attack) and you have the ability to kick enemies off of ledges, into each other or into traps. There are also loads of unique items in the game, such as the all mighty Sword of Dragonclaw and the Lightning Shield and also the Earthfire Sword & Shield combo; most of these items are also hidden in the various secrets areas in every level. For fans of first person games or RPGs this is a must play, it's a polished and truly well made game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dak messhia is a game made in the source engine. THe same engine that powers Half-life 2 and portal 1-2.With this in mind why the f*ck havent you picked it up allready.This is a game with infintive replayability wich means its a sandbox filled with toys.Other games that are sandboxes filed with toys include Darksouls, Terraria, Fallout.Thats right what you are thinking now is ""WTF THOSE GAMES WHERE GREAT!"" And thats what im saying.This game played on the heroic difficulty is like playing the thief games but all guards are immortal zombies, If they see you you are dead, And if you fight back they just rofl over you. HOwever if you get in to backstab ooo the feeling is undescribeble. THats why there is no other stelth game like this.BUt wait stelth you dont like stelth well dont worry the magic system is like Skyrim's if Skyrims was good. In Dark Messhia you can put an ice blast on the floor and aggrooed enemies will slip when they charge you. In Dark Messhia you can throw bottels of oil on the flooor behind the ice and ignite it with a fireball.But wait you hate magic you are all about the bow well let me tell you about the last time I Played,So I was an archer with a nef found elven bow and I was protecting this gangplank. enemies where charging from the docks. And i said Screw it and charge to. TO my suprise you can RUN WHILE FIERNING THE BOW LIKE FUICKING LEGOLAS. Dark messhia is the first first person shooter in witch you can fire a bow and run atr the same time. Also if yopu hold the notched arrow over fire it will ignite. Mayby that was the fire you started with thet fireball. INFINITIVE REPLAYABPIELITY,""Hang on I hate bows magic and sneaking What is there for me?"" There is nothing im sorry  :( If you play this game with sword and shield you will not see anyting sure you can walk around and throw barrels at people then when they stagger up you can kikc them into a spiky wall or fire, But you will never see the backstab animation or the throwing dagger adrernmain rtusj I'm getting tired.GET THIS GAME 5/5 Mib stars			",138,10,3,14,9,0,15

												Fantasy done properly: daggers, swords, bows, magic, creatures, demons, spiders, caves, castles, dragons, orcs, the undead... and bad Demon trying to rule the world.3 classes, various weapons, various skills - all those allow different approach to combat. Set in fantasy world on a quest to save the world from supreme evil - yeah, standard thing, but does job well. Gameplay is great and combat is very satysfying. Game offers multiple playthroughs (3 classes+skill choices) followed by even more playthroughs due to choices made during story (4 endings). In the end you can beat this game many times and experience something new. If you like fantasy setting and playing as mage/warrior/archer/thief (you can mix classes with skills to create a hybrid character) then it is a good choice. You visit caves, castles, towns - generally areas specific to medieval/fantasy worlds. Levels offer diversity in terms of setting and obstacles as well as approach to combat. Sometiemes they have interesting features that change gameplay or are simply quite original (Big Worm as an example).It all sounds like a cliche, but the game leaves a very good impression overall. Too bad it was forgotten. Gameplay/Combat is fluid. Surrounding vary and are never boring. It is a very solid title overall. It feels complete and the theme is consistent.Audio-visuals are strong with this one. Graphics are nice and voice-acting is good. Performance is solid. Music matches the atmosphere.

												What drew me into Dark Messiah was that it seemed like an Elder Scrolls clone without the massive time commitment. In my days of youth, I recall repeatedly playing the demo. When I finally got my hands on a full copy of this game, I was more than enthused to take it for a spin.Dark Messiah boasts a wonderful melee combat system and forces the player to think tactically. Rushing into a room with even two or three enemies will result in certain death. As you level up, you can invest points into your typical RPG attributes: melee, ranged, magic, and stealth combat. Diversity and replayability are certainly present.Unfortunately, the game's difficulty encourages cheap tactics such as kicking enemies over ledges or into traps, resulting in instant kills. The user interface is occasionally unresponsive, making switching weapons or casting spells a royal pain. Furthermore, mages will also find themselves lacking enough hotkeys to fit arsenal.This is a bargain bin game.Grade: C			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												I would recommend this game to both shooter and RPG fans. The gameplay is a bit hard, but it's never boring, if you start playing, you won't stop until the end of the game. While the gameplay of many other RPGs depends on characteristics of your character, player's real skill is very important in DMMM. This game doesn't even have character levels. Graphics are on par with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (while the game was made 5 years before Skyrim), sometimes even better, because the game is linear, and developers could spend more resources on improving certain locations; sound effects are pretty good. There are some bugs like getting stuck between objects and inability to jump off a rope when there's another rope nearly, but they're not very critical. The only bad thing about this game is multiplayer. While multiplayer gameplay is fine, it is very laggy. 9/10.			",296,32,7,16,27,1,20

An unusual setting and general plot, one very endearing character (talking about Xana, of course) and an interesting take on the general ""save the world from bad guys"" story. Graphics have aged decently well and the story, while not too long, at least has the merit of not being riddled with worthless sidequests like so many RPGs (""Go waste an hour killing 50 wild boars"") and being replayable up to three times if you really want to see everything.Recommended especially since the price is fairly low now.

Something for all your nefarious (kicking) needsI never knew this game existed until I found it by chance one day ago. Thought I'd pick it up, because it looked interesting, I gathered that the melee combat was good, and I'm currently very curious about first-person melee combat.Nine hours later, it was already evening. I'd binged through most of the whole thing, and had to stop only because of biological needs and because my eyes were stinging. Rarely have I seen them be so bloodshot...This game comes quite close to what I'd like to make, if I had a team of artists at my disposal. The graphics are very pretty, though of course, the game is ten years old at the time of writing of this review, and beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Still, the HDR lighting in particular makes an astonishing difference, and the whole things looks really nice at maximum quality.The story is... adequate. It's certainly nothing groundbreaking, and I had a feeling that I've already played this game, despite the fact that I never have. That may have been a result of the story.It's worth mentioning that this game feels like some sort of Tomb Raider mixed with the new Thief game (the one from 2014). The protagonist is a gluttonous kleptomaniac with a berry juice addiction, who spends most of his time raiding tombs. Aside from that, we've got demon kings, ancient artefacts, necromancer armies... and, of course, all of it ended with a dragon, as is standard for the budget fantasy genre.It really does remind me of a budget fantasy film... But I really love that sort of thing, so I enjoyed it.I should also say that the ""big twist"" of the story actually caught me by surprise. I wasn't expecting that to happen.It's also got a voiced protagonist (though no dialogue choices), something which I very much prefer, so extra points for that.The characters are standard - nothing quite memorable in that department - and the voice acting is... delicious. It's not ""great"", but I like it. You can guess whether the character is good or evil based on voice alone. Ain't that a good thing?The gameplay is quite interesting as well. The melee combat is quite well executed, though magic and switching between the two is slughtly clunky by today's standards (or at least my standards). As usual, the player is presented with different playstyle options: sword-and-board combat, archery, magic and stealth. However, you can always do all of them, and aren't necessarily limited to one, which is very nice - some situations are naturally better solved with some tools rather than others.I personally went for a build that emphasised stealth and marksmanship. They both start off pretty weak, but stealth ends up completely broken in the endgame (Remember Chameleon 100% in Oblivion, anyone? It's sort of like this, but with actual backstab mechanics that aren't dreadful).Furthermore, enemies are prone to parrying most of your swings and dealing too much damage to you, so direct combat is more effort than necessary.I can't not mention the kick. Kicking is your best friend, because of the point above, and because there's precarious ledges and walls of spikes everywhere. When it works properly, you can propel enemies backward, and literally send them flying. It feels extremely satisfying. If you like the power fantasy type of games - Far Cry 3/4's broken takedown mechanics come to mind - then you'll probably enjoy the combat here... Kicking, that is. Note that it's not as overpowered as the knife in said Far Cries, because you can still die in three hits, and your kicking stamina is limited, but it's still pretty enjoyable.The sound is fantastic. Except the thundering footsteps that are loud even when you're supposed to be sneaking. But aside from that, I really enjoyed the sound. The ambience is very atmospheric when it wants to be, and some combat tracks were brilliant. Sounds in general were also on par.Some other things worth mentioning:- The goblins in this game are great, and I absolutely loved them. Their banter is hilarious, including the in-combat quotes, and slauthering them was so fun that I'm slightly worried to admit it. Unfortunately, there was too little goblins throughout.- The first-person full-body-awareness thing this game has going on is sometimes exceptionally glitchy, but it's not fatal. Still, it's a bit awkward to have your knees clip through your face when you're running up a steep staircase... but fortunately, that rarely happens.Conclusion: May I have some more, please?Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is a well-made, if not very polished game. It's aged quite well (your opinions may vary), except a few things that I'd personally change, mostly related to the inventory.The combat is satisfying, and the story isn't too bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would have very much liked it if additional campaigns or expansions existed.I thoroughly recommend it. It's worth at least a single playthrough, if not more, and the ratio of value to price is big. I got my copy for less than £3.50, so I can't complain on that front.Final rating: 7.5 Pao-Kais out of 10 Pao-Kais. ",10,0,0,1,0,0,2

												Underrated game. An unusual setting and general plot, one very endearing character (talking about Xana, of course) and an interesting take on the general ""save the world from bad guys"" story. Graphics have aged decently well and the story, while not too long, at least has the merit of not being riddled with worthless sidequests like so many RPGs (""Go waste an hour killing 50 wild boars"") and being replayable up to three times if you really want to see everything.Recommended especially since the price is fairly low now.

												I would recommend this game to both shooter and RPG fans. The gameplay is a bit hard, but it's never boring, if you start playing, you won't stop until the end of the game. While the gameplay of many other RPGs depends on characteristics of your character, player's real skill is very important in DMMM. This game doesn't even have character levels. Graphics are on par with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (while the game was made 5 years before Skyrim), sometimes even better, because the game is linear, and developers could spend more resources on improving certain locations; sound effects are pretty good. There are some bugs like getting stuck between objects and inability to jump off a rope when there's another rope nearly, but they're not very critical. The only bad thing about this game is multiplayer. While multiplayer gameplay is fine, it is very laggy. 9/10.			",296,32,7,16,27,1,20

												What drew me into Dark Messiah was that it seemed like an Elder Scrolls clone without the massive time commitment. In my days of youth, I recall repeatedly playing the demo. When I finally got my hands on a full copy of this game, I was more than enthused to take it for a spin.Dark Messiah boasts a wonderful melee combat system and forces the player to think tactically. Rushing into a room with even two or three enemies will result in certain death. As you level up, you can invest points into your typical RPG attributes: melee, ranged, magic, and stealth combat. Diversity and replayability are certainly present.Unfortunately, the game's difficulty encourages cheap tactics such as kicking enemies over ledges or into traps, resulting in instant kills. The user interface is occasionally unresponsive, making switching weapons or casting spells a royal pain. Furthermore, mages will also find themselves lacking enough hotkeys to fit arsenal.This is a bargain bin game.Grade: C			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												For a game I've only recently heard about, this is one of my favorite games of the summer. The combat's far beyond anything you'd find in most RPGs, foregoing a weak-hitting numbers game in favor of physical, visceral combat. The kick button alone gets a lot of mileage from varied combat scenarios. A nice range of weapons, plenty of magic, and varied character progression give this game's 10-12 hour campaign a hefty amount of replay value. The story's forgettable, but the combat, presentation, and cool level design more than make up for it.The developer's currently working on Dishonored; if that looks good to you, then you'll probably appreciate this.

Something for all your nefarious (kicking) needsI never knew this game existed until I found it by chance one day ago. Thought I'd pick it up, because it looked interesting, I gathered that the melee combat was good, and I'm currently very curious about first-person melee combat.Nine hours later, it was already evening. I'd binged through most of the whole thing, and had to stop only because of biological needs and because my eyes were stinging. Rarely have I seen them be so bloodshot...This game comes quite close to what I'd like to make, if I had a team of artists at my disposal. The graphics are very pretty, though of course, the game is ten years old at the time of writing of this review, and beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Still, the HDR lighting in particular makes an astonishing difference, and the whole things looks really nice at maximum quality.The story is... adequate. It's certainly nothing groundbreaking, and I had a feeling that I've already played this game, despite the fact that I never have. That may have been a result of the story.It's worth mentioning that this game feels like some sort of Tomb Raider mixed with the new Thief game (the one from 2014). The protagonist is a gluttonous kleptomaniac with a berry juice addiction, who spends most of his time raiding tombs. Aside from that, we've got demon kings, ancient artefacts, necromancer armies... and, of course, all of it ended with a dragon, as is standard for the budget fantasy genre.It really does remind me of a budget fantasy film... But I really love that sort of thing, so I enjoyed it.I should also say that the ""big twist"" of the story actually caught me by surprise. I wasn't expecting that to happen.It's also got a voiced protagonist (though no dialogue choices), something which I very much prefer, so extra points for that.The characters are standard - nothing quite memorable in that department - and the voice acting is... delicious. It's not ""great"", but I like it. You can guess whether the character is good or evil based on voice alone. Ain't that a good thing?The gameplay is quite interesting as well. The melee combat is quite well executed, though magic and switching between the two is slughtly clunky by today's standards (or at least my standards). As usual, the player is presented with different playstyle options: sword-and-board combat, archery, magic and stealth. However, you can always do all of them, and aren't necessarily limited to one, which is very nice - some situations are naturally better solved with some tools rather than others.I personally went for a build that emphasised stealth and marksmanship. They both start off pretty weak, but stealth ends up completely broken in the endgame (Remember Chameleon 100% in Oblivion, anyone? It's sort of like this, but with actual backstab mechanics that aren't dreadful).Furthermore, enemies are prone to parrying most of your swings and dealing too much damage to you, so direct combat is more effort than necessary.I can't not mention the kick. Kicking is your best friend, because of the point above, and because there's precarious ledges and walls of spikes everywhere.

												I admit, Dark Messiah came as sort of a surprise for me. Absolutely fantastic level design that actually supports all three viable play styles (combat-magic-stealth) in equal measure, and first-person melee combat which is still one of the best ever made combined with lack of incessant hand holding inherent to video games these days - all come together in one amazing package that's only somewhat tarnished by its wonky AI and, at times, signature Source Engine animation clunkiness. Also, ""chewing the scenery"" doesn't even BEGIN to describe game's voice acting.			",906,388,16,192,89,8,171

												After replaying this initial source engine gem from 2006 it was VERY evident that Arkane Studios had basically overhauled the overall theme, setting, characters etc for Dishonored (Its in my very very fond games forever list) every ability nearly (magic) is straight out of the design works of this or that game; Arkane both uses DARK VISION (may have gotten the name wrong) as the first tier of that tree; it has Stealth Elements based on manouvering around; straight magic based combat (figure using Rats, or various combinations of them) and then the Sword and board (or whatever weapon you pick up) having bow and arrow feels like the crossbow in dishonored. A crossbow even more. If you use a shield ofcourse you can block - but hesterically enough 6 years prior to dishonored if you are using daggers or just a sword if you end up hitting at the same time; the same type of button mash prompt will apear to see who gets the ""break"" on the sword fight - ALSO same system is used to block an enemies weapon blows by hitting right click with a 1hsword / dagger by quickly parry blocking (same animation style as in dishonore) - Its basically Dishonored in the Might and Magic universe; without the ability to use the spell ""Blink"". :).

												This game is not like other games. Though the classes are lacking with only the assassin, wizard, and warrior, the game has an excelent use of making the player pay attention to his surroundings. For example, there is a platform with two weak beams supporting it. There is an enemy below it that you have just lured. You must break the beams, and the platform will fall resulting in the enemy to fall down and become vulnerable. There is much more to discover when you play this game. Like secrets you can find and mini bosses. The armor and weapons in the game are great, because they have different properties and damage ratings. To end it off, this game has many levels and lots of content for many hours! Even if you beat the game you can play from another class and it will feel like another game! These are just some of the reasons for getting this game.			",98,7,0,8,3,0,4

												I immediately thought about this game as my ""Test of time"" award pick. I have bought it when it came out and loved it, then I played it a few years ago to ""master"" it and it was still amazing. Few months ago I had some free time so I decided to come back and play a bit - which ended in a full playthrough. What makes this game stand the test of time so well is its amazingly satisfying combat system - especially on higher difficulty setting. It's brutal, fast paced, it requires you to use the enviroment and look out for your stamina. And I have to mention again - it's extremely satisfying. When you fight off a ghoul pack... dancing around like crazy, kicking, parrying, making the best out of opportunities to attack, trading off space around you for some time to regain stamina, trying not to get surrounded and looking for a good place to attack from... and then its over. Then you realise it was only a few seconds since the fight started and now you find yourself surrounded by corpes. The feeling is glorious. I will surely play this game again in some time.*MILD SPOILER* My favorite fight is the one where you enter the city, you find Duncan and then you have to fight a necromancer and a bunch of ghouls. Trying to keep Duncan alive in this fight on the high difficulty is so madly difficult, ghouls kill him in one hit if he doesn't manage to block and there are few waves of them, coming at you from different angles. It's very frustrating but also very satisfying whenever you find a way to get a bit closer to keeping Duncan alive. I should probably say that you don't have to keep him alive and it has 0 influence on the story... It actually seems like the SHOULD die here (your character says a line when he dies), but if you are determined enough, he can be saved. I mean... we like challenges, right? :D			",61,9,0,6,8,0,11

												A relic that doesnt seem to age, this game continues to surprise me with the fluidity of the combat system and dynamic range of playable roles. The story, on the other hand, is uninspired. Anyone who wanted Skyrim to have a combat system that extended beyond hack'n'slash with the occasional block, may I introduce you to Dark Messiah and the glory of the ""kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him until he dies"" approach. This game should not be taken too seriously. Hell I cheated and gave myself 300 experience points and dont feel that it diminished the game to any extent. In conclusion, buy the game you cheap bastad. It's worth a play. ",126,15,8,34,7,0,7

												I played this game before it came on Steam, and I had a blast.I bought this game when it came out on Steam, and I have been having a hell of a good time all over again. It's not the most gorgeous game, it's about on-par with Half-Life 2 (fun fact: they're on the same engine). The RPG elements aren't the most deep, and skill points are gained at set points throughout the game, some of which are missable. The story is entirely ignorable.  Weapons and armor are only acquired through finding them in the world. It's mostly linear.But you can kick people off cliffs. You can kick people into fires and watch as they struggle to limp over to a source of water before you kick them in and kill them while they're down. You can kick people into spikes. You can kick people into weak structural supports, causing barrels and boxes and whatnot to fall onto their allies, killing them. Your kick is one of the greatest weapons of all time, and it is unbelievably satisfying to use throughout the entire game. I've never had so much fun with first-person fantasy combat in my life.I give it 4/5 kicks. Buy this game.			",430,78,6,42,42,3,74

												I never really gave Dark Messiah a chance back when it was first released. I bought it, played it for maybe 10 minutes and then closed it. I don't know why, because I started playing this again recently and it was pretty good for a game released in 2006. The graphics still hold up (well, mostly) to this day and the gameplay works alright as well, with some minor flaws. These flaws aren't actually flaws at all. It's just that we've been spoiled with games that do most of these 'flaws' better. For example, walking around, and especially jumping over obstacles, feels very wooden. Same goes for the combat. Switching between weapons and spells isn't as fluent when compared to, let's say, Skyrim. Now I can't fault a 6 year old game for not being up-to-date, but it does throw you out of the experience from time to time.I really should've played this earlier, because it was seriously pretty good.I do wonder if Bulletstorm got its inspiration from this game though... ?[Rating: 80/100]			",1659,634,69,221,194,16,225

												The game is based on Source engine so it makes it Half-Life 2 with magic and stuff.If you spend your learning points right way you get lots of weapons — grenade launcher (Fireball spell), flamethrower (oh, I meant to say Inferno spell), the gravity gun (Telekinesis), and unlimited amount of first aid kits (Heal spell). Ammo (mana) regenerates slowly. Of course you can learn sword fighting or stealth instead and playing this way is much easier, but being mage is more fun. They also put in your head hot (literally) demon girl which works like Infolink from Deus Ex. You have to fight helicopters (dragons), armored vehicles (cyclops), combine soldiers (guards). There is even antlions level (spiders). If you are not comfortable with spiders, install No-Spider mod.I feel like the game is a little bit underrated. It's interesting despite being absolutely linear. There is multiplayer mode but it doesn't function anymore.Oh, and by the way, game adds French AZERTY keyboard layout into system settings. It looks like developers are not going to fix this bug, so don't forget to delete it after completing the game.			",486,119,9,75,53,4,88

												Embrace the power of the Dark Side! Back in the days, this title was a good example of a well-crafted action RPG created with Source Engine. It was both gameplay-rich and storytelling-wise, with a tech potential of the Source engine at it's finest for that time period.It's not an open-world game, but it does give you a choice. You have a choice to craft your own hero, choosing your path through the storyline set in one of the HoMM worlds. You could become a powerful wizard and unleash doom at your foes or stick to the shadows and play with prey. Or you could pick an axe, and start to wreck everything in your way in blazing havoc. Choice is yours.I recommend this game for all fantasy fanboys out there because it's now the living classics and it'll totally be worth your time. It's missing Steamworks features, though, but I wonder how nice would have been an HD remaster!			",246,7,5,12,10,2,22

												This is a first person action RPG with very enjoyable combat and well-designed levels. It may look a bit aged and the story is nothing to write home about, but it's still good fun.You can make the protagonist Sareth a fighter, mage or rogue-type character, or a combination thereof. Depending on the skills selected, he will be able to use different equipment and/or spells. But for most of the game, the terrain and your right boot will be your most powerful weapons: kicking enemies into fires or spikes or off ledges is great fun and highly effective, as is getting them crushed by falling objects. While it might seem exploity, the environments are intentionally designed so you can decimate your enemies like this - and it still makes you feel like a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you do. The occasional boss creatures are also pretty cool. Levels are long and very well made, with plenty of secrets to find, The only real downside here is that the fast attacks in close combat feel a bit lacking in substance.The story is basically your standard ""young apprentice ignorant of his shadowy origins embarks upon quest"" type thing. It's not badly done but very predictable. What few narrative choices there are make next to no difference at all, choosing a different playstyle changes the game more.I cannot say anything about the multiplayer as I haven't played it, but I find the game to be worth getting regardless.

												The M&M series is primarily either an old-school, pen-and-paper style dungeon crawler, or a card game. Meanwhile, Dark Messiah is an oddity; it's a first-person action RPG in the Source engine, of all things! Picture Half-Life 2 with swords and sorcery instead of guns and robots, and you'll have a good idea of what this game plays like. Going into this title, I did not expect much. I knew it was from Arkane Studios, the same folks who delivered the excellent Dishonored, but all the same I was not prepared to fall in love with the game.The StoryMost certainly Dark Messiah's weakest aspect. You play as Sareth, an apprentice serving under the wizard Menelag. Your master has sent you to deliver some sort of artifact to a friend in a far off city, but has transported a woman into your conciousness to be your guide for mysterious reasons. Xana is pretty much a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Cortana from Halo. You'll either tolerate her character, or outright despise her. Once you actually get to your destination, stuff hits the fan and you're thrust into a campaign to defeat an evil Necromancer. There are quite a few plot twists along the way. The biggest will probably be obvious to you, but I can guarantee there are plenty of left-field ones. The question is... will you even care enough to, well, care about what happens? 6/10The GameplayAhhh, now here's Dark Messiah's shining beacon of awesomeness. I'm going to be blunt about this one, straight out of the gate: Dark Messiah has the greatest first-person combat I've experienced in a game. The guys at Arkane are wizards when it comes to first-person animations; everything is incredibly silky smooth and satisfying to witness and interact with. As you progress through the game, you'll be rewarded Skill Points which you can then distribute as you please through two skill trees. There's no skill that will drastically change up how you play; just some generic ""More HP"" or ""Slightly Bigger Fireball"". Still, it works. You can also get some skill points by finding certain secret objectives within the world.Dark Messiah's level structure is not unlike Doom or Quake... Littered with clever secrets (Some I didn't find until my fifth or so playthrough!) filled with special loot like new armors and weapons. Using either a Sword & Shield, Dual-Daggers, Staves, Bows, or Magic, you'll slice and dice and stab and smash and burn and freeze and electrocute your way through hordes of Mercenaries, Orcs, Giant Spiders, Undead, and more. Though you can mash your attack button, that is rarely effective. The true combat is found using the various styles of power attacks. Not unlike the system found in Elder Scrolls, you'll preform different attacks based on which direction you are moving. From vertical swipes to long reaching stabs to hard-hitting slashes, you'll need to use every available move to defeat the very clever Orcs later on. Swords are nimble; the all-around weapon. They're capable of parrying foes, and you can even disarm by power-attacking while aiming at the hand. Daggers are lightning fast. They chop up foes before they can get a swing in, and they are capable of instant kills against unaware and fleeing enemies. Staves lack damage, but in smart hands they are the most powerful in the game. They can strike multiple foes at once, and blows to the head almost always stun instantly, leaving the foe extremely vulnerable to being kicked off their feet and into traps and the like. Bows work like you'd expect; headshots instantly kill unaware enemies. Once you get the skill that makes you draw faster and a secret unlimited quiver, it's possible to go bow-only, most definitely.Magic requires a lot of skill to use effectively. Sure, you have your standard fireballs and lightning bolts and freeze spells, but in my experience it is just too difficult to use solely these in combat. You'll need to be crafty; turn enemies against each other with a mind-control spell, shrink enemies to the size of mice, and lay traps near instant-killing spike-walls in the environment. About a third of the way through the game, you'll find the Rope Bow. Truly an inventive tool that I would adore seeing in another game. Near useless in combat, this weapon is instead used to navigate the environment; firing at any wooden structure above you will release a dangling rope you can climb and jump from! This one simple tool drastically changes up the level structure from there-on, and gives room for some dastardly secret nooks and crannies.Admittedly, it does take quite a while to get used to how the game works. But I guarantee you... when it all clicks, you'll be saying ""Holy smokes! This is gosh-dang-diddly-dum AWESOME!"" 10/10The Art and the SoundIf you've seen any sort of high fantasy movie, show, comic, or game, you've seen everything in Dark Messiah before. There's nothing visually that is truly original or outstanding. Admittedly, the super weapons later on have some great designs and one of the final levels is a big palette cleanser after hours of trudging through a boring ol' cave system. The environment, the enemies... it's all generic as possible. Thankfully, the sound is a fair bit better. The clang of metal against metal and swooshes of air as swords tear through it are top-notch and really bring a little extra bit of immersion. You'll probably get sick fast of the early Mercenary enemies who seem to always begin a fight with ""Hey, pal!"", but the later gruffness of Orcs and Goblins and the like feel a fair bit more threatening. 8/10The ReplayabilityBetween the many different styles of equipment available, the extremely harsh skill point limit, and the myriad of secrets to be found in every corner, you'll definitely want to play this beast more than once. The average first playthrough will probably take 12-15 hours. There are multiple endings, but trust me; you won't be replaying just to see these. The addictiveness of the combat is far more a reason to do so than the plot. 9/10In SummaryDark Messiah came out in 2006, and I played it in 2014. I was WOWed by it, and found myself playing it over five times before getting bored. I legitimately count it among one of my favorite games now. Well worth the low price of admission these days!Story: 6/10Gameplay: 10/10Art and Sound: 8/10Replayability: 9/10Total: 8.3/10			",121,21,1,19,3,2,1

												Good game.  Combat is different - you often can't just hack and slash, you need to lure your opponents into cheap kill situations, which is a refreshing mechanic once you get used to it and embrace it.  Kick em off ledges or into spikes, or find nearby structures you can collapse on them, or draw them into fire traps, etc.  Recommended if you like fantasy fps with light rpg elements and an original angle.

It probably doesnt do the other Might and Magic games justice (I wouldn't know), but it is a solid game in itself with good melee combat (for me, probably the best yet), agreeable graphics and lots of fun places to explore.The game lets you pick your own path and places to reach with its lovable rope-arrows, which -for those that have played them- works exactly like the rope arrows in Thief 1 & 2. The exploration is encouraged by the game designers and you will often find awesome stuff (like a homage to the Thief series as an example) lying about in crazy places.So if you are an old Thief Fan that love exploration and getting to places you werent mean to be in(tm), this is probably a game for you. If youre just on the lookout for some fantasy melee (or range/magic) action with optional stealth, this is also probably a game for you.Just dont abuse the kick, it spoils the fun.

												Well, this is certainly the most impressive use of the Source engine I've ever seen. Pretty cool game. It's not what you think it is. This is not an open-ended adventure game a la Elder Scrolls. This is an ""on-rails"" first-person hack-and-slash akin to Half Life.Not to say that's bad; it's just not what I expected. There's not a lot of exploring to do. Some, but not much. There are secret places you might not find, but they rarely contain anything really valuable (just a couple extra potions usually). The graphics are pretty, the combat system is really, really cool.The one bad thing is that you spend in-game time to perform meta-game tasks. For example, the game doesn't pause while you're in your backpack or re-doing your hotbar. So if you get in a fight and that spell you want isn't already bound, you're taking some damage while you open your backpack and drag the spell's icon onto your hotbar.Good game, but don't expect Oblivion. It's Half-Life with swords.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												Definitely one of the best first person combat I've ever played.You can behead your enemies, slice them in half, impale them in spike walls, smash their heads with your staff, impale them with your sword, kill them with a precise arrow to their heads, throw them fireballs, electrify them, freeze them, levitate, enchant them to fight by your side, kick them into the abyss, cut their limbs or disarm them with a precise strike to their hand! Hell, you can do all this or a combination off everything, and even more! Seriously! What more could you want?!			",335,66,24,36,29,2,71

												This game has the best first-person RPG combat I've ever played. Apparently it had a bunch of bugs when it first launched or something...I don't know, but I got it recently on a sale, and I haven't seen any bugs. Think Oblivion - the open world + way better combat + source engine physics + more focused, linear storyline. I don't understand why some people think that a linear story is always a bad thing. Its simply a different style. The biggest benefit is that the developers get to focus on each part more, making a more involved and polished experience.			",207,58,5,43,6,2,21

												I would say this is one of the best action based rpg's out there, it's my personal favorite next to Fable, and even better than Oblivion and Skyrim, the combat system is better and the level system and skill tree is more enjoyable as well..... The only complaints I had was that it felt short and the ending of the story was strangely abrupt, but the shortness of the game is easily made up by it's re playability of different skill trees and different difficulty settings. The game also has a multiplayer and it's fun but there is rarely anyone that plays.  It's one of my favorites because leveling systems and combat mechanics for me is really important as opposed to the Elder Scrolls series which seems to skip over that, like I said it's kind of like a WoW version of Fable, if your into orcs and dragons and a fun leveling system than you wont regret getting this.

												A first-person action/adventure game which eschews player levels for skill points awarded based on progress through the game rather than kills (except bosses). Allows combinations of the three combat styles common in games (warrior, rogue, mage), but the more skillful player will use their environment to greatest advantage. The world is littered with physics objects which may be used to hurt, disorient, trip, or impale your enemies. Shove your foes into the fire, or use oil to bring the fire to them. If they are foolish enough to wander near a high ledge, give them a kick and let gravity do the work for you. Take advantage of traps or unsafe building equipment, which could hurt them just as well as you.If you're not the type to get your hands dirty, charm the most powerful foe and watch them fight amongst each other. Or sneak by them, you need not be the grim reaper in this world, as foes are merely obstacles in your path, not the goal.Would you embrace your destiny or fight it?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't be confused by the name. This is no turn-based RPG. It's first-person action all the way with just a sprinking of RPG progression.Dark Messiah's single player has been the only first-person ""shooter"" I've played that brought back memories of the old Jedi Knight games. It's not just a rollicking adventure, but it offers very distinct playstyles. The stealth mechanics are good enough to satisfy a fan of the Thief games. Some of the spells are brutal and make you feel like a truly powerful mage. And those who prefer fighting will enjoy the novel-yet-effective experience of throwing furniture at enemies and kicking them off edges or into spikes.Get this game if you're missing over-the-top shooters of old, like Jedi Knight or Duke Nukem, or if you liked the combat in Skyrim but longed for something MORE.

												What makes this game revolutionary and yet fall short in ratings? Many complain about the linearity and shortness of the game. The linear aspect made this game come off more as an adventure novel and enhanced the experience. A game that if polished, it could have deserved more. The combat system of this game is revolutionary, yet enemies are too overpowered thus making fighting repetitious and rather boring. However, through the eyes of a game developer the idea was genius and sadly overlooked. If the same system was applied to other source games, it would only enhance the gaming experience, allowing more control. The storyline has a total of three endings, yet the horrible ending suffers continuity issues. Despite the game suffering from bugs and some questionable design, the modern has advanced so far that this game runs rather smoothly. Revolutionary in combat and often overlooked, I recommend gamers to play this solely through the eyes as someone interested in game development.			",173,36,3,19,2,0,4

												Probably the best 10 dollar game you will ever play. The combat is gripping and the story (so far) is compelling. Truely a hidden gem. The graphics and animations do look slightly dated as it is a six year old game, but they are better than what you get in tes: oblivion as far as I can tell (with much better combat and a story that doesn't suck). It does run in 1920x1080 with a 16:9 aspect ratio which is a plus. However, you will get slight pixelation in the cut scenes due to this (as should be expected for older titles). Final disclaimer, although I compared it to tes it is not open world. It is similar to a shooter really (or simply a classic rpg). You begin each ""chapter"" of the game on a level and play it through. Your items and ""spec"" stick with you throughout the game though, and although it plays like this the game doesn't feel linear. The objectives are not insanely straight forward and there multiple paths to completing each one.			",270,53,5,65,14,1,39

												Good game.  Combat is different - you often can't just hack and slash, you need to lure your opponents into cheap kill situations, which is a refreshing mechanic once you get used to it and embrace it.  Kick em off ledges or into spikes, or find nearby structures you can collapse on them, or draw them into fire traps, etc.  Recommended if you like fantasy fps with light rpg elements and an original angle.

												This game is simply awesome. I have finished singlepalyer 4 times in a row. And even during the fourth run I have found some new elements of the fighting system (shield bash, stabing people with arrow, leaning out etc. ) . DM M&M is action game on HL2 engine with RPG element; magic, stealth and of cource melee combat. You can make your character as you like. Many uses of the environment to your advantege. There are maaany way to deal with your enemies. This game has multiplayer too but I did not tried it, it will be probably dead, but this game is simply worth if for it's singleplayer campain.

												Dark Messiah is one of those games that I enjoyed immensely but people in general seemed to dislike. It probably doesnt do the other Might and Magic games justice (I wouldn't know), but it is a solid game in itself with good melee combat (for me, probably the best yet), agreeable graphics and lots of fun places to explore.The game lets you pick your own path and places to reach with its lovable rope-arrows, which -for those that have played them- works exactly like the rope arrows in Thief 1 & 2. The exploration is encouraged by the game designers and you will often find awesome stuff (like a homage to the Thief series as an example) lying about in crazy places.So if you are an old Thief Fan that love exploration and getting to places you werent mean to be in(tm), this is probably a game for you. If youre just on the lookout for some fantasy melee (or range/magic) action with optional stealth, this is also probably a game for you.Just dont abuse the kick, it spoils the fun.

												Good game at a good price. First, it's not open like Oblivion. But the degree of polish and detail is something you can't find in a massive world game. You can build your character as you like, and there are always many routes to take to complete the objectives. Single-player has a good story, and really breaks from the cliche RPG stories. Multiplayer has great potential, as you can improve skills by completing tasks. Combat is excellent in all aspects, and I recommend the game.			",430,126,11,41,29,1,58

												Dark Messiah has been out for more than a few years now, but the game still provides a solid single-player experience. The story may not be that engaging, but the combat is fun and allows you to finish the game in a number of ways: you can either develop yourself as an assassin, a mage, just go for a hardcore berserker approach or develop for some sort of hybrid. The nice thing is that all of these feel like they are actually viable and fun options.The game was based on the Source engine, meaning it also uses the physics made popular by Half-Life 2 to its fullest, admittedly even going a little overboard on it sometimes (or those orcs sure love having dem dere spikey racks all over the place). The use of the Source engine also means that Dark Messiah´s graphics have aged quite well.All in all, a good 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What I liked about Dark Messiah was the fear of the enemy's attack when on the hardest settings.  I found myself running away from enemies all the time.  Seeing them at the end of corridors freaked the hell out of me.  I didn't have enough upgrades most of the time.  Enemies were too powerful.  At times, I thought maybe going on hardest was a bad idea.  I did finish it though.  At long last.  It felt great.The settings were beatiful and you had that feeling of dread when you were near or in the presence of evil.  This is a really good but somewhat flawed example of a first person melee fantasy game.  Way better than any other game in its time.  it was too bad they didn't continue supporting this game like other Source Engine powered games.  I would have loved to re-visit Might and Magic in first person.			",207,42,7,17,10,3,36

												MM Dark Messiah is one of the most forgotten and unappreciated gems in the role-playing genre. The game breaks from the classic Might & Magic style from a long open world rpg to a linear action focused rpg and it does so beautifully. The game is short for a rpg lasting only 6 hours or so, but in that time you will fight epic interactive battles with everything from Orcs, Cyclops, Liches, Wyverns and much more. The gameplay of Dark Messiah is the best in the entire library of rpg's, and the game rewards creative fast paced combat with tons of ways of hilariously killing your enemies. The storyline is good scripted, good voice acting and multi choice ending. It's in many ways better than Oblivion, Dragon Age and Mass Effect. To me Dark Messiah represent the last of the great action games like Heretic, Hexen, Quake and Doom.			",113,17,3,46,37,0,70

												This game got dumped on by a lot of critics when it came out, and not without reason. Magic is gimpy, and the most powerful tactic by far is kicking dudes into pointy things. However, the fact remains that no game has ever made first person melee combat feel so good or so smooth, not even zeno clash. It's also one of the few games that effectively combines action and stealth gameplay, so that both approaches seem worthwhile, even using both if you've spent your skillpoints appropriately. Just do yourself a favor and don't bother with hardcore mode. It makes all humanoid enemies and possibly spiders invincible unless you knock them down and hit them with a coup de grace, which makes combat incredible tedious.			",149,24,0,27,4,0,12

												A first-person action/adventure game which eschews player levels for skill points awarded based on progress through the game rather than kills (except bosses). Allows combinations of the three combat styles common in games (warrior, rogue, mage), but the more skillful player will use their environment to greatest advantage. The world is littered with physics objects which may be used to hurt, disorient, trip, or impale your enemies. Shove your foes into the fire, or use oil to bring the fire to them. If they are foolish enough to wander near a high ledge, give them a kick and let gravity do the work for you. Take advantage of traps or unsafe building equipment, which could hurt them just as well as you.If you're not the type to get your hands dirty, charm the most powerful foe and watch them fight amongst each other. Or sneak by them, you need not be the grim reaper in this world, as foes are merely obstacles in your path, not the goal.Would you embrace your destiny or fight it?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't be confused by the name. This is no turn-based RPG. It's first-person action all the way with just a sprinking of RPG progression.Dark Messiah's single player has been the only first-person ""shooter"" I've played that brought back memories of the old Jedi Knight games. It's not just a rollicking adventure, but it offers very distinct playstyles. The stealth mechanics are good enough to satisfy a fan of the Thief games. Some of the spells are brutal and make you feel like a truly powerful mage. And those who prefer fighting will enjoy the novel-yet-effective experience of throwing furniture at enemies and kicking them off edges or into spikes.Get this game if you're missing over-the-top shooters of old, like Jedi Knight or Duke Nukem, or if you liked the combat in Skyrim but longed for something MORE.

												Here's a basic review about this game:Story: 7.5/10 - A bit lackluster, but it gets the job done.  Given that most of the game involves action there isn't as much need for an in-depth story, though it would have been appreciated.  Lots came in the form of snippets in books, which have copies throughout in case if you miss one.  Pretty decent overall, though not enough to really draw you in fully.Gameplay: 10/10 - There's a reason why TotalBiscuit has sworn by this game.  The combat is amazing.  Makes me wish that more RPGs, such as Skyrim, could have just copied and pasted these mechanics into their games instead of try to make their own from scratch.  The use of rope arrows to help climb up surfaces was a nice touch, and the game is loaded with secrets...speccing in alertness early on will be a move you won't regret.Dialogue: 6/10 - With story, this one was kind of lackluster, though thankfully it was enough to keep some of my attention.  The dialogue between the two potential 'love interests' in the game was absolutely ridiculous at times.Art Style: 7.9/10 - You can definitely tell it is a Source engine game by simple nature of the fact that everything is nice and gritty.  Does remind one a bit too much like Half Life 2 in that regard, but it is forgivable; after all, this is the only actual RPG that uses the Source engine with any form of credibility.Lighting: 4/10 - Probably more frustrating than some of the puzzles.  I had to fiddle with the effects because everything was too dark.  Giving the player the ability to use Darkvision from the get-go put me in a position where I thought the dark rooms were a mechanic rather than a flaw on the settings.  This, however, is mostly a Source engine problem and I couldn't expect them to provide me with a flashlight, so despite my griping it's a forgivable feature.Overall experience: 9/10 - Definitely will be playing this game again, but more importantly this game has left me with some high expectations for any planned followups if/when they happen.  One thing is for sure though; this game has given me new appreciation for the Source Engine, and makes me wish that Dark Messiah wasn't the only RPG available on said engine.-Kerian			",139,24,1,20,13,2,34

												Probably the first action-RPG I've ever played with a truly interactive combat environment.  Imagine being in a swordfight along the edge of a cliff, then reveling as a swift kick results in that guard you were dueling with falling hundreds of feet off the edge... to his DOOM! Or... fighting with some foes, you spot some spikes protruding from the side of a wall in the room. With a nice kick, that orc you were fighting falls onto the spikes, getting impaled on them! There are a few other things I could add, but you get the idea. The game also has some pretty nice combat animations for a first person RPG. Doing a power-stroke with your sword, some of these animations can involve driving your sword clear through the gut of your foes, then kicking their corpse off the blade with a well placed kick, resulting in showers of blood. Uses the Source engine.Warning: though fun, the game is EXTREMELY buggy. Fortunately it's also cheap! (And imo worth it at this price).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just wow is this game a hidden gem. Dark Messiah is about an apprentice to a powerful wizard who finds he's more than just an apprentice. Powered by Source, this game's visuals are amazing for the time it was made. What really separates this from other RPGs is the physics and controls. Using the source engine, enemies are flung around like ragdolls. There's all kinds of booby traps and other devices to help you fight enemies. Depending on which buttons you push (forward, back, left, right) determines which way you swing your weapon or which type of attack you use. It comes out so smooth and intuitively it's like you're holding the sword yourself. Because of how well combat is crafted, having good skills means the game rewards you. There's not much replayability. You can try playing as a mage or thief type character, but there's so much focus on melee and bows you'll end up playing as a warrior anyway. The levels are also too linear. Overall, 9/10			",65,14,0,12,3,0,14

												Probably the best and most satisfying first person RPG combat system ever. Blocking, combos and plain aimed hits are intuitive and responsive. Story, graphics and level design are alright, being on Source engine. Any TES game is ages longer, but even with mods their combat system feels crippled and stupid compared to this.Think HL2 EP1 as an RPG.			",89,11,0,11,4,1,10

												This game was awesome! I enjoyed the gameplay, unique storyline, graphics, and have yet to see another game of similar likeness. I played this game in between breaks from weekend grind and finished it on the third day. It was a lot of fun. I am about to test the multiplayer version and hope it's equally as enjoyable. I think the game creaters did a great job with Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and I eagerly look forward to the second Dark Messiah of Might and Magic game whenever it is due for release.

												The M&M series is primarily either an old-school, pen-and-paper style dungeon crawler, or a card game. Meanwhile, Dark Messiah is an oddity; it's a first-person action RPG in the Source engine, of all things! Picture Half-Life 2 with swords and sorcery instead of guns and robots, and you'll have a good idea of what this game plays like. Going into this title, I did not expect much. I knew it was from Arkane Studios, the same folks who delivered the excellent Dishonored, but all the same I was not prepared to fall in love with the game.The StoryMost certainly Dark Messiah's weakest aspect. You play as Sareth, an apprentice serving under the wizard Menelag. Your master has sent you to deliver some sort of artifact to a friend in a far off city, but has transported a woman into your conciousness to be your guide for mysterious reasons. Xana is pretty much a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Cortana from Halo. You'll either tolerate her character, or outright despise her. Once you actually get to your destination, stuff hits the fan and you're thrust into a campaign to defeat an evil Necromancer. There are quite a few plot twists along the way. The biggest will probably be obvious to you, but I can guarantee there are plenty of left-field ones. The question is... will you even care enough to, well, care about what happens? 6/10The GameplayAhhh, now here's Dark Messiah's shining beacon of awesomeness. I'm going to be blunt about this one, straight out of the gate: Dark Messiah has the greatest first-person combat I've experienced in a game. The guys at Arkane are wizards when it comes to first-person animations; everything is incredibly silky smooth and satisfying to witness and interact with. As you progress through the game, you'll be rewarded Skill Points which you can then distribute as you please through two skill trees. There's no skill that will drastically change up how you play; just some generic ""More HP"" or ""Slightly Bigger Fireball"". Still, it works. You can also get some skill points by finding certain secret objectives within the world.Dark Messiah's level structure is not unlike Doom or Quake... Littered with clever secrets (Some I didn't find until my fifth or so playthrough!) filled with special loot like new armors and weapons. Using either a Sword & Shield, Dual-Daggers, Staves, Bows, or Magic, you'll slice and dice and stab and smash and burn and freeze and electrocute your way through hordes of Mercenaries, Orcs, Giant Spiders, Undead, and more. Though you can mash your attack button, that is rarely effective. The true combat is found using the various styles of power attacks. Not unlike the system found in Elder Scrolls, you'll preform different attacks based on which direction you are moving. From vertical swipes to long reaching stabs to hard-hitting slashes, you'll need to use every available move to defeat the very clever Orcs later on. Swords are nimble; the all-around weapon. They're capable of parrying foes, and you can even disarm by power-attacking while aiming at the hand. Daggers are lightning fast. They chop up foes before they can get a swing in, and they are capable of instant kills against unaware and fleeing enemies. Staves lack damage, but in smart hands they are the most powerful in the game. They can strike multiple foes at once, and blows to the head almost always stun instantly, leaving the foe extremely vulnerable to being kicked off their feet and into traps and the like. Bows work like you'd expect; headshots instantly kill unaware enemies. Once you get the skill that makes you draw faster and a secret unlimited quiver, it's possible to go bow-only, most definitely.Magic requires a lot of skill to use effectively. Sure, you have your standard fireballs and lightning bolts and freeze spells, but in my experience it is just too difficult to use solely these in combat. You'll need to be crafty; turn enemies against each other with a mind-control spell, shrink enemies to the size of mice, and lay traps near instant-killing spike-walls in the environment. About a third of the way through the game, you'll find the Rope Bow. Truly an inventive tool that I would adore seeing in another game. Near useless in combat, this weapon is instead used to navigate the environment; firing at any wooden structure above you will release a dangling rope you can climb and jump from! This one simple tool drastically changes up the level structure from there-on, and gives room for some dastardly secret nooks and crannies.Admittedly, it does take quite a while to get used to how the game works. But I guarantee you... when it all clicks, you'll be saying ""Holy smokes! This is gosh-dang-diddly-dum AWESOME!"" 10/10The Art and the SoundIf you've seen any sort of high fantasy movie, show, comic, or game, you've seen everything in Dark Messiah before. There's nothing visually that is truly original or outstanding. Admittedly, the super weapons later on have some great designs and one of the final levels is a big palette cleanser after hours of trudging through a boring ol' cave system. The environment, the enemies... it's all generic as possible. Thankfully, the sound is a fair bit better. The clang of metal against metal and swooshes of air as swords tear through it are top-notch and really bring a little extra bit of immersion. You'll probably get sick fast of the early Mercenary enemies who seem to always begin a fight with ""Hey, pal!"", but the later gruffness of Orcs and Goblins and the like feel a fair bit more threatening. 8/10The ReplayabilityBetween the many different styles of equipment available, the extremely harsh skill point limit, and the myriad of secrets to be found in every corner, you'll definitely want to play this beast more than once. The average first playthrough will probably take 12-15 hours. There are multiple endings, but trust me; you won't be replaying just to see these. The addictiveness of the combat is far more a reason to do so than the plot. 9/10In SummaryDark Messiah came out in 2006, and I played it in 2014. I was WOWed by it, and found myself playing it over five times before getting bored. I legitimately count it among one of my favorite games now. Well worth the low price of admission these days!Story: 6/10Gameplay: 10/10Art and Sound: 8/10Replayability: 9/10Total: 8.3/10			",121,21,1,19,3,2,1

												Awesome sword and sorcery game that you'll love restarting again and again just to experience diferent combat oportunities.The game offers opportunities for physics driven traps and contraptions, platforming, exploration and stealth. The rope arrows are the most amusing thing to use when you're not trying to kill the enemies in diferent and creative ways. You'll reach places you would have though unreachable in other games and find that the devs left a few items there. You'll find yourself often sourounded and runing around trying to throw objects to stun or trip your enemies, often pulling them over a fire or a breakable platform, pushing them under a heavy pillar or swinging trap.did i mention you have a key dedicated to kick, just like in Duke Nukem but in a better way i think.I just wish the game would go on and on forever as i tend to finish it too quickly. Too bad they never released any modding tools for it even though it uses the Source engine (Half Life 2).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is still an amazing game to play. I love games with medievil settings and weapons. the handling of swords is really challenging but very pleasent if you get used to it. it is all about timing and driection of hits. you don't only hack on opponents by pressing the mouse button, you have to aim your sword in the right direction and you can swing from left, right, overhead and so on. there are nice combos. and the best feature in such a game is the kicking. you can kick opponents off a cliff. you can kick them in fire so they burn, or kick them in spike traps and they die instantly. the game is very linear but you never get bored. some puzzles with levers etc.this game is really fun to play and challenging.if you liked dark messiah you should look for severance: blade of darkness, it is available on GOG.com. it is even harder and much longer gameplay and challenging sword mechanics too.

												The Good: Great visuals and voice acting, decent story, fun deep combat, lots of upgrades to get, tons of items to useThe Bad: Little in variety of enemy types, very linear, combat is tedious after awhile, semi-poor level design, HL2 engine is starting to look oldBefore I start here Dark Messiah suffered bad reviews because of all the terrible bugs that launched with the game. now that 2 1/2 years have passed Dark Messiah's bugs have been pretty much been ironed out and you now have a pretty fun action RPG. Before I start explaining the game DM uses the Half-Life 2 engine so you can expect some wonderful graphics and effects. DM uses the HL2 engine very well, but the engine is a bit supped up so you'll need a fairly beefy rig to run this game. If you computer was being pushed with HL2 then your computer will have a hard time running this game. I also have to mention that DM felt a lot like Oblivion Lite in the sense that it is set in Medieval times, melee combat is first person, and the art style is a little like Oblivion (not as unique of course).You play as a young protagonist named Sareth and you must stop the evil Arantir from using the Skull Crystal and bringing the Dark Messiah back to life. You have a choice to either stop him yourself or let the Dark Messiah live on. The story is actually fairly interesting and will keep you on the edge throughout this 15-20 hour adventure. Now DM is a linear RPG (it's not free roaming like Oblivion), but makes up for it with a intricate combat system. You have about 30-40 different item slots and you can carry things from health, mana, weapons, magic etc. As you progress through the game you will earn skill points for completing objectives and you can upgrade a variety of things from endurance, health, stealth, archery skill, learn new skills such as heal, fire arrow, freeze, sanctuary etc. There's a lot to learn and you won't upgrade 100% in a play through. You can either concentrate on being a Knight, Mage, or Archer or just go down the middle.There are a variety of unique weapons you can pick up throughout the adventure such as the awesome rope bow (shoot an arrow at any wood overhanging and a rope will come down), ice staffs, flame swords, poison daggers, and even a cool electricity shield that stuns enemies when they attack you. Now there are no shops where you can buy things so everything has to be picked up throughout the world. This keeps the action constantly going, but will disappoint people who are used to having stores in their RPGs.Combat consists of left clicking for your basic attack, but if you hold it down you do a Power Strike and whether or not you strafe, move forward, or backward will determine whether it's a side swipe, impale, or overhead strike. This can let you easily dodge attack and quickly strike back. You can use the right mouse button to block (and when you get the ability) left clicking to knock enemies back. Hit enough bad guys and you'll get your adrenaline bar up and this results in a gory slow-mo instant kill. This applies to all weapons and each of them have their own unique advantages to them. You have a kick button and this is great when you are on a ledge so you can just kick them off. Every so often you'll find spike beds on walls you can impale enemies on, also you'll find traps that can be kicked down to crush enemies.While the combat is really fun and you can do a lot with it; it will get repetitive after about half way through unless you use different weapons and toss things up. Every so often you'll find a blacksmith room where you can add bars of metal and forge your own weapons. Now when it comes to enemies there aren't to many of them (knights, undead, spiders, necromancers, evil demons) and that's about it. They are mixed up a lot, but you still can get bored of them after awhile.Every so often, though, you will get a great boss fight and these are huge creatures that require key items in the environment to kill them. These are pretty awesome and are very satisfying to take down. My biggest complaint must be the level design. A lot of times you won't find most of the hidden secret areas since they aren't even in places you'd remotely think they'd be in. There will be times you'll wonder around for over 30 minutes in the same place wondering where to go and this has to do with poor level design. The levels are very linear, most of the time dark, and really hard to navigate. Other than this Dark Messiah is a pretty good game, and you can even get it off Steam for $10! I highly recommend Dark Messiah to any action RPG fan.~Score: 8/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												The Ubisoft game that uses the same engine as Half-life 2, Dark messiah: might and magic. This game brings you into a first person melee combat game that also uses RPG elements. Dark messiah introduces new things to the source engine. Dark messiah has one of the darkest stories in a game I have ever seen, yet interesting at the same time. Dark messiah can have some issues here and there but overall the game is easy to beat. Dark messiah also has great textures to the weapons in the game. If you like FPS's or RPG's this game is worth a try, For only $10 that's not bad deal. Overall the game is fun to play and sometimes replayable.			",47,3,0,14,4,0,0

												This is a pretty interesting game. It's built on Source, and looks pretty good for the time. The mechanics are introduced in a fashion that doesn't leave you with many questions and the gameplay is pretty solid. There's a basic RPG framework built into the game that allows you to choose specialisation in three different primary areas of mastery. Stealth, Magic, and Weaponmastery. The enemy variety is mixed up enough to keep you from getting too bored, but the formula is pretty much the same for most humanoid enemies. The game includes a kick that has the ability to knock back a lot of enemies, and the game liberally places hazards for you to take advantage of, so most often it's a lot easier for you to just kick someone off of a ledge or into spikes than actually fight them.I feel the game is geniunely very difficult without taking the heal spell from the mage tree, but other than that, you can play the game without there being too many necessary skills. I would say that it's mandatory to either get magic or bows, however.			",210,31,1,30,12,2,44

												I don't really think that this game justifies the mediocre scores it achieved. It's not cutting edge - after all it uses the Source engine familiar in many FPS's. But this has got a number of novelties in it - a few extras that make you think the developers thought quite in depth about this hybrid of RPG and FPS.It's much more action focused than say Oblivion, but in doing so, sacrifices a lot of the depth of that game. Sometimes the controls are a little fiddly and the enemy manages to score hits on you when clearly they didn't. Seemingly difficult situations like a horde of spiders in their lair can simply be defeated by running in circles around them and hacking away.Dark Messiah is best viewed as a Source mod. When taken in that context, it's really very enjoyable - with some excellent dialogue and set pieces. Don't think of it as a ground breaking RPG, as it clearly isn't. But it carves out a welcome niche for itself within the genre. 7.5			",324,46,21,42,39,2,85

												Very entertaining action game. What really makes this game stand out is the melee combat. I really liked how the attacks felt weighty and how attacking different body parts will do different damage and different effects towards your enemy, seeing your enemy get injured and hobble away and show that he is at low health was also lots of fun because a lot of games don't show you enemy opponents get injured by your attacks. Environmental kills were also really fun as you can kick your enemy off of cliffs, into fires, into spikes and traps etc, you can get really creative with how you deal with enemy encounters and watching the physics of the enemy's corpse as they fall down a cliff or some stairs is fun too, which is because it runs on the Source engine. There is many ways to mix your character's build with a mix of ranged, melee and magic attacks which adds replayabilty.The designs of the world and characters is very nice, the game has a great high fantasy atmosphere that feels like real lived in world. Despite being an older game it has aged nicely in this regard.There are multiple endings which offers replay value and adds weight to the story as it feels you can choose to be the good guy or the bad guy, which was interesting while the story itself was a bit cliched. The level design is quite linear and at parts could get a bit annoying with backtracking but the way you can build your character adds replayability to the fun combat that you'll want to play again, as you try different strategies. Overall an underrated game in the Might and Magic universe that really stands out due to its fun combat system and kicking things.			",651,181,13,106,63,5,102

This keeps the action constantly going, but will disappoint people who are used to having stores in their RPGs.Combat consists of left clicking for your basic attack, but if you hold it down you do a Power Strike and whether or not you strafe, move forward, or backward will determine whether it's a side swipe, impale, or overhead strike. This can let you easily dodge attack and quickly strike back. You can use the right mouse button to block (and when you get the ability) left clicking to knock enemies back. Hit enough bad guys and you'll get your adrenaline bar up and this results in a gory slow-mo instant kill. This applies to all weapons and each of them have their own unique advantages to them. You have a kick button and this is great when you are on a ledge so you can just kick them off. Every so often you'll find spike beds on walls you can impale enemies on, also you'll find traps that can be kicked down to crush enemies.While the combat is really fun and you can do a lot with it; it will get repetitive after about half way through unless you use different weapons and toss things up. Every so often you'll find a blacksmith room where you can add bars of metal and forge your own weapons. Now when it comes to enemies there aren't to many of them (knights, undead, spiders, necromancers, evil demons) and that's about it. They are mixed up a lot, but you still can get bored of them after awhile.Every so often, though, you will get a great boss fight and these are huge creatures that require key items in the environment to kill them. These are pretty awesome and are very satisfying to take down. My biggest complaint must be the level design. A lot of times you won't find most of the hidden secret areas since they aren't even in places you'd remotely think they'd be in. There will be times you'll wonder around for over 30 minutes in the same place wondering where to go and this has to do with poor level design. The levels are very linear, most of the time dark, and really hard to navigate. Other than this Dark Messiah is a pretty good game, and you can even get it off Steam for $10! I highly recommend Dark Messiah to any action RPG fan.~Score: 8/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												Dark Messiah Might and Magic is a great action-packed Linear RPG. Graphics are good, Voice acting is decent, Storyline may be a bit lacking, but the combat is the redeeming factor. I sometimes wish that more games will adopt the combat system that Dark Messiah Might and Magic created. Running around rooms and throwing chairs, barrels, crates, etc. is awesome and not to mention kicking your enemy whether it's into his ally or off a cliff. On a side note... if you have arachnophobia be aware of the Temple of the Spider... I hear of mods that change the giant spiders into pigs, but have never tried one. I personally got through it with the audio turned off to avoid the hissing of those 8 legged monsters. I'd consider this game a bit on the short side, but Dark Messiah has enough choices, in leveling and story choices, to validate atleast 2 play throughs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty interesting game. It's built on Source, and looks pretty good for the time. The mechanics are introduced in a fashion that doesn't leave you with many questions and the gameplay is pretty solid. There's a basic RPG framework built into the game that allows you to choose specialisation in three different primary areas of mastery. Stealth, Magic, and Weaponmastery. The enemy variety is mixed up enough to keep you from getting too bored, but the formula is pretty much the same for most humanoid enemies. The game includes a kick that has the ability to knock back a lot of enemies, and the game liberally places hazards for you to take advantage of, so most often it's a lot easier for you to just kick someone off of a ledge or into spikes than actually fight them.I feel the game is geniunely very difficult without taking the heal spell from the mage tree, but other than that, you can play the game without there being too many necessary skills. I would say that it's mandatory to either get magic or bows, however.			",210,31,1,30,12,2,44

												The Ubisoft game that uses the same engine as Half-life 2, Dark messiah: might and magic. This game brings you into a first person melee combat game that also uses RPG elements. Dark messiah introduces new things to the source engine. Dark messiah has one of the darkest stories in a game I have ever seen, yet interesting at the same time. Dark messiah can have some issues here and there but overall the game is easy to beat. Dark messiah also has great textures to the weapons in the game. If you like FPS's or RPG's this game is worth a try, For only $10 that's not bad deal. Overall the game is fun to play and sometimes replayable.			",47,3,0,14,4,0,0

												One of the best hack n' slash games ever. You control the character Sareth, but you can roleplay his character to an extent, by changing the story every once in a while, and choosing how he fights. The gameplay is what makes the game so great. You can use stealth, magic, and direct combat, and excel at your favorite path with skill points distributed throughout the story, or create a satisfying mix to your liking. There are so many ways to play the game, and they are all unique and fun. All the levels lend themselves to how you have moulded Sareth, and all the different skills shine brilliantly. It will be a fun, challenging game that you will want to play more than once, and will be the most fun hack & slash RPG for a long time. ",103,11,0,11,4,0,3

												Ok, before people start bashing this game for the admittedly terrible voice acting and lame plot, consider what this game does. It is an action RPG that focuses on being smarter and more skilled than the NPCs. Sure, you could charge at an enemy and beat them to death with your sword; OR, you could shoot them with your bow, crush them with collapsable scaffolding, drop them down a pit, down some stairs, hit them with barrels, kick them into spikes, burn them, kick them into each other, or stab them in the back. The level up system is kinda lackluster, and does seem like it takes forever to get some useful skills. If you RPG damage sponges want a game that doesn't require much thought to play, by all means, don't buy this game. If you are looking for an RPG that challenges you on multiple levels and prefer gameplay to plot and VAs, give this a shot. A good plot does not make a bad game better, but a bad story doesn't hinder a good game.			",77,21,0,19,7,2,8

												I adore this game, Everything about it from the incredible combat to the enemy AI to the hilarious ways you can kill people. The only flaw I find in it is the amount of spiders. There are SO MANY SPIDERS. Now you may say ""What's wrong with spiders?"" And I say to you I am Aracniphobic, meaning of course I am unreasonably terrified of spiders. Now I've never found any spiders in any game a terrifying as this. Spiders in Elder Scrolls? Harmless. Spiders in Minecraft? You kidding? Spders in Magicite? You joking, right? Are they even spiders? But THESE spiders, they look real, and they JUMP at you! That is traumitizing for someone like me! This sprouted a joke with me and my friends were we play would you rather but the second option is always be in a cave full of spiders. Now I do recomend this game, it's beutiful, but Aracnifobes beware. and also:Kill them with fire.			",29,4,1,13,1,0,2

												One of the best if not the best first person melee combat games I've played. Combat is very intense and pretty bloody. Story is okay as well, cutscenes don't take you out of the action too often and not too long as well. Finished several playthroughs before getting the steam version (thus the ""low"" track record).Mage class is not balanced too well (sorta underpowered for the most part), but archery, heavy melee and stealth are a lot of fun.You should also avoid the highest difficulty setting - it's just ridiculous and leads to a few very frustrating parts - including a bossfight at about a third into the game where you can be killed in one blow before even exiting cutscene mode if you're not a sturdy fighter.

												HEY, PALLL!!!This game is the resultant offspring between the brief Ubisoft/Source relationship of 2006. What you get from this incident is a unique RPG/action/adventure game in terms of both combat and gameplay. Using the 3 styles of playthroughs provided (Sword-fighting, Magic, or Stealth) there are plenty of fun and creative ways to dispatch foes using finesse, might, or dumb luck. The campaign itself is fairly linear and the story is nothing to remember but the gameplay is so different from anything I've played prior that I can't find another, more popular, comparison to give. There is replayability provided from the multiple play styles which are worth trying out and finally it should be noted that this game can't be taken too seriously; though it wants to be. The laughable voice acting and derpy A.I. make playing it way too enjoyable and hilarious for the purpose of a serious story-backed game. In short, I recommend this unique specimen if on sale and you don't mind a casual and funny action/adventure experience.(Also, the women seem to try way too hard to get your attention in this one… and it’s still cheesy as ever)			",210,24,1,8,20,2,11

												Here's a basic review about this game:Story: 7.5/10 - A bit lackluster, but it gets the job done.  Given that most of the game involves action there isn't as much need for an in-depth story, though it would have been appreciated.  Lots came in the form of snippets in books, which have copies throughout in case if you miss one.  Pretty decent overall, though not enough to really draw you in fully.Gameplay: 10/10 - There's a reason why TotalBiscuit has sworn by this game.  The combat is amazing.  Makes me wish that more RPGs, such as Skyrim, could have just copied and pasted these mechanics into their games instead of try to make their own from scratch.  The use of rope arrows to help climb up surfaces was a nice touch, and the game is loaded with secrets...speccing in alertness early on will be a move you won't regret.Dialogue: 6/10 - With story, this one was kind of lackluster, though thankfully it was enough to keep some of my attention.  The dialogue between the two potential 'love interests' in the game was absolutely ridiculous at times.Art Style: 7.9/10 - You can definitely tell it is a Source engine game by simple nature of the fact that everything is nice and gritty.  Does remind one a bit too much like Half Life 2 in that regard, but it is forgivable; after all, this is the only actual RPG that uses the Source engine with any form of credibility.Lighting: 4/10 - Probably more frustrating than some of the puzzles.  I had to fiddle with the effects because everything was too dark.  Giving the player the ability to use Darkvision from the get-go put me in a position where I thought the dark rooms were a mechanic rather than a flaw on the settings.  This, however, is mostly a Source engine problem and I couldn't expect them to provide me with a flashlight, so despite my griping it's a forgivable feature.Overall experience: 9/10 - Definitely will be playing this game again, but more importantly this game has left me with some high expectations for any planned followups if/when they happen.  One thing is for sure though; this game has given me new appreciation for the Source Engine, and makes me wish that Dark Messiah wasn't the only RPG available on said engine.-Kerian			",139,24,1,20,13,2,34

												This is one of my favorite games ever, and arguably the one that has the best 1st person swordplay action to date, including The Elder Scroll series, Chivalry, War of the Roses and the like.There's three basic classes: Warrior, Wizard and Thief. This sounds restrictive at first, but apart from the fact that you can play the entire game 3 times and get a totally different experience out of it every time depending on your class, you can also just distribute your level-up points in all three skill trees as you see fit and mix it up. Even for a warrior, it's pretty useful to be able to turn enemies against each other or to spot traps or hidden doors; Even for a mage, it's useful to do more damage with your staff or sneak around more effectively, and even for a thief/assassin, it's useful to be able to disarm enemies or create magic invisible fire traps.The story is cool and intriguing with a couple of big optional choices and side missions that affect it, the locations beautiful and diverse (although the graphics are a little outdated, of course), exploration and sneaking fun and immersive, boss fights pretty unique and against several pretty BIG enemies, the RPG mechanics balanced and the fights badass and VERY satisfying - and this is the meat of the game.You can disarm foes, dismember them, burn them, shrink them, zap them, freeze them, stealthkill them, kick them into spikes and fires or off cliffs or into other enemies and use the environement in all kinds of other creative ways (cut/shoot ropes to have large objects drop on or swing at enemies, or to collapse bridges or pillars to crush enemies, create fire arrows by simply holding an arrow into any fire, and shooting into oil puddles or at enemies directly - sometimes after you picked up an oil pot and threw it in their face for that extra-crispiness. You can of course use firespells for that, too.). The cool implementation of the environment into the combat always has you looking for opportunities at any location, which makes both planning fights from the shadows and thinking on your feet in hairy combat situations a lot of fun, and you feel like a proper badass after a huge fight that was so awesome that it could have been featured in a movie. This game makes you feel badass, and you feel like you EARNED to feel badass.Enemies include humans, goblin and orcs (warriors, archers or wizards of all sorts), zombies and skeletons, quasi-dragons, spiders, trolls and more, and they often require different tactics. Oh, and you get *SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT, SORT OF (because you can set ""change form"" in the key bindings anyway)* the ability to turn into an ""Alien""-like demon form later on, which I hardly used, but well, if you're into that sort of thing...*END OF ZOMG SPOILER*You'll also do a lot of freeclimbing with the ability to grab ledges and the use of chains and ropes (You get Thief-style rope arrows later on, too!).All of this in 1st person, which is very immersive and simply works well, especially since you have full body awareness, meaning the model that exists in the world is also the one you see from your perspective - and it throws a shadow. You're not a camera on a stick with fake arms on the side, you're ♥♥♥♥ing IN there.I was a bit disappointed in the MP back then because it was too fast for my taste (and in comparison to SP) and didn't have any objective maps - or co-op. No mods to speak of either, which is unbelievable for a somewhat unique gem like this, especially since it's a Source game.Dark Messiah was made by Arkane, btw, who later made DisHonored. It is rather linear, so don't expect anything like Skyrim - but that's not a bad thing since Dark messiah is a different experience altogether, in a good way. It does have its flaws, but overall, it's a great experience.Damn, I just wanted to write a sentence or two... Anyway, I just installed Dark Messiah again to play through it for the 7th time (I think), despite having some awesome new games I haven't played or finished yet. That should tell you how much I love this game. :)			",193,24,0,4,4,0,6

												Underrated. A title that flew under the radar because of the Might and Magic name. Too different for traditional RPG fans but action-adventure fans weren't lured either, thinking it's probably just another RPG.  It also suffers because the intro is extremely dark and the combat, while not overly complicated, does have a bit of a learning curve.  I think the opening tutorial might have turned off a lot of players right out of the gate.  However, once the main story begins the atmosphere of the game changes completely and draws you in.Fun melee action or combo'ing spells with melee.  Tons of environmental use like kicking bad guys off cliffs or dropping stuff on their heads.  It's pretty linear but done the right way, including varied environments and mini bosses, and it's all tightly coupled to the story so you don't feel like you're playing just another filler level that pads the running time.  Graphically the game is starting to look dated but required very high end hardware in its day to max out, so consequently still looks quite good on modern hardware.  At the usual $5 price these days it's definitely worth it.			",80,19,3,5,3,1,2

												Ah, this game is one of my favourites.This game, is a mix of action and RPG games, in a fantasy world like Skyrim.The story of the game is very good, you have chocies to do, that will lead to a certain ending (four endings you have here, if not wrong).Be a Warrior, an Assassin, or a Wizard, your choices.Is this game worth your money and time? Yes, yes it is.			",134,8,2,7,6,2,8

												I finished it. in 8,7 hours.Of course it was singleplayer only, while the game has multiplayer mode, i don't think multiplayer will and can be finished.So if this game is really short, why am i recommend it?First of all, imo i like the characters, i don't feel forgetting/discarding easily of these characters, They actually felt alive and thus will not be forgotten so easily.While the game is made in source engine, many would say like""Wow, those physics are going to be gud""Not in my experience, although i think it was likely the developer's fault rather than source engine's fault. One of the problem is slidey movement, it's like taking your time to stop rather than a full, quick stop, in other word you'll die to gravity more than the enemy itself.And the combat is a little bit more different from most RPG games, it felt more like Chivalry style gameplay rather arcadey -i'll-just-hit-everything-accidentially. So you need to watch where you hit, supported by the different attacks even performed by a single weapon.This game is made in 2006, so you can't really judge it's graphics but i think it has good graphics at it's own age. Music felt nice, nothing special.In my experience, i've had numerous amount of crashes, i didn't really sure it was on my end or it was the game itself. Because of this i'd say this game is normal, nothing special, not bad, not great.I'd recommend buying this game on a sale, didn't think really worth it on full price. Hell i've got this for half a dollar.			",45,0,1,1,0,0,0

												Dark Messiah Might and Magic is a great action-packed Linear RPG. Graphics are good, Voice acting is decent, Storyline may be a bit lacking, but the combat is the redeeming factor. I sometimes wish that more games will adopt the combat system that Dark Messiah Might and Magic created. Running around rooms and throwing chairs, barrels, crates, etc. is awesome and not to mention kicking your enemy whether it's into his ally or off a cliff. On a side note... if you have arachnophobia be aware of the Temple of the Spider... I hear of mods that change the giant spiders into pigs, but have never tried one. I personally got through it with the audio turned off to avoid the hissing of those 8 legged monsters. I'd consider this game a bit on the short side, but Dark Messiah has enough choices, in leveling and story choices, to validate atleast 2 play throughs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is simply amazing. For an old game it has very nice graphics, interesting storyline and awesome gameplay. The combat system is really fun, especially with kicking. The game invites you to use the environment around you to your advantage, rather than just sticking to the usual combat methods. Plus it's always hilarious kicking enemies off the ledges and watch them fly XD! The other thing that is really awesome is the exploration element, there are some not-so-obvious places that you can get to find secret areas which most of the time contain very rewarding treasures. All that being said, I really wish that the game was longer, I felt it was way too short and too linear, I think it definetly deserves more. Also there are a couple of annoying glitches that are not patched, they are not game-breaking but very annoying. I would like to try the multiplayer but there doesn't seem to be many that play the game anymore. In the end, it's a very fun game and an awesome experience, I highly recommend it.

												I don't even know where to start. This game ♥♥♥♥ing ROCKS! Great setting, awesome characters. And the shining point is the combat. Played as a hybrid fighter/mage and had a blast. Ledge or staircase + Freezing spell = UNCONTROLABLE CHUCKLES. Looking around the enviroment for spikes, pits or flimsy wooden beams to kick enemies into is a great way of slaughtering those filthy orcs and undead. Also fine to pick up a jar, big rock or a broom and throw it at a necromancers bald ugly head!You can even literaly (and often) THROW A BARREL AT IT!  (Pro-tip yo, lite that barrel on fire; it's wood and burns, enemies can go up in flames)The number of different ways to kill enemies (enviroment hazards, with spells like lightning bolt and fireball, different weapons or tricks like liting an arrow with a nearby fire to make a fire arrow!) had me interested throughtout my entire play through. Also, the old school puzzle elements, secert areas and a bow that shoots a freaking arrow with a rope that you can climb where very enjoyable.I would like to come back to this game again some time in the future and try out a sneak/dagger archer build. I think that will be so much fun. The story is fantastic, and I like how both the romantic leads are manipulating the main character. It was a really tough choice for me to choose at the end. The voice acting is awesome. Moon Dailly, (the actress that voiced Xana) did a great job. Everyone else was also pretty well voiced. The only problem with this game is dated graphics, but considering its AGE this game looks freaking awesome. Even the cinimatics have aged very well. It looks decent. Not amazing but not bad either.Truely a great game in so many ways. AND NO SECOND GAME!? WTF! how this just got dropped I'll never know...BTW: If your interested in a bit more lore of this story and a couple of it's characters; check out Heroes of Might and Magic 6. In the Infernal Campaign if you make Kirie a Mage > Hellcaller You get XANA! as a companion. It's pretty cool.  ",171,78,0,120,25,2,71

												I don't really think that this game justifies the mediocre scores it achieved. It's not cutting edge - after all it uses the Source engine familiar in many FPS's. But this has got a number of novelties in it - a few extras that make you think the developers thought quite in depth about this hybrid of RPG and FPS.It's much more action focused than say Oblivion, but in doing so, sacrifices a lot of the depth of that game. Sometimes the controls are a little fiddly and the enemy manages to score hits on you when clearly they didn't. Seemingly difficult situations like a horde of spiders in their lair can simply be defeated by running in circles around them and hacking away.Dark Messiah is best viewed as a Source mod. When taken in that context, it's really very enjoyable - with some excellent dialogue and set pieces. Don't think of it as a ground breaking RPG, as it clearly isn't. But it carves out a welcome niche for itself within the genre. 7.5			",324,46,21,42,39,2,85

												One of the best hack n' slash games ever. You control the character Sareth, but you can roleplay his character to an extent, by changing the story every once in a while, and choosing how he fights. The gameplay is what makes the game so great. You can use stealth, magic, and direct combat, and excel at your favorite path with skill points distributed throughout the story, or create a satisfying mix to your liking. There are so many ways to play the game, and they are all unique and fun. All the levels lend themselves to how you have moulded Sareth, and all the different skills shine brilliantly. It will be a fun, challenging game that you will want to play more than once, and will be the most fun hack & slash RPG for a long time. ",103,11,0,11,4,0,3

												Arcane Studios second big game Dark Messiah of Might & Magic stands the test of time, by providing fast paced meele Action with great physical elements. After their Hommage to the Ultima Series ""Arx Fatalis"" Arcane created this truly unique game as part of Ubisofts relaunch of the equally important Might & Magic Franchise. The Story takes place a generation after the Story of the turn based Heroes of Might & Magic V. You are Sareth a young wizard's apprentice tasked with accompanying a expedition in search for a ancient artifact ""The Skull of Shadows"". The story is mostly a backdrop to the real core mechanics of the game. Those of the combat. You have the choice between very distinct playstyles. Charge into Meele with Magic Assistance? Use the rudimentary stealth system to sneak and assassinate your enemies avoiding their reinforcments in the process? Be a Archer that falls back on fast daggers or fast swordplay? Lay traps to soften your enemies to uttely destroy with Elemental magic?This promised and marketed Diversity of Playstyle still holds true to this day. The great level design caters to most playstyles and offers a great amount of secrets and ways to overcome opposition.All in all an amazing experience that still shows it's influence in the game systems of Dishonored and Dishonored 2.

												Not super popular and in my opinion, underrated, this is still one of my favorite games.  It's a fun balance for me of being hard enough to feel rewarding but easy enough that you can play around with the different combinations of ways to kill opponents.Really some of my favorite moments simply involved hiding in some dark corner and shooting ice arrows at the feet of enemies who stood at the top of a flight of stairs.  Goblins or necromancers just absolutely befuddled as to why the stairs are so slippery this morning and why they keep falling down them and into their goblin or necromancer friends, knocking them over in the process.  Play Yakety Sax in the background for enhanced mood.  I was once able to fire an arrow at a guard, kill him, and pin him to one of his guard buddies who still ran around looking for the person who shot his buddy who was now pinned to his back.  The ability to do that made me smile, the situation itself made me laugh, and the rag doll physics involved made milk come out of my nose and I wasn't even drinking milk, I was drinking coffee.  An arrow, a torch, a stack of barrels.  A flaming orc, more flaming barrels, lots of flailing around and catching environment and other orcs on fire and falling off cliffs.  High comedy and sure to cheer you up when your're feeling down.			",71,21,0,16,3,1,0

												This game is still enjoyable after all these many years. While the story may not be the most complicated affair out there, there are plenty of fun enemies, varied environments that make the best out of the Source engine from back in the day and a satisfying fluidity to one- or two-handed melee fights that a lot of other games (most modern games?) lack. Once you got used to kicking your enemies down a ledge or into some spikes, you'll play other first person games and wonder why no other developer ever made use of your player character's legs in that way. Intuitive and fun! I often find myself saving at certain parts in the game only to then try out all possible ways to kill all enemies using whatever traps / props / means the environment and spells/equipment one carries provide.A few of the levels can be a bit hard to navigate and one gets lost here and there, but at least in some cases this adds to the immersion, for the most part though this is a strictly linear game; you won't be going back and forth a lot. Very well worth a shot if you haven't played this yet! Just be nice to the poor goblins and orcs, I feel kinda sorry for 'em getting kicked around all day! x]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has one of the best combat systems that I have even experienced. The combat just makes sense. Find an enemy standing near a cliff and want to take them out quickly? Just give them a good kick off of the edge. Rag dolls work as you would expect. They don't fly across the map like some other games, but instead they act much more naturally. It has actually been quite a while since I last played this, so I do not remeber a ton of details. All that I remember is that the combat was top notch, and the game overall was a great experience.Definantly worth a try.Note: I never attempted multiplayer, and I'm not even sure if it works at all. Never was interested in that part of the game.I have reinstalled the game and played it for a few hours. The first few hours were pretty good. After about 3 hours I had my first crash. The crashes (so far) are not too bad. They only happen occasionally. It may get worse later in the game though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has so many equally good and bad things going for it. + Half life 2 engine still looks gorgeous. The art here is pretty generic D&D but the models are nice and the entire atmosphere is very well done. Music is moody as well.+ This game is challenging. If you turn the difficulty all the way up, it's just like playing Dark Souls but in first person! Even a single zombie can kill you. If I didn't use all the combination of weapons I had (swords, daggers, bows) and also magic, I couldn't get past even the 3rd chapter. This is NOT a game to go hack/slash in. You will die as quick as you start fighting. + The RPG elements are fun and although aren't as deep as any traditional RPG, they are fun to mess around with. I played as a pyromaniac swordsman and it was definitely fun! BUT read the final negative below point as well.+ Lots of ways to set off physical traps and kill you enemies with. For example, cut a rope holding up a bunch of logs and watch it fall down on your enemies. Never gets tiring.+ The game is barely more than 10 hours long. First playthrough anyway but because of last point, there's moderate to high replayability.+You can kick enemies into spikes and pits.- There are lots of bugs. I encountered a lot anyway. Graphical, like black boxes appearing over my spells when fired. Controls, like assigning a spell to a number on my keyboard and not having the spell come up even though I pressed the corresponding number several times. This gets very annoying especially when you're in a tight situation and want to change your weapon or change to a spell. It just doesn't work sometimes. Sound bugs, as in voice overs repeating or missing or playing in the wrong places which could mislead the player. As I said, lots of bugs.- Platforming is CRAP. It was bad in Half Life games and it's still bad here. And the fact that there's almost a high amount of it in the game makes it the more painful. You even have a bow which extends a rope down for you to climb and this gives possibilities to explore more of the world or just get past levels but the jumping and walking controls are so loose that it just doesn't work in an enjoyable way.- Most of the time your objective becomes VERY obscure and I personally got lost a lot in most of the maps simply because the exit to some rooms were so out of sight and unlikely to be where they actually are that I needed to look at walkthroughs in some places just to know how to get out of a certain dungeon.- The story is almost non-existent. Don't come into this expecting any cohesive, attractive story or ending. Even though there are 4 endings, they are alll equally predictable and not worth playing the game for. - multiplayer is long dead. Unless you have other friends who have the game on steam. But it's nothing special. Passable.- Most of the time, the game throws loads and loads of enemies at you which seems more like what a shooter would do than a game like this. Soon it becomes such a chore to manage a crowd of 5 ferral ghouls who are attacking you from all sides.- The RPG elements are fun but really unbalanced. You find so many weapons from the 3rd chapter on that you can't equip way into the game unless you were super pin-pointed towards a certain role (fighter, archer,white mage, black mage, thief). If you want to spread out a little like, say, be a white mage/thief, you're not going to accumulate enough upgrade points to truly be that until the very end levels of the game. That seems pointless to me as well as the fact that some classes like archers and thiefs will never be strong enough to take on most of the enemies in a game which is so close-combat oriented. The fact that you don't get any experience from defeating enemies but only from story checkpoints is a very bad choice to me. As you see, I can say the game has much potential and I am going to give it a thumbs up even though it annoyed and frustrated me as much as I enjoyed some of its better moments. If you're willing to risk, give it a go. I'm sure you'll find your own reason to like it. It tries to be deeper than what it is and sometimes that's both a blessing and a curse.

												(quick note: I played this game off Steam for many, many hours. I know what I'm talking about!)Dark Messiah is a really interesting case of a game being completely carried by a single gameplay element.In most respects, this game is unremarkable. It takes place in the Might and Magic universe, but bears almost no resemblance to its namesake. In fact, the only thing ""M&M"" about this game is the villain being a member of the necromancer faction. If you took the word ""necromancer"" out of the script, it would just be another generic fantasy world. The story is extremely simplistic and transparently linear; the average dialogue will be ""I am <name>. The <Macguffin> is at <location>. I will <plot>. Good luck!"" Sometimes, the only thing pushing you forward at all is the knowledge that you're in a videogame and have an objective. As for the characters... Sareth, the protagonist, only speaks to complain or prompt other characters to provide exposition (""What is <Macguffin>?"" or ""I'm tired of staring at a horse's ears""), Xana is just a sultry tease-dispenser (""You did all of this for a hug. If I were there...""), Leah is the hopeful love interest (""With you here, we should have the <Macguffin> in no time!""), and every other character has too few lines to even be described. Combine this mediocrity with a scrabbled-together Source engine full of bugs and freezes and you get an overall disappointing experience. Well, except for one BIG thing...The combat in this game is sublime. Attacks are directional, animations flow into each other seamlessly, combos feel satisfying, and the environment is RIFE with opportunities to punish your opponents, with plenty of blood and gibbing to reward you for the effort. There are three combat styles: melee, ranged, and magic, and each style has substyles (for example, melee has sword-and-board, staves, daggers, sneak attacks and backstabbing, and so on). Fighting in this game just feels good. There's one level in particular which gives you a compound full of easy-to-kill goblins and lets you wreak havoc however you wish. I won't lie, I love to reload that level and play it over... and over... and over... and over, trying out different methods for mass murder. Perhaps most satisfying is the synergy you can develop between styles. For example, you can shoot a blackguard in the leg from behind, then tear his head off while he's limping. However, the most iconic moment in this game is when you kick an enemy into a spiked wall or off of a cliff. Seriously; if you thought you already had the most satisfying kicking experience you could in a game, YOU THOUGHT WRONG. The kicking alone makes this game ""good"", and the rest of the combat bumps it up to ""memorable"".Should you buy this game? Well, have you ever wanted to kick an orc into a pillar holding up the wall of the building, causing the wall to crash down and kill a dozen orcs and goblins before they can react? Have you ever wanted to beat a crowd of people to death using the dead body of one of their friends? Have you ever wanted to slit a foe's throat and kick their dying body off of a cliff above the clouds? Most importantly of all, have you ever wanted to beat an entire video game by just kicking people into stuff? If any of these sounded like fun, you should probably drop a couple bucks on this game.P.S. The multiplayer is fun if you can get a couple people together for it. It's a real kickapalooza.

												Don't confuse this game with the other ""Heroes of might and magic"" games. This is a entierly new game. Everything from the universe to the genre is completly changed. The game plays very much like Dishonored, as Arkane studios is the developer of both games. (*cough* also a bit like the recent theif 4 game as edios kind of ripped of about everything, and then dumbed it down*cough*). This means that you can play the game like you want to play it, you can go about any problem your own way, be it sneaking, backstabbing the crap out of everything, to just improvising and just throwing random props you find on the floor. Or maybe you go about it with magic or raw strengthThis is NOT an open world rpg, and it does not try nor need to be. Much like dishonored the ""maps"" are open linear. It is a big, well designed map (that you will not find in any openworld game as it would take to much time to design), that has lots of thoughts behind it, with loads of variety. The levels can be explored and very often interacted with. I often find myself drifting around, looking for secrets, or new ways to kill enemies. ""humm that 12 meters statue looks fragile, maybe i can destroy... OH GOD ITS FALLING RUN!!"". Some parts inbetween levels are linear, be it jumping between rooftops in a frantic chase, it still feels authentic and as if it has a part in the game. The niche of this game is the phisics. Be it kicking people into spikes, throwing barrels, kicking orcs of clips you name it. Combat is fluid, active and varied. The enviroment is a weapon that you will need to use. There are lots of diffrent weapons, with diffrent ""enchantments"". The combat is not only skill in the heat of battle but also choosing the right tool for the jobb, as using a firesword to hit a demon is not the greatest idea. in other words use logic when choosing weapons. As far story goes, you are Sereath accompanied by Xana (the weird sarcastic woman stuck in your head), trying to find the skull of shadows, an ancient artifact, part of the legend fortelling the doom of mankind ""something something"".The story is fairly predicteble, but nonetheless worth experiencing. It's not bad because even though the story is a classic cliche, it is well executed. Just dont expect a bioshock infinite.This game remains to date, as one of my favorite games of all time. Good work arkane studios!  ",154,20,1,14,6,0,13

												This game is like a bad girlfriend; you just want to beat it over and over again.  Seriously though, it is one of my favorite games of all time, and I would strongly recommend it to others.  The viseral combat just feels... right; enough so to cover for the fairly predictable story and moderate graphics.  Definitely worth getting 9/10.			",131,3,0,10,6,0,4

												I bought an hard copy (DVD) of this game around 2008 and indeed I had much fun with it.  It's your standard ""Action RPG"" and the gameplay is mainly focused on melee combat, however you can use bows and magic projectiles as well. By progressing trough the game, ie. completing the quest (which are in linear succession) and killing enemies you earn experience and skill points which you can put into Combat, Magic or Mixed Skill trees. You also aquire objects. Some of these require you to have a particular skill, so choose well.Although usually the game is a first-person ""hack and slash"", you also have sections where you are unharmed (and muct avoid enemies) or you must chase an enemy through rooftops etc...The gameplay is fairly linear, this is not a sandbox or open world RPG, but it's fun. Sometimes the combat can get a bit repetitive, but it is satisfying overall.One of the main perks of the combat is the variety of ways you can kill your opponents. You can used situational hazards like fire or spikes and kick your opponents into them to kill them. You can also pick up objects such as crates, vases or shovels to throw at them, you can kick them off ledges, rooftops, etc.There is some witty humor in the game and the story, although perhaps not innovative is quite interesting. GRAPHICS: very nice... still hold up to this day... it has aged fairly well. Only problem often things are too damn dark (which is easily solved by the ""night vision"" spell you get at the beginning at the game and uses no mana)AUDIO: nice music and voice acting is decent. Only complaint is your own footsteps. If you are wearing earphones it sounds like someone is banging at the door when you walk... you simply can't immerse yourself into a stealthy gameplay when you sound like that when walking...GAMEPLAY: nice combat system, fun and satisfying, although a bit repetitive sometimes. Might be a bit tough in the beginning (getting the healing spell REALLY helps), but it's not a very hard game (not on normal difficulty at least)Also the game offers a variety of locations, which is nice.TECHNICAL: Worked fine on Windows XP and Windows 7 (when I played w my physical copy) and works fine with windows 8.1 too. Not sure why some people complain... Maybe Win10 is screwing this game too? ((many negative reviews on older games indeed relate on the fact that they are unplayable on Win10))It's quite stable (never run into big bugs)---So overall I am recommending this game. I re-bought it on STEAM (although I still have a physical disk somewhere) for like 1 US dollar or so... truly a bargain.  Normal price is like 4 dollars anyway... still a bargain! If you like action RPGs Dark Messiah is right up your alley!			",46,34,0,22,14,0,15

Interesting combat, leveling system (althrough most character developement is seen through the gear you're wearing) and most of all this game feels like a true medieval adventure with satisfying ending (which there are 4 btw).Got about 9 hours worth of game time.

Forging weapons was very cool. Finding better equipment too. The levels were good, there's a lot of mobility freedom. Combat was never boring. Xana.Things which dissapointed me Crashes, which seemed to happen when I spammed my left mouse button on a horde of orcs or ghouls. The ending, it was too abrupt and a little confusing and had no real sense of reward.Things which I would have enjoyed An open world after you finish the game.If you're hesitatating, here's my advice:If you like combat like Oblivion for example and a good ol' cheesy story, definitely get this one, just try it.

												Most will have played Skyrim by now, so I'll compare to that to save time.This game is very similar to Skyrim, but it has a few significant differences.  It is not open world, you have to follow a linear story; there's still plenty to discover throughout the game.  Character builds still touch on warrior, mage, and thief aspects, but it's almost all combat-focused.  The REAL difference in this game is the physical interaction.  Smithing, for example.  You can't smith-and-sell like in skyrim with all the complexity of a miniature free market, but you can go through each step of smithing.  You see your hands and all the objects move as they should; everything is suitably realistic.  This realistic physical detail applies to EVERYTHING in the game.  The way your arms and body (this game has full body awareness, just look down and see your body) move during combat, running, kicking, everything.  The only thing not covered is grabbing and pulling levers with your hands.  This PHYSICAL DETAIL in absolutely everything you do is intoxicating to me.  Even the environments and enemies are full of physics and interactivity.  Throw boxes and barrels, the way you climb ropes, the viewpoint as you look around actually follows your head, and even when you die the camera follows where your eyes would be on your physical body as you fall down.(Yes, it can feel a bit mirror's edge-y when you run, but the only free-running is vaulting onto things) This combined with the fantastic combat (better than skyrim's combat imo), plenty of character customization, and beautiful artistic design make the whole journey enjoyable.  I suggest playing on the hardest difficulty to make your character build choices feel like they really affect what you're doing.  (If it gets frustrating repeating areas, just play on Normal at first)tl;dr - YOUR ARMS AND LEGS ♥♥♥♥ING MOVE LIKE REAL ONES AND YOU CAN INTERACT WITH EVERYTHING PHYSICALLY HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥YES! 11/10Since I can't say it with the yes/no thumbs, I'll have to say it here :  I give this game a HELL YES!

												The combat is fun, You can get through the game hacking and slashing, Backstabbing and thrusting, or Fireballing and Frosting. But no  matter which combat style you prefer. You will be kicking it all the way. While the game has certain sections I depise, It is generally fun and hardcore mode does offer that challenge if your into it. The story isnt great, But it provides the reason why your going here, doing this, and killing that. The skill progression is nothing noteworthy. you'll see what you prefer then skill in that direction, Items, While they make a difference. ETC. Fire against enemys vurnable against fire is usually a must in hardcore difficulty, There is three occassions to get each weapon in my experience if your explorative enough.Secrets arent exactly rewarding, More of a haaa you went off the beaten track, heres a piece of armour, and two potions, You would of found these somewhere else, but here you go. I kind of lost track of what im saying in this overglorified opinion they call a review, So all in all. try the demo, If you like it, buy it, or wait and buy it on sale. if not, then well. thats like your choice.

HOW TO APPRECIATE COMBAT: read before playing.You won't like combat if you treat it like a normal game. THIS IS NOT A COMBAT SIMULATOR. It's more of a puzzle game that uses melee animations. Swords do no damage. That's because you're supposed to figure out how to get them on the ground to finish them off.Enemies are massively tough. That's because you're supposed to figure out the insta kill in the room. Shoot their heads as they go up ladders. Use the swinging chandelier. And every day is leg day!IF YOU DON'T SEE IT THIS WAY, COMBAT IS FRUSTRATING AND UNINTUITIVE. But when you treat it as a puzzle game, it becomes pretty fun.And the story and voice acting is so bad, you'll be driven insane. It's wonderful. WHERE IS DARK MESSIAH 2? Bring me it's head.

												This is really quite a hidden gem of a game. The story is tired: You are the chosen one crap, a world that doesn't have much depth unless you already know the lore of the world of might and magic, and standard fantasy fare as opponents- orcs, spiders, dragons, goblins, etc. But where this game REALLY shines is the combat.Every single fight is intense, quick paced, and fresh with every battle. There's a reason this game is known as stompy mcheavyboot's adventure in the land of spikes: kicking opponents into environmental hazards is usually an efficient way to kill almost anything. But there's so many options for combat: kick your opponents into each other, sneak up and cut ropes to activate traps, launch your opponents into huge ravines with well placed fireballs. The combat is so damn satisfying and the exploration is so gratifying that you're glued to the game. I picked it up on a sale, and this is more than worth your money.			",63,8,0,15,8,0,16

												I love this game always have since it came out beat it three times and it just keeps getting better. If you love kicking people into spikes or throwing barrels and sexy women that like telling you what to do then this is your game. It is well worth the money to buy it. Buy it for everyone you love in your family we need to show that this game still has fans and we need a squeal so throw all the money you can at it and hopefully they will notice, even tho it's been almost 10 years.

												I remember way back when this game was about to be released. The entire gaming community online was going bonkers with this game, the demo that had been released roughly a year prior had been completely broken down.It was hacked and people discovered loads and loads of hidden features and at that point unused enemies that had giant errors as skin. Everyone was waiting, including me,  and then at the day of release....Nothing, no one bought it, review sites gave Dark Messiah a horrible rating calling it less than average.Me and a friend of mine were even the first people to buy it in our country, the game sales guy was shocked that we were the only 2.And now, after so many years, it still recieves horrible reviews from critics, but I'll step up to defend it. LEt's just go over it point by point see where and how they are wrong.This review will contain spoilers but I highly recommend it if you haven't played it yet.First off, the Story.-------------------People say the story is transparent, why? Because the game is called Dark Messiah? Or how about that first cut scene, you know where you actually SEE the ending in a dream.I never can understand why anyone would say that, the game never tries to fool you.Others might say that there really isn't much story to begin with....which is also false.Most of the story actually lies in the past, things that have come and gone already, I think it has enough depth.Gameplay-----------I've heard more than enough times that the combat is repetitive, but I don't understand why.This is where Dark Messiah excels , never not once in playing it have I gotten bored during combat, fighting enemies is never the same. On the highest difficulty setting fine you know, yes the enemies have some really cheap hits, that do a heck amount of damage. But I never saw it as unfair, only that I had to be better, faster, more cunning and slippery.Everything is a weapon, going from a big Wooden Barrel, to a bucket of plain rocks.Often I found myself actually reloading a certain fight scene when it went to EASY, killing 5 vampire knights without any damage....no that didn't do it for me, so I did it again and after 40 retries I finally succeeded again.And the kick, nothing beats that, if there's a ledge someone is going down, and it never gets old.RPG or Not?-------------I wouldn't call Dark Messiah an RPG, persé. Howeverit does have RPG elements. But you don't gain skill points for killing enemies, and there's no class system.Most people really hate that about this game, but I don't. At least it's a refreshing take upon the genre, just build your own class. And if you don't have enough skills to finish your end goal...well you screwed up not the developers. The only thing that I kinda don't like is the fact that in a way you are forced to have at least 1 magical ability.Ending Good or Bad---------------------There's only one true ending, and that's the evil ending. The game is called Dark Messiah, the ending is shown to our protagonist in the beginning in some sort of vision. Even the crew of Might and Magic themselves kinda admitted to which was the real ending when they included good old Kha-Beleth in the series.Again a refreshing take, not everything has to be sunshine and lollipops with rainbows.Final score I give it a 10/10, play this, love this and enjoy this.

												Le moins qu'on puisse dire, c'est qu'on a déjà vu des jeux plus récents qui ont beaucoup moins bien vieilli que celui-là. Dark Messiah, c'est quoi, au juste ? C'est un jeu qui s'inscrit dans l'univers de Might and Magic (d'où le nom à rallonge) et qui n'est ni plus, ni moins, que l'ancêtre de Dishonored, qui est la version aboutie de ce jeu. À quelques détails près, évidemment. Là où Dishonored est un jeu clairement conçu pour de l'infiltration avec, en bonus, la possibilité de faire du combat, Dark Messiah est un jeu clairement conçu pour du combat avec, en bonus, la possibilité de faire un tout petit peu d'infiltration. Et puisque je parle de Dishonored... Si vous avez joué à Dishonored avant de jouer à ce jeu, préparez vous à rager un petit peu quand même. En effet, si vous avez joué à Dishonored, il est tout simplement impossible de ne pas remarquer que Dishonored est la version améliorée, sculptée, dégrossie de Dark Messiah... c'est à dire qu'il sera impossible de ne pas remarquer plusieurs petites imperfections dans le gameplay de Dark Messiah, qui, bien que petites, vont vous rendre un petit peu fou lorsque vous constaterez que vos habitudes dans Dishonored (notamment en ce qui concerne les mouvements du personnage) ne marchent pas dans Dark Messiah, ce qui est parfois pesant (on remerciera la poursuite du chapitre 3, pas nécessaire et mal fichue). Mais bon, si le jeu souffre un peu de la comparaison avec son successeur, comme je vous l'ai dit, il n'a pas trop mal vieilli non plus. Il a même plutôt bien vieilli, en fait. Côté graphismes, c'est propre, et c'est même assez charmant, autant en ce qui concerne les textures que les animations en passant par la direction artistique. ATTENTION cela dit, le jeu tourne sur Source, ce qui veut dire que le jeu se calquera sur la langue utilisée pour votre client steam (potentiellement chiant, surtout quand vous passez d'une cinématique en anglais à un dialogue en français tout de suite après). Niveau son aussi, rien à dire, même si on aurait apprécié une OST un peu plus marquante. Niveau gameplay, le personnage manque peut-être un peu de souplesse dans ses mouvements (ça rejoint ce que je disais sur Dishonored) mais ce n'est pas bien grave. En fait, le gameplay du jeu est extrêmement simple (First Person Slasher de base avec des pouvoirs), mais étonamment riche. On peut récupérer pas mal d'armes / armures différentes, et se spécialiser dans le style de combat qui nous plait : plutôt magicien, plutôt archer, plutôt épéiste... Sachez toutefois que les côtés ""archérie"" et ""furtivité"" ne sont pas assez fournis pour s'y spécialiser entièrement : ce sera juste un bonus apporté à votre build, qui sera déterminé par là où vous mettez le curseur entre magie et combat. On peut donc manier des bâtons, des épées, des dagues, des arcs, des boucliers, sans distinction véritable, ce qui permet de varier un peu comme ça nous plait (et idem pour les compétences magiques). En plus de ça vient se rajouter une barre d'adrénaline qui vous permet de déclencher des exécutions violentes à l'épée (quand je vous disais que c'était le prédecesseur de Dishonored !) ou de booster une autre attaque. Mais bon, si le gameplay du jeu est aussi fun, ce n'est pas (seulement) parce qu'on a des pouvoirs, ce n'est pas (seulement) parce qu'on a de la variété, ce n'est pas (seulement) parce qu'on a des mouvements réalistes à l'épée... c'est surtout grâce à une chose.Le coup de pied.Et là, je vous montre une petite vidéo très drôle qui résume assez bien à quel point on peut se marrer en jouant à ce jeu. Non seulement ce coup de pied est extrêmement pratique (c'est votre outil numéro un), mais en plus, s'en servir est super drôle.Donc malgré les petites imperfections dont je parlais au début, le gameplay est vraiment bon.Un petit mot rapide sur le scénario, enfin : ce dernier est assez bateau, et on s'en fiche pas mal, car le jeu n'est pas là pour nous proposer une histoire originale. Par contre, je tiens à dire que la narration est franchement pas mal du tout. D'autant plus que le jeu a le bon goût de nous proposer quelques choix qui influeront sur la fin, et comme le jeu est plutôt Immersive Sim côté game design, j'ai bien l'impression que les développeurs ont prévu un petit dialogue pour (quasiment) chaque éventualité, même les plus rocambolesques. Donc voilà. Le jeu a pris quelques rides, mais il vaut quand même le coup, largement !			",226,43,6,17,16,1,21

												A thrilling first person action game featuring one of the most impressive melee combat systems seen to date. Although the game is fairly linear, levels are at times open enough to allow some optional exploration, often resulting in usefull rewards that can be uncovered through the games numereous secrets rooms and pathways. There are also three branching character paths the user may choose from, allowing for different play styles, and some replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really really wanted to play this game but it just refuses to work not only does it have a SecureRom issue Windows 10 does not support this so you have to use a no CD patch just to get passed the SecureRom issue then the game will ether run the logos or just wont startup at all and when i did finally get it to start-up it was just constant crash after constant crash and wouldn't even make it passed the intro without a crash and i ended up browsing online looking for tips ad fixes and there was very few and non fixed the problem leaving the game unplayable and I tried this game on multiple computers with the same results which is a shame as i really was looking forward to playing this but as of now I don't recommend it as it's just completely unplayable well on newer systems anyway if you have an older pc system with an older operating system like XP or 7 you may have some hope but im not sure but as for modern systems don't buy as it wont work unfortunately			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can get it cheap, go and get this game. It's essentially an FPS/RPG hybrid in the vein of Deus Ex or STALKER. Though it's single-player only and clocks in about 12-15 hours of gameplay, there's a ton of replay value because of the many RPG options and arguably one of the best first person melee combat systems I've ever seen in a game. Disarm opponents, knock them off cliffs, light them on fire, throw objects to topple them, or just plain gutstab them and kick 'em in the face.			",239,34,3,7,9,0,19

												Actually it's a good game. It's based on sourse, but it's an first person RPG, Oblivion-like. And though it has a small skills tree, the game offers you a nice variety of tactical solutions for your battles, you can impale enemies on spikes, push them off the cliffs, cut ropes so stuff fall on their heads, throw random objects at them, stun them and finish them off later... There is plenty of options and I didn't even mentioned the half of them, also there is a grappling bow, so you may climb some difficult to reach places and a pretty decent variety of weapons of all kinds. There are couple of points I'd like to mention to you first:1. Game is linear. You may choose your approach to the situation as you wish, but it's a straight-line story you'll follow.2. Choose your class wisely. Warrior, assasin or mage... Though it would help to have some extra perks from other classes trees, points are given for completing parts of the main story, so I'd suggest to invest them in the build that suits your gamestyle the most.3. Keep all the stuff you'll find. You never know when you could need it.4. Secrets, puzzles, hidden loot, etc. Be observative.5. Use your surrounding to your advantage, you won't always be able to win by brute force.			",435,59,4,47,45,4,68

												An action-adventure taking place in a fantasy world and all this with Valve's Source engine! I liked how varied game they developed - you can be a master of swords or become an archer or simply stick with magic. There are a lot of traps here and there which means the game lets you use the environment to kill your opponents. For example: you kick a support beam after which a dozen barrels are dropped on your enemy. Or you can sneak up to those standing near cliffs and kick them down into the abyss. This environmental combat is what makes Dark Messiah a unique game. Looting exists but you cannot really equip that many weapons - it is as if the creators wanted to put the system there as it was a requirement for an RPG anyway.Putting the insignificant looting system aside Dark Messiah is a very good fantasy game. If you love Might & Magic you can pick up its FPS iteration: you won't regret it.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												HOLY @#%$!! I think that sums up how I feel about Dark Messiah.  I've been looking for a game with a good, immersive combat system (where you have full control over direction of attack/aim), rpg elements, and at least graphics I can stomach.  This game delivers in these areas better than I would have ever imagined.  Why there isnt 100's of clones for this game is beyond me.  I must admit I have only played the game approx an hour, so I will come back for a full review.  So far it's the best $10 I've ever spent.			",32,2,0,3,3,0,2

Excellent story and character progression with some great set-pieces.2.  Well-made combat with enough environmental situationality to keep it constantly fresh (even though Normal is too easy and Hard is too difficult)3.  Well, it's old, so reasonably cheap and definitely worth a tryPerfect for fans of Dishonoured; I realised they were made by the same people before I checked who made each.

												This is a gem from the last era in PC gaming and must-play material for any fantasy or adventure game enthusiast. The simplicity of the structure of the game is both decieving and rewarding; There are at least 5 viable and engaging ways to play the main character of the story and each of them is fun. Add in a few twists depending on the choices you make, more than one ending and several difficulties and you're looking at hours of fun. The secret areas and special items you can find and pick up earlier on in the quest do a lot to make the experiences of exploration and discovery. Took me 25 hours to clear this game the first time poking around every room and corner looking for secret goodies. Probably 20 hours straight through. Large and small bosses, tons of neat physics, traps and environments that force you to make changes in your items and spells to adapt mean you're going to enjoy Dark Messiah. Take the crystal, Sareth; This is but a first small step on your journey...			",306,41,2,78,15,0,33

DMOMM is a good game, that just misses the mark of been great. Let me start with the story. You take the role of Sareth – an orphan who is train by the wizard Fenring. Years goes by and finally our hero is tasked to deliver a crystal to another wizard named Menelag in the city of Stonehelm. But before you leave master Fenring summon a woman name Xana, who will be your guardian and she settle in Sareths head. When you're getting closer to the city you see people leaving because army of Necromancers are about to attack. And they do and Sareth saves the city … for now. After the battle you meet Leana, niece of Menelag and the wizard himself. Sareth goes to sleep and in the middle of the night he is attacked and here start your adventure. The story is the big minus of the game – it is so predictable. The other thing is the stealth. There is no point of using it, which is a shame, but game is design  around to fight, not to sneaking.There is some rpg in DMOM and it's not deep. You earn skill points by doing tasks and you distribute them in three categories. There isn't big skill tree and some people won't like it, I personally don't mind that much. It would be better if the developer put little more variety in the skills.The combat is what I like most. It's is somewhat repetitive, but awesome. At your disposal they are swords, bows, staffs, daggers, shields, magic all their pluses and minuses. When clicking the left mouse button you perform normal weak attack, but if you hold it you execute power strike, which do more damage and depending of your movement the animation is different. While battling the enemies adrenaline meter is filling. When it's full you can kill enemy with one hit and it is gory. Lets not forget the mighty kick. In a lot of cases enemies will stand near a cliff, fire, spikes and you give them the boot it's instant death.The magic spell are nothing new or exiting. You can freeze, shoot fireballs, lightnings. The most useful spell for me is Charm. There is nothing more satisfying of making group of enemies killing each other.  The level design is great. You will walk in to caves, island full with ruins, sewers, castles. Exploration is rewarded, they are a lot of hidden stuff.There is a decent variety of enemies, but their design is generic. You will encounter humans, orcs, dragons, goblins, zombies, spiders, cyclops and the most annoying enemy – ghouls. Most of them has some weakness, but not the ghouls. They are just annoying. The game is hard. If you walk right in front of more than two-three enemies, most likely you will die. Use the weaknesses, set some explosive traps.Despite some shortcomings DMOMM is good game and I definitely recommended it.			",310,73,9,43,10,2,35

												story-driven compared to oblivion, but came out around the same time and is another great first-person fantasy rpg. It's currently on sale, so I suggest you grab it for 2 and a  half bucks at a steal.  Keep in mind, like with oblivion, to play with a gamepad you will need to use software like pinnacle game profiler (frequently on sale for 10 bucks for lifetime license) or xpadder or joy2key. joy2key is free, I think xpadder may also have a free version, if you have pinnacle there is an official (pinnacle official) pad profile downloadable in the program and custom ones are available on some sites.  But anyways, it works great with kb/mouse and is a fun, solid first-person combat rpg experience. The multiplayer is p2p and I Believe it's still able to be used if you go through some trouble to find people and host or have them host, but don't expect to be able to use the multiplayer as the game is pretty old by now. It looks as good if not a little better than oblivion in some ways though, in spite of it's age and plays as well. Many of the combat mechanics are better than oblivion's too in my personal opinion.			",407,76,4,85,14,0,62

												I have played the single player and it was great. I like how the game provides several ways to engage your enemies. For example, the obvious way is the hack and slash method which is very straight foward but I chose any high ledges I could possibly get my feet on and shot away with arrows using an ""endless quiver"" I found within the game.  You can also change your methods and weapons for engagements as you please. Some enemies are best to engage in hand to hand (sword, dagger, staff, etc), others with the Bow (fire damage, ice damage, poison, etc) and some require the use of magic to defeat. There are several ways of not only killing your enemies but also eliminating them quickly either kicking them off cliffs, stabbing them from behind, kicking them into traps, activating traps while the enemy move across the area, etc. You can use the environment to your advantage or it can literally kill you if you're careless.It's a good game all around and it provides you with a few choices within the game; optional objectives or alternate endings based on certain choices throughout the game.

												It's fun at first, when you're kicking guards all over the shop and punting them off high ledges, but this wears off soon enough and all that you're left with is a generic fantasy game with uninteresting characters and a plot as dull as dishwater. The game is split up into ten chapters/levels. The first four - five at a push - are great fun. They allow the game mechanics (especially the kick attack, oh baby) to really shine and I had some of the best fun I've had in a video game in a long while. Unfortunately, you spend the rest of the game navigating claustrophobic dungeons fighting boring enemies. Overall, Dark Messiah is the product of wasted potential. There are some really great gameplay and level ideas present, that, like I said, flourish primarily in the first half. I'd strongly recommend getting this game on sale as I did, because you'll probably justify the price tag from the fun you'll have booting guards into campfires and orcs off cliffs. It's just a shame it becomes more of a chore nearer the end.6/10 ",128,18,0,7,9,0,11

												Hard to pick a recommendation. The game itself seems pretty decent, for its age, so I want to give it a thumbs up. However, I played about half way through and then I hit the dreaded ""frame rate issue"" in chapter 5 - locked in at 10 fames per second. Seems that people hit this issue in different places, so I could only guess at the cause. Nothing I can do gets past the problem. I've heard that the DVD version may get past the issue. I'll have to see if I can find a downloadable version. I don't want to have to pay for this game again as Steam won't issue a refund because I've played over two hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the right price, it's an OK buy.Combat is too easy in the beginning, but too wacky in the end.  For example, staffs are great at the beginning, but they require magic affinity later on.  Eventually, they're awful since enemies move way too fast (such as ghouls and vampire knights), so those magic affinity points are wasted.  You don't really need them even for casting spells since mana potions recover mana at a fixed 50 mp/potion.  Daggers are the weapon of choice later on, but early on, you really can't assassinate everyone, especially when playing on hardcore.  Going stealth really doesn't yield many combat options aside from equipping stronger daggers and armor, but later on, you don't care anyway since you're just slashing like crazy to land hits on those fast enemies anyway.  Archery's mad weak.  Don't even bother going for headshots.  They don't count.Magic is only good in the mid game.  In the beginning, spells are too weak.  In the end, they're strong, but only against individual enemies which means it doesn't help against packs (until you unlock inferno and sanctuary which are way OP, but only if you land the initial hit.  If you miss, then you might as well just reload your quicksave since you'll be dead before you know it).  The story's kind of interesting.  It makes you really think about good and evil since the plot isn't straightforward.  Good guy orcs that fight against not so bad demons is a neat angle, and in between is a powerhungry necromancer leader who's trying to stop a prophecy from coming true.  You can really think about why you're doing what you're doing.  The story never really explains why your father is locked away by dragons either, and it makes you wonder if his ""demonic"" heritage is only opposed based on what he looks like.  There's no real indication that the demons did anything ""bad"" to deserve getting locked away.Also, the rope bow gives a lot of exploration options, and combined with the burglary skill, you can find a lot of helpful loot.  Actually, you'll end up throwing a lot of gear away just to make space for future discoveries.  The game seems to offer the chance to play through in many different ways, but ultimately, you really can't.  You use staffs in the beginning, daggers later on, and a few support spells (freeze, charm, and heal) to carry you through......and all the while, kicking enemies off a cliff, into a fire, or into a wall of spikes is still your coup de grace.

												Intro:Dark messiah does not feel like a linear adventure game with their backpack and level system. It's more like an FPS/RPG(I woudlnt say action rpg).Longevity and difficulty:It does not take too many hours to beat it, but it's worth it. Play at very hard and i bet you won't survive. I tried it on hard mode, but you still have to limit yourself if you want your hard mode to be challenging. Limit yourself(a game is never too hard):So if you want your hard to be hard, you should not unlock healself and do not use weapons that do exactly what a spell does unless you want to do a quick speedrun. At the very least, drop the ice bow and lighting shield.Combat:One of the best combat system. The enemies and the ai are strong and smart enough to beat you in a duel. so imagine when 2 of them jumps on you. This forces you to sneak first before you engage. It forces you to use you spells strategically to kill a couple before you jump on the last few of the room to kill. Thus, it forces you to use your environment and front kicking your opponent on a spike like a mortal kombat's fatality. Speaking of fatalities, you will most likely kill your opponent with a fatal blow and you must build up your meter for that like a super meter from street fighter.Story: Il say it now, don't play for the story. The immersion is there and everything, but the story is not that good. The ending is one of the worse. Verdict: Buy the game. It's unique and this game probably influenced most first person slashing games after that. It was very unique when it came out in 2006 and it still feels that way.  ",62,0,0,9,1,0,1

												The Best Kicking Simulator you could ever spend your money on.I think the reason reviewers ragged on this at the time, was that because of the game's pedigree, they wanted a serious RPG.  Instead you got an incredibly enjoyable action game in which you spend your time dropping goblins into traps and kicking orcs off cliffs.  The reviewers are right about the story and script being garbage, the same overly serious, overly cliche and sexist garbage that has defined Might and Magic since Ubisoft acquired it.

												Dark Messiah is mostly known as ""the kicking game"", and while that isn't an inaccurate description, there's more to it than that. Most people only know Arkane Studios for Dishonored, possibly without even realzing that Dark Messiah still influences things to this day, like the Deadly Reflexes mod for Skyrim, because its combat was so fun that very few other games have managed to match it. The game uses the Source engine's physics in the combat arguably better than even Half Life 2 itself did, letting you pick up almost anything in the environment and throw or kick it as a weapon, use telekinesis magic to turn anything from flaming corpses to pies into projectile weaponry, smash environmental traps to send things falling onto enemies, and of course the ever-famous kick, allowing you to stagger and kick your enemies into environmental hazards or off cliffs. Along the way you can put skill points into buildling your character for stealth, magic, or standard combat, each of which are equally fun and viable. The story isn't really its strong point, but you'll be too busy kicking things to care much. If you liked Dishonored and you haven't played Dark Messiah, you should probably fix that.

												story-driven compared to oblivion, but came out around the same time and is another great first-person fantasy rpg. It's currently on sale, so I suggest you grab it for 2 and a  half bucks at a steal.  Keep in mind, like with oblivion, to play with a gamepad you will need to use software like pinnacle game profiler (frequently on sale for 10 bucks for lifetime license) or xpadder or joy2key. joy2key is free, I think xpadder may also have a free version, if you have pinnacle there is an official (pinnacle official) pad profile downloadable in the program and custom ones are available on some sites.  But anyways, it works great with kb/mouse and is a fun, solid first-person combat rpg experience. The multiplayer is p2p and I Believe it's still able to be used if you go through some trouble to find people and host or have them host, but don't expect to be able to use the multiplayer as the game is pretty old by now. It looks as good if not a little better than oblivion in some ways though, in spite of it's age and plays as well. Many of the combat mechanics are better than oblivion's too in my personal opinion.			",407,76,4,85,14,0,62

												I have played the single player and it was great. I like how the game provides several ways to engage your enemies. For example, the obvious way is the hack and slash method which is very straight foward but I chose any high ledges I could possibly get my feet on and shot away with arrows using an ""endless quiver"" I found within the game.  You can also change your methods and weapons for engagements as you please. Some enemies are best to engage in hand to hand (sword, dagger, staff, etc), others with the Bow (fire damage, ice damage, poison, etc) and some require the use of magic to defeat. There are several ways of not only killing your enemies but also eliminating them quickly either kicking them off cliffs, stabbing them from behind, kicking them into traps, activating traps while the enemy move across the area, etc. You can use the environment to your advantage or it can literally kill you if you're careless.It's a good game all around and it provides you with a few choices within the game; optional objectives or alternate endings based on certain choices throughout the game.

												I don't quite know what it is about this game that keeps me coming back to it. (At least twice after my initial playthrough.) I know nothing about the Might & Magic world or the other games set in it. I'm sure there's more story the characters and events in this game. I hope so since the story felt a bit disjointed and incomplete. I was put in middle of events I have no idea why they happened. The characters were never properly introduced either. Or built upon.But the gameplay. There is that little something in the gameplay. I can't quite put my finger on it but best I could describe it is solid. This feels and plays like a very solid game. What that means I'm not too sure. I have no problems with any of the gameplay mechanics. I just love how the gameplay feels.The graphics, despite being an old game, still hold up just fine. It has that old time 3D feel but that's just fine. I think it adds to the game. It is also worth noting that this is a very linear game. There is very little exploration to do. And I dislike most linear games.I really like this game. Every time I think about it I get the urge to try it out once more. The story isn't all that interesting to me and graphics just do their job. It's the combat and overall gameplay that keeps me coming back. But I just don't know why.If this ever goes on sale again I definitely suggest picking it up, just don't expect a great story. Even so this is one of my favorite games among such popular hits as Trine 2, Mirror's Edge, and Psychonauts as you can see from my profile showcase. I feel like this is a very underrated and unknown game.If you're a game designer or a wanting to be one I suggest you check out this game. Perhaps you could take apart and analyze why this gameplay feels so different from all the other sword and sorcery RPGs. I genuinely  think there is something to be studied here.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 1.5/5Gameplay: 5/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 2/5Replayability: 4/5Aesthetics: 4.5/5Visuals: 3/5Atmosphere: 3.5/5Music: -/5 (I don't remember.)

												This game has the best combat system I've ever seen. You can use the enviroment to help you in combat. For example you can trigger traps, throw objects on your enemies, or kick them to water/from stairs, impale them on spikes, or climb above them and shoot them with your bow. As assassin you can hide in shadows and backstab your enemies. As wizzard, you can freeze your oponents, make them smaller or cast ice on earth and watch them as they slip on ice. You don't have to learn skills from one class, so you can learn anything and become anything you want. Some people say that it's useless to learn some skills, because the kicking is the most powerful weapon in game. It's not true. It's more effecient to be for example  assassin(and of course, it's more fun).Game is linear, you cannot stray, but there are four different endings.You have been possessed by a demon which will help you and say funny comments on some situations in the game(and she's got sexy voice). The story is simple but good. The maps are very well designed. The atmosphere is different from location to location. Somewhere it's peaceful, elsewhere it's calm, or dark, or little disturbing.The game is from 2006, but still good looking. Textures aren't high quality, but the illumination is perfect and enhance atmosphere. Music is mix of orechstral and industrial, someone can say it's dark fantasy.  You can find soundtrack on youtube. Sounds are average. Water sounds like water. The characters have very good voices, even the supporting characters. There are also ambient sounds. There are very good and further enhance the atmosphere.Dark Messiah is the most underrated game I've ever played. It definitely should have second part. I played this game three times and it's still fun. There was still places that I didn't see in previous playthroughs.Many people were dissapointed becasue they thought Dark Messiah is RPG. It's not. It's action game with RPG elements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Curator-esque Review A great first-person RPG that demonstrates you don't need complicated skill trees or a plethora of side quests to have fun.  This game gets the basics right and is rewarding for the player no matter what upgrade path is chosen. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic Review (Spoiler Free)  Story When the original MM series ended with The 3DO Company, Ubisoft bought the rights to the franchise and began to reboot it.  Dark Messiah was one of the first games rolled out and while it shares the name, it does not share any lore with the games prior to Ubisoft's acquisition of the franchise.  Players take the role of Sareth, apprentice to the wizard Phenrig.  The story starts with Sareth as a young adult, sent to collect a special crystal as his final test from Phenrig.  After doing so, Phenrig sends Sareth on a journey to the city of Stonehelm to deliver the crystal to Menelag, a friend of Phenrig.  However, Phenrig does not send Sareth on this journey alone.  Before leaving, Phenrig uses his powers  to summon a companion for Sareth to travel with known as Xana.  Xana melds herself into Sareth's body and becomes his source of advice, much like Link and Navi (only sexier).  When the two finally reach Menelag, they learn he is searching for a special artifact called The Skull of Shadows.  Unfortunately, Menelag's journey to the island where the Skull is hidden has been delayed due to necromancer attacks on Stonehelm.  Sareth's arrival in Stonehelm proves advantageous though and after a few setbacks, Sareth makes it to Skull Island.  But terrible visions begin to plague him and Xana begins to speak cryptically.  To make matters worse, the leader of the necromancers is pursuing Sareth and seeks to use the Skull for his own reasons.  Can Sareth recover the skull in time before this prophecy everyone is talking about comes true?  It is entirely up to the player how this story ends. Gameplay Dark Messiah is played from a first-person viewpoint.  This has lead some to compare it to Skrim or other high-fantasy  first-person games.  While most of the game is combat and exploration, it is important to note that Dark Messiah is a linear experience.  It is closer to Half-Life 2 in terms of its level structure and closer to Chivalry in terms of its combat.  Level design is very good nonetheless and once you get the rope bow, things really get interesting.  Sareth's body is fully rendered, meaning you can look down and see your feet and what you are currently wearing.  You can also look around without reorienting Sareth's body, scale ledges if you can jump to them, climb ropes/chains, and even swim underwater.  In Dark Messiah, skill points are your upgrade means.  You gain skill points through the completion of objectives and the killing certain ""boss"" creatures.  Killing average enemies does not net you skill points, meaning you need to spend them wisely.  Sareth has three skill trees to dump points into: Combat, Magic, and Miscellaneous.  Combat allows you to use special attacks, aim better with bows, and use weapons with skill requirements.  Magic is all about offensive, defensive, and status effect spells.  Miscellaneous deals with stealth, health improvement, increased mana, and poison resistance.  No matter your skill point build, enemies are very hard to kill in this game, even the spiders.  Awareness is your strongest tool in combat.  Enemy standing by a ledge?  Kick him off.  Barrels just lying around.  Pick one up and throw it at an enemy.  Oil pots?  Throw one at an enemy and light him on fire. Got the freeze ability?  Shoot a patch of ice on the floor, laugh as a guard slips on it, then impale him as he writhes on the floor.  Sam Fisher?  Pick up the corspe of your back-stabbed enemy and hide it in the shadows.  Many rooms have physics booby traps and cutting ropes/kicking supports often leads to some hilarious kills.  The combat can be infuriating at times and a Mage build really does'nt work as well as you might think.  You'll have the most fun with a Melee build or Stealth build.  Every build has unique weapons and clothing to find though so pay attention for secret areas.  Also, food is health so if you're injured just eat three cured hams, two strands of raw garlic, a mashed banana, and five pies.       Each of my three playthroughs took me around 10 hours.  There multiple endings to the game and while I have not seen them all, I can say some are very similar.  I have not tried the multiplayer component of the game but its is 8 years old so I would not expect a thriving community. Design A testament to the versatility of the Source Engine, Dark Messiah should not be ignored for its age.  One area the game is lacking in terms of presentation is facial animation for its human characters.  The Pre-rendered cut scenes are OK but, anything in game feels a little awkward.  But you won't be spending a lot of time staring at faces thankfully.  Exploring abandoned temples and underground catacombs is quite enjoyable thanks to great lighting, sound, and visual effects.  Sareths's spells give off light and each sound unique, wood splinters and groans, water drips deep underground, and wind blows in high up places.  Music is just right and not overbearing.  Voice acting is great for the most part with every actor playing their part well.  Weapons, shields, and armor each look very different from one another.  Every melee weapon type has its own animations.  Sareth even holds his arms and hands in different ways depending on what spell you are about to cast.  Objects have weight as you would expect from the Source Engine and as I alluded to above, ice and fire behave as you would expect them to in a high fantasy world.  Being a Source Engine game, I was able to run Dark Messiah at high settings without any problems for the most part.     One problem I encountered with the game was the frost and poison daggers.  For some reason, when I equipped these weapons, I had a massive FPS drop.  Fooling with AA seemed to resolve the issue but it would never stay solved.  Another problem I encountered was every time I quit the game, it crashed and I was forced to close the program.  This did not have any effect on the game at all but to anyone reading this I recommend saving  before  you quit the game rather than saving  as  you quit the game. Final Comments A fun first-person RPG with challenging combat, good level design, and a unique story that is not Skyrim?  Dark Messiah's your game.  Nab it on sale if the short campaign discourages.  Once you play it through, I think you'll agree that it has elements you wish would show up in games more often.  What you see is what you get, and there's nothing wrong with that at all.

												Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is a first-person hack 'n slash game based on the Source engine and placed in the world of Ashan - the same one where Heroes of Might & Magic V takes place. This game is basically what would happen if you mixed Half-Life with Elder Scrolls - an on-rails first-person fantasy adventure.The game is a little bit old, but the graphics aren't very weary. I would say that even today they look very good, with details put both into enemies and weapons alike. The location design is also great - most of the time you'll spend in dark, moody catacombs and dungeons of sort, which can strike a bit of fear into your heart considering you don't really know what lies further ahead.The plot is good enough to be interesting, but somewhat predictable, actually. The dialogues is what makes it stand out - the voice acting is good, and Xana has to be one of the most interesting Mission Control-type characters in video games. Mostly thanks to her sarcastic remarks for most of the game.Gameplay-wise, it focuses almost entirely on exploration and combat. There is a lot of options you are given for fights - whether you want to kick your enemies into pits, spikes, sneak in and backstab them, sling magic spells, or just get out your sword and hack them to bits, it's all up to you. There is also a skill point system where you can buy new abilities - you'll get enough to buy most of the more useful skills, so it's all up to you whether you want to be a standard fighter, archer, mage, stealthy assassin, or a hybrid of any (getting a healing spell early on makes the game a lot easier).The game also has a multiplayer mode with a few different gamemodes - most of which are focused on team battles with five classes: Warrior, Archer, Assassin, Priestess and Mage.Unfortunately, since the game is old and based on Source engine, you can expect it to have hiccups here and there. I got framerate problems once and the game crashed a few times during combat, but nothing too painful.Overall, this game is a very good first-person hack 'n slash. I recommend it to anyone who liked games like Might & Magic or even Half-Life, if they don't have anything against swapping out guns for swords.			",100,18,0,17,2,2,5

												This game really deserves a sequel or spiritual successor. The first person sword fighting is good, satisfying and possibly the best of its kind (haven't played Dishonored yet). There are some issues with hit detection, and Flurries (your main attack, but you'll probably be using power strikes most of the time) is pretty crap, but apart from that the melee combat is done pretty well and has a good sense of impact and physicality, whether you're blocking a strike with your shield or kicking an enemy. The RPG elements, which let you use magic and stealth as well, and environmental weapons (wall spikes, fires, flimsy wooden supports that can be broken to topple barrels and crates on enemies etc.) allow for different approaches to each battle. The platforming is also decent. The game isn't perfect of course. Some sections of the game don't cater well to a specific build, boss fights are dull and in some cases (usually when they fly) annoying, and some of the enemy types aren't nearly as fun to fight as others. There have also been complaints about the plot, characters and voice acting, but I wasn't bothered by them.Basically, if you're looking for good first person sword fighting and physics in a fantasy setting then Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is the game for you.

												Dark messiah is one of my favourite games ever. the combat mechanics are second to none (still) and the game looks pretty amazing. While at launch it was plagued with bugs, most of these have now been ironed out leaving one of the best story, fun and exciting games ever. This is one of the very few games that i actually finished multiple times. The multiple endings are a bit rushed but i don't care. Getting there was an experience that i repeated multiple times. I currently just enjoy using the cheats, give myself full poweres and explore the different levels and how i can complete them.This is a truly awsome game			",316,59,13,26,21,2,41

												One of my alltime favourites.Used to play it ALOT back in the days when it was released in 2006.Great story, awesome physics for a 2006 game and fun combat!But the one thing which was the best part of the game was the multiplayer mode. Unfortunately Ubisoft turned down support after a few months, but it was soo much fun.If you like a game where you can choose between being a wizard, a knight, an archer or a rogue - buy it! It's totally worth it!			",86,13,2,19,5,0,4

												Good gameplay and interesting story with plot twists if you don't mind the graphics.The best thing about the game is the gameplay. There are many puzzles, and when you have to fight, you have lots of ways to approach (or evade) the enemy. First, you do this by choosing your skills (melee, archery, spells and/or stealth). Then, you can fight your enemies using the traps in the environment, you go past them with stealth or kill them silently, and you can combine these strategies with blunt force and a good mixture of weapons and spells.8/10 I recommend for those that are looking for a refreshing gameplay experience.

												I've just completed this game. For the first time, despite having played it as far as at least 9 years ago.Why? Because the plot is just... let's just say it's so bad it's just irrelevant to any sane player. Don't even bother following it. The setting/vibe is kinda nice, reminds me of old-school RPG games, that's M&M alright.However, the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. This game is over 10 years old and it still has one of the best combat systems I've ever seen. That's why most people who bother to play it never get to the ending. They don't have to, simply because they have what is best right from the beginning: combat.How is it remarkable? I'd explain, but I think a video - which wasn't made by me - is gonna be more expressive than a thousand words uttered by me:

Oh, and if you're worried this game has aged too much for you to bother with it - no, it hasn't. Trust me.By 2017 standards, my rating is:-graphics: 5/10 (that has aged, indeed, although they aren't offputting)-sounds: 7/10 (voice acting is kinda mediocre, and once you hear Leanna, you'll want to plug your ears with something... although Xana is just as obnoxious with her ""edgy"" commentaries)-gameplay: 9/10 (plotwise, your choices don't make much sense, there is very little character development, but less is more, if it's polished - and it is, if you ask me)OVERALL: 7,5/10One con: be prepared for crashes while loading the game. I mean, some people report that this game crashes on other occassions, too, but I only had crashes while reloading savegames for any reason. Oh, and multiplayer is dead. Which really does suck. But it's still worth it.			",153,22,4,22,20,3,16

												It's fun at first, when you're kicking guards all over the shop and punting them off high ledges, but this wears off soon enough and all that you're left with is a generic fantasy game with uninteresting characters and a plot as dull as dishwater. The game is split up into ten chapters/levels. The first four - five at a push - are great fun. They allow the game mechanics (especially the kick attack, oh baby) to really shine and I had some of the best fun I've had in a video game in a long while. Unfortunately, you spend the rest of the game navigating claustrophobic dungeons fighting boring enemies. Overall, Dark Messiah is the product of wasted potential. There are some really great gameplay and level ideas present, that, like I said, flourish primarily in the first half. I'd strongly recommend getting this game on sale as I did, because you'll probably justify the price tag from the fun you'll have booting guards into campfires and orcs off cliffs. It's just a shame it becomes more of a chore nearer the end.6/10 ",128,18,0,7,9,0,11

												At the right price, it's an OK buy.Combat is too easy in the beginning, but too wacky in the end.  For example, staffs are great at the beginning, but they require magic affinity later on.  Eventually, they're awful since enemies move way too fast (such as ghouls and vampire knights), so those magic affinity points are wasted.  You don't really need them even for casting spells since mana potions recover mana at a fixed 50 mp/potion.  Daggers are the weapon of choice later on, but early on, you really can't assassinate everyone, especially when playing on hardcore.  Going stealth really doesn't yield many combat options aside from equipping stronger daggers and armor, but later on, you don't care anyway since you're just slashing like crazy to land hits on those fast enemies anyway.  Archery's mad weak.  Don't even bother going for headshots.  They don't count.Magic is only good in the mid game.  In the beginning, spells are too weak.  In the end, they're strong, but only against individual enemies which means it doesn't help against packs (until you unlock inferno and sanctuary which are way OP, but only if you land the initial hit.  If you miss, then you might as well just reload your quicksave since you'll be dead before you know it).  The story's kind of interesting.  It makes you really think about good and evil since the plot isn't straightforward.  Good guy orcs that fight against not so bad demons is a neat angle, and in between is a powerhungry necromancer leader who's trying to stop a prophecy from coming true.  You can really think about why you're doing what you're doing.  The story never really explains why your father is locked away by dragons either, and it makes you wonder if his ""demonic"" heritage is only opposed based on what he looks like.  There's no real indication that the demons did anything ""bad"" to deserve getting locked away.Also, the rope bow gives a lot of exploration options, and combined with the burglary skill, you can find a lot of helpful loot.  Actually, you'll end up throwing a lot of gear away just to make space for future discoveries.  The game seems to offer the chance to play through in many different ways, but ultimately, you really can't.  You use staffs in the beginning, daggers later on, and a few support spells (freeze, charm, and heal) to carry you through......and all the while, kicking enemies off a cliff, into a fire, or into a wall of spikes is still your coup de grace.

												Combat is nowhere as good most people here claim.Kick action is sometimes unresponsive. Using environment to your advantage is fun to some extent but god, melee combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥without power attacks. You deal little to no damage even after around 10 - 20 quick slashes.Stealth is not well implemented either. You can't use stealth in well lit areas (which is logical) but dark parts of the game mostly consist of tight corridors which does not allow you to sneak behind your enemies much.Magic seems fun but it is limited to a couple of spells really.Navigating environment in game is like in old Tomb Raider games, guidance is close to none.Making circles in an area trying to find what you are looking for gets really annoying after a while.Deleted game around chapter 5 and decided to watch non-commentary walkthough video in Youtube for story's sake.TL;DR: Not much of a fun game, don't waste your money.

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #38 - Dark Messiah of Might & MagicI played a number of the very early Might & Magic Games.  In particular I remember playing a ton of Might & Magic VI.  I remember it as a role playing game before the Heroes of Might and Magic series overshadowed it with a completely different type of gameplay and focus on strategy.Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is a different beast altogether.  It's not a turn based strategy game like Heroes is.  But it's also not an RPG like the original games either.  This is more of an action RPG, with an emphasis on the action.    You do have some RPG aspects, for example the game provides 3 skills trees, one for melee, one for magic, and a third for other skills.  The early skills are cheap, so it's easy to dabble in each of the skill trees.  I found this to be good because I was primarily focusing on melee, but early on I found it extremely helpful to train a heal spell.  I noticed I wasn't really healing on my own, but I would slowly get mana back, so being able to trade mana for health made things a lot easier.Even with the skill tress and RPG elements, I still consider this game pretty RPG-lite.  If you are looking for an open-world type game, this isn't for you.  The story is linear and really the game feels more like an adventure game with an emphasis on combat than a typical RPG.  This may sound like a turnoff, but the combat is actually a lot of fun.  I really liked the feel of combat.  It isn't just smashing buttons or turning on auto-attack.  Another nice aspect to this game is the interactivity with the environment.  The game encourages you to kick the crap out of your enemies, either into a fire, or into a convieniently placed spike rack, or over the edge of a railing.  In fact arguably your foot is the best weapon in the game, at least from what I saw.Probably the most fun I had in my hour of play involved a chandelier.  I cut a rope which caused this chandelier to start swinging around.  Meanwhile I had about 4 guards chasing me.  I'd run past the chandelier while it was on it's upswing, and the guards would stupidly follow me without paying attention and get smacked as the chandelier came back down.  It was kind of ridiculous as I'd watch the guards body ragdoll it's way across the room as if it was hit by a wrecking ball.  After about 3 laps around the room, I had killed all of the guards by chandelier.My only complaint about the game was it was rather crash prone.  It crashed 3 times on me in the hour I played.  Once it crashed on startup, once it crashed as I was quitting the game, and once it crashed in the middle of the game.   Perhaps this is from me running Windows 10 (the game came out for Windows XP).  Looking at other reviews, this doesn't seem to be a common issue, so it may just be something specific with my setup.Overall, the combat alone is enough to make this game fun, and to earn my recommendation.  I did not check out the multiplayer version of this, so my entire review is only based on the single player game.			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												Pros:- Great combat mechanic- You can get creative with the rope arrow physics and make your own shortcuts - Using physics to reach places you shouldn't is often rewarded by secret rooms and items- Level design was goodCons:- The story and voice acting could've been done much better- The game does crash ALOT*The game crashed about 7 times on loading screens between areas and 3 times mid combat on my first playthrough*One of the levels had a huge framerate drop ""from a solid 120 to 15 fps"" that i solved by saving and loadingIn conclusion, I did love playing this game yet I cannot in my right mind recommend it due to its constant crashing...

												I'll give this game a tentative 'endorse.' I ran my first playthrough as a thief with some archery. While rough, it eventually became awesome stealth-one-shotting enemies after an ever uphill battle. I figured for sure a second playthrough as a fighter-mage would be even more epic, if thief ended up so well done. But really, I'm on chapter 9 now with that character, and it's pretty bad. For the most part, the magic is incredibly impotent by end game. For being called Might *AND MAGIC* it's a pity to see magic really only good for healing. On the contrary, I find myself increasingly just bashing enemies to death left and right with the fighter abilities I took and keep on trucking against the hordes.Overall, worth a playthrough or so. Just don't go in expecting to be some kind of omnipotent mage by the end - that WILL NOT happen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A forced union of two personages from opposing factions gives birth to an unlikely hero. Parents separated, mother dead, raised by foster family, apprenticed into the basics of wizardry. You are tasked to deliver a mysterious artifact to a guy who then dies, like, a few hours later. His hot niece, who totally has a crush on you, helps you retrieve the artifact from the bad guys. She dies. Or she doesn't. Anyway, in order to get even, and fulfill your destiny, you must find and use a skull. And then you die, but not really. Because your conscience, which also totally digs you, brings you back to life and triggers your mega-evolution. You can continue on the pokemon path, or choose to cleanse yourself of the annoying voices in your head, and then you get some hot lewt good vs undead. You kill some more guys, and then another guy, and then you can choose to either watch a cutscene, or the other one.But srsly, I recommend it with all my limbs. If you haven't tried it before, you will notice similarities with Arkane's previous first-person slasher, Arx Fatalis. But with more emphasis on melee&ranged, and a simplified magic system. It features some damn awesome melee combat. Slashing, backstabbing, kicking, is just too damn fun. Also connects with the HoMM series (5th), but I won't say how because spoilers.I give it a 9.75/10, but only because it makes me want to backstab people while walking down the street. Can't have that, man			",666,205,19,126,56,15,121

												I'd give this game a 8/10:It features a versatile combat system, where you can make extensive use of traps, physical objects squashing enemies and so forth. Futhermore, the story is told pretty well, but it references some Heroes of M&M V characters and events, making it possibly a little confusing in terms of who-is-who.All in all, I found the game to be quite amazing. So why only 8/10? Because of the bugs that still exist and that will likely never be fixed. I experienced nothing game-breaking, but it ranges from nuisances (i.e. the game crashes everytime I quit for me), over bothersome things (I had for instance some common shield in my inventory I could neither use nor drop, thus it just blocked one slot in the inventory), to real bugs (example: somewhere in chapter 9, you have to jump into water in a rather dark tower. For some reason world reflections caused the entire screen become white and the game was unplayably slow. I had to turn off reflections to see anything and to be able to play again).Neither of those bugs is a real deal breaker, but the amount and versatility of them is truly annoying.

												This game is nearly ten years old and I consider it a timeless classic.  I played it when it first came out and still play it once a year or so. The things you can do in this game are incredible to say the least.  From using the enviroment to kill the bad guys to trying out different ways to get from point a to point b.  If you've never played this game, play it.I only wish there were more mods for it to increase replayablity.  P.S. Even the demo is worth playing a few times.			",184,27,3,43,32,0,19

												This game is for when you just want to slaughter creatures in a street fight style. The game is worth 5 buck as it stands on Steam.  If you can get the hardcopy version from when it fist came out it's way better.  The Steam version doesn't have the frantic, run screaming or get smashed by a cyclopse. Nor does it have the shoot zombies for two-n-a-half hours just to get through a door. But it does have a bug fix for the NPC you have to keep alive. She no longer walks back and forth like a duck in a shooting carny booth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Messiah (which, if I'm right, has basically nothing to do with Might and Magic) is a pretty wierd game. It's basically a first person shooter, except medieval, so they had to do a lot of work on making melee combat interesting. They largely succeeded, honestly. It is totally fun to kick dudes around and into spikes and off cliffs, and the first-person movement and combat all looks and feels really good. It was an early Steam game, though, and people didn't like Steam, and there were issues with the multiplayer, and the voice acting and the plot are TERRIBLE, though, so it's sorta been forgotten. I think it doesn't deserve that at all. 4/5			",759,224,23,90,104,9,146

												One of my favorite games of all time.  I think it has the best 1st person melee out of all the games ever made. It has a few glitches like enemies hitting you when they are facing the other way or hitting you when their limbs aren't even moving.  But other than that it's the best ever.			",90,23,4,6,11,1,1

												A VERY Good Singleplayer Game. Its innovative and quite Imaginative. In its gameplay, definetly not the Enemy Variety. Orcs, Spiders, Goblins and Vampires, Zombies and Necromancers. If there were Skelletons, all ... Oh wait, the final BossYep, all Generic Enemy Fantasy Types are in this Game. Which isnt a bad thing at all. Enemies have different Strengths and Weaknesses.Story is a bit too easy to guess but good nontheless.You get your fair share of Different Endings, 4 to be clear and a few ingame decisions. Which is basically one, and you can decide at which Point you do them.You can decide to be good and get a Powerful Weapon or be Evil and turn into a Demon Xenomorph,  including Tail, Claws and running on all 4.No Classes, free skilling and the amount of Skillpoints you get is very fair and Balanced.Weapon Variety is big and this is one of the few games where you can actually fight with a Staff which is pretty damn Badass. The First Person Weapon animations are Fluent and look really impressive.Hitboxes are spot on and only a centimetre next to an enemy makes you miss and curse over and over as Enemies can dodge and avoid your attacks easily.The Game pretty much Forces you to use the Physics Engine. Every Room has an easy way to kill enemies. Spikes on the Wall? Kick them in it. Fighting in a stairwell? push them down. A Candleholder floating over the Room? Cut the Rope and crush them. You get the Point.Dont expect a good Ending though. All Endings end in a Poem like the game starts, leaving you in a Cliffhanger what might happen.The Game is great Honestly. Not Perfect. It needed alot more Love put into it and some gameplay changes to make it better.Definetly worth buying. Even when its not on Sale.			",287,55,5,34,27,4,26

												Honestly pretty lame but kicking orcs off bridges never gets old soCombat is great, imo, but the hitboxes seem off at times and I kind of hate that the only options to kill someone is knock them down and wail on them or use a power attack and have, what seems to be a chance, to stab them. Option 2 being kicking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of their nuts and knocking them off high surfaces or into conveniently placed spikes which is INFINITELY FUN. :^)In the end, it's worth the money in my opinion.Nutshot/10			",112,25,2,32,8,0,3

Product received for free
												Loved this game ever since i had it on DVD.the system of it all was very well done and unique.the ""secret"" locations were a good thing to find.- great Combat system- great physics- pick your own way to approach your style of combat.- even the magic system/effects are brilliant from a game of its time!- Kicking / 10- Goblins- the ONLY thing I would have to dissagree on this game is that its not more open world than it could be. BUT to be honest, it sets the line of what SHOULD be open world and how to tell a story.i would honesty ABSOLULY LOVE a Squeal to this stand alone title, it amazed me on how good it is and still upholds its underrated reputation.

 Tl:dr If you can't decide to if you want buy this game here's what you get:A great game with an good but not very original story, Half-life like gameplay and some crashes.The story is good but not very original so it feels a bit cheasy altrough the game take itself seriusly, the only problem except that is that the ending was kinda anticlimactic. It's not an open world game but it gives you many diffrent ways to complete the level(mainly stealthy or guns blazing) wich transcends fluently into each other and keeps the storytelling consistent. About the crashes wich occurs with the game, it's nothing major but you will probably have the game crash on you about 6-9 times during a complete playtrough, this isn't relly a big problem as the game on default autosaves consistently so you most likely wont loose any progres. This game is a hidden gem and is a great buy for anyone who likes rpg's.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember playing this game back in ’06 when it came out, I enjoyed it back then and I have to say I enjoyed it now.  I picked it up on sale for a couple bucks and it was worth every dime.  The game play is excellent, takes a bit to get used to, but overall enjoyable.  The re-playability is good since playing as a warrior, stealth type, or mage changes the gameplay so much that it keeps it interesting as you play through it again.	Graphics are a bit dated, but I still found some of the vistas they displayed where excellent, they reused a lot of textures and character models, but overall not terrible.  	The difficulty levels you will find to be a bit of a jump from normal too hard.  I played through as a warrior the first time, and when I finished I started up a mage.  I found myself using the environment more and more on hard, which seems to be the key on hard, use your environment as much as you can.	The levels where pretty linear, but with the addition of the rope bow you have more directions to go and it added quite a bit to the experience.  Overall a great experience and one that you won’t regret if you are into action RPG games.			",125,12,1,34,10,1,16

												My buddy bought this game for me when this first came out.  I totally never played it / nor installed it.  I just installed it and let me tell you.  Fighting system/sound/level up system was ahead of it's time.  It holds up well for playing it 2016.  Something that doesnt hold up - Story/Dialogue.  Gameplay has you using the environment along with dueling one on one.  For the price and for the enjoyment you'll get, I highly recommend this game!  4/5 (great swordplay/sound - horrible story)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice Half-Life 2:ish linear and scripted FPS with fantasy elements. In the end it becomes a little bit too repetitive and thus more boring. The story line carries over the dull moments. I did not see much bugs mentioned in the reviews from the period of game's actual release. I had had the game on my Game Library for many years, but now eventually I decided to give it a try at last, and was worth the time. I finished the game within a couple of days.The game's melee fighting system was first of its kind and very sophisticated, better for example than of The Witcher 1.Some remarks of critique. The choices one makes could have had a huger impact, but thinking of the post-HL2 time it was released, multiple choices still is worth, maybe of an another playthrough. The ending was a bit dissapointment. It was short and a bit ""flat"" after all the big expectetions one had built during the playthrough.Nevertheless, I recommend this a bit old game for all enthusiastics. It took ~16 hours to go through for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This was badass I hope they make another with even greater artwork, story, etc.  It was a very linear story with not a whole lot to see, but what you do see is awesome..  when the multiplayer was actually active... it was pretty damn fun.

												If you're looking for a hidden gem, you've come to the right place.If you're looking for a tripple A game that is perfect, gtfo.Heres a TL;DR for those in a rush:This game is much better than the console. If you've played this on the console and hated it, buy this version. Why? One simple reason: Unlike the console you are NOT restricted to choosing a class. The goods about this game are: Physics are utilized, despite being linear there are multiple ways to take on missions and groups of enemies, fun to explore, combat is fun, pretty much everything is fun in this game.Whats bad about this game: Pretty old, sometimes easy to get stuck/lost.Buy this game, its worth the money and has replayability. Detailed review:I remember getting this game for the console when I was younger and feeling like I missed out, due to you having to choose a class before the game start. Choosing your class determines what skills you can and cant take, and what weapons and armor you can and cant use and it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off that 1 of the 4 classes were locked off until you beat the game (or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that). When I came across this game on steam, I almost passed it up beacuse of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the console made this game seem. But at the time I was going to lose my internet in a few days so I decided to download it. Once I lost my internet (for maintenence reasons), I played this game. Holy hell was it fun. I could take what I want, when I wanted. Do you want to kick a dude into a nearby hazard (firepit, spike trap, off a ♥♥♥♥ing cliff/mountain), do it. You want to stab him? Yolo. You want to be a sneaky character that uses magic? Or how about a guy that is focused on combat that uses staves? You can do it. Whats good about this game is that the combat is satisfying, and feels right. The fact that, despite being linear, you can still explore and sometimes even get lost. This game truly makes you feel like a protagonist, where you start off as an average joe but the more and more you level your skills, find (and even make) your own weapons, the more and more powerful you get. The level design is great. Not the best, not the worst, but good enough to have fun with. Be it using the environment to kill your enemies, sneak around, ambush, its just fun. The graphics are pretty poor and are nothing to write home about, but i feeel as if it fits the game. There is multi player, but I never checked it out. Something worth mentioning is you can really do what you want with this game, and as far as building your character for combat/utility, its almost as flexible as how Oblviion was in that reguard. Though it is discouraged through the rarity of certain items, it is possible. For example, I was able to build a mage that wore heavy armor. Was it hard to beat the game that way? Yes, very hard, but I found it fun. I might have always been running out of mana, but it wasnt impossibly hard, just hard enough to pose a challenge. While building something more forward like a warrior with a sword and sheild, or a sneaky character using daggers will do you justice, the game will still be challenging enough. The difficulty of the game is almost perfect. It punishes you for not using the environment to your advantage, punishes for poor skill, and punishes for blindly mashing the attack button. Also, the story is pretty good in my opinion. Dont ask me if the lore is friendly or whatever because outside of this game I have no clue about the lore of the might and magic universe.However, with all the amazing things this game brings, there are of course some bad things. The graphics are pretty bad. They are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Bugs do happen. Not often, but often enough to note. No game breaking bugs thankfully. Despite this game being extremly fun, its pretty forgetable. Also, the end of the game feels... kind of disappointing. That might be me just being an♥♥♥♥♥ but thats just me.I still reccomend this game though. Buy this game right now. However if you come across the console version of this game, do everyone some good and burn that copy.			",130,16,0,23,3,0,1

												Story wise? game is really underwhelming. but in where it lacks it also excelsThe sound design and combat system for this game is really amazingand considering how short this game is helps it be a really fun game to start and finish over on weekends.Sounds go indepth as much as to really imerse you in the game and this game takes combat to another level.requires you to use just a little bit of thought to get around obstacles and defeat enemies that might be waaay above your skill level.This game uses the environment around you to help make a play pen worth playing in.Kick down platforms while hiding to bring enemies to a halt.Magic is really simplistic but goes a long way.overall 8/10 would probably play again if i have the time.

												If you're a fan of System Shock 2, get this game.  Don't ask questions.  This game very much uses the System Shock 2 formula in all of it's gameplay.  Secrets (rewarding ones), cyber modules, skill trees, 1st person combat, inventory management, equipment, limited resources, damage and armor types, the ability to make the game hard on you if you make a poor character.  All the bells and whistles.  The story is kinda meh, but everything else is good.  It might not be as great as System Shock 2, but it's a good experience, and worth playing through.----------------------------------Now let's talk deeply about the game.If I were to pick out one large flaw, it would be the melee combat.  It's a bit dated and missing some things, like dodging and impactful attacks.  I kid you not when I had to beat a single soldier to death with my combat staff about 20+ times before he died.  I was playing on hard, as I figured normal would be too easy.  Maybe on normal they have a more reasonable amount of hp.  You'll probably figure this out, but the easiest way to get through head-on combat is to kick baddies into spikes or flames, killing them on impact.  I don't particularly like that, as it feels cheap and gets stale, but this is the weakest point of the game we are talking about and it is somewhat avoidable.  Let's get onto the good points, now.The good news is that there are multiple ways of building your character.  Stealth has been most enjoyable for me, as the game has fairly good stealth mechanics, and you can one-hit baddies with a backstab (doesn't matter how high their hp gets).  It's a little bit easy, but I do have to earn my kills by not being seen, so I'm cool with it.  Wizard seems to have powerful spells, with some utility as well, such as telekinesis, mind control, and trap-laying.  Archery also seems to be supported, although I have not personally done a archer-only run.  It does sound fun, though, so I will certainly get around to it.The game has quite a nice survival element to it, if you avoid the healing spell.  I'll admit, once I got the healing spell, all survival was thrown out the window.  I had infinite mana and that meant infinite health.  However, without the healing spell, you will run out of health, if you are too careless.  I personally enjoy this more, as it feels more challenging and feels more akin to System Shock.  It makes the secrets and items laid around the world have an impact, since a lot of them are food or potions.  But hey, if you're in for the experience, rather than the challenge, the healing spell is there for you. It's very easy to obtain and will make the game much more of a breeze.  The game is quite difficult without it.Secrets!  I love secrets!  A relic from an old age of gaming, and for some reason they feel less prominent than in the old days.  This game is full of secrets.  They range from finding awesome gear earlier than you should, to finding healing supplies that you may be in dire need of.  It's great really, because it encourages us to really explore the world we are playing through.  It's great to find a secret switch that opens a compartment with a pair of daggers that deal 4x the damage than the starting daggers do, on the first level, wink wink.  Some secrets are only obtainable by a rogue with picklocking.  Others are obtainable through telekinesis with the mage.  It's just like those days of System Shock, hacking terminals, finding gear hidden in an unreachable place.  Good times.Finally, let's talk about the gear you can find.  There are maybe 5 or 6 different weapons in each category.  It's not necessarily linear in progression, as some deal more damage to different types of creatures.  Lightning works well on demons, fire on normal beings, and holy on undead.  There are also normal damage weapons, which don't specialize in anything, but are better on average than the specialist weapons.  There are also some unique weapons, such as poisonous weapons, freezing weapons, or life-stealing weapons.If you're a fan of System Shock 2, get this game, don't ask questions.  It's very much of the same spirit.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then maybe pass on this game.  It's quite old, quite difficult, not really casual-friendly.  I imagine if I gifted this to a new-age gamer friend of mine, they probably wouldn't like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is all you can await from a first person high-fantasy setting game.The world you play in is the typical might and magic world with it´s knwon factions of humans, undead,...., whereas in this game only the factions infernals, humans and undead play a role.Aspects of the gameStory: The plot can be written down in two sentences and all characters are as dull as they can get, but if you are ok with this the stroy won´t do harm to the quality of the game.Gameplay: FPS with focus on melee, but the combat is fast and cleverly designed. Especially the usage of the environment is in this game in my opinion even better than the one in HL2.Graphics: A bit worse than HL2 and the characters look a bit stellar, but it can still hold up, due to it´s great setting from Stone-cities, to beaches and old caves/ruins. All you need in a fantasy game.Verdict: The game is worth it´s money, also i would recommend to wait till the next sale, because the game always drops to 2,5 to 1,25 dollar, which is a brilliant deal.

												Loved this game ever since i had it on DVD.the system of it all was very well done and unique.the ""secret"" locations were a good thing to find.- great Combat system- great physics- pick your own way to approach your style of combat.- even the magic system/effects are brilliant from a game of its time!- Kicking / 10- Goblins- the ONLY thing I would have to dissagree on this game is that its not more open world than it could be. BUT to be honest, it sets the line of what SHOULD be open world and how to tell a story.i would honesty ABSOLULY LOVE a Squeal to this stand alone title, it amazed me on how good it is and still upholds its underrated reputation.

 Tl:dr If you can't decide to if you want buy this game here's what you get:A great game with an good but not very original story, Half-life like gameplay and some crashes.The story is good but not very original so it feels a bit cheasy altrough the game take itself seriusly, the only problem except that is that the ending was kinda anticlimactic. It's not an open world game but it gives you many diffrent ways to complete the level(mainly stealthy or guns blazing) wich transcends fluently into each other and keeps the storytelling consistent. About the crashes wich occurs with the game, it's nothing major but you will probably have the game crash on you about 6-9 times during a complete playtrough, this isn't relly a big problem as the game on default autosaves consistently so you most likely wont loose any progres. This game is a hidden gem and is a great buy for anyone who likes rpg's.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember playing this game back in ’06 when it came out, I enjoyed it back then and I have to say I enjoyed it now.  I picked it up on sale for a couple bucks and it was worth every dime.  The game play is excellent, takes a bit to get used to, but overall enjoyable.  The re-playability is good since playing as a warrior, stealth type, or mage changes the gameplay so much that it keeps it interesting as you play through it again.	Graphics are a bit dated, but I still found some of the vistas they displayed where excellent, they reused a lot of textures and character models, but overall not terrible.  	The difficulty levels you will find to be a bit of a jump from normal too hard.  I played through as a warrior the first time, and when I finished I started up a mage.  I found myself using the environment more and more on hard, which seems to be the key on hard, use your environment as much as you can.	The levels where pretty linear, but with the addition of the rope bow you have more directions to go and it added quite a bit to the experience.  Overall a great experience and one that you won’t regret if you are into action RPG games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's made by the guys that made Dishonored, but instead of punishing you for not approaching a situation stealthfully, it provides you with cliffs, fires and spikes for you to kick people into.I wouldn't even recommend going for the stealth abilities, as the AI can be a bit dumb and immersion breaking when you crouch right in front of them and they can't see you. It's plenty of fun playing with the combat moves, archery and magic abilities.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pirated the game a year back and instantly fell in love with it. Has the best first person swordplay mechanics to date (easily beats chivalry). The magics and other combat mechanics are also well thought. Downscales amazingly from 1440p and even 4k. Graphically this game is on par with many games that have came out from the past 2 years. I highly suggest buying this game straight away, if not for the story then for the kicking mechanics.10/10 would do another kick only playthrough again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, in my opinion rocks. It's a splendid first-person adaptation with a very action-oriented control set. There is a delightful variety in abilityes/skills/spells, for the type of game anyway, and a goot spattering of secrets. The story isn't particularly incredible, but the game has aged fairly well considering its time!You can use a variety of weapons, stealth, freeze enemies, kick them into spikes/over edges/underneath breakable roofs, etc.It carries the M&M moniker but it's really more of a first-person run around and beat 'em up, contained within the M&M mythos, of sorts. Think more like the older Crusaders of type game and whatnot. Definitely would recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, I find it hard to find a good RPG today, but I acidentally found this gem and man am I glad I did, It has a great story (especially compared to other games that are suppossed to be near all story), the gameplay is amazing and I honestly would rather play this than things like skyrim and overwatch.Also, you can kick your enemies into spike walls, fire, and off cliffs. The screams are great 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for a nostalgic trip to the past of PC gaming, this will fit the bill, albeit briefly. It has all the trappings of oldschool PC gaming like no map, no direction, clunky movement, clunky combat, goofy looking (blocky, rough) NPCs, etc. It looks old and feels old, it may use the same engine as half-life but it is not even close. It is what it is, good for 1 play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly good for how old it is.While there's room ofr improvement, the storyline is better than average.The game mechanics are solid and consistent - all enemies use the same types of attack available to you.The puzzles where decent - difficult enough that I accidentally found ways around some of them, simple enoguh, with enough alternatives, that I could find ways around the ones too hard for me.The ending felt a wee bit rushed, but on the whole, a fun, solid romp.

												This is the game I think of when you ask ""A first person rpg done right"". This is the combat system oblivion should have had. It is however, not an open world RPG. But more of a story driven RPG that railroads you along a certain path. There are some moral choices down the line, however these affect the game only slightly. The only complaint I have is its horrible Multiplayer. It is dead for a reason. Which is a shame, it was a nice concept.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very nice game! Graphics tend to look a little old now but the game is very enjoyable. The idea that you can knock your opponents back is a great addition in battle. The game is filled with good ideas. The story is not a revolution in writing but it's good. For 5$ bucks the game is well worth it!I haven't finished it yet but i'm really enjoying myself!

												The combat is really interesting and fun. It allows the player to be creative in most awesome, gory and funny ways. But I couldn't enjoy this game because the story is bad. Story (in RPG) is the most important part for me. If the story is not good, then it doesn't matter how great the gameplay is. But, again, I really enjoyed the combat mechanics ... I envy those gamers who can ignore bad story telling.

												Combat is fun and one specific cliffside level on the 5th chapter was also well designed. Other than that the game quickly falls flat. Difficulty curve ramps way up for no reason in the 6th chapter which is where i had to quit the game because of not enough healing items to progress further. Level design is terrible. Doesn't give any direction on where to go and i found myself having to use a guide just to progress. Had to use cheats because the game glitched at one point and i couldn't progress further. The game gets to a point where it's constantly throwing enemies at you that do more damage than you can do to them and it gets frustrating.Environment traps are encouraged by the game for the player to use but in some situations i found that these simply didn't work or were badly placed.Story and characters are barely there and the characters started to get annoying after the first 30 minutes. Was really expecting more from a game using the source engine, regardless of the age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												!!!DO NOT BUY THE STEAM VERSION FOR WINDOWS 7 64bIT!!!Many players including myself experience gradual FPS drops resulting the game reaching sub 10 FPS - some reported the game playing like a slide show (I had 8 FPS at one point). I have tried multiple fixes from various Steam threads, forum posts, and  PC Gaming wki. The game is apparently patched to 1.02 per the Tilde console which was supposed to fix FPS issues but a config file in the game folder says otherwise. Downloaded patches from the Internet (which are no longer on Ubisoft's website) doesn't recognize the Steam version.I dont remember having issues when I first tried the game a long time ago, but I didn't get far and when I came back, it was fine until I reach a certain point. One work around was able to get it running back to 60fps and even 90s, but it started to drop again, which many assume is due to a memory leak. I even tried using a third party program to increase the memory access size for the game, suggested by PCGamingWiki (Large Address Aware) and that did not resolve the issue for me. I won't say that these workaround will not work for you, but it is very likely they won't.I have fortunately past the time frame to refund this game, so I will have to resort to other means.The Disc version can still be found on Amazon and probably a downloadable iso if you look hard enough.

												During this game, I found myself experiencing a strange feeling. I coulden't quite put put my finger on it until I happened upon an area in which I could make an item. Then it hit me: 1. the game hadn't shoved this fact down my throat with a red-hot poker. 2. the game did not in any way tell me that something could be done in this area. 3. once I had figured this out ON MY OWN, the game did not let me know HOW to do it, so I had to use MY BRAIN. 4. once I did it, I was rewarded with a sword that was tangebly better than my current one. Thus I realized that THIS GAME DOES NOT TREAT ME LIKE I'M MENTALLY HANDICAPPED!All this took place after a very fun, yet challanging rooftop chase, and before the game dropped me in front of a ship and told me to board it without dying, after which it expected me to Errol Flynn my way through every enemy on it, which I did happily with my new sword that I got myself and wasn't forced to swallow whole with a red-hot poker.GET THIS GAME.

												During this game, I found myself experiencing a strange feeling. I coulden't quite put put my finger on it until I happened upon an area in which I could make an item. Then it hit me: 1. the game hadn't shoved this fact down my throat with a red-hot poker. 2. the game did not in any way tell me that something could be done in this area. 3. once I had figured this out ON MY OWN, the game did not let me know HOW to do it, so I had to use MY BRAIN. 4. once I did it, I was rewarded with a sword that was tangebly better than my current one. Thus I realized that THIS GAME DOES NOT TREAT ME LIKE I'M MENTALLY HANDICAPPED!All this took place after a very fun, yet challanging rooftop chase, and before the game dropped me in front of a ship and told me to board it without dying, after which it expected me to Errol Flynn my way through every enemy on it, which I did happily with my new sword that I got myself and wasn't forced to swallow whole with a red-hot poker.GET THIS GAME.

												I originally played this game on the Xbox, on PC its no different. I think this is a great underrated game that any fan of first person RPG's can get into. It's very fluid and the physics also work well. I bought this game when it was on sale for a couple bucks so if it goes on sale again I'd recommend buying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Come for the kicking stay for the stealth.Frankly this one of the most unintentionally funny games I've played and at times it's also genuinely fun to play. That said it's not without an abnormally large number of problems I'll be getting into. The game runs like butter in 4k maxed out (Source engine game from 06 after all) and the visuals have held up well overall thanks to some fancy lighting effects and general visual flair and well as a reliance on physics that would make Half-Life 2 blush. The lip sync is great and the animation is decent even though that's primarily because it's a Source engine game and you'll often recognize some canned animations reused over and over if you've played other titles on the engine. Faces are a mixed bag with some humans looking great and others obviously not being capable of and facial animation. All the monsters look great but the people aren't all well detailed and are sometimes more ghoulish than the beasts you encounter funnily enough.One thing that could have made up for the wonky animations would have been good voice acting but unfortunatley that's another thing this game lacks to a frankly laughable degree. Things like he ability to see your feet and phyisically use your hands to pick objects up in the world (In addition to some slightly sickening head bobbing) make up for that quite a bit and can make it incredibly immersive at times even if you'll see your sword floating out of your hands or just walk past all the enemies like I did. The overly drawn out tutorial followed by a long drawn out linear opening are a few issues that keep you from getting into the meat and potatos of the game but during this time you'll have held every useless object in your hand (if your me) or destroyed everything with your awesome kick.There is stealth, there's magic, swordplay (You can dual weilding daggers, using a sword and sheild, just a sword or a staff all of which can also be used to block with), archery and donkey kong which is my preffered playstyle. The most effective weapon is the♥♥♥♥♥♥lying on the floor. You'll find yourself mostly jumping on enemies as it ragdolls them even when they are already lying down, picking up a body to block attacks, kicking people and generally being merciless as enmies limp away only to get kicked. While kicking has limited stamina it's quite useful as ledges and spikes are everywhere. It kind of reminds me of Theid with the whole game feeling like a source engine version of that title for better or worse.It's biggest problem is the lack of polish which only effects the 2 of the 3 most important things in the game those being the the gameplay and story. It's a wee bit janky and the occasional badly compressed FMV's are another thing that makes it a chore to sit through. In Half-life 2 if you got bored at least you could climb around the room and throw stuff. Funnily enough NPC's actually react twoards your bad behavior for the most part outside of cutscenes but then the game will reload a past checkpoint after you've been chastized even if all you did was throw a bottle or jump on someones head. I guess this is also because unlike Half-Life 2 you can ALSO kill pretty much anybody which could have lead to some awkward moments if you walked into a room and accidentally killed off an important charcter needed for progression.I disliked everybody I met in the game which is why it's a bummer I can't just kill everybody all the way until the end of the game. Regardless the price is right and I advise anybody who hasn't already to pick it up as there is a lot of freedom in terms of what means you use to progress.I don't know if it's really good or really bad but overall I reccomend it.Oh and Ubisoft AND Arkane had a hand in it whcih probably explains a lot.

												KICK EVERYTHING!  Kick them off cliffs. Kick them into spikes.  Kick barrels into enemies.  Kick shrine offerings into the pit.  Kick that annoying nagging NPC into demon-hell for the True Ending.Be prepared to enjoy unique, open level designs with plenty of hidden areas.  First person combat mechanics that mix spells, range weapons, and melee all together.  And it works.  This is the combat you wish Skyrim had.  Some stealth is also possible although you cannot bypass most fights.  Instead use it to gain the initiative and pick the encounter location.The story is decent too, with four possible endings and some real choices to make.  It's unfortunate more games have not emulated Dark Messiah.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Posted elsewhere in 2010, since I revisited this game recently, I feel the need to post this here.Dark Messiah could have been an excellent (though still extremely linear) game. For one, the game's combat is probably one of the best uses of melee combat in a FPS, with excellent hit detection (but still not perfect) and combat that puts lots of importance in good use of the environment. It works for a bit, but then after a while something simply feels off and it does get boring if this isn't the first game you have ever played. The game gives the illusion of having varied way of playing through it. The warrior, mage, and assassin archetypes are all present with the addition of archery. Now these ""classes"" aren't static in anyway as you don't pick who you want to be at the start of the game. Instead you are awarded character points for completing objectives with which you are able to allocate to three different character traits: combat, magic, and ""other"" (which consists of stealth skills, stamina and mana boosts, etc). Because there are a finite number of character points available, you will need to place these points in each category with care, as being a generalist in this game will simply make it much harder. However, the care needed to put points in some categories is further increased due to the simple fact that many of the skills and the ways of approaching this game are simply a waste of time (in that they are useless) or are completely un-entertaining. An excellent example is in the ""stealth"" route of character creation. For one, the game is far too linear for implementing any real semblance of ""stealth"" game-play, and the only real use for stealth is for scoring one-hit kills on unsuspecting enemies (which are great, because after playing ""through"" this game many times, sometimes it is nice to be able to avoid a drawn out confrontation). The problem is, there are very few hiding places and opportunities to use stealth, because even if there are shadows to hide in the place usually is very narrow hallway. If you have some space to maneuver, the places are usually very well lit and makes it hard to sneak anyway. In all, putting any points in this skill is an utter waste simply due to map design.Archery, like stealth, is also unsatisfying and character points are best spent elsewhere. Unless when used in conjunction with stealth, arrows do very little damage, and you will only be able to get in two, maybe three, shots in before the opponent is in your face before you need to switch to a weapon with the ability to block with. Sounds easy, but switching weapons requires a lengthy withdraw from sheath animation and by the time you pull your weapon out you already lost lots of health in the mean time. Granted, this danger could be avoided if you pull out your weapon earlier, but that would sacrifice the ability to fire more than once… so in the end, really, there is no need for archery in this game unless certain things were tweaked.The tweaks about to be mentioned would also benefit melee combat as well, as using a sword/staff/daggers (why are daggers in fantasy games always in pairs?!) because combat in this manner also suffers from issues.Weapon damage in this game is too flawed. Quick strikes simply do no damage at all, now it does make sense they are weaker than power strikes, but hacking an enemy in the face should at least some effect. As a result, there is no reason to quick strikes, and you'll mainly rely on strong strikes and kicks, neither of which do any real damage either. This simply makes the game an especially grating experience on harder difficulties as you receive far more damage from attacks but still inflict very little unless you use power strikes, but being extremely slow, you'll get hit many times before you can strike yourself. This could have been easily remedied with a sidestep or back dash system of inputting a direction twice and quickly hopping in the direction at the cost of a fair portion of your stamina. You know, spice up the combat, something this game needs. This is where more flaws come in, the power attacks only come in two or so animations in a game with pretty precise hit detection this is an awful combination.The weapon swings in a set path, and with it the camera jolts with the swing, the result: you have very strange attack animations, with limited functionality in battle as the swing arc is a such a strange plane it will often miss your intended target. It is really hard to accurately portray this, but if you were to pick up a staff (the ""crowd control weapon"") and use it's power attack, you'll see first hand by what is meant by attacks being unresponsive. What could have remedied this would be a simple directional input plus attack button scheme which would result in a different kind of attack. Step to the side for a sweeping attack, forward for a power overhead strike, back for a stab attack; you know to spice up combat and do it in a logical and intuitive manner.Blocking is yet another sterile facet of combat. It is always the same animation, and it is uninteresting to perform (though in dispensable). What could have been done to make it far better is incorporate better animations, maybe more depth to it (like needing to block directional attacks) and adding the ability to actually parry attacks. How that would work would be simple (and intuitive) like the directional attack idea: direction plus block button when timed versus an attack would bat away an enemy attack allowing for you counter attack with your weapon or kick. I believe this feature and the directional attacks had they been included in this game, Dark Messiah's combat would have been epic, but alas, innovation isn't attempted nearly often enough. Kicks are a great tool and are probably one of the highlights of the game. They allow you to clear paths, kick enemies off ledges or into spikes and fires, and break through an opponent's guard. But since swinging your weapon is either too weak or too slow, so the last example is, for the most part, pointless. In fact, the combat outside of kicking, combat is so ineffective and stale, you are better off playing through just blocking with your weapon and kicking your enemy to their death. Once again, here is another transition that leads to yet another flaw of the game.The combat is so boring, and the developer seemed to notice this as well, that the game is over reliant on using environments to kill the opponents. So much so you will find spiky wall thingies everywhere for some strange reason. It gets ridiculous. Luckily, many of these spiky wall thingies happen to be in some of the more interesting maps (albeit linear) in a FPS to date. The Orc fortress and cliff side houses being the high point (stupid pun intended), and offer a great many ways and places to kick enemies off of ledges.The last way to play the game is with magic, and compared to all the other ways you can play this game, it is the most effective. But no all is well as not all spells are made equal and the only ones worth using is the basic fire bolt, lightning bolt, heal (if you don't have enough food rations or health potions), and maybe charm (though never really necessary unless you are being mobbed by many ghouls or during that duel sequence with a Orc clan leader). The trap spells (and most of the others), are kinda useful, but they're nothing but a fancy way to waste mana and character points.Continued in comments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For now, this review is just going to note some problems I've hadwith the game. I will be updating this review to talk about the game itself later.I'm on Windows 10, 64 bit, and this is a pretty old game!- Game often force closes when loading a new level. Quitting the game also makes it think it has force-closed. Enemies spawning also seems to cause crashes on occasion.- The ""rope bow"" can create ropes that stick you into walls. Having two ropes next to each other can make it incredibly diffiucult to dismount the ropes and get on the ground. Save frequently (F6 is quicksave)!- When trying to stay afloat among some rising water, the character makes some horrible drowning noises. Pretty grim! Minimise them by aiming upwards and holding jump. - There are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Hardcore. I opted for Hard. The game starts off incredibly difficultly, but it quickly teaches you how to use footwork and the environment to dispatch your enemies. Unfortunately, you can be faced with a large room filled with multiple guards, and by far the easiest way to kill them is to use the environment (in this case, there was a chandelier which killed them in one hit). You get some more armour, weapons, and skills, and the game difficulty is bearable, and you're able to use your sword. However, there are some escort missions, and when you come across the orcs they can kill you (and your escortee) in one or two hits, if you're unlucky. You can change the diffiuclty mid-game by using the command line, e.g. to switch to Normal mode, type:mm_game_easy_difficulty 1 mm_game_hard_difficulty 0Or set the game to start with the parameters:+mm_game_easy_difficulty 1 +mm_game_hard_difficulty 0			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can't recommend this.Only about 4 hours into the game, and I've run into several moments of cheesy, artificial difficulty, culminating in one that finally made me say ""Nope. Done"".-- Spoilerish --Without ruining it, it has to do with keeping a certain NPC safe while getting to a temple. I deliberately placed the NPC out of the enemies' range, and well out of line-of-sight. Didn't matter. While responding to me attacking one of the enemies, 2 others ran straight past me like I wasn't there, and made a bee-line for the NPC, killing them and causing me to fail the mission. And it's not like the NPC was ""right there"" in the open. No. I'd placed them a good distance away and well out of sight. The enemies would have to see through solid rock to know they were there. In other words, it's hard-coded into the game, and there's nothing I can do to prevent it from happening. So basically, I don't get to decide how to handle that part, I have to figure out and do it the way the devs want me to, or fail the mission. Way to rob the player of agency, folks. Lame.-- End Spoilerish --Oh yeah, and those spike boards the designers scattered all around like confetti, even in places they make no sense (like the middle of a busy village square)? These guys are apparently impervious to those, too. I kicked the same enemy directly into one 3 times. Nothing happened. It was unphased. Just got up and came back at me. Were they props with rubber spikes?And what is it with arrows killing an enemy in a single hit if they don't know you're there, but then being able to shrug off 3 or 4 of them if they've spotted you? Do the arrows get intimidated or something? Do the enemies deploy invisible force-fields?I like challenge. I like mystery and having to figure things out. But I like the challenge and mystery to make sense - to have some kind of train of logic attached to it. Sadly, DMoM&M isn't designed for that. So much about this game is so arbitrary and inconsistent, and it undermines what would otherwise be intriguing and entertaining gameplay opportunities.Either way, a cool concept, and a beautifully rendered/designed world which is sadly mired in poorly executed and arbitrary gameplay.Thumb down.

												I only thumb this down for one big reason but before we poke at that, lets look at the good stuff.Pros - 1. This game runs on the source engine so it has that Half Life feel and sound face into it, making for a very nostalgic piece.  Along with that, the game is very fast paced and has a good, even difficulty with plenty of enemys in it.2. The Story while now adays is a bit easy to catch on to still has a good number of twists and confusing ends for you to try and figure out on the quest.3. The Combat is strong and the branching trees and inventory are easy to play with. Overall it takes no effort to getting used to the controls, only getting used to the task bar really.With all these pros whats the one big issue with this game?Cons -It barely ever works. Reports from other players say they can barely get past the prologue, infact, the most infamous bug (the one I'm having) is that apparently, this old game from a generation ago will constantly crash on the major area of the game over and over and over. This ruins the entire experience as you'll be busy slashing at orcs while Leana is healing you, your about to land that killing blow! Then a black screen appears, the game says MM.exe is not working and all your blood lust is turned into rage. This is such a horrible flaw because its on every computer past Windows 8.1. That is total crap, the fact that an old game can't run on these high tech systems is like saying you can't use a bullet for your new fancy gun because it now needs ""Special Bullets"". Until I find a fix for this, steer clear of this game unless you are below Windows 8.1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is heavily praised for the story and dialogue, which is fine, but that only makes about 1/2 of a game. The other half has to be filled with actual gameplay which is a big pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm punished for using magic and I know this because I can only use a spell thrice before I run out of mana.

												Absolutely awful... Only played the first mission and the beginning of the second before refunding it.The game is solid. The graphics weren't bad at all and the gameplay was pretty fun. But the game itself is unplayable. Constant crashes where the sound gets in an obnoxious short loop and the image stops for a few minutes happen very often. In a 3 minute sequence in the second mission, this happened to me around 3 times, each of the crashes having around 2/3 minutes meaning that I literally spent more time waiting for the crash to end than actually playing it.My computer is very bad but this is a known issue and it happened no matter the graphical quality, highest or lowest.I would really like to play the game but I'm really doubting that Ubisoft will ever make a patch for a 10 year old game so I guess we'll have to wait for a remaster.https://forum.quartertothree.com/t/dark-messiah-of-crash-and-crashing/30794https://steamcommunity.com/app/2100/discussions/0/864974880516630120/https://steamcommunity.com/app/2100/discussions/0/624076027818651156/http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/929360-dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic/answers/55466-why-do-crashes-seem-more-frequent ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first, the game seems rather well made. However, as you progress, you realize just how horrible it actually is. Several fights are outright impossible if you are building a ranged fighter instead of a melee fighter, many other areas you'll go through your entire mana pool just to down one regular enemy. Arrows are slightly better, except that you can't really fire them at a fast enemy closing in on you, and you can't block with a bow.Repeatedly, the game has decided I died even though I still had over 20 HP left after being hit, the orc boss decided to smash my face in during the cutscene while he was talking without giving a chance to fight back(twice), and that's just two of the bugs I have encountered playing this game. Honestly I'd probably be rather♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I hadn't gotten it essentially for free. Don't waste your money on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well well well, First time I heard this game it was meant to be something very big, one of the ""next gen"" game back then. And who else made this game? You already know them from ""Dishonred"". And that's why I think it might worth a while to check on it. Is it worth? Well Yes and No. Here's the reasonPositive- A very unique gameplay of fps hack and slash- Decent Voice acting- Physic by source never disappoint.- Some ""immersive"" gameplay (discover things, literally smithing your own unique sword)Con - Buggggggggggggggggggggggggg. And there's one point I've never manage to pass at all (That ""Percy"" was no where to be found)- Idiot AI and AI escort mission (They died you screw up and restart from last check point)- Annoying some of main character.- Inventory system- Main story line (According to prophercy blah blah blah)-Unfair duel.-Shallow skill tree system.  In conclusion, this game could really be something big but to compared it as a revelant of ""Vampire Masquerade bloodline""? I don't think so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kicking guys off cliffs and into spikes is what this game is known for, and it works really well. Indeed, it is a key crowd control mechanism since they are instant deaths. But while cool, it is ultimately a cheap trick and the fights are diminshed because of it since you are more concerned with lining guys up than actually fighting.What made me quit, though, was that you can pick either melee or magic as an expertise but a key fight requires that you use only melee, so mages get crushed. Sigh. Horrendous game design.Not recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Messiah is a fantasy action game dressed up like an RPG.  As the nameless one you will explore castles, crypts, caves, orc villages and more on your quest to...I am not sure what the quest is but there is plenty to do/kill along the way.  However you better love the combat (melee, archery, magic) and scenery because the RPG aspects are bland and minimal.  There is character building but it is simple and never really changes how you play the game, just makes you stronger in your particular discipline or allows you to equip special weapons.  Also the skill points to “level up” are only available by completing quests, and there is a set amount so it takes forever to build your character and you are very limited in how strong you can get.  There is inventory management, but no stores to buy and sell, and what you find is also very limited.  Want to interact with NPC characters, there is none of that either except as scripted cut scenes.  As an RPG Dark Messiah is a failure, but as an action game it’s decent but very repetitive.  I made it over half way through hoping the game would get deeper or the story more interesting, but this really is just an action game at heart, and a fairly generic shallow one at that.  If that’s what you are looking for Dark Messiah is not a bad game, however if you are looking for an RPG as I was look elsewhere. I played with the Steam Gamepad, with a little tweaking it worked well and you can map everything you need to the controller if you are so inclined. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game for 2 hours.  I find it as to being a cheap time filler for a good game.  After 2 hours, a tough scenario evolved, where I needed help from YouTube to figure out what to do next.  After trying it a few times, and looking at the quality of the game so far, I had enough.  This game turned out to be a waste of time and money for me.  Some may like it, but I am not a fan of having to do a scene over and over and over again unless I am going after a boss in a fight, not chasing some character before time runs out.  Stupid.

Poison is a death sentence, and so is the buggy terrain and rope/chain-climbing, which you will get stuck in walls, miss your marks, and 80% of the time fall to your death.

												When this game was actually working, it struck me as ""okay."" I felt like the developers were going for a grand feel, but weren't quite able to achieve it. Everything seemed to feel a bit awkward, especially the combat. Even when out of combat, I felt strangely ""off balance,"" as though I couldn't quite get the right feel for the world my character was in.""Dark Messiah"" also had significant technical problems on my machine. For reasons I never understood, the framerate would start out well and then gradually drop to the single digits. Reloading an area would fix the problem...only for it to come back. I attempted a couple of different fixes, but I couldn't nail down the problem.In the end, I had a game that just generally wasn't fun to play and would become flat out unplayable after a few minutes.I just can't recommend something like that.

												This game is actually a game of football. EA Sports actually has the rights to the sequel, and has lent the same code for fifa road to world cup (tm) so that they would use the same mechanics, only instead of a leather ball it's orcs, spiders, humans that you kick around. And they fly! Look at them fly! Like tiny dragon butterflies they fly and fall of walls, on spikes very accurately placed so that you can kick your foes into (it's a soccer goal, I know).The magic system is awesome: You have to wait for many seconds in between spells, that are not really better than melée combat at any time in the game. Also, the enemies can run forever, and you can, which is very good, because that means you actually get to die, when 45 enemies spam over you and can run forever while you are like a fat, retired Ronaldo that is about to be hacked to death by angry orc mobs.Also, ingenious, is the fact that the animations are not skippable in game. I love that. You can't stop the orc cleric from having the most boring speech ever.The stealth system is mandatory, and even if it doesn't work, exactly as in real life, it might bring you some advantage before you kick the enemies and you see them flying in the air.Fighting is amazing; your hits don't land, you have no clue how much damage you're dealing, and that makes the game far much more real. Also, using first person shooters with movement combos for power strikes is ingenious, i.e. you will break many mouses. Mouses are fun to break. And Overrated.The game is also very smart: In order to increase the user experience, it will have mandatory game stops that happen at random. Yes, the game will crash on many animations, which makes for excelent user experience and will leave you hungry for more. Don't buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game. For the part of the game that I was able to play, I did enjoy it a lot. It's a high fantasy first-person linear RPG, with different skill trees, combat types, and hidden secrets. By linear I mean you progress from one level to the next and can't return to older areas. It works really well - the game is surprisingly fun when it works.UInfortunately, I ran into numerous bugs that made it very difficult to proceed. One bug about 2-3 hours into the game makes it unplayable - no matter what you do at a certain stage, you are guaranteed to lose if this bug crops up. Restarting the entire level doesn't fix it. The only way to avoid the bug is to completely restart the entire game, and hope that you don't get the bug AGAIN, which would require another restart.I've searched for patches and mods to fix this and there are none. Until this game-breaking bug gets fixed, I cannot recommend this title, as much as I wish to enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got hyped about this game reading reviews. After playing for more than half of the game, I honestly regret buying it, even in 75% discount price. This game might have been great in 2006, but it's annoying in 2015 and not really fun. I could overlook the technical aspects due to game's age (except for the forced motion sickness mode), but even the gameplay mechanics are poor compared to newer games (or even, say, Half Life 1).The gameplay issuesEnemy variety is tragic. There are like 4 different enemy types, everyone looks the same, and an area is usually populated by a single type or two. You fight them over and over again.The fact that you can use environment to kill is cool, but in this game you are forced to do so, and you're almost forbidden to use standard means (like, a sword!). Because the enemies are extremely hard when fighting the standard style (they can parry as fast as you can strike and they never miss a parry), but they are extremely vulnerable when anything hits them. Throwing a jar at them can yield a better result than hitting them with a sword from behind to a neck (really, because a jar or a barrel knocks them down and you can then kill them instantly, but hitting them from behind to a head doesn't... makes real sense, and definitely not a gimmick!). So using environment is not a great addition to your fighting style here, it's shoved down your throat and you need to use it all the time.The technical issuesThe game is full of bugs that either make you fail instantly or prevent completion of the area. I had to load a past save several times to work around those. Make sure you save (and don't rely just on a quicksave).You'll get stuck on anything and everything. Using ladders, ropes, jumping through a window, all of that is incredible pain and you'll often die because the engine is dumb.The lighting is so bad that half of the game is well lit and the other half is pitch black (like house interior during a day). Enabling HDR makes it even worse. You can't see a damn thing and you need to use night vision a lot just to work around poor lighting. Adjusting gamma doesn't help too much, you'll still see sh** and the rest will be blinding bright.The hitboxes and targeting, oh damn. Very often you hit something completely else, like a wall *behind* a person. Performing an execution is a random chance whether the game considers you in the right place or not.The UI for switching weapons is far from usable. You can switch from sword+shield to a bow, but you can't switch back. You can either switch bow->sword (and only then add a shield), or switch bow->shield+random weapon (usually not the one you want). Very clever.Forced motion sickness. Oh yes, you human weaklings, the developers will let you suffer, you deserve it. You can disable head bobbing, but that's the least of the problem. The image tilts every time you strafe. Every time you move sideways, your view moves unnaturally, right side up left side down, or vice versa, like boat swaying on a see. I found a way to disable it, otherwise I'd have refunded this immediately. You can see my solution on pcgamingwiki[pcgamingwiki.com].I ended in chapter 6 in crypts, fighting zombies. I didn't see sh**, everything was pitch black so I had to constantly toggle night vision, and it was near impossible to execute a zombie, because of targeting glitches, so the fights took eternity. There was no fun in that.How long can you enjoy throwing barrels at people and kicking them from ramps, when you're forced to do that a thousand times over and there's no other way? 9 hours seems to be my experience. (In hindsight, I was really persistent.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is bad. Story is boring as ♥♥♥♥, characters are boring as ♥♥♥♥, ESPCIALLY LEANNA. ♥♥♥♥ YOU LEANNA BORING AS ♥♥♥♥.For melee combat, you have a light attack and a charged attack. Light attack is literally useless, NO REASON TO. Early game, enemies are ♥♥♥♥ing sponges and need A LOT of attacks, late game everything dies with 2-3 shots, ♥♥♥♥ing lame. Combat is fun when you sidestep your opponent to land a charged attack, but otherwise its bland as ♥♥♥♥. It's more useful to KICK your enemy than hitting him with your sword.Seriously, there is a huge emphasis to kicking your opponents and throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at them. Spiked walls scattered EVERYWHERE (why orcs, why?) for you to kick people into, barrels and crates everywhere for you to throw them at the enemies. And they call it 'using your environment'. Yeah, sure.So many ♥♥♥♥ing bugs. Leanna kept getting stuck for me after getting off a ♥♥♥♥ing boat, i had to reload a couple of saves before to get it to work.You have a demon form later on in the game. ABSOLUTELY USELESS. You have a semi-powerful charged attack but no defence. At higher difficulties, you'll just end up getting slaughtered after killing 1 guy. Way more reasonable to stay with your shield.The first couple of levels are awesome, lush green environments, great open spaces. The rest however, are boring as ♥♥♥♥ dark corridors and caves. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The only good thing about this game, is the rope bow. That's pretty cool.It really seems like the only people who like this game are hipsters. And the classic nostalgia ( i played it when i was younger and it was awesome!).Get the game when its on sale, if you really want to try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've bought the game years ago, but long since lost the CD to redownload it, and Christmas sales seemed like a nice way to bring a nostalgic game to my library on Steam. I would probably give it a good review for it's mechanics and gameplay... If I could play it. It seems to be a common problem for this game to not be compatible with systems like Windows 7 x64 from what I've read on forums. Many people as well as I can't seem to get this game to run. So while I would like this game from what I can remember, make sure to research if you can actually run it or if you're just wasting $6 (in my case) on a game that crashes the instant you try to play it.

												How did this game get any good reviews?The controls are best described as ""clunky"" ""sluggish"" and, if you're generous: ""indirect"".The hitboxes are a joke:You just jab somewhere, not even aiming at the enemy -> You hit, the enemy is killed.You aim for the head, your sword goes right between his eyes -> he doesn't even flinch, the hit didn't register.These reviews praising the melee fighting must be a bad joke.I don't care about the 5 bucks I paid, but give me back the time I spent with this rubbish.

												So the game seemed pretty fun mechanically, based solely on the start of the tutorial, but then the first female character is introduced and I want to vomit. Prior to her entry into the room, she's introduced as someone that might teach me a thing or two in the most suggestive tone of voice possible, then she's summoned by magic, and she's barely wearing clothes. She then says 'how my I serve you, my master' while my character (out of my control) looks her up and down a few times. Then she walks over to my character, and makes out with him as the screen fades to white.I can't play this garbage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A girl I met nearly half a decade ago who really liked this game. She liked it so much she actually bought me a copy to play with her, but while I was downloading it (lengthy process back then)  she called me and told me that she tested positive for Hep-C and that I should get tested. At this point I couldn't bare to play video games so I left it unplayed. After A few weeks of not really speaking to her I finally get my results back, and that's when my life changed for the worse forever. Results came back positive. After this point I never could bear to ever play it. Sometimes when I see it in my libary I cry uncontrolably at the mistake I made.This game will break your heart and destroy your liver with an incurable disease.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Kicking Simulator""I really dont know, what I should think about that game and I really dont know, what I should write about it.Based on the Source Engine and Half Life 2, the Game places you into a medival fantasy setting, somehow based on the universe of Heroes of Might and Magic.The story (if we can call this ""something"" a story) is a classic ""slumbering evil is about to get awaken. Player is a unknown noname who will face incredible odds and become a true hero with hidden destiny. I think this is, how IGN would describe this game.But well, lets talk about the story (maybe spoilers!):You are some student of a wizard, discover an artifact, get a mission to hinder the dark forces from unleashing a great evil. Then, after a short intro session (which is quite a nice tutorial), you will get a mysterious female companion, who is bound to you and is only speaking in your head.This is, where the game gets strange, somehow interesting, and crazy and throws tons of klischees at you.Shortly after you are in the middle of a necro army, a cult that will fight evil with evil, your hidden destiny (which is totally silly) and a (total stupid) choice between two sides.The game even have some decisions, you can make and has ""4"" endings. (kinda)But dont expect a deep story. If the game were a parody of fantasy plots it would be a 20/10. Maybe it is a parody and I got it wrong. But the whole storyline throws so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at you, that you go through 3 phases.First you are enjoying it.Then it annoys you.At last you encountered so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that it starts to be a real fun (like: At this point I will just lean back and smile).The whole story has one good part, which is also its greatest flaw:The two female characters. One a voice talking in your head, the other a young mage, not talking in your head, but is annoying, useless and always in your way. Because of the major plot around these two characters, the whole story seems to be a big funny stupid fanservice. Both characters seems to fight each other to get you, even if they will never meet in the whole game. Both are making you compliments, trying to get your attention and in the end, trying to get you to kill the other one.While the the mage is an annoying little girl, the voice in your head is a well written, awesome voiced character, who is maybe the strongest and most enjoyable element of the game. While I hated every single second hearing the mage girl talking, I enjoyed every second of the other character, laughed about her dark jokes and couldnt do anything but liking her, even if she is ""the evil one"".Within the game, you have the choice to rescue the mage, after she is captured and nearly fed to giant spiders, after that, she tries to get you cleaned from the voice in your head.I rescued the mage and then tried both decisions...man, I never felt so guilty after killing the voice. It was (given the age of the game) one of the most touching scenes outside of a cutscene in a game.Even after loading my game, I still felt guilty.Well, in the end, siding with the woman in your head, you WILL have to face and kill the mage. It is not even a bossfight. It is a stupid girl, who is mad at you, and wont stand down, until you kill her.Maybe the game want to teach you a lesson of life decisions and their consequences, I dont know.The combat system is somewhat awesome and frustrating. You can block, do different strike attacks, sneak, use bow and magic. But the main part is your enviroment. Every object, you can move, you can use as a weapon. Pick it up, use telekenesis, kick it...you can do so many things, to make your environment your weapon. If you ever felt like it is a good idea to end a mountain fight by kicking your enemy of the cliff, this is your game.But after enjoying your big playground for a few minutes, it will get really annoying after the first hour. Throwing objects will get boring, and a fight at the docks, ending a fight by kicking nearly every enemy into the water, because it is an insta kill, will make you question your life decisions.Swordfight is unsatisfing because the enemy blocks every non power attack and on his side hits you every time, you lower your own block.Magic feels even more static than in skyrim and looks over 5 years older than the game already is. Also it simply does no damage.Ranged comat is flawless, which makes it a flaw. You could play the game with bow only, kicking your enemys out of melee range, camping on top of stairs and feel simply op.Sneaking and dagger fighting feels somehow useless, because you have to put way to many skillpoints into it, but still after the first kill the survivors will start attacking you, even when they couldnt see you. Walking in sneak mode is one of the slowest movements I ever encountered in any game.But my favourite were the bossfights. First looking really good, they mostly will turn into a confusing pseudo cutscene, where you senseless attacking the monster, until one of your followers tells you, what you really have to do.Also I really dont get, how you are able to finish the final fight without any ranged attacks.I really had to push myself to finish this game and Im not really happy about it. It is a game full of great ideas, which could have given the start to an age of medival FPS games, but was so poorly executed, that everyone forgot the game.In the end, the only thing I remember clearly, is the funny voice of Xana (the voice in your head) and I think it is the best memory I can get from this game.Last but not least I want to say: Making the mage girl your follower, making her killable and making her a story relevant character, so you will loose the game, if she dies, and then making her stupid as ♥♥♥♥, running into her death...I was terrified how much I enjoyed the moment, shutting her up for good. What a crazy game, making you go down the evil part, because the only good character makes your skin crawl.(I had a lot of more things I could rant about, but it is irrelevant)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now I have to find five (or six) stones / stuff in a boring labirinth (hence the expression ""dungeon crawler"", I guess), while being attacked by a non-stop wave of zombies, which are much like your dog asking for more food: not important, but really annoying. Not to mention that, when I find one of the stuff I´m supposed to, I have to go all the way back to a certain point. I prefer more linear adventures.

												Bugs, bugs are everywhere...Game installs french keyboard layout, which is to be deleted by user manually after uninstall.(The simpliest SOLUTION: install and uninstall french keyboard layout).Comming out of water is a mini-qwest by itself. So is jumping to secret locations. I made over9000 attempts.Regular crashes are welcome too.Playing this game I sent rays of hate to developers so many times, that they should be bald this moment.If one is not afraid of bugs and very very patient, play this game, graphics and gameplay is not bad.Other issue is bad balance, in the middle game has big leap in difficulty, so that one empties full mana pool just to killone zombie. Mage is very hard to play. Though archer and warrior are much more easier, as you can find better weapons,magic spells dont scale at all.VERDICT: worth only if bought under big discount.

												I was pretty excited to play this game, as it looked like the sort of thing that I would enjoy. However, whenever I try and get past the main menu, the game proceeds to crash. After many hours of trying various fixes and searching the internet, I found that this is quite a common problem that has STILL not been addressed by the developer, making the game unplayable for many. Since so many people have the same issue as me, I am confident this is not a 'user error' and I have had no problems playing other games using the Source engine. The fault appears to be with Arkane Studios and until this issue is rectified, it appears that many people have had their money taken for a broken product and therefore I cannot recommend buying this game currently.

												Jesus Polevaulting Christ, this game is bad.I was looking forward to the lauded kick mechanic of this game, but after a short while it just became super repetitive and boring. Combat is janky as £vck - slashing someone feels like balancing a teapot on a pencil, making your character feel like a god damn mongolo|d. Hit detection is all over the place, reminiscent of that horrible Dead Island game. And for the sneaking, how about a toggle crouch button, developers? Getting finger cramps here.Oh yeah, as a final £vck you, when I quit the game normally, the screen froze and took priority over everything else on my computer. Even ctrl-alt-del'ing out of it was impossible, forcing me to restart my computer. Now THAT's something I haven't experienced from a game for quite some time, if ever.Good riddance, you piece of sh|t travesty pile of dirty pixels.

												It was good for its time but is simply too dated now.Dishonored, made by the same developers, is simply a better game in all aspects. There's no real story or characters or interesting atmosphere in Dark Messiah. The reason to play it is because of combat and environmental effects. The combat and variance in how to beat levels is Dishonored destroys this game. The atmosphere and story of Dishonored is fairly good too, but that's just an added bonus. The only reason to play Dark Messiah is because of it's combat and Dishonored destroys it in all aspects. So why buy this game? Don't. It just doesn't hold up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good luck getting it to work. Don't get me wrong, this game is fantastic when the frame rate isn't nose diving. If you're lucky you might even get to experience a pretty neat first person action RPG. It uses the source engine so there is tons fun to be had with physics (traps, flying bodies, etc.), but again, if you're lucky. This game WILL inevitably crash on you.Is there any sort of quality control on steam? This game is broken. Yeah, there's some online source that will tell you to delete some stuff in the registry and move some files around but I shouldn't have spend 3 hours digging around to find that before i can enjoy a game.

												At first I found this game rather enjoyable. It introduces alot of very interesting and unique concepts along the way, and item progression, as well as skill progression, actually matter quite a bit in this game. The main pitfalls (heh...) of this title are the mechanics, the physics engine. Enemies are tough to kill in combat, even if you tool yourself out with the best equipment possible, the game is brutally difficult. As such, many just resort to ranged combat, and trick the AI into getting stuck, so they can peg them with dozens of arrows. Main issues I encountered were such: Getting lost again and again, which I realised was partly due to several progression bugs which prevent key doors from opening. The level layout does tend to make everything sort of blend in, so figuring out just which corridor contains the identical looking wooden door you need to go through does happen. The rope bow/arrow, well before the latest Croft game and other titles empoyed it, is quite fun, until you start floating through walls while climbing ropes, because the physics engine was not programmed to deal with this vital game mechanic. The number of times I died whilst trying to do the fiddliest of tricky platforming (which as always, in a first person game, is just an awful idea from the start), due to the rope intersecting with a chunk of rock, which caused me to noclip out of the level... It gets frustrating very quickly. Finally, the magic in this game feels utterly flat. Fireballs hit enemies as though you just threw a small water balloon at them. Lightning appears to have the same effect as assaulting your enemy with a particularly wet piece of paper. There was absolutely no appeal to using magic in this game except as a means to use the mana I have anyway. If you really want to try it, nothing I say is going to stop you, but otherwise i'd say leave this game where it belongs, in the past.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is boringThe first 4 hours of gameplay its ok, but the conveniently placed spikes, barrels, and other mekanics turn old really fast. It's plain boring, so boring i want to uninstall steam burn my laptop and wash my brain with bleach, could push myself to go past the spider statue.Ubisoft this game is bad, and you should feel bad!

												One word. Dissapointment.I used to play this game somewhere around release date. Now, after 8 years I decided to play it again and it was awful. I don't mind the graphics or plot but the combat is just bad or even broken. It's just riddiculous that many times I can't make two hits without taking damage. The main character must be martial arts master because kicking is his best weapon. Oh, and fighting multiple enemies is just a joke.Bought it on a sale for barely 3 euros. Not worth it. Not worth a penny. Don't buy it, don't play it, let it rot and be forgotten.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Originally posted on July 11, 2009 Dark Messiah of Might and magic is a truly disappointing game. From the clunky controls to the frustratingly simple combat, the core game mechanics are boring, and the presentation is quite shabby to boot.Graphics- While some of the game's graphics can look pretty good, the overall effects are very uneven. Especially the game's more open areas look absolutely atrocious in comparison to other source games, as low res textures and bad backdrops abound.Sound- I found the sound design to be generic and not really anything special, although it did the job. The voice acting was pretty bad.Gameplay- The hack and slash mechanics with magic mixed in work much better in other titles that mix these dynamics, but for some reason Dark Messiah features a terribly frustrating control scheme and nonsensical combat mechanics that often feature your character taking damage full seconds after the enemy blows have been deflected. Button mashing combined with circle strafing led me to the most success when playing this game. In short, the gameplay, enemy, weapon and skill systems are pretty generic and do not provide for a satisfying experience.In addition to these concerns, the story is very very dull, providing no narrative flow or any kind of imperative to your actions.Overall, I'd say Dark Messiah is a sad example of low-budget game development gone wrong.

												This game is a combination of an action game with some RPG and magic elements. It seems to be very, very interesting.BUT.Could this game be any more harder? It's so hard it's almost ridiculous. I never was able to even finish the first level, even on Easy difficulty. Already the first enemies you encounter are like boss battles. I mean, even with bow and arrow an enemy takes about 5 to 10 shots before dying. A sneaky shot from behind to the head from behind doesn't deal any more damage.This is ridiculous.Additional to that comes the somewhat extremely clunky, not responsive controls. It's just plain awful and frustrating to play.The levels are designed to provide unique ways to kill an enemy, like kicking them into spikes / over the railing or destroying some planks which hold some barrels. This seems to be the ONLY way to succeed in this game, since a direct confrontation is pure suicide. Further problem is: Moving your character seems to be too stiff and not responsive and the back-steps are so tiny you're constantly being attacked.In conclusion for me, this game is way too hard, clunky and therefore no fun at all. I really tried it on Easy difficulty several times with different approaches and even on this setting its unplayable. For hardcore gamers or those who get the right tactic this might be a challenge but for gamers who just want some casual fun now and then, not a good choice.Update: Curiosity made me cheat - so I activated the God Mode, gave myself about 300 skill points and put everything to the maximum. I have to say: Good thing I didn't play this game the normal way so the disappointment came rather short. The visual effects and presentation of the spells like fireball or lightning bolt (both are fired through your hands) are looking, feeling and sounding very, VERY uninspired and boring.Don't buy it. And for the haters: Just respect another person's opinion. It's not that hard ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Caramba, esse era um jogo que eu já estava afim de jogar a muito tempo, e sempre ficava esperando uma promoção, até que veio o Sammer Camp"" e para minha felicidade este jogo entrou em promoção.Bom, para quem gosta de um RPG com mais ação, vai curtir esse jogo. A jogabilidade é muito simples e divertida (eu realmente fico animado jogando), os gráficos não são ruins, já que o jogo foi lançado em 2006 e usa a Source, engine da VALVE utilizada em Half-Life 2.Quando joguei esse jogo veio logo uma coisa em minha mente: Dark Messiah = Oblivion + Ação (jogabilidade mais dinâmica), e é bem isso que vocês vão encontrar neste jogo.Nota: 9.0 / 10.0Nota 9.0 por que acho que deveria ter mais customização e mais equipamentos no jogo. Mas estou realmente adorando o jogo até agora. PS: Não finalizei ainda.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After the second or third time you douse an enemy with oil, collapse a ceiling full of assorted large wooden objects ontop of them, set the entire bowl of mixed nuts on fire, and then kick the remains of their flaming torso into a wall of rusty garden utensils, you will know that you have found a winner.  Retrieving their charred corpse and throwing it 500ft upwards to watch it rain down kibbles and bits from the sky is purely optional.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game...it needs to win the underrated game of the universe award.  Apparently went it first released, it was hampered with bugs and over shadowed by games like Oblivion. It is a Source Engine based game that plays very much like a combination of Thief and Half Life controls/combat.  It uses chapters/missions similar to both of those games as well.  It isn't open world but that won't bother you because there is plenty of loot hidden in secret areas for you to find.  It also starts off a bit rough with a hard to understand story and uninteresting at the time, plus the combat is difficult until you get new skills/weapons.  The combat in this game is so well done, especially for a game this old.  Most people say that if Elder Scrolls had this combat, they would be the best games ever made.  You'll have so much fun kicking enemies into spikes, fire, off stairs and using the many types of weapons you find along the way.  You even get to forge a few weapons.  Once you get past the first few chapters the story and gameplay really get great. I highly suggest playing on Hard mode because it forces you to use the various methods of fighting within the environment well.  You can activate traps laced within rooms like cutting ropes on swining objects, throwing oil on the ground and lighting enemies on fire, etc.  This game was worth every penny and I can't wait to finish it.Pros- Brilliant Combat System (super fun)- Variety of weapons to use and loot- Challenging Difficulties- Interesting Environments- Great Inventory and Skill System- Interactive Environments and SecretsCons- Mission based - Not Open World (plenty to explore though)- Story is bland at times- Steep learning curve- Unbalanced beginning- Slightly outdated and a few bugs remain (not the spiders)Score 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would recomend this to everyone, the gameplay is fun but not simple, its exciting, AND IT'S DIFFERENT, there aren't that many games in first person with good exciting swordplay mechanics like this. There are things like Skyrim and Shadow Warrior but that doesn't have the same complex fighting system this does.Bottom Line:For 10 dollars I dont think you will find a game much better then this, definately get it. I wish there were more games like this, and I can't stress enough how amazing this game is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game didn't get the best reviews when it came out, it was buggy and had some issues running on hardware. I played through this game on a newer system and I experienced no such problems, it still looks pretty good too. The levels and gameplay mechanics are quite fun, who doesn't want a good action RPG in the source engine? The melee combat is what Oblivion should have been like and kicking people off bridges and into spikes with your overpowered leg never gets old.The plot does start to get a little stale towards the end a long with some of the voiceovers but that does not detract from the actual gameplay. It is well worth the money if you can find it cheap. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Right off the bat, Dark Messiah makes me question the simplistic nature of all combat in the Elder's Scrolls games. One thing is clear, though. Dark Messiah is a PC game, meant for gamers rather than mainstream turkies (gobble gobble!).Comparisons aside, this game has its moments but the AI is rather simplistic. Combine this with highly linear mapping and progression, and you have something very close to a late 90's-early 2000's, relic. Still, the distinction between the ""classes"" is well done. Magic, however, is feeble through most of the game without certain gameplay ""tweaks"". Typical really, as most devs have little vision for such things. Once you get a certain upgrade, however, you become untouchable. That's abstinent, rudimentry balancing if I ever saw it. The main problem lies with the adrenaline system and why magic had to be tied to it.Like most medieval-based games of this nature, Dark Messiah is catered primarily towards fans of swords, shields, and gimmicky action. I will say they did a good job of it, though. Progression and mapping may be simple, but the environment itself can be a lethal weapon. Magic may be feeble, but it's done just well enough to be enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where does this stand in 2014? The graphics and sound are a little rough at the edges but the gameplay is still fine. Big dungeon crawl with creepy dungeons. The dungeons are good and dark but that gave me some contrast problems with bright light from magic stuff. You can often use the environment to help you fight cleverly, perhaps too often.

Lets see what I can do to this guy... drop a box on his head or get him to chase me, freeze the floor and watch him slide off the edge of a cliff.   In other words have a go and see what you think.

												No witty intro this time. Is it a good game or bad game, that's the real question here.Story/Design: The story is as much as you'd expect from a chapter based RPG Like game. You play as Sareth, the usual main protagonist of any RPG, he's not much during cutscenes but likeable enough. Unfortunately, the main plot is not the highlight of Dark Messiah, the plot is predictable, the plot twists are recognized from a mile away, and just not all that interesting. Is that a bad thing? Not really, you don't need the best story to make a great game, but it could have used a bit less clichés and more original ideas. The ending(s) do it a bit of justice, but not by much. Overall the story is just a bit too bland for me to enjoy besides the last few stages, and only slightly memorable if you look at the endings. Design wise, it's what'd you expect for a late 2006 game. Luckily it's made with the Source Engine so at least it has some decent looking details from then, but not everything is top quality obviously. Nothing hinders it, and it can hold up still for a few things, besides a few NPC designs of the humans. Unfortunately there's no real modding community or big graphic overhauls on this game as of this review, so you're stuck with the graphics. But again, it's not a flaw against the game. Gameplay/Mechanics: I'll start by saying Dark Messiah of Might & Magic has THE BEST first person RPG combat I have ever seen. Unlike Oblivion/Skyrim as you constantly spam your attack button hoping to kill them at first before they kill you, the combat is much more strategic and can vary depending on the situation. It's an RPG like experience, so you can be a few different kinds of ""classes"" I'll put them in. Mage, Archer, Rogue, and Warrior. Standard of course, but each have their strengths in this combat system, it's unfortunate I cannot put into words how well and fluid the combat is with each class type, as it's one of those systems where you need to try for yourself and see it's not just another clunky button mashing system like in the Scrolls games. Traps and environmental hazards are plentiful, and ragdoll physics are just fun to mess with during fights, as kicking Orcs into a wall of spikes or off a cliff has never been so satisfying. (Or kicking a bird on a beach, I mean why not?) The A.I. is surprisingly smart and can be ruthless if you're reaching your breaking point, some say it's cheap and the A.I. is way too tough, but I'd prefer a challenge over a way too easy game experience where I don't die at all. They do not have health bars either, which I believe is a nice touch, as if they're injured enough they'll plea for their lives of limp away in agony and try to escape or get help. There's not a specific class either, you'll be needing to use all of your tricks to take down enemies, with stealth as best you can being very effective and immensely rewarding, to long ranged assault on unsuspecting goblins, or magic against non-humanoid creatures. It's never just one class throughout the game, which can help make each level feel fresh. Overall, what is this game? Does it have a compelling and memorable story? No. Memorable characters? Not really, unless you're a pervert and wanting to remember all the slightly nude women. (Why have that?) Best level design? Not really, unless it's well placed birds for you to kick, then that's a plus. What it does have going for it is the combat, the gameplay, the A.I, the kind of fights you'll remember a few years down the road when playing some other RPG with awful combat ... not naming any names. Some games don't need to have a good narrative or plot going for it, as the gameplay can make the game. It's not perfect, but it's not bad either. Only if they made this a more open world like Oblivion and keep the combat like this, it'd be my favorite RPG. (One day...) Overall rating: 7.5/10+Best combat out of any RPG I've played+Smart A.I. +Interesting hidden items! +Can punt kick a bird off a beach.-Bland story/characters-Non memorable protagonist or plot-Mixed level design			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I still have not finished the game yet, but I'm recommending it. This what I think of this game, I being a great fan of the Thief Series 1 ,2 and Deadly Shadows, the Gothic Series and Medivial Amosphere. This game clicked right away. The game is basically Thief(mechanics) sneak, rop arrows, bow, swords and talent system like WOW, ElderScrolls , Gothic like and RPG game. It also has great combat system similar to Skyrim maybe even better. The only thing with the game it's Linear like Half1 or Half2. I totally enjoy the battle's in this game. -Negative's- some of voice actors and script of game soundsa like corny. - Not as much depth as famous RPG's or Thief. - Game Crash's at times, crashed maybe 4 times out of 5 hours of gameplay.

												A fun game that stands up well even in 2014. The physics and environment is what makes it extremely entertaining. You can move objects, knock down traps, kick foes off of ledges to their demise. The RPG elements are rather basic. There are only a handful of upgrades for abilities and weapons, but as an FPS rpg it's entertaining.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NOT always easy to set up on any OS other than Windows XP (not impossible, but they made a few odd design choices that Vista and 7 don't like much), this is a fantastic game. One of the first to use the Source engine, you step into the role of a wizard's apprentice and go treking through your round-of-the-mill fantasy setting. Conspiracies and such follow, but suffice to say that the game's emphasis on physics and a realistic first-person perspective (you ride into town in a wagon, which makes for a really nice intro) more than make up for its short-comings. I learned that the third or forth time I impaled a grunt on a spike by kicking him off of the roof, only after first ramming his head into the roof itself several times. Violent, oh yes, but plenty fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Source-based RPG is ossum!  It has its fautts: too linear & restrictive and far too short.  But the epic melee system is stil the best around, allowing enjoyable hand-to-hand combat (unlike certain other games that come to mind; Oblivion, Gothic 3 I mean you, amongst others)... pushing Orcs into spikes, making ice traps so Goblins slide off cliffs, throwing guards using Telekinesis and setting all and sundry on fire are just some of the amusing things to do in what is still a graphically-appealing faux-medievel Kickathon!

												Ah, Dark Messiah. A wonderful game! I had a lot of fun with this one.Graphics:Source engine. Sharp textures nice physics. There isn't much to say about it really. The graphics look fine and they are holding up well to this day. Oh there is one thing, you are able to see your own feet. I think this is important, it somehow adds a lot of ""friction"" to the world (think: Arx Fatalis)Sound:Okay. Has oomph. Little music in this game - which is a good thing (think: Dark Souls).Story:You are a hero on a quest to save some part of some world. I don't think there were any rats in a basement to kill, but there is a succubus manifested in your head that'll talk to you occasionally, resulting in some funnily greasy moments. It's nothing special all in all - but the succubus gives it a decent twist.Gameplay:This is where Messiah shines. Luckily - who gives a damn about graphics and story in an ego-fantasy-rpg-hackfest? Well, lay aside the rpg, there isn't much roleplaying to do apart from some character development. This character development will decide whether you'll be casting, shooting arrows or close combating your way through the world, and with the given physics and environmental dangers in level design this gives for some really awesome fights. I love the fights! I love the kick, i love the brutal finishing moves and i love the kick. Yea, you can kick people off high places in this game, and you'll never grow tired of that since there are about a million ledges to kick people, orcs and other monsters off of... of? The combat is awesome, like seriously. It's like Skyrim done right! It's fast paced, it's gritty, it's evil and it'll make you feel like a real Badass Dark Messiah of Might and Magic! You should get this game just because of that. That's it. Start, and don't stop playing until you get to the Orc village. If you hold through until then, you will start loving the game. But yea, until then everything is weird. Combat mechanics feel odd and the game starts slow and boring.I beat this game annually, because it's cool.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, Dark Messiah. A wonderful game! I had a lot of fun with this one.Graphics:Source engine. Sharp textures nice physics. There isn't much to say about it really. The graphics look fine and they are holding up well to this day. Oh there is one thing, you are able to see your own feet. I think this is important, it somehow adds a lot of ""friction"" to the world (think: Arx Fatalis)Sound:Okay. Has oomph. Little music in this game - which is a good thing (think: Dark Souls).Story:You are a hero on a quest to save some part of some world. I don't think there were any rats in a basement to kill, but there is a succubus manifested in your head that'll talk to you occasionally, resulting in some funnily greasy moments. It's nothing special all in all - but the succubus gives it a decent twist.Gameplay:This is where Messiah shines. Luckily - who gives a damn about graphics and story in an ego-fantasy-rpg-hackfest? Well, lay aside the rpg, there isn't much roleplaying to do apart from some character development. This character development will decide whether you'll be casting, shooting arrows or close combating your way through the world, and with the given physics and environmental dangers in level design this gives for some really awesome fights. I love the fights! I love the kick, i love the brutal finishing moves and i love the kick. Yea, you can kick people off high places in this game, and you'll never grow tired of that since there are about a million ledges to kick people, orcs and other monsters off of... of? The combat is awesome, like seriously. It's like Skyrim done right! It's fast paced, it's gritty, it's evil and it'll make you feel like a real Badass Dark Messiah of Might and Magic! You should get this game just because of that. That's it. Start, and don't stop playing until you get to the Orc village. If you hold through until then, you will start loving the game. But yea, until then everything is weird. Combat mechanics feel odd and the game starts slow and boring.I beat this game annually, because it's cool.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While relatively short, Dark Messiah is a bold venture into a brand new fantasy realm from the creators of Might and Magic.One of the first 1st person slashers, the game makes trying to organise your fights against multiple opponents into a frantic battle to gain control of the situation. Leading to a combined blend of satisfying moves and repetitive exploits in order to get through to the next section; the story itself being rather bog standard fantasy, but is executed well enough with theatrics and tone to be immersed into the game.Definitately worth a play for those with expendable income and hoping for some escapism.

												If you ever have a craving for a single-player first person swordfighting game, Dark Messiah is the guy to see. Quite simply, what this game does is offer many hours of supremely entertaining and tactical combat, which involves not only slashing and parrying, but the use of the environment to dispatch enemies efficiently and hilariously. The lesser parts of the game never feel like a chore, so this is a definite recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed it a lot.  The combat was simple yet challenging, the item system and inventory was also simplified yet effective.  It seemed like you could play effectively no matter where you decided to put your skill points, it seemed fairly balanced.  I really liked the rope bow.  I liked how they gave you plenty of weapons to suit your play style.  I chose the bo staff because Donatello is the coolest ninja turtle.  I used variations of staffs for almost all of my fights and enjoyed the ways that the blows landed, and the way the screen moved with each of your blows.  I did think that using the demon form made things a little too easy.  The demon that possesses you is also very horny, so that's a plus too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first got this game, I found it in the local GAME store when I was younger I decided it looked cool and bought it. Then this game became one of my best old-school fantasy experiences I've ever had when I was younger and stupider, This game changed my viewing of other games with me learning about the story and experiencing the immense abilities the game has to offer instead of just playing the game for the sake of it. This game gave me creative ways in which to eliminate my foes which was one of the best things about the combat within the game. The atmosphere of the game is astonishing and realistic, also fitting for the settings and multiple locations of the Game. And the interesting story is easy to follow just by listening to Cutscenes in the game. Dark Messiah is although a game which has set paths in which you HAVE to take to progress within the game, it still has many areas which allow you to drive away from just the objective and get better items. Since this game had so many oppurtunities in it, I have played this game's singleplayer more than usual about 15 times or more, the first 3 times I played and completed this game was the story choices (Bad, Good.), class selection (Theif, Mage, Warrior) And the rest was for the whole nostalgia effect and just to see how fast I can complete the game or just play-through it to just have a nice old-school experience. I would reccommend people to buy this game and keep the game in their libary just to have it as a side-game to play it for bordeom or story choices, despite it being an Old Game.

												I bought this game almost on Day 1 back in 2006 - Steam seemed to have reset my progress during an update, so I gave it another run-though.This is a great game, very underrated and immensely fun - albeit flawed in a few areas.The graphics are amazing for 2006 standards, Source is used very well, the environments are beautiful, the atmosphere great and the models are also decent. The game is BRUTAL, finisher moves, burning corpses, beheadings, turn limbs etc.The gameplay... oh dear, how do I even describe this. ""Might&Magic"" is about right, I'd say. On my first playthrough, I decided to go full-on Warrior (usually I'd go for a mix, paladin-ish thing), and it was IMMENSELY fun, the combat is great once you get the hang of it, although I'm sorry I didn't play it on hard, because once you get beefed up a little, slaying enemies is a bit too unchallenging. I think I died maybe twice the whole campagin during combat. When you get the Lightning Shield and the Dragonborn sword, well, it just gets ridiculous.On my second playthrough, I chose a full-on Mage (combat mage, staff and all) and while I was a bit whimpy at first, by the end, I was even MORE powerful than a Warrior. Mana-sucking staff and Sanctuary=god mode, basically. I wasn't new to the game though, so that helped, but still, if you're going for a narrow, ""one-trick-pony"" build, perhaps play on Hard right off the bat, otherwise you might wade through enemies like dust.The reason why I said ""Might and Magic is about right"" is that I tried doing the whole Stealth/Thief thing, and more often times than not, it falls a bit flat. It's either too easy (really obvious ledges and rafters to avoid enemies) or too hard (open areas where you can't really be sneaky at all), and the inconsistent Stealth meter doesn't help - you can be ""invisible"" in plain torchlight or completely visible in total darkness; go figure.  The story is... alright, it has a few twists, and the game has 4 endings, depending on which woman you choose to leave alive and what you do at the very end. It's alright, but to me, it was really corny, though it wasn't necessarily the bad kind of corny either. Oh, and the voice acting is pretty cringe-worthy, it's just soooo emPHATIC and exaggerated to death. Nothing like the subtle delivery of Half-Life's Alyx or Barney, hell, even Dr. Mossman wasn't as annoying as most of the characters in this game. Not driving an Orc Cleaver through Leanna's face requires some serious self-control, believe me.One more (rather major) gripe: it does have a tendency to glitch/crash at times. The Rope Bow close to flat surfaces is a classic example, then there are random crashes, overall, it's not the most stable of games, so save often.All in all, it's Skyrim/Oblivion without the overbearing world and clunky combat system. It's a non-stealthy Thief. It deserves your attention and at the very LEAST, two playthroughs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actual quote from a book you find in the game:""There are thus conflicting prophecies treating the inflection point of the apotheosis; however, it could similarly be argued that these seemingly differing prognostications--that is, the apotheosis and the dynacidal restriction--stem not from fundamentally opposed analyses of the propogational effects of the apotheosis throughout the continuum, but merely the identical conclusions of the inflection dynamic as observed via heretofore unrelated points of reference! While certain philosophers may scoff at this theory, uniting previously disparate theses concerning the Quarantine and the Sentinel, acceptation of the fundamental argument would definitely reconcile extant factual data with the previously suspected yet unproven link intimately binding the related vessels both geographically and temporally.""Other devs wanna think their games are intellectual?

												GREAT storyline that let me feel like my actions fit the storyline my character was a part of, and other characters within the storyline act wonderfully and in meangful ways.  Graphics are decent and the game engine (Source) works as expected, environments are in general pleasant but can be confusing.Now to the best parts -- The combat WORKS.  Slashes have noticeable impact upon your foes, magic / archery / stealth all work well in addition to the standard melee fighting.  Environmental hazards abound and are a joy to use, as are the various special strikes and methods of dispatching your foes.Another good part -- The platforming WORKS.  See those knee-high barrier walls and neck height ledges you just can't seem to scale in other games?  You can in this one!  A big climbing mechanic in the Rope Bow allows for great platforming and exploring element which the game fully realizes and rewards the player for.This is a Fantasy FPS-Melee game DONE WELL.

Fighting mechanics could need some patching up, but gosh it's freaking awesome fighting in this game. Not as great as triple A titles like, Skyrim, but this game tries and does a good job at the end.

												A highly underated and underappreciated gem of a video game.It has its flaws for sure, but mechanically, the combat is the best of any fantasy FPS-RPG. Far better than any Elder Scrolls game - by lightyears (TES obviously wins in story/lore/world). It is a damn shame that more games have not taken after Dark Messiah, we could sure use it. Not enough games allow you to kick dudes into a variety of traps and pits. The foot is just as underappreciated as a weapon as Dark Messiah is as a game.Maybe one day we will get a worthy successor...a man can dream.Definately in my top 25 games of all time.

												Dark Messiah has one of the better combat mechanics in a game to date. In many ways this game is absolutely fantastic despite its problems. It still looks stellar even though the graphics  won't compare well with today's standards. It is really funny, I mean the ragdolls and physics in this game is just hilarious at times (perhaps not intented though).But it is also frustrating, and with a forgetable story full of shameful clichés. Despite high production value in cut-scenes and music, the voice acting makes you shudder of embarrassment, and you wonder who this story was written by, and targeted to. I can only come up with 8 year boys who know nothing about the other sex. This game could easily be used as an example of shameful tropes and predictable storylines in videogames. Feminist or not, most people would find the story quite horrid.Perhaps one of the biggest annoyances is that even though the game looks and feels great, and runs with no problems on today's machines, the engine just feels a little clunky. You miss a lot with your sword and your character feels a clumbsy. It doesn't feel like the source engine is the greatest choice for this type of game. At the same time the physics and ragdolls are just the whole point of this game. The game constantly encourage you to use objects,in your surroundings, and kick things around. There are many way to get rid of your foes that does not involve your fighting skills. Kicking foes off from cliffs just never gets old.The game gives many options of fighting, but in my mind going full sword combat is the only real way to enjoy the game because it is easier that way, and probably the most fun - It just becomes bonkers. The worst style is to do a little of everything because there is not enough skill points for just one style. This is too bad because you probably want to try the all the fighting options the first play-through, but it is better to play through several times, specializing. You might find the game too hard the first time, but I promise it will get easier as you understand how it works. What can cause a lot of frustration is the reach of both you and the foes. This will result in you getting hit a lot because you will strike too late, thinking the foes are not close enough.What is really great is that it is a game you really learn to master, you don't just level up. In fact ""levelling up"" happens at fixed points and is not based on how you play. A great way to replay the game is to try something completely different which really changes gameplay and provides many other creative ways to get rid of your foes. I did find the stealth/thief option the least interesting even though I love stealth games. Speaking of thief, this games will feel very familiar if you like the earlier thief games, for example there is a rope-arrow which really makes this game much more enjoyable. Another similar game is dishonored, but Dark Messiah is better in that you won't get punished for being creative. Dishonored is ultimately a much better game though, but not as ridicoulous. This ridiculousness is one of Dark Messia's strong sides and a strong reason to play through.Dark Messiah is an old game but the graphics are still enjoyable and you visit many great locations. The source engine gives lots of life and depth ot the game. The fighting mechanics are really good even though the hitboxes are rather confusing at times. When you master the mechanics well it feels quite awesome.I do reckomend it. It runs really well, has great ideas and fun mechanics that will make you laugh. It is often dirt cheap as well. Just don't care too much about the story. This game is about mechanincs, not about story (Even though story is important, it is not necessary for a good game. A good story and horrible mechanics is a bigger problem in my mind - like BioShock infite for exaple). But is not hard and serious as dark souls.			",149,34,4,16,9,1,4

												Dark Messiah is an underrated game that totally wins in every way! You can choose a different ""class"" and go on with the story. If you find yourself in a sticky situation, you can swtich to a different skill based on what you spent your points on. I find having a few extra spells while focusing on stealth as a thief to be quite handy. The only qualms I have about this game is that it seemed rather short, only lasting a good 20 hours. However, I would play through it again, just to relive the diversity and openness of skills and weapons avaliable to the main character. ",63,22,1,30,9,0,15

Probably one of the best games I have played.I definitely recommend buying this game, and I emplore that you grab this if it is on sale.I really enjoyed playing this although the ending was a bit of a letdown because I didn't get to do anything after completing the ""task"" I had been working toward all game.  I would really have liked to have a small amount of content after the goal of the game had been completed so I could interact with my ""companion"", or see a bit of what happened instead of a short cutscene. There are 4 possible endgame cutscenes, 2 for completing the game with Leanna, and 2 for completing the game with Xana. Playthroughs will probably take you between 4-10 hours depending on whether or not you like to rush, or you like to search everything and find secrets. I had issues with the game crashing but for the most part it seems to had been an issue with the ""Global Settings"" under my Nvidia control panel settings conflicting with the game settings.

												I would like to thank all preceding commenters for their reviews, because I would otherwise have missed this gem of a game. The combination of fast paced action with direct controls and strong emphasis on situational awareness due to the many possibilites to interact with the surroundings make for an excellent, engaging gameplay. I can highly recommend the game and wished there were more of its type.			",49,11,7,19,4,0,14

												A pretty fun game that will keep you busy for a few days. Not a bad price for what you get. It has clunky but somewhat fun fighting mechanics that take some getting used to. The graphics are on par for the time it was released. It's got a interesting story albeit short. You'll find yourself dying a lot as enemies are very strong even on easy.			",30,4,0,5,1,0,1

												A personal anecdote from yours truly.I was a young'un during the heyday of EverQuest, and later WoW.  Too young to muster the resources to see those games in action, let alone play them.  (Yes, that means videos too -- dialup, motherf**ker, have you used it?)  So I was left to simply imagine the majesty of these virtual worlds.  Mind you, I wasnt raised on Dungeons & Dragons, frankly I found Tolkienesque fantasy a tired premise before I even knew the name 'Tolkien'.  But gaming was the new frontier of entertainment, and the idea of entering a bona fide fantasy realm set my little mind ablaze with possiblity.Maybe I 'missed the wave' with MMORPGs.  Or maybe my years with Counter-Strike took the sheen off multiplayer gaming.  But by the time I finally saw WoW for myself, I couldn't care less.  I'll gladly take five minutes of deathmatch over a month of MMO banality.But then I randomly found this game, Dark Messiah.  And I was amazed at how it looked and played exactly like the MMO fantasy I had imagined all those years.  Combat wasnt just a mathematical abstraction, the level design looked like a coherent living world (even though, ultimately, its a linear FPS affair) and the art direction made the most out of everything to immerse you into it's world.  This was the fantasy adventure I wanted, but didnt get, from MMORPGs.The only thing missing is the multiplayer, but thats a fair trade IMO.  Pubbies ruin everything anyway...			",220,20,3,20,12,0,41

												I really enjoy dismembering enemies here.____________________________REVIEW:Lame, clichetic story with pretty obvious and simplistic decision-making. Characters are not to root for, except maybe Xana. Levelling is really weird in this game, but it still works for some reason, just make sure you think of a good built. Fighting mechanics could need some patching up, but gosh it's freaking awesome fighting in this game. Not as great as triple A titles like, Skyrim, but this game tries and does a good job at the end. Multiplayer is just... where the f*** is everybody?!To me it has great replay value and I would definitely play it again. 8.5/10			",67,3,0,8,1,0,0

												Arkane Studios does it again with another epic fps/rpg game. The other fps/rpg game i'm referring to is the epic game ""Arx Fatalis"" if you haven't played that game stop reading this lazy review and buy it. But back to Dark Messiah of Might and Magic all i gotta say is if you are someone who likes to play video games you should play dark messiah it's as simple as that. I played dark messiah when it first came out on xbox 360 and loved it i decided to play it again on PC with full graphical settings and i still love the game as much as i did back in 2008. Pick the game up you won't be disappointed the game has good graphics, good music, cool story and awesome combat and mechanics. I would rate Dark Messiah of Might and Magic 90 out of 100 points			",132,46,0,17,2,0,4

												Actual quote from a book you find in the game:""There are thus conflicting prophecies treating the inflection point of the apotheosis; however, it could similarly be argued that these seemingly differing prognostications--that is, the apotheosis and the dynacidal restriction--stem not from fundamentally opposed analyses of the propogational effects of the apotheosis throughout the continuum, but merely the identical conclusions of the inflection dynamic as observed via heretofore unrelated points of reference! While certain philosophers may scoff at this theory, uniting previously disparate theses concerning the Quarantine and the Sentinel, acceptation of the fundamental argument would definitely reconcile extant factual data with the previously suspected yet unproven link intimately binding the related vessels both geographically and temporally.""Other devs wanna think their games are intellectual?

												This game is so much fun and its unique. You really cant take it too seriously. Its a fantasy playground. I just wish the controls were better. They give you 9 hotkeys and 20 skills to use. Changing between them is a little clumsy. Otherwise this game is a blast. I particularly like the secrets. They are hidden in interesting ways. When you get a magic item its often useful and a big deal.			",267,35,1,32,8,0,14

												When I first got this game, I found it in the local GAME store when I was younger I decided it looked cool and bought it. Then this game became one of my best old-school fantasy experiences I've ever had when I was younger and stupider, This game changed my viewing of other games with me learning about the story and experiencing the immense abilities the game has to offer instead of just playing the game for the sake of it. This game gave me creative ways in which to eliminate my foes which was one of the best things about the combat within the game. The atmosphere of the game is astonishing and realistic, also fitting for the settings and multiple locations of the Game. And the interesting story is easy to follow just by listening to Cutscenes in the game. Dark Messiah is although a game which has set paths in which you HAVE to take to progress within the game, it still has many areas which allow you to drive away from just the objective and get better items. Since this game had so many oppurtunities in it, I have played this game's singleplayer more than usual about 15 times or more, the first 3 times I played and completed this game was the story choices (Bad, Good.), class selection (Theif, Mage, Warrior) And the rest was for the whole nostalgia effect and just to see how fast I can complete the game or just play-through it to just have a nice old-school experience. I would reccommend people to buy this game and keep the game in their libary just to have it as a side-game to play it for bordeom or story choices, despite it being an Old Game.

												Amazingly fun singleplayer action. From beheading enemies in a slow-motion moment to tossing corpses at goblins! The combat in this game is intense and keeps you on your toes. Just as any fps would except you're using swords, bows, magic and my favorite: daggers! I would like to say that they could have added a wider variety of weaponry but with what they have, it's fantastic! The environment is your weapon, too, if you know how to use it ;)Even the story line is enthralling. It might seem a little scatter brained and linear but I have to say it is very original! They incorporated a few aspects I never thought about (being a story-minded person). I enjoyed it very much.I would advice anyone and everyone to play the demo to give it a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been aquainted with this game long ago, when I was actually reading gaming magazines.(lacking internet around that time) One thing that stuck to me recently is the sandbox combat that spices some situations, although the physics of of some situations makes it a bit awkward and sometimes it looks just too forced to even seem realistic. Melee combat, however, is truly impressive. Making use of the smooth character movement(strafing, jumping, power strikes), you can perform effective combat manouvers and unpexpected turnouts makes it even more spectacular.( ex. that moment when you use a power strike on an Orc charging you and both of you cross swords, making it a click masher before it gets decieded who is disarmed). The magic system could have used a bit more adaptability to the already flexible character tree that you can develop up to the epilogue of the game. However, magic itself serves as a very useful tool in some situations.( ex. unlocking the cells of prisoners with telekinesis so that the Necromancer doesn't see you and goes Darth Vader on your neck)All in all, the game has quite decent a storyline, mood and visuals( especially for it's age) and I can honestly say that I have encountered only a few glitches. It may not cater to some modern gamers but those of you who are more old school will find this game quite pleasant and memorable experience.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So one day.... I was surfing the web on what are some good steam games to buy. I came across a comment on reddit that said ""Dark Messiah of Might and Magic"" and then some others commented on that saying that, THAT game is the ""best"". I then decide to look it up on the store on steam, I watch some videos on it, looked at the comments and decided to give it a try. I went ahead and bought the game and fired up single player. I've got to admit, it's a pretty fun game. Even though I havn't played a lot, I did enjoy the time i already played. I then came to find out that the multiplayer is dead. I was a little upset at first, but then I showed the game to my friend. He really wanted the game after i showed him, but he didnt have any money. So me, being the generous guy I an, gifted him it and we occasionally 1v1 in multiplayer whenever we feel like it. I definitly recommend this game to any one who is even a little interested in picking it up.			",87,5,0,7,7,1,0

												My first ever Steam Game and it was awesome, AND still is, although old it can compete with many more modern games.  The single player I installed 3 times and kept going back every year to play it again, sadly it seemed too short, although it always does when its a good game!  I dont know if people are still playing the multi-player but that wasn't to bad for a while either.			",20,4,1,5,0,0,1

												One of the first games that featured well working directional combat which felt responsive. Probably a great game for VR, as you have an actual body you see while interacting with the world. The story is nothing to be too surprised about, but the gameplay mechanics are extremely fun, especially the combat feels close to perfection. I remember playing this so much, way before playtime tracking was implemented.			",529,261,7,96,60,4,154

												HelloI bought this game not expecting much, but I personally have found the game extremily fun...The game physics are way beyond its time, it even has better then the games you get nowadays. The combat never get old and the mulitplyaer if you find the correct server (the Russian server has over 10 people paying at a time, Great Fun!). This game surprised me and I really recommend it.

Graphics are still ok in my opinion.Still hope for a second part or something similar to come in the future.			",86,15,1,5,5,0,10

												This game is simply amazing once it gets going. While the combat and movement may seem a bit clunky at first, you quickly get the hang of it and realize what all it offers. Many games say they deal environmental damage, but Dark Messiah is the only one I know of that continues to offer alternative routes for just about every thing you can possibly do. While you are not technically in an open world, the large levels with a plethora of secrets and alternate routes give you the illusion of one.  I'm still finding secrets several play throughs later. If you like first person action/adventure games, particularly those like Thief, you should definitely give this game a try.			",174,34,0,25,4,0,25

												A pretty good RPG all around. Its focus on interesting combat mechanics, as well as a more narrow and focused scope overall made it stand out from other games similar to it (ie Oblivion at the time). The only downside really is how easy it is to win fights by kicking stuff into spike walls, however it is entertaining to do so. I wish more had been done with this Might and Magic offshoot, I really enjoyed playing it.			",281,28,3,30,16,4,36

You'll fight dragons, orcs, and all kinds of other crazy enemies. There are many, many weapons to choose from: bow & arrow, swords, daggers, magic, and big axes, and those are just to name a few.

Dark MessiahInteresting game in which arkane studios managed to create a mix of RPG/adventure game with good level design and excellent gameplay mechanics but the game is mostly action oriented despite the existence of the stealth route that is manageable ( if you engage in close direct combat you have that feeling of ""weight"" in the actions made by mele weapons which they nailed perfectly ) - i played a combo build : twin daggers + stealth approach from ""behind"" :D ( i tried as much as possible to avoid direct contact - to be unseen, and to kill eventual enemies from ""behind"" ) - as a conclusion you can see the later refined development taking shape in the form of Dishonored years later :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a deep action RPG with a heavy emphasis on a variety of combat choices, and one of the few games I've seen that does ""character builds"" properly. Except for the occasional unmodeled wall, the game looks good, and has great level design for what is really quite a linear experience.Really, the main focus is on the combat, which it does spectacularly, thanks to the best usage of the Source engine that I think I've ever seen, but the actual execution of the engine is where the game shows its two biggest faults, aside from my computer's language being changed to French every time I play the game.- Visual effects can often crowd the screen to the point that vision is annoyingly obstructed.- Enemies can sometimes get stuck on certain objects, making them cheap, easy targets.That's it. That's all I disliked. Everything else is golden.Last minute note: The multiplayer is kind of dead, unless you don't mind looking for private servers.			",120,19,3,24,14,0,4

												The game shows the signs of age, but nonetheless a good remark about some aspects that RPGs usually don't take into account.Pros:+ Good gameplay, with a wide range of possible strategies to afford enemies;+ Environment can (must) be used; also, good stealth mechanism;+ Multiple endings: now we're all used to it, but back in the time it must have been awesome and it's right to give it the right credit.Cons:- Lack of secondary quests and lore - set aside the choices for the endings, the storyline is straightforward;- Few customization options for the character's skills;- Poor enemy IA, counterbalanced by high damage output - no way to be tank;- The story is nothing new under the sun.There might be other pros and cons, but the main ones are here. Recommended, for the nostalgic or the ""collector"" who wants to see with his eyes an RPG which gives importance to the environment (I'm both).			",43,9,1,13,0,0,7

												Arkane Studios does it again with another epic fps/rpg game. The other fps/rpg game i'm referring to is the epic game ""Arx Fatalis"" if you haven't played that game stop reading this lazy review and buy it. But back to Dark Messiah of Might and Magic all i gotta say is if you are someone who likes to play video games you should play dark messiah it's as simple as that. I played dark messiah when it first came out on xbox 360 and loved it i decided to play it again on PC with full graphical settings and i still love the game as much as i did back in 2008. Pick the game up you won't be disappointed the game has good graphics, good music, cool story and awesome combat and mechanics. I would rate Dark Messiah of Might and Magic 90 out of 100 points			",132,46,0,17,2,0,4

Arkane Studios keeps you on your toes throughout the whole game, no dull moments really maybe some stumps and holes but it does an amazing job keeping the audience entertained. The storyline is clear and precise and its just a simple game that a real RPG fan needs to experience and all he/she has to do is download steam and put in 10 dollars for one of the best RPG games on the market (besides skyrim and witcher). Plus Half Life and Garrys mod fans will love this game as well like when I first started this game I thought of Half Life lol because it really felt like Half Life to me.

												The singleplayer is a truly unique and (yes, in this case, the word fits) epic experience, it's a pity that the game is hard to mod and didn't ever get a sequel. Lot's of hack 'n slay fun with a combat system that may LOOK like Oblivion/Skyrim/..., but is superior and more fluent in any way. Don't expect too many RPG elements besides an inventory and a skill tree.The multiplayer is unpolished, unbalanced and barely resembles the singleplayer experience, though it can be insanely fun if you can gather enough friends to play it with, especially at LAN parties.

												A very under appreciated game. It has a bad rap because it was severely buggy when it was released and has no business being in the Might and Magic universe. The story is also laughably bad. The single most redeeming feature is the really well done combat. You can't just run in with your sword swinging. You have to use the environment and physics to your advantage. The spells are very powerful but have a large windup time.There's really no reason not to try it because the game is super cheap now. Just don't expect anything beyond the fun combat.			",169,44,0,62,10,0,12

												Though swords and magic settings are primarily used by rpgs, this game uses the setting for an action game. There are no choices, shops, or overworld. There is character customization in which gear you can equip, spells, if any, to use, and the like. Combat is fairly decent, with variety in weapons, swords, daggers, staves, and such. But the most fun you can have is seeing the ways in which you can cause environmental deaths by using your kick to knock enemies around. Whether it be spikes, cliffs, traps, or mixing it up by hitting them with a pot of oil, then lighting it, environmental deaths are often the funniest and most efficient ways to defeat your foes. At ten dollars, it's not a bad buy, but Steam has sales with it often enough, so pick it up then, and it will truly be worth it.			",183,19,2,27,5,2,28

Dark Messiah of Might and Magic ReviewAhh such a classic game. I remember playing this on the xbox and spending countless hours finding different ways to kill enemies! Without further a due lets jump in shall we? Ill split this review into the following categories: gameplay, graphics, audio, and story.Gameplay/CombatProbably the most entertaining aspect of this game is the gameplay. It's first person with a very fluid feel to it. You play the game by picking from the skill trees (or putting points into multiple trees effectiely becoming a hybrid) and using weapons that correlate to that tree. Warriors use shields and sword, mages use staff, rogues use bows and daggers, etc. I played through the game as a rogue/warrior hybrid and gotta say it was fun as hell. The physics engine is hilarious, theres nothing like spartan kicking a ghoul over the castle walls. The game is not all that long which is fine because for what the game is trying to achieve the length was perfect. I could go on forever explaining the combos, power attacks, etc you can use but ill just use a bulleted list to give the highlights.  great physics fun traps to use against enemies simple skill system diverse ways to kill enemies=never bored short-medium length game. hidden areas to discover which give good weapons and some additional skill points. AudioHonestly not a whole lot to say here. The audio isnt anything special. Sound effects sound appropriate and the background tracks/combat music aren't especially exciting or annoying. For this part i'd just say ""meh"".GraphicsDecent graphics, some models and enemies looked a little neglected to some of the other characters but I suppose thats to be expected when you don't spend much time looking at them as you do punting them into a wall of spikes.If you want to know what I mean look at the cyclops and goblins in the game. Compared to orcs and humans they look lackluster but again im not going to sit here and rag on it like its a big deal this game is FUN.StoryOk so this part, in my opinion, was very well thoughtout. I won't spoil the main plot of the game as that would ruin some of the fun but do know you can essentially choose to be good or evil. Because of this ""choice"" system (there arent that many choices as say, dragon age) there are multiple endings which may add some replay value on top of the desire to want to play through again as a different class. It starts out simple and adds enough throughout the game to keep you interested. Its not AMAZING but it was cool and had a nice twist to it, albeit one that probably a lot of people will see coming. All in all, pretty good.Additional Notes-I did encounter some minor bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. Of particular annoyance was a sound bug in which the sound effect of flys near dead bodies would ""follow"" you around regardless of how far you got away from the body. A simple reload will solve this.-I played through two times to get the endings and i recommend your first time through just to play without much worry about secret areas and hidden items, then on your second playthough take the time to looks for the secret areas so you get cooler weapons/armor and more skill points.-SECRET AREAS ARE ""NOT"" required. You can easily beat this game with the weapons that drop from enemies/you find in your path way and youll have plenty of skill points to make your character into a decent hybrid or a focused badass.Id rate this game a 8.5/10. Plenty of fun and defintely worth the money if on sale!			",36,5,0,20,5,0,1

You get it all, you get to be a sword-slaying, magic-wielding, sneaky-bow guy badarse; with an embedded sucubus to boot.You can quite literally build you own guy without any restrictions to skills in any way.

												Awesome melee combat. While there are some RPG fragments, mostly with the advancement tree, what i really loved about Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is the awesome melee combat and the physics of it. The game is made by the Arx Fatalis creators, but it has little resembance to Arx Fatalis (something that many Arx fans disliked) and is much more action oriented. The graphics also are very good, but in some places the game can be a bit cheesy - like the big bad guy and the idea of having a ""companion"" in your head to drive the scenario.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A highly underrated Action-RPG that kicks way more♥♥♥♥♥than most titles coming out nowadays. As a swordfighting Simulator it easily beats War of the Roses and Chivalry while also supporting fantasy elements and class based multiplayer featuring the possibility to level up completely individual in 5 different classes. Singleplayer has a decent length (took me eight hours on the lowest difficulty), four possible endings while MP looks quite entertaining if the servers weren´t kind of dead. With a bot mod however MP may provide some fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark Messiah is an interesting game which at times feels like some odd amalgam of Morrowind, Tomb Raider, and Thief. The levels are fairly linear but the overall locales and environments were interesting to explore regardless. However, my one complaint is that much of the game is played in pretty dark environments, dungeons, crypts, etc - but the brighter environments were more enjoyable. Overall though, the atmosphere and the unique graphics engine has kept the game fresh despite its age. The dialogue is merely so-so and the voice acting of the main character is bad. Nonetheless, this game has some really interesting moments and is full of good sword play and combat. I felt the use of the rope bow was overdone at times, but otherwise it was an innovative addition. Note that as the story progresses, you earn skill points which allows you to learn new abilities and improve basic stats - it is a very simple RPG addition into what is otherwise a first-person action adventure game.Prepare to battle orcs and dragons, jump from dangerous precipices, and kick your foes into spikes, flames, and off mountain tops.

												If you're looking for a game with excellent swordplay mixed with a good dose of magic, this is it. Unless you're well versed in the lore of the Might and Magic universe, you won't care much about the story. That said, it was engaging enough. In fact, it's not the story that'll keep you hooked but the gameplay. Enemies work as a team and if you play on hard, each encounter becomes a fight to the death. I can't stress enough how fleshed out the combat mechanics are in this game. Advice: Play on normal on your first playthrough. I started this game on hard and at one point, I simply couldn't proceed because it takes quite a lot of skill to fight each and every enemy. Not saying hard mode is unfair but if you don't have enough time to spare for video games, you won't like how difficult 'hard' mode is. Also, game has demon waifu.			",109,12,5,5,6,1,8

The combat is awesome, the story and voice acting is hilariously campy. Honestly, I am very surprised that popular Youtubers haven't made a Let's Play series for Dark Messiah. 9/10, I highly reccomend giving this game a try.			",399,95,7,49,39,1,57

												Dark Messiah is a good game. That being said the story is average for its time (2006) and the characters are annoying. I would say the selling point would be the gameplay. The gameplay is fantstic , it feels like what the skyrim combat system should of been;more involving. Oh how gratifying it is to kick someone off a clif or into spikes or finishing the off with stab while they are down. The magic is very basic, you have a fireball like spell , a freezing spell and so on. The rpg mechanics aren't the best but are servicable enough not to ruin the experience.  If I had to rate this game I would give it a 7 out of 10. An ok dark action rpg but nothing fantastic. If youn want to purchase this game to try it yourself there is a sale at the time I am posting this review for  2.49. I recomend you buy while it is still on sale			",43,0,0,7,4,0,0

												A really great and terribly underrated game. It's a bit like Half-Life mixed with Oblivion, in that it has a linear story but RPG elements that allow you to build whatever kind of character you like, whether it be a swordfighter, sorcerer, assassain, or a combination of different abilities. Has great combat and bloody fatality-style moves that are always fun to do. It even has good multiplayer, which combines classed-based point capturing like TF2 with a per-round experience system that gives you greater abilities like in the single-player (although I don't know how many people are on the multiplayer anymore). A really fun game the whole way through, and a must-play for it's price.			",153,22,1,7,9,2,15

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. I've played it lots of times, even before I bought it on Steam. How the metascore could be 72 is beyond me. Anyway, here's a list of advantages and disadvantages:con:-It has some technical difficulties sometimes-you will fight a lot of clones, all with the same voicesliterally nothing elsepro:-It has one of the best combat systems I know,-you can play it in many different ways, because--a: you can interact with the environment in so many ways, and--b: the skill system, which does not offer many skills, offers a few really powerful ones, so that you can quickly specialize significantly. Especially if you use the according items.-the level design is simply divine.-story is archetypal, but with brilliant cutscenes and very nice characters, given the relatively short time in which they appear.-the story is embedded in the Might and Magic universe, so it has a lot of background and many references to the stories in the Heroes of Might and Magic series.-the art design is great, it really feels like something different altogether and something very raw, gritty and realistic. So even now, years after the graphics are actually outdated, it still looks good. -the overall atmosphere is thrilling and tense in a way I do not experience often in video games.So, don't let the age or the low metascore fool you, this game gets 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First person action rpg with several skill trees that allow you to progress in a few different ways or mix between them. Your choices being a stealthy character, fighting based and magic. The addition of being able to kick enemies into spikes/fire/in pits was interesting, occasional trap and even destroyable structures that collapse on enemies was a nice change of pace from straight up brawling with everything. The sealth skill allows you to sneak up on enemies and kill them from behind, you could even leave bodies where other enemies can find them so as they inspect the carcus you can kill them from behind as well.

												Why I bought the game: Got it free with a Video card in 2007What I liked about the game: Rich gameplay, combat, and a decent story. I can see where a lot of new AAA games stemed there own combat from, expecially Skyrim in similarity of a primary focus on magic, combat, and stealth. It felt like a newer title despite being almost a decade old, I regret not playing this more at the time.What I didn't like about the game: I can't complain about anything really.Would I buy at current asking price of 9.99? I wouldnt go out of my way to purchase this game now, but worth playing if you can get it for free.**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant.

But I have about as much kills with my boot as I do my sword, so that is why you should buy. The kicking mechanic.			",264,36,1,46,16,1,22

												This is a very awesome game! it lacks a bit in graphics because of its general age and it is heighly underestimated. i tried this game once a long time ago and played the single player, it amased me tht this game had the ability to scare me in to not plaing it so i left it for a while. but when i came back i realized there was nothing to be scared of, of course. it is a first person game with a lot of funny functions and secrets and a epic way for the enimies to ragdool. All in al i think this is a very likable game and i would hope to see a secual in the future some time.			",85,2,0,5,2,0,1

												They really should make another one of these titles, make it even longer, but not flashier please!!! Too many games try to be flashy and loose the charm that this title has. Also, please not tons of DLC. It always bogs down and ruins the solid good old straightforward awesome core-game experience. MY OPINION. They need to make one more Dark Messiah game.

												Great visuals and interesting story so far with some dark humor. It has a lot of trial and error moments that can get annoying. The combat might be the best I have ever seen in any game. Sick of assassins creed type of combat? Tired of being able to take 100 strikes to the face in skyrim without taking any damage? Then pick this game up because trust me when I say you want to avoid getting hit in this game!9/10			",103,5,0,21,3,0,11

												Super system de combat qu'on soit mage, guerrier ou rogue.Scenario peu prenant (sauf pour les fan de la saga HoMM) et tres lineaire. Cependant, il a l'avantage d'etre suffisamment court pour ne pas donner l'impression qu'on a perdu notre temps. (comptez une dizaine d'heures pour finir le jeu en normal, un peu plus en difficile).

												Dark Messiah holds up well with age. Even though the targetting is sometimes spotty, that's about the only draw back I found. It allows for a lot of style choices between boss fights. I initially went head-in and later tried the stealthy approach and had a blast in any case. Really worth purchasing, especially during a Steam Sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very nice game! Action packed. 3 choosable classes: Warrior, Mage, Assassin - with 3 differend gamestyles, different finishing moves by classes. But You can mix classes to a hybrid one. A little short game but very nice atmosphere, high replaybility. Many new FPS games still taking ideas from this game mainly because it have an unique fighting style. For 6,69 EUR it`s a must buy for people who likes Might & Magic universe at the first time in FPS. And for those who likes fantasy.			",61,0,0,3,2,0,3

												Dark Messiah Might and Magic is easily one of my all time favorite PC games, and I think it has to do with the fact that, to me, it is a fantasy DooM with very light RPG overtones.  Get it nao!			",599,135,11,104,32,4,61

												I would've been willing to pay so much more for this game. I've played it probably almost 10 times start to end already and it is definately among my favorites. I would recomend this to everyone, the gameplay is fun but not simple, its exciting, AND IT'S DIFFERENT, there aren't that many games in first person with good exciting swordplay mechanics like this. There are things like Skyrim and Shadow Warrior but that doesn't have the same complex fighting system this does.Bottom Line:For 10 dollars I dont think you will find a game much better then this, definately get it. I wish there were more games like this, and I can't stress enough how amazing this game is.			",203,18,1,1,3,0,7

												Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is a very fun game. It has a very well-thought out combat system. It works kind of like Oblivion, but you can kick enemies to knock them over, ect... This game has a pretty mediocre stroy though.... I haven't gotten a chance to play multiplayer but i heard that it's even better than the single player!			",45,5,0,4,3,1,5

												A Great Fantasy Experience. This isnt your typical M&M. this is a Fantasy FPS at its best. Some say its not as good as Oblivion, and well, as a a Fantasy game its pretty good. Nice Leveling of skill points based on actions not kills, so there is no grinding. There is no over leveling either. Its a pretty balanced game. 7.5/10PS. it is old Source. There is a mem leak on high end systems that reduce performance to Nil. so Dual/Quad core, DX10/DX11 and W6/7 = nearly impossible to play. to fix it I loaded everything on Very High, Vsync, and QS/QL often as a fresh load helped.

												Probably one of my most replayed singleplayer games because of all the different ways you bring pain to the not so defenseless (and quite tough!) enemies. Wether it be outplaying them in the way of melee combat or simply being a lil bich and chucking a barrel right in their face, this game offers many, MANY ways to play it with its huge replay value.Wanna be a spell-casting mage that still fights with swords with the occasional use of bows?Go right the hell ahead, there is absolutely no limitations that stop you from doing just that.The incredible versatility and depth of the combat system provides many etertaining ways to dispatch enemies. Learn ice magic and freeze your enemies. Discover that you can use said spell on the ground and create a patch of ice, watch and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off as 5 orcs coming to chase you all slip on said ice and fall to their deaths. This is just one of the many past times you'll come to see in this gameThe game is built on the source engine and makes use of all the nice, juicy physics engine that we've all come to love over time. Pick up heavy objects and toss it at enemies which results in the enemy stumbling hilariously in whatever direction the object was thrown in. Use your mighty Duke Nukem boot to send a baddy flying down a crevice or to send them into the many VERY  convinently traps.The RPG elements certainly blend well with the game, with the skill trees being flexible and many of the skills being quite handy. You are also able to spread your skills however you please so it opens up many possibilities on different playstyles that will certainly not all be experienced in just one single playthrough.
