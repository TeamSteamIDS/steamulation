												Before the review, I want to exclaim:BUY COMMANDOS 2 IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED ANY OF THE COMMANDOS GAMES.Also, this game usually costs 1 $ or € throughout the Steam sales.I remember when I was younger playing this game and how fun it was. Controlling commandos behind enemy lines. Stealth. Tactics. The experience was amazing and I am elated right now to play this game again.The game's charm is in figuring out enemy's patterns, observing the environment, planning tactics and then carrying it all out. It is hard, but addicting and rewarding in the end. A simple act of throwing cigarette packs and then knocking out a soldier and tying him up, booby-trapping, throwing a bomb at a group of soldiers or disguising as an officer with a spy is satisfying.The game is a little hard to get into at first, but after you really pass the two training levels, you are essentially ready to go.VERY USEFUL TO KNOW: CTRL-S and CTRL-L for quicksave and quickload.It was also released in 2002 so the game looks rough and doesn't support widescreen natively. To remedy this, you can pick up executables that fix this, although very high resolutions might cause graphical glitches. There is also a mod called Destination Paris that makes the game even more challenging.Commandos 2 is my favorite game in the whole series and I recommend it to Commandos newcomers; as Behind Enemy Lines and Beyond the Call of Duty are too unforgiving (I haven't played Commandos 3 yet, but it's apparently not as up to par). Alternatively, you can try Desperados if you're more into Wild West or Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood if you're into Middle Ages.Download links:https://sites.google.com/site/xbootx/home/commandos2 - High Resolution fixhttps://commandoshq.net/c2dp_dloads.php - Destination Paris			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before everyone starts insulting me i'll begin by saying Commandos 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I spent hours playing this game when I was a kid (back in the days when games gave you a real challenge !).From where i'm sitting I can still see the CD on my shelf, so I already own it but when I saw you could buy it on Steam for 99 cents, here I thought : ""Let's buy it, it's cheap, it'll be the occasion to play it again and since it's in my steam library it'll be more convenient than the CD"" (I bought a lot of games I already owned that way and I know I'm not the only one).Here comes the downfall : it's a pain in the *** to make it run on a W7 64Bits computer.First, the game just wouldn't launch, opening and exiting immediately, then after some tweaks, new message : ""problem checking steam application"" and then ""comm2.exe not responding"".I finally got it to work only to find you can't play on a wider resolution than 1024x768.I know it's an old game but what's the point in making this game available on Steam if you can't play it on a modern configuration ?I wouldn't want them to change the graphics at all but at least they could've make a HD resolution compatibility, that would have justified the buy for me.So, do I recommend this game ? Hell yeah !Do I recommend you buy it on Steam ? Hell no ! They didn't even bother to check if the game would run properly on a current PC. I work in computers for a living so I know my way around and it still took me 2 hours just to launch the game (and my time playing the game is not updated on my profile, I didn't play it just 6 minutes) !My advice : buy it elsewhere like on Good Old Games, the pack Commandos 2 + 3 only costs 5$ and download a mod allowing 1920x1080 resolution.

												Commandos 2 is one of few examples, where a sequel of the game turns out at least just as good, if not better, then the original idea.To be clear: if there is a single flaw of Commandos 2, compared to Commandos 1, it is low difficulty level.In a nutshell: the game is isometric sneaker strategy / logical game in real time, World War 2 themed, British commandos fight against III Reich and ... Japan, consists of ten regular missions, nine bonus missions (+1 regular mission 'bonus phase'), and two trainings, roughly 20-40 hours to beat.So what it is all about? The key idea remains the same: player has 1-8 (usually 3-5) commandos to control plays missions against 10-50 (sometimes 100+) soliders on the map being outmumbered and outgeared, the player must use silent takedowns without setting off the alarm, at least for most part of the mission. enemies have their own sight and hearing areas, most of the time the player approaches from behind, and in places which are isolated from another guards, this usually requires luring the guard out from crawded area, distracting anoter patrolmen or combination of both, all settled during the WW2, though with fictional history. One will for instance visit Asia and Pacific as a British commando.The commandos 'specialise' in following areas:  a dirty job guy aka Green Beret, stealth and melee combat expert,  a sniper, one shot one kill, can collect ammo from enemies,  a diver, can swim unnoticed in deep water,  a sapper, demolition expert,  a driver, gunner and tank operator, also handles ""exotic"" weapons,  a spy, covert ops expert, can dusguise himself as an enemy and chat the guards,  a thief, sneaker but with limited combat abilities,  Natasha, spy / sniper equivalent (shows up in three missions, where European officer would be too suspicoius),  a dog, another distractor but is cool.Compared to C1, all the commandos have shared set of skills, which includes: shoting a gun, machine guns and rifles (except for sniper rifle), stunning enemies with fist punch, carrying bodies, driving small cars, swimming and (limited) diving, using medpacks, disguise as enemy solider (though only the Spy can do this efficiently), distracting with cigarettes, decoy, etc.The commandos no longer seem to be rookies.This actually makes the game way easier, as a tight cooperation is no longer needed.On the other hand this varied set of skills adds a lot of freedom into the game, and one no longer needs to stick with the Green Beret.The game lost its deadly alarms and garrnison patrols, which were almost a signatue feature of the first part (and usually resulted in mission failure).The enemies are far less aggressive and leave a large time margin of error before opening fire.More then enough to get back to safety.They are more susciptable for diversion and there are more ways to distract them.So what did the game gained? Why it is still worth anything?A lot of freedom. A lot of equipment (compared to C1): smoke grenades, gas grenades, bottles of wine, sleeping pills, wire traps, landmines, bazookas, fresh meet (for guard dogs), binolucars.Gun blazing is now more possible, but stealth actions remain a tactics of choice (plus it is fun with all those toys).Possobility to explore and fight inside buildings.Ten unique missions (+ a couple of bonus), every single one has something which makes it distinctive (including a mission with no killing, whose objective is to steal enemy documents).Campaing progress menu, possiblility to replay a particular mission.Bonus objective, and item collections which unlock bonus missions.Commandos 2 introduced amazing (for its time 2001) interaction with the environment including: daytime / night time (only one mission), switch off the lights to hide in shadow,  frost (limited time to stay outside buildings, one mission only), search the shelves and boxes for equipment,  enter and expore buildings, get into the building through the door or windows,  sniper shot through the window,  climb a pole to move unnoticed, hide corpses in a pile of thrash, hide yourself under the table.The game still offers quick save + load, still used quite frequently. While it is a war game most of enemies can be stuned and knocked out without killing.On top of that the missions are scored based on time taken, damage, exploration and stealth level, including mentioned nonlethal takedowns.The game is almost 15 year old, and offers a maximum resolution of 1024 x 768, but on my 17'' notebook I find the video surprisingly good, mainly due to reasonable amount of details and limited 'graphical pattern reuse'.The music is finally present in the game and sound effect seem also fine, don't distract a lot.Flaws? low-to-medium difficulty level (even ""very hard"" difficulty is a mid-game of Commandos 1), The boxed Commandos 2 version featured short cienematics between the missions, which don't run in Steam version,I cannot tell if this is a common problem or just a config / codecs issue on my computer, When scaled to 16:9 display, the graphics gets a bit pixelized.Do not play if: you are allergic to old games / hybrids / isometric cameras.Do play if: well... just play!

												A Masterpiece! Truly one of the most beautiful, well crafted and compelling games ever made. Brilliant characters and missions!

												Commandos 2 is the best of it's series. In the aspect of today gaming stand point. This game is brutaly hard and unforgiving for any small errors that you can messed up with.It's a ww2 squad-based strategy that treat player like a man. No hand holding. No tutorial (actually it has, but they look more like exams before let you to the real mission). You have to learn how to survive by reading manual and tooltips. If you can't learn to use hotkeys at least. you will ended up pressing quick save and quick load the most.If you are new to this series you will die a lot , but at the same time you will see that enemies will leave that small window of oppatunity open for you as a smart guideline to encourage you to try new approch tactics. As for the result , every guard you knockdown , every enemies you have killed , every thievery or sneaks you can pull off will feel so much rewarding.One more thing i have to say is this game has exceptional fantastic soundtracks. some may say these tracks sound a little too hype to be in this kind of game that you have to take your time. But they did make you want to come back and kick more nazi's♥♥♥♥♥If you are looking for a classic and a challenging experiance then buy it. this sums up all the meaning of good old classic pc games.

Recommendation level:|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|+|Commandos 2 is real-time squad-based tactical strategy game which was came out more than a decade ago and is still considered as the best of its kind.Good:Huge, well-designed maps can be completed through various ways. Different tactical approaches are available via the lots of items that can be found around the map. Needs some brain-work even on the lowest difficulty. The team is well established, every mate has its unique style. Gameplay design is great, there is not much to be desired, most of the things work flawlessly. Save system is very user friendly, as you can save your state whenever and wherever you want. The pre-rendered graphics are still looking good. Resolution can be easily modded without braking the visuals.Bad:Easier, sometimes a little bit duller gameplay compared to the previous titles. Some glitches and weird stuff due to the rendering style.Overall, the second Commandos is not as hardcore as the previous installments of the series, but instead lets you deal with things the way you want. Its presentation and ideas are making it a must have even after many years.MY OPINION: 9.0/10 (OUTSTANDING)Graphics: 8/10World Design: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 8/10Replay Value: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What other game can you command a squad of elite commandos, be in an 3D simulated isometric world, and explore the world, plus for it to actually be good? Well then, Commandos 2 is the answer you would be looking for. This game is able to capture that epic feel of being an elite commando, not one, not two, but eight. In a variety of missions all around the world, taking on the Japanese Empire in Asia and the Nazi Forces in Europe. This wide variety of missions are all housed on massive maps, with plenty of ways to tactically go through. As well, each map has bonus content hidden in each one, which unlocks even more maps for the astute players. The level variety, and enemy variety are amazing, with tactics unlimited, as well the music is sublime, unique to each level, and keeps the tone and gravity of the high stakes game of warfightering.The commandos themselves are a particularly interesting note to mention in the game. Out of all of them, there is only one American character, which is a nice deviance from the typical video game standard of making every character in WWII an American. The commonwealth is strongly recommended, france has their own few commandos, and even the USSR is represented. All together, the human interaction, and true comradery between these ""Men of Courage"" brings out their grin worthy character and qualities. Its that feeling that its more than just a game with pixels, that this is high stakes, that the world is there to be saved by you, and you alone.This is why the game can be appropriately recommended, because it simply is excellent. It doesnt hold your hand, its not gonna treat you nicely sometimes, but it manages to not matter. You keep pushing, you keep trying, you keep reloading. You need to, do you know why? Because the world is at stake, and you are the only one to save it, now get out there soldier, and kill me some Schutzstaffel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I've ever played. Still today i fire it up and enjoy beautiful graphics, excellent gameplay and music. Many comments around web said that it was harder than first one. But i think it's the other way around IMHO. Yes, the maps are larger, enemies are all over the place, but you get more means to dispose of the nazis, which makes things easier but yeah, there's a lot of them. It might not appeal to newcomers not used to this type of gameplay, but for this price and with so many good comments you can hardly go wrong with the purchase. Highly recommended...

												As most of the people around the globe would say ""the best tactical strategy game of all times"". This game is surely the best around. I've played Comandos: Men of Courage countless of times and everytime its like first time. Love the intro's in beginning of each mission, the story telling takes you deeper in history...This game by far is the first in list of my favorite games! Pyro studio surely did made a masterpiece, i only wish that more people have played this and i would like to try it online as i never had an opportunity to play against someone.Keep aware though, for newbies this game might be too complicated, but for the ww2 type based game lovers it will just take a couple of minutes to find out how to control all the characters given in Comandos. The game can either be played peacefully or aggressively, so sometimes it just depends what mission you are on to. Most likely nearly all missions can be played peacefully (undetected by enemy soldiers) and therefore playing this way can get you very high in ranks.I really liked the many ways how to take out Nazi soldiers, you could either hit, tie and gag, or knife from behind, cut throat behind, shoot, hit, burry (trap), make them walk over booby-traps, poison, use throwing knifes, molotov, grenade them or just tie up and drown soldiers in water. The game gives you many possibilities of how to complete certain missions. I've also learned that in most cases ignoring some of the side missions, like defusing water mines can be fatal after completing the main for example.By far the most favorite of all missions were the bonus missions you get for completing secret pictures, this is where you test your commanding abilities and strategy the most.So i suggest you try Comandos: Men of Courage, this game will get you addicted fast, but most importantly enjoy the game any way you want.ps. the most fun you can have is tie and gag all soldiers on map, then take a drive in car, truck or tank and run the over  just for the lols. +If you tie Japanese soldier in burma, throw him near crocodile view range and see what happens haha! Goodluck and Have Fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's funny how back in the day (and certainly today) people were complaining that this game is too hard. That's what the genre and this saga is about, and that's what makes hardcore players love this game. Those without degrees in strategy gaming will find this game impossible to play, in many cases, too hard to accomplish. But lucky for me, at the time, I was well versed in the ways of the special forces.

												The best of the best in this category. Graphics are still looking decent, playability is good, variaty is great, missions even better. Only flaw is that the AI isn't that good, compared to same era game Desperados. Fooling the AI is made too easy and so the game is pretty easy too. Single pack of cigarettes is the key to most situations and when officer is available everything becomes even easier. Comparing to the first installement, this is far more approachable game and the learning curve isn't that steep. There are multiple solutions to most situations, although the cigarette & officer is the way to go in most situations.Thought the game is easy, it also takes considerable time to complete (22 hours for full playthrough on my 4th time). Steam sales has the game costing only 80 cents, so it's worth a try if you have the time for it. It has 2 tutorial missions 10 longer missions and 9 smaller missions if you happen to find all hidden puzzle pieces. I already had it on my shelf as a hard copy, but thought this could be fun to play sometimes when the hard copy isn't available.Although the version is 1.2. there are still some annoying things in inventory that one needs to learn before making mistakes, although since the game is easy, most items are not needed at all. Resolution is maxed at 1024x768 so beware if you like widescreen. Not sure if there's a fix for this.T/S+M1+Q+M1+Shift M1 + shift M1 + M1. That's all you need to learn.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It also teaches you to love the quicksave and quickload features. It's pretty hard, but very rewarding and fun.Bad part is that this game doesn't natively have high resolution, and though it can be hacked to work with higher resolutions ( https://sites.google.com/site/xbootx/home/commandos2 ) it doesn't work properly with resolutions higher than 1440x900.Still a great game.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So.. Commandos 2: Men of courage, Its a great game, gives you a good vison of what world war 2 was, and how some of the well known, ""Commandos"" do their work.The team has 8 members:""Sapper"": He's a demolitions expert, but doesnt run that fast, and cant climb on walls.""The Marine/Diver"": He is, as you should already know a diver, he also has a grapling hook, that he can use to climb onto buildings ect.""Green Berret"": A well known Irish Commando, he is in all of the games in the franchise, he has a knife, and has big muscels, he can lift metal boxes.""The Thief"": He is a small, fast, clever commando who was a thief, he's from france, and was just introduced in  this game.""Spooky"": He is also a Frenchman, a middelaged man, who was in all of the games, he is known for his medical arsenal, he can stun, knock out, or kill his enemies.""The Driver"": He is actualy not just any driver, he can drive planes, cars, tanks ect.He is also an expert with molotov cocktails.""Natasha"": She is a russain spy, who joined the commando corps in the second game, she can distract guards by *Clears throat* Showing off, it's funny to just distact guards and see them loose everything just to  watch her.""The Sniper"": He is one of the best snipers of the allies, he has an Amarican sniper, he quickly becomes a loveble charecter to the series.""Rating:The voice acting is not the best, but is forgiveble.The gameplay is both hard and great, you need to get used to them.The graphics are alright since the game out 14 years ago, Also the year i was born haha.. The Charecters are loveble and you will quickly find you favurite commando, mine is of course The thief.Overall rating: 9/10Sorry for my bad english, since im from another contry. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sequel to the original Commandos and probably the best in the trilogy! Developed by Pyro Studios and released back in 2001 Commandos 2 offers a 3D isometric view - we command a squad of soldiers who are specially trained allied conscripts and their task is to try and bring the allies closer to overthrowing Nazi Germany by completing various objectives throughout the 10 missions offered by the game. The game looks dated, for sure, but I'm not sure that there are many such real-time strategy games out there. I would not recommend this to newcomers of the genre but to people who played this on their good-old rig more than 10 years ago. If you search Google a bit or the forums on Steam you can find a solution to the missing widescreen resolutions. This is good as this means the game can be enjoyed on modern PCs, as well.This is a real gem! I would only wish that there was another developer such as Pyro who did a remake or yet another sequel to the franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the definition of how hard it would be to pull off stunts like this in an actual war, and stay alive. In general, it is pretty hard and unforgiving, but with trial and error, you will slowly get better at it. The gameplay itself is pretty decent and intuitive (better read those ingame manuals) and you generally want to keep all your commandos alive to strive in the game. It actually has an option to set up multiple cameras at a time, how anyone can actively keep track of more than 2 cameras at once, I don't know. The game heavily relys on you memorizing at least some hotkeys, because a bunch of the time it requires fast thinking and acting, so if you rely on using the mouse for things like items and weapons too much, you'll find your characters full of lead.One of the most notable things about the game is the soundtrack, it is just plain awesome and upbeat.It's definitely the best of the series, if you want to try ANY of the Commandos games, you should try this one first.

Short version: 91%Better graphics, huge maps, simplified controls and less strict game mechanics were a great recipe for success for Commandos 2, even if the more hardcore fans were a bit disappointed with the more monotonous gameplay and low difficulty.Long version:Commandos 2: Men of Courage was the most successful entry of this series of isometric strategy/stealth World War II games about a small group of international soldiers sent behind enemy lines.The game features ten missions (plus ten bonus levels) with great map size and large variety in design and objectives. The levels have a more cinematic feel to them, thanks to replacing the short briefings with dialogues, and also adding small arcing plots.The general goal of the game remained: sabotage Nazi and Japanese forces, which can mean anything from blowing up a submarine to saving some POWs.To achieve this, you are usually required to get rid of all enemy soldiers on the map – mostly by stealth, but some segments require combat, and in some cases you even need to fend off invading forces. The latter ones don’t really fit into the game though, as they are more of a repetitive memory game that gets pretty boring pretty fast.The commandos themselves received an overhaul. Everyone retained their unique abilities, but basic actions like driving, knocking out enemies, and carrying bodies can be done by anyone.This was a double-edged sword. Many situations require team coordination, but this coordination mostly means throwing two packs of cigarettes to the floor and quickly hitting two soldiers on the head. This trick works for the majority of the game, leaving gameplay quite repetitive, especially when you need to do this on more than a hundred enemies.If you can live with this repetitive nature, the great map design will more than make up for it, giving you a memorable and quite long game for very little money.

												For a game which turned 13 this year, it stands up incredibly well. It's probably the best game in the series, which began to lose something with Destination Berlin and lost it decisively with Strike Force. I'd highly recommend it to an fan of real-time strategy games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even now this game deserves to have a full price. I bought it from steam just because... I already have it 2-3 physical copies of it collected through the years. You can lose sleep playing all the commandos games. Definetly the most underrated (from the new generation) series ever. Beware though, some of them might require some mods to be able to play without problems on widescreens.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a huge fan of the series. Commandos 2 is my favourite of the bunch.It's a must-play tactics game, and a genre-defining example of intelligent gameplay and design.However, the chances of getting it to work on a system running Windows 10 is hit and miss.Personally I've tried every fix described in the forums, as well as others I've used with my original CD version. Most of them don't work, depending on the particular issue you're having, and even when they do work the game will run once and then never launch for you again until you reinstall it, or re-patch it manually.Basically, buy it on GOG, like you should with any classic title that needs post-release patches or an entire support support network of mods and tweaks for modern systems.The developers patched this version of the game recently, but with Steam's launcher and api being the issue I'm having, it's still impossible to get it to run for more than a mission or two without a CTD followed by the need to reinstall it. Not worth your time unless bought elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commandos 2: Men of Courage is the successor of Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines and its stand-alone expansion. This new installment features new characters with unique abilities, such as the French thief and the Russian seductress, and a loot system, much like what is seen in the Men of War games, and new maps of which some in the pacific against the Japanese. Fans of the previous Commandos games will love this title, if not more, despite maybe needing to use workarounds to get it working properly. That's unfortunately an illness among almost all Commandos games, that they haven't been optimised/readied to be used in modern systems. All-in-all a great game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best tactical stealth games ever made. Haven't played 3 yet but I can say that 2 is much better than 1. You control a selection of soldiers each with their own personality, abilities and traits. Each level is sort of a sandbox with lots of hidden weapons and utilities you can use to complete your objectives. The objectives are all very clearly defined with lots of maps and pictures in your intelligence folders along with the documentation of each tactic, ability and item in the game simply at the press of a button. I would recommend learning the hotkeys and to quicksave a lot, but make sure you don't do it the second you get shot at, as you might regret that.The graphics are holding up very well since most of the levels is 2D with lots of detail. 3D models are small enough to not notice the limited polycount.The program itself is clearly dated though as you can only use 4:3 resolutions, and you can only change the in game resolution (every time you hit ESC or watch a cutscene your res will change to the menu resolution for the time, then back again which is a pain with windowed mode since it always resets the position of the window). Check the pc gaming wiki on how to enable window mode (it is a simple cfg tweak, disables mouse scroll sadly). Be careful with the window mode as the game can and will crash 8/10 times you click outside of the game. Other than this it runs fine on W10 x64 without any compatibility issues.Haven't tested co-op yet but I assume it will work fine through a LAN, as all of these older games do without any problems.

												When i was a lad, i sent my poor mum off to buy me a game that I saw in a store and did not remember the name of, with the only hint that ""It had a guys face on the front"" and she accidentally brought me back commandos, and I was devastated, shed picked the wrong one. Then I played it, and this game has been on my top ten favorite games list ever since.Commandos 2 is the sequel to the incredibly difficult ww2 tactical top down game Commandos. Commandos two introduces new characters, 3-d art models on a 2-d background that can be rotated, and more options to go into combat with. Very few games allow the intense amount of freedom this one does. The game gives you a choice to go with its idea, or your own, and does not penalize you for going at it your way. Sneak in, disguise, break in shooting nazis everywhere. Trap things, steal uniforms, kill officers, or dont kill anyone at all. This is a game to be played the way you want to do it, the only thing limiting you is the commandos the game chooses for each level and their gear. Each commando has his own talents and abilities, and theres not one single commando that you will use more than any other. This is a gem that many people may have missed, and that is a travesty. This is a damn good game that will please any gamer that loves strategy, tactics, and espionage. Play the whole mission using the lightning fast theif, lupin, or slit some throats with the green beret, Tiny. Blow up buildings with the sapper, or poison the leading officer and assume his identity as the spy, these are your battles, fight them your way. The game comes with a large amount of levels and every level can unlock a bonus mission if you collect all the diaries in the level, leading to countless hours of playtime and tons of replayability.

 NOTE: TO PLAY MY MOD SCROLL DOWN TO END FOR DOWNLOAD	 The amount of Details and features in this game is absolutely amazing for a game from early 2000s. the graphics are gorgeous and even today i dont feel like it is outdated. this commandos is the most completed one in the series because it has paied attention to EVERYTHING that you can imagine. you can knock out an enemy tie him up and throw him infront of corocodiles in river kuwai and they kill him but make sure you stay away cause then they start chasing you, or you can dive into savo island waters and face the brutal sharks or how about diving to Burma river and be eaten by piranhas?when i was 11 this game came out and it was my daily life and i loved everything about this game but if you are a new comer to this series do not start with this one.Commandos 2 unfortunately suffers from a few things, the amount of details has made the game a bit more casual and easy and for a hardcore commandos player like me who has grown up with behind enemy lines since i was 7 this game doesnt really provide any challenge even on hardest mode. the enemies are way too slow in reacting and if you play it on anything below hard mode your men will not even die you can revive them at any time by a medic pack just like in battlefield (wtf).Also if you are keen to check out my Mod for this game which provides you realistic gun sound effects, higher difficulty and more:Link to trailer:

												One of the best game ever created. The game takes locations from real world and movies based on WWII, puts you in scenarios filled with tough challenges, and provides means to finish objectives in various ways. This game I've played for so many years, still it amazes me to find that the possibilities of doing a mission could vary so much in terms of techniques and strategies one may apply. Anyone who may think this is another generic WWII game would be seriously mistaken. I recommend that one should play Commandos 1 (Behind Enemy lines), it's expansion (Beyond the Call of Duty) and THEN this one. Commandos 3 is better in graphics, but the game sucks mostly due to pointless removal of hotkeys. Get it play it, you will not regret this awasome old classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best game in Commandos series. The story is interesting, gameplay is fluid and quite good for the time it has been released. Last missions (Castle Colditz, Paris) are the best in the bunch.It offers both ends of the stlye: one can play quietly, like a sneaky assasin, or just shoot at everybody.The only objection I have is that if the resolution is higher than 640x480, the is a glitch (one second long break) between the gameplay and the menu. It's tolerable.If you can get this game for cheap in a sale, I'd wholeheartedly recommend buying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the all-time best strategy games ever made.  Probably one of the best games ever made.Hard as nails, rewarding, huge maps and involved tactical gameplay. Freedom to play cooperatively if you so choose. Do not be put off by its age - yes, it's dated but I've not known a game to age as this. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a game to set the bar for all strategy games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is basically the best Commandos game out there, thanks to Destination Paris. I personally played the previous two on a 98 before playing this one. This is a RTS that requires patience and skill. C2 expands on the previous two by adding more abilities, enemies, and mechanics. I especially like the in-game manual that explains everything you need to know. For others, this game won't work at first; for me, it worked straight out of the virtual box on my Windows 7 32-bit. The gameplay is a little bit challenging, but it is mangeable. I would recommend Commandos 2: Destination Paris because it adds in 118 missions amidst its heavy overhaul of mechanics, weapons, and other things! This mod plus the game itself make it a must buy. I also recommend the other games in the series. They are a little bit harder/complicated, but they are very fun and inspire nostalgia in those who have played the series before10/10 especially with C2:DP			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, if you loved the first 2 of the games themselves, than I recommend grabbing this one now while it's at it's lowest price, I remember playing this back in middle school, the game is like a quick-thinking and planning kind of game of how you would execute your missions from start to finish.

												One of my favourite games of all time. Excellent mix of tactical and action game. You can play it either quickly, focused on target, or slowly clear whole map - it's up to you, game really supports both styles. The game is packed with details - interactive objects, various items, enemy AI. Although it's quite old, the graphics don't look bad - maybe a bit low resolution, but still everything looks realistic. It's probably the only game I played thrice - and I still feel like I may return to it some time in future. I really recommend it! Good old school... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my chilhood's great memories. Are you a stealth type? You will like it.Like to blow up stuff and set up traps? Will enjoy.Quick thinking? You got it.The issues with this game come from being a 15 year old software:1 Some people will have trouble starting up the game. There is only sound but nothing on the screen. This can be solved by installing a codec pack.2 Resolution and graphics in general may not satisfy the 1080-ultra-60fps crew.It was a nice game on it days and it still is. Easier than its predecesors and with a better camera than its continuaiton. Rich maps, good challenge and plenty ways to complete the missions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Real time Strategy games ever made.Instead of commanding armies, you have one to ten World war 2 commandos, each with various unique abilities.Stealth in nature, it plays almost like an action puzzle game, having your men in the right position and using the right abilities, the game requires perfect timing for clean kills.While the AI isn't particually stellar, it never breaks the game, and they can suprise you on occasion. (Careful with footprints in the snow)One of the things you'll notice after a few hours of play is that some of your men are simply more useful than others. While some may have items or abilities required for mission success, you'll definitely use one or two over the others, for the majority of the game.In terms of graphics, it still holds up after all these years, each character is small on the screen but quite detailed, and the environments are so beautiful and well crafted, it's clear that a lot of research was done to make the game, which leads me to the next point.If you're a world war 2 buff, or you're just interested in that time period, you'll enjoy playing your part in history, destorying U-boats, assisting Ghurkas resist imperial japan, and decrypting the enigma code.Plenty of missions, great stealth action, it's just good old nazi killing fun for the whole family.

I guess Commandos started that.This is by far one of the best tactical assimetric games, and one of the best games of my teens. Even at full price this game is worth it.

												A huge and incredible jump following the success of Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines - And still looks just as exceptionalWe see a welcome return of much that made the first game amazing: A true David & Goliath situation where, using your wits and the skills of a handful of commandos, you must work your way through heavily-guarded encampments, cities and even Colditz Castle itself - eliminating enemy soldiers as you attempt to neutralise key targets, rescue captives and capture the enigma machine. Gratefully all of the commandos from the first game return, charming as ever, including a few extra faces. This goes way beyond point-and-click stealth - The game requires a lot of patience, careful planning and studying of enemy movements. For 10 missions (not counting bonus ones), there's a huge amount to do - so expect to divulge many hours into this... it's a beast!There's a ton of new features and abilities too - including completely revamped graphics and a superb soundtrack, the biggie is that you can now enter (and operate) within buildings - bringing huge levels of new scope to the missions. Each Commando also now has an 'inventory' and can carry / exchange any item (even if they cannot necessarily use them) and there's much more this time around in terms of raiding boxes / cabinets for useful items or pinching them off some guardsThe missions bring with them an exceptional variety too. Amongst the sneak-and-kill we're used to, the first night mission forces you to play without any killing. Another leaves you with just one Commando having to set free the rest of your companions, held captive in several different houses. You also get a number of 'defence' scenarios where you have to place your guys and a handful of friendly soldiers to defend against an attack force. It's varied and brings refreshing new elements to an already formidable gameI have two small gripes though. The first is that, compared to the original, it's not as difficult where you no longer have garrisons. Previously, patrols would start swarming the place if you set off the alarm - here, the consequence is less fatal. That's not to say the guards are any less dangerous, but you can sometimes ragequit a situation with a few well-aimed shots or explosives if you get fed up. The 'rooms' tend not to interact with each other much, so it splits up the levels into smaller easier-to-manage chunksThe second... Spike the rat (and a castaway with a trumpet). Come on... a specially trained rat that does backflips to distract enemy soldiers? You can get infinite uses, send it through doors and it pretty much distracts nearly any group... Talk about overpowered. It removed a lot of the challenge - not to mention being quite ridiculousTruth be told though, that's nit-picking. It's an otherwise exceptional title which successfully manages to retain much of what made the first so ground-breaking, whilst valiantly bringing in a cavalcade of new features and dynamics. Superb work			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that makes me wish there was a Neutral option in addition to Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down. My complaints about Beyond the Call of Duty apply to this installment as well: Too many shared abilities water down the puzzle aspect and difficulty. All of the characters have the means to: lure enemies away from posts and patrols incapacitate them non-lethally carry bodiesMaybe that doesn't sound like much but those three actions actually account for about 90% of dealing with enemies in this game.Overall, the word I'd use to describe this game compared to Behind Enemy Lines and Beyond the Call of Duty would be: complex. There is a VERY steep learning curve to controlling the characters fluidly. The hotkeys to their tools/skills span the entire keyboard and differ between characters. It took me a long time before I stopped stumbling over the controls during high intensity situations that required precise hotkey-ing.All characters now have ""roleplaying game""-style inventories. Whereas previously all tools/abilities were displayed on the sidebar backpack, now there's a per-character inventory for carrying different objects and equipment. Characters can also carry equipment that can only be used by other characters, too. e.g. the Diver can hold bombs even though only the Sapper can use them. In addition, boxes, cabinets, chests, etc. are scattered throughout the map and need to be searched to find items/weapons and a set of unlock keys for bonus levels. All of that actually kind of annoyed me by padding gameplay time with what I feel to be filler material. There's a war going on here, and I'm trying to find scraps of photographs in random kitchen cabinets?Two new ""characters"" have been added to the starting lineup: A Thief and a dog. The dog has his own backpack/inventory space, does not agro enemies, and has a 'Green Beret's Decoy'-like function i.e. barking to draw attention. (-_____-) Come on, man! Really? Too easy. I enjoyed this game, I did, but I really can't help but feel that every installment drops a little bit further below the bar set by Behind Enemy Lines even as they add more and more ""stuff"". I can't stress enough how bad I think it is that the classes share so many abilities. The Green Beret used to be the only guy who could cause a distraction while being elsewhere by using the Decoy. Then they let everyone throw rocks and cigarettes. Then they created an almost autonomous Decoy: the dog. Used to be only the Green Beret and the Spy were strong enough to carry bodies. Now everyone can carry bodies. The only thing that only Tiny can lift is barrels now, and I never used them in this game because bombs were so abundant.The Sniper is.... still the only guy who can snipe. Phew.The Diver used to be the only guy that could pilot boats. Now anyone can do it. He used to have a silent and lethal albeit short-range weapon: the harpoon. Now the harpoon is only useable underwater. There are very few opportunities to use it. They combined his short-range lethal with his Knife to give you a Throwing Knife ability. Rarely useful because it is not silent.Sapper is still the only person who can use explosives but they took away his man-trapping ability and gave it to the Driver for some reason. They also took away his exclusive wire-cutting priveleges and gave it to everyone. Instead he's now the only guy who can detect and defuse mines.The Driver's original niche was being the only guy who could drive vehicles and the only one to use a machine gun. Granted, I never once used the machine gun because it's slow rate of fire and straight line spread made it borderline useless, but at least he could drive. Now everyone can drive. His exclusive abilities are: Rigging tripwire Setting mantrap Throwing knockout gas/smoke/incendiary grenades Digging pitfalls....Uhhh, since everyone can drive now, what do we need a ""Driver"" class for? He should be called the Trapper given his new skillset. It almost looks like they had too much stuff the Sapper would have needed to carry so they just spread it out and divided it with Tread because he wasn't doing much.The Spy is actually a little more useful here than in BCD. Once he has Distracted an enemy he can now command them to do two things: Look a certain direction or Walk a short distance to a specified location. You can literally Distract a guard and tell him to walk into a mantrap.The new Thief class has a few special qualities. He can crawl under barbed wire, he stole the climbing ability from Tiny,  he can climb in through windows, and deploy a Rat that will Decoy enemies in short range. He's also the fastest runner.I feel like the gang could really afford to ditch the Driver and the Thief and just divvy up their abilities amongst themselves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that makes me wish there was a Neutral option in addition to Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down. My complaints about Beyond the Call of Duty apply to this installment as well: Too many shared abilities water down the puzzle aspect and difficulty.

The only ""thumbs down"" is that it's a little less challenging than the previous titles. But if you like the previous 2 (BEL and BTCOD) you will like this too.I give it a 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't quite know how a game published by Eidos 10 years ago is today considered ""indie"" but Commandos represents a genre of games that nowadays would NEVER get made (real-time tactical stealth?), and 2 is my personal favorite of the series. You're given a small team of units, each with unique and VERY limited abilities, with which you must infiltrate fairly large areas and complete objectives. Getting spotted with most characters means death/KO due to low health, and since everyone's usually needed for the plan to succeed, that means you restart the stage. Winning requires first just not moving an inch, watching the enemies patrol the entire map, and figuring out where to start. This can take a while but Commandos 2 at least has a few guys for whom you can decide ""screw THIS,"" set off an alarm, and just MURDER EVERY NAZI AND JAPANESE YOU SEE. But at its core, this is a game about distractions, disguises, traps, & silent kills or KOs. It's The Great Escape, not Saving Private Ryan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worked for about 20 minutes and then never again.  Bought the series on sale.  Behind Enemy Lines and Beyond the Call of Duty work flawlessly (with plenty of patches out to fix issues, though I haven't had any), but Commands 2 and 3 fail on launch no matter what I do.  I've been to every forum, guide, community, I've tried registry fixes, resolution adjustment files, I've run it in every compatibility configuration, the game is flat BROKEN.  I don't lament the $0.50 I spent on the game, I lament my inability to play a game that holds so much nostalgia for me.  Shame on whoever rolled out the gamebreaking patch and then left it for dead and shame on Steam for not putting the screws on them to fix their game or remove it from the store.  Until they fix the current issues, DO NOT BUY.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Tactical stealth strategy game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can have multiple profile slots.There is a difficulty settings.There is training camp (Required to do this).There are some resolution sizes.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.There is a Master volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is an Ally voice volume slidebar available.There is a briefing voice volume slidebar available.About the game.There are a couple of things that i hate about the game. The controls, They keep changing the controls. Yes i know that you are able to customize it, but why keep changing it. The game also runs way too fast compared to the Commandos 1 Series. Each commando doesn't really feel like he has a role. Back in the Commandos 1, Every commando has a purpose and a role. ""Driver is driver, diver is diver, sniper is sniper, spy is spy"" and so go on. I Don't get that feeling in this game at all. Each Commando has their own name aswell, which is confusing. I have the feeling that some information are left out or arent good explained.There are multiple save slots available.There is no Shift + Tab.Message from friends (if you have friends ofcourse), wont be shown.You can rotate the camera to have a different screen view. Save and loadgameOther things.I just didnt like this commandos part. It didnt feel like it was a commandos game at all, compared to the other one. Im sure other people would love this game. But nobody has a role here. They are basically on one line. which i didnt enjoy.-------------------I Give this game a 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I thought this game was easier, but then... it took almost 40 HOURS to finish it (at 1st attempt), and the 2nd level took me 4 hours! If you like an hard game, this is the best you can find!This game is WWII related and you have the control of a squad of commandos made by 8 characters. Each man has unique abilities and weapons (for example, the Sapper is the only man who can use explosives).The game's charm is in figuring out enemy's patterns, you have to observe the environment, planning all the tactics for knock out the enemies and don't alert nobody. The game is full of commands and hard to learn all of them, but when you learn the useful ones (like Q for the fist or A for the main attack of the character, for example) it get's easier. A single error can ruin the whole mission and drop your rating in the end of the level.There are 10 levels + 2 training levels, but you can unlock other 9 bonus missions if you take all the ""bonus pages"" in any main level and you complete a photo with these parts.I highly suggest to play this game! During the sales you can take the whole series at 2€ only!I don't know if this games works in the newest OS, but in Windows XP works fine!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I spent my entire evening beating the first tutorial, just like old times.This, in my opinion, is the best Commandos game in the series followed by the third one. I played this about 14 years ago when it first came out and I am amazed that it works flawlessly with today’s hardware and OS. I’m playing it now on Windows 8.1 64-bit on my GTX 970 on a widescreen monitor and it runs like a charm. I need to mention those specifications because I read a few users having problems with those setup. Sure, the graphics are outdated but it’s the same good old Commandos game I enjoyed when I was a kid-hard but rewarding.This game is one of the best of its kind. It’s worth every penny.9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game that i have sunk hundreds of hours into before i bought it on steam.Problem is no matter what i try i cant get this game to work, and im not the only one that is having problems. It just doesnt seem to like modern computers and although the developers have claimed to fix the issue, what they actually did was remove multiplayer completely (before adding it back due to massive backlash from the people that CAN get it working...)  without fixing any of the problems users was having.Like i said, it was great game but buy it at your own risk. If they ever fix it, i will happily change my review to recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commandos 2 — игра-переросток. Из красивого особняка Pyro Studios сделали небоскреб, да еще поналепили этажей сбоку. Выглядит величественно, спору нет. Удобно перемещаться: тебя постоянно подхватывает то лифт, то услужливый эскалатор. Коридорные дарят тебе цветы. Зеркальные окна, как щиты, прикрывают от лучей солнца. Но это величие отпугивает незваных гостей. Тем, кто не был вхож в дом первой Commandos, тут просто нечего делать. “Только для фанатов” — гласит плакат у входа. Да и тем после пары миссий захочется вытереть пот со лба и пойти немного прогуляться.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this when i'm still a kid, and it's still as good as i remember it, the difficulty is a little hard though, but you'll get used to it. So basicly the plot is about a group of allied commando unit fighting axis in WW2. The mission ranges to sabotaging a submarine pen, blowing a bridge, rescuing VIP in a middle of warzone, and so on. You can also pick up items that can help with the mission, like finding bombs, guns, medkits, and such, thus giving it a bit of a RPG element. The gameplay really good, if you ever met with trouble like a soldier that always looking at the entrance to a door that leads to your mission goal, the door is in his line of sight and if you get in his line of sight he will alert the other soldier, you can kill him but the other soldier has his line of sight on the soldier that you need to kill, thus rendering frontal attack useless. So how do you get pass him? The game provide many ways to do it, you can command your commando to disguise as the enemy and get him to provide distraction by talking to the other soldier, and then you command your other unit to attack the soldier that watching the door, or you can throw a cigerattes to distract the soldier out of the other soldier line of sight thus allowing you to attack him, or maybe there's another way to the mission goal and you should look for another way in. The music is also really good, there's nothing else that i can say about the music. It's excellent.Grapich wise it's still good for an old game, though sometimes the background blends with certain object, thus making it hard too click on that object. (The ladder on the top of the tower that located near the fueltanks in mission 3 kinda blends to the background making it hard too click) But nonetheless it's not a really big deal.This game is a real recommend for those strategy games fans.""Herr commandant, It's not our fault that we suddenly get gagged and tied. We only trying to get the cigeratte pack that laying in the middle of an artic desert, there's nothing wrong about that right?"" ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commandos the year 1999 i was 9, finding commandos behind enemy lines in an eletroniques boutique catalouge. It was known as electronics boutique back then not EB. My dreams had come true, an army based isometric view game with a lot of detail! i played over and over again also its expansion beyond the call of duty. i played these games religiously untill men of courage came out in 2002. Pre orderd from electronics boutique and was not disapointed built heavily on a great game, added heaps of new content and built a whole new 3d engine which proved to be beautiful. this game isnt for people who want an easy run, its highly stratigic and very frustrating sometimes, however that makes it so very addictive.   You definetly must keep quick saving or u will rage. great graphics, alot of levels, doesnt have the bugs newer games have, pyro studios being one of my favorate of all time. this is one of those games that i will never forget i will come back and play again and again. there is secrets and stuff like that too which will grant u extra levels to play on. overall one of the best militry strategy games out there. you grow to love the characters as well. dont believe all the hate about it not working  just because they cant get it working. for this price its worth the shot. i have win7 64bit runs beautiful never had an issue with this game on any computer ive owned			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commandos 2: Men of Courage combine the brutally long gameplay of its predecessors with modernized graphics. The game, while still maintaining the long mission length, somehow manages to be easier than Commandos 1.  There is more leeway for mistakes and as result Commandos 2 is less masochistic than its predecessor. That doesn’t mean this game will be easy on beginners though, in fact the tutorial and first few mission should hurt your ego if you think this game will be a cake walk. The graphic, sound effects and musical score are all very nice and varied. However, the game severely fails when it comes to clarity of objectives and pathetically easy enemy takedown patterns. In some missions the objectives are borderline invisible, so you may have killed all the enemies on the map, but if you can’t find the one specific npc, you will never leave the map. Overall a good entry level and modern commandos game, imo the best of the series regardless of a few negatives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WTF!! I bought this game so that i would have a low requirement game to play on my netbook just to pass some time. the netbook doesnt have the hardware to handle modern games and is mostly used for simple tasks like watching videos online or word processing, spreadsheet, paying bills etc...  When i first installed the game it wouldn't even run I had to go to the microsoft website and download an old plugin for DX8 called ""direct play"" even after that it still crashed twice before I finally had to restart my system then after restart the game finally decided to run. Then after all that i start the training mission to learn how to play and there is no help dialogue no tooltips nothing!! I spent 20 minutes just figuring out how to control my players and shoot enemy soldiers or use items, that is when the inventory menus don't glitch and prevent you from picking up items or randomly open info sheets about the items when im just trying to pick them up before I get shot. This game could be fun but with the horrible controls and interface it is almost unplayable and certainly not enjoyable. Did I also mention you can't play in anything better than 1024x768 resolution :/ Yah it was a cheap game but it should at least be playable!!AVOID THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it seems it works after all... (win 8.1 64bit)I played the first installment of the series long time ago and somehow it seems superior... I had issues to finish the tutorial, as the game does not show you all the options available to you. If you don't google it, you don't know how to: - tie up the enemies (only the big guy can do that) - carry the enemies (you need to tie them up first) - go up the posts... (use shift)I finally passed the first tutorial, then on the second one - pure sillyness. Friendly squad pinned down by enemy fire and Nazis running around - everybody is waiting for you to punch all the Nazis unconcious... Just so you know - punching is more silent than knives... It's probably an awesome game, but it's very hard to get familiar with it. As far as I remember, the first game was much more user friendly... I miss having all the portraits on the screen and all the available actions clearly presented to me.Maybe I will give it a try some other time,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												* (of 5): The game looks promising as a tactical combat game, although with very old graphic. Unfortunately the game won't accept my command to tie enemies and is therefore unplayable and not recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I downloaded this game overnight along with a bunch of other ones.I'm at work and think, hey, i'll play this game while on break. Doesn't look very demanding. So then I install, it asks to install some stupid **** for windows. I'm thinking, this should only take a second. It asks to restart. An hour later it finaly hits 100%, the problem is that it stays that way. ""Working on features 100%"" it says.  I wait, it hangs, I wait, it hangs.. I say **** this. From there took me about an hour of hard resets and troule shooting before I decided to do a system restore. Lost all my downloads, and work files since last night. Conclusion: I spent about 3 agitating, annoying, angry hours of my life due to this game and didn't even get to play it. This game is not meant for the Windows 8.1. I didn't get any work done either. Not to mention the hours I will spend downloading all those games again and doing the work I lost. **** you game! so so much!That's my .79 cents.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I believe this once was a great game so I had to try seeing it only cost 70c. But now I regret even spending that 70c into this game.The user interface is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible, nothing like other games use so it's really confusing. Also this game would need some kind of tutorial, since you have no idea what you have to do here. I don't know what some of the stuff is and what to do with it and how to even do it. There is no info of ANYTHING anywhere. It took me 5 minutes to even figure out how throw a grenade from my inventory.After trying the original desperado-game I needed another game like that, but in Desperados it was always clear what to do and how to do it, and what was the skills of my crew. I tried to give this game a chance and to learn it and to play it, but after a lot of rage the last straw was when the screen would always go into the upright corner of the map. I don't know if it was supposed to do that since there was no info of anything. It caused me to rage quit and remove this game from my computer and want to kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the devs of this game.I would really like to get my 70 cents back.♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a major difference between challenging difficulty and pure laziness when explaining basic game functions; maybe I'm too accustomed to being shown the ropes but this is like someone throwing you a chessboard and saying ""here, have fun.""I'd prefer not to read dozens of text tutorials to know how to play a game.

												Just started playing this game and here are my thoughts...Coming from a background where once upon a time I played the original Commandos game, I was expecting this to be similar.  The tutorial level sucks.  There won't be any explanations of how to do the things you need to do, who the characters are or anything.  You will have to dig around and find all the shortcut keys yourself.  Perhaps this game was meant to be purchased from a store with a physical manual that had a shortcut key sheet explaining everything.I'm determined though and so I will push on, but my first thoughts are that this is not an intuititive game.

												One of the timeless classic. I played Commandos 2 since I was a kid, and still playing now after 10 years. I am playing the game via steam launcher in win 7 64bit. Here is a link of some mods that allow playing in fullscreen https://sites.google.com/site/xbootx/home/commandos2So far it does not cause any performance problems. In high resolution, the game looks great, and very smooth. Commandos series is probably the only one of this genre still runs fine on modern laptop/pc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best classic games I ever played. Actually I played Commandos 2 on PS2 a lot, and I'm surprised when this game appeared on Steam Sale. The previous series are suck, trust me, after playing Commandos 2 you will say the exact same thing.Commandos 2 is a strategy game where you command 2 or more commandos (the team) to infiltrate enemy base or sneak behind enemy lines to ruin their plan. The game took place on WWII that means you'll face the infamous nazis and japanese. To score a mission you'll need to play the game flawlessly, and that means avoid being detected at all times especially on Hard level.You can knock an enemy unsonscious, tie them up, and throm them over the water or you can just stab them with Green Berret's knife to kill them silently. Don't wander around too much and make sure don't run like a crazy person because enemies will notice. You can also command Spy or Natasha to sneak pass the enemy ranks to steal some information, items or even you can just kill them with your commandos.Overall, this is a great game. The graphics? Well, not much to say, it's not that great but I think this game has a great gameplay that you won't regret buying it. Haven't try the Commandos 3 yet but I heard the fans rather dissapointed and prefer the Commandos 2 over it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played an hour and a half of this game, and I am honestly impressed. While it doesn't tell you much about the controls right off the bat, it does get easier the more you play. As for the way of playing, you can use a variety of tactics including stealth and just flat out shooting the enemy. I won't go so far as to say this is a must have, but It's worth the buck or two that you put into steam for it.			",100,4,0,13,5,0,6

You have to take this game one enemy at a time. Then load cause you didn't see the next guy over. And the two watching him. And then start over cause you worked yourself into quite a hole.

Worth the money, even when not on sale.I played through a CD version of this game many years ago. - Didn't run into any compatability issues.Gameplay involves using stealthy strategy.. it's a puzzle to figure out which enemy you can eliminate next. It's very, very satisfying. Can also involve some time to study enemy movements.			",230,25,2,14,15,0,34

 Do not buy. I love the commandos series BUT its not running on current hardware.I wonder if they even tested the game on recent hardware before steam publish.For ONE YEAR I'm trying to run this game without succes.The devs do not even bother. Steam discussions are full of people with problems.This is just a simple money grab.So for the people that want to get this game.. try to get it from other sources before buying on steam to test if your pc can even run it ^^Pc Specs:Windows 7 SP1 X64i5 4670K8GB Dominator RAMNvidia GTX 670If you dont believe me: http://www.swe-gaming.com/fsx/files/2014-03/211533_gameszzz.png EDIT:As for 3-8-2015 my game seems to work like a charm within Steam.Recommended :)			",60,2,6,0,10,2,5

												There's this excellent aura that works well with pretty graphics for 2.5D and its level of difficulty. There's nothing more fun than setting up a plan and killing a myriad of enemies. At first, it was really hard and only because I kept rushing. Finally I got around to accepting this wasn't a rambo-esq style game but more of a stealth and conquer. All in all, if you want superb strategy, try out this iteration in the Commando series.Design gets a 9 for the time it was made.Sound is just enthralling and the voice-overs are spot on.Gameplay is fluid and not restrictive for 2.5DPlot is average, nothing too enticing but it pans out nicelyNote: Most of my play-time was from before it was on steam, i used it play it for hours. Fun fact: my username originates from this very game. The Green Beret was my favorite character, so.			",164,6,6,26,8,0,21

												A big bit of me wants to put this as the best strategy ever, but then I replay 'Medieval: Total War' (which isn't even available to buy anymore, not even on Steam) and then 'Commandos 2' takes home the all-time silver. Incredibly involving, an infernally difficult learning curve, deeply pretty (even to modern standards), and epic on a scale that only James Cameron or Warren Spektor could master. The perfect PC game - console kids should not apply.			",244,16,7,14,15,2,31

												A great classic, in Commandos 2 you can go solo and take command of all available characters in a mission, or divy it up with a mate and try out some coordinating (multi and single share campaign levels). This one's a thinker, so you'll have to watch enemy patrol routes, line of sight, look for mines and traps and beware the dogs!

												This game is one of the most definitive stealth games. This game requires patience and strategy. Every character has their own unique abilities, making it stressful when you have different commandos. This is one of the best games I've ever played, though. High replayability and such.

												This is an old game. Don't expect awesome visuals or even expect resolutions higher than 1024x768. You can zoom in/out with (CTRL +) or (CTRL -).The game runs fullscreen by default, but I find full screen annoying when the cutscenes happen. I work around this by playing the game windowed (you can get out of full screen mode with ALT+ENTER). However, when windowed, panning the view is almost impossible using the mouse only. I resorted to holding down ALT and moving the mouse to pan the view.Multiplayer saves are restricted to quick save only. Also, multiplayer quick load doesn't seem to work at all once the mission has started. I resorted to re-creating the game again and quick loading from there.If you can overlook the apparent compatibility issues (and there are quite a few). This game is a lot of fun.Running on Win 8.1			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game for the patient gamers!  I've always loved the Commandos series from the beginning. It wasn't until I learned how to properly play the game that I found the beauty in the gameplay. It's not a game you can just run around gunning all the Nazi's down and hope to prevail. It's a game where you rather setup your attack or simply go around the obstacle using whatever gadgets or tricks you have up your sleeve.  That is the beauty in the gameplay. You can make up many different ways to get to your next point. During this time you will spend patiently waiting, hiding behind something out of a guards view as you inspect your surroundings and the entire environment where you plan your move.   Each Commando has his own special abilities and reasons for use so you generally have to mix it up and figure out which Commando to bring to the situation at hand.   While the game can seem brutal hard, there is a quick save and quick load feature which is best to use often. I constantly found myself reloading after making a mistake and trying to figure out the best way to accomplish the task at hand.   While the game has aged quite a bit, it's still a great play for any gamer this day in age mostly because there is none quite like it. The backgrounds are solid looking pieces of work that can be rotated at 4 different angles while the troops, Commandos, and most interactive environment objects are full 3D. You can also go for 360 degrees when you are inside a building. This makes for great planning and inspection of the environments.  Overall, I recommend this game as I consider it one of the benchmarks of this type of gameplay. For those unaware, its' not turned based or pause the gameplay and figure out what to do. It's all in real time and 1 mistake can cost you the mission instantly. Although like I said, there is a quick save and load for a reason and be prepared to use it often. The beauty in the game is making the corrections of the mistakes you made to get by and the rewards for the success upon finally completing a mission. Great game!  For another game similar to this that I think did a great attempt at trying to be like Commandos, look out for the original Desperados.			",175,14,2,6,7,0,6

												Still one of the best strategy games with well written characters and unique abilities. Played this game to death when it first came out 12 years ago, and it still looks and plays every bit as good as it did then. The controlls are a bit ""dated"" so to speak, but you can fully customize them for more convenient mapping. The only thing I could really say about this game is that I wish they had implemented Xbox-controller support (it had a relase on the XBOX as well), because that totally changed the game as you actively move around the character yourself in the XBOX version rather then point and click.

												It's one of those old, good games. Luckily, the graphics won't make your eyes blow up like most old games. This game is a bit difficult and I remember playing it when I was young, but hell, this doesn't even compare to Commandos 1, that thing is hard. It's one of those games that you play when the Internet doesn't work, or you're simply bored. Overall, a nice game. 7/10.			",94,6,3,2,4,2,6

												This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. In this game, you lead a group of Soldiers called ""Commandos"". There are 21 Missions in general. (2 Training Missions, 10 Main Missions and 9 Bonus missions.) For me, this game is VERY HARD, im only at Mission 2,but im trying to be stealthy.  Pros :                                                      -Good History.                             -Great Soundtrack.-Difficult Game.-Good Characters.                                 Cons:-None.10/10, Buy this game.			",80,5,0,9,4,2,3

												Commandos 2 is fantastically fun and challenging without being overly difficult.It's an isometric tactical squad thats very different from other games in the same genre, say Jagged Alliance in a sense that this game is heavily focused on stealth actions. Each characters has their own class, weapons that they can use and unique abilities. By combining these characters abilites you can beat every level with various approach. It's like playing puzzles with lots of way to solve.The only negative points i found in this game is the astounding amount of hotkeys with every characters have their own sets of keys because they use different equipment and abilities. I have to check the hotkeys every so often and it can be pretty confusing since everything is done in real time where your quick reaction and decision is very important.But nonetheless it's a very solid classic games.

												As a Game ""Hard as Bawls, but the reward is amazing"" Outstading Missions, intense Stealth, strategy game. This is not a game for turn off your brain and enjoy, this is a hard and awesome game, with the right mixture of action and strategy.As an Experience ""Great Art and Great Music""Nice atmosphere, Nice Music, Nice Art. This game has aged well, at least visualy.As a Memory ""Still Kicking"" Still awesome, as I remenber. It might not be as easy to get into, but the reward of beating a mission is amazing, If you love hard games and thinking games, you would love this. ALSO! If you love old WWII movies this will be also a treat.			",148,18,0,13,7,0,16

												A big bit of me wants to put this as the best strategy ever, but then I replay 'Medieval: Total War' (which isn't even available to buy anymore, not even on Steam) and then 'Commandos 2' takes home the all-time silver. Incredibly involving, an infernally difficult learning curve, deeply pretty (even to modern standards), and epic on a scale that only James Cameron or Warren Spektor could master. The perfect PC game - console kids should not apply.			",244,16,7,14,15,2,31

I would ignore the nitpick of a lack of tutorials (despite being an RTS), but, the amount of errors this game has on newer hardware/software is too much to ignore. Don't buy this version.Forgot to mention that the multiplayer doesn't function.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game that I have replayed again and again. It takes liberties with actual WWII history, but that's just to establish its own lore within the context. That's not an issue, however. Instead, the main issues I have are recently inflicted by remnants of the developer (Pyro has since become a mobile developer). While the game was definitely dated graphically, I feel that, short of mods, it didn't need an update. Let alone a hokey, barely competent update that essentially fills the screen up with more pixels rather than actually increasing fidelity or anything like that. Yet that, too, is not the main issue I have with this game.It's the bugs. Newly introduced ones at that.First off, before they updated the game I was right in the middle of the ""Saving Private Ryan"" mission. I was totally amped to continue my progress when BOOM! An update comes out of the blue and totally kills my save progress. On top of that, you had to do pull some moves to even get the game to launch properly. Then when I started playing I noticed a number of things that popped up that I never encountered before. The minor things may include missing animations (Tiny & Lupin no longer 'sneak' when walking near enemies, which actually hurts immersion a little), to some audio cut-offs. Also, it seems that when you have a commando leaning against a wall (a stealth tactic in the game), they are prone to appearing through said wall to any enemy on the other side. Also, some things feel like they are missing, but putting my finger on those is an arduous task at this point and I think you, reader, may get said point, too.My biggest problems are the bugs that cause either the game to not move forward at all (case in point, 'Castle Colditz', where you have to combine parts of a secret plan and use a radio in order to trigger an evacuation condition that allows you to complete the level). Another problem I ran into that FORCED me to cheat was on the 'Bridge Over the River Kwai' level, wherein you try to interact with the model of the bridge in order to initiate that level's level completion condition. It crashes to desktop each and every time you try. So, frustrated as I was, I was forced to fire up the cheat mode in order to go to the next level. They changed that a bit too but it's nothing concerning to me. Unless the developers screw up the game enough to warrant using this feature in the first damn place, which they damn well did so the joke is on them.If the game worked as it should have, then I'd heap nothing but praise upon this title. It had been my favorite for over 12 years, and still is, in spite of the hackneyed attempts to ""revitalize"" it. Do a better job, guys, or go home and leave this as it is. You're better off getting this on Good Old Games, since it seems to work better in that version. What a shame, too, that the developers thought to mess with a title that seemed to be working fine on legacy versions of Windows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Totally worth the money since it's not so expensive. The game is difficult but if you have friends that like WW2 games such as this, you should try it with them, it has co-op which makes the game simple and even more fun at the same time.Played this game when I was little so at first it was super nostalgic. I got it on Black Friday btw, but since it's only 4 euros it's totally worth the money.			",87,15,4,7,8,0,6
