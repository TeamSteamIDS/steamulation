												Sit down, son. You just stumbled upon the page of the best shooter ever made. Pay some respect. Before the days of shooters that holds your hand and aim for you, that regenerate your health and show you what to do like a baby, there was this. Unreal Tournament 2004 - the most brutal, adrenalin-fueled shooter since Quake 3 Arena, a game so fast-paced its guaranteed you'll burn your eyes from not blinking for so long. They say we only use 20% of our brains - well, if you play this game on the hardest difficulty, you'll be using 100% i assure you. Holy hell son, this game uses so much of your brain it pretty much even cures autism. This game is filled with so much testosterone you have to shave your beard every forty minutes of gametime.Gameplay wise, this game is delicious. With an amazing arsenal of creative, varied and badass weapons, its certified there is a gun for everyone and every situation - sniper rifles that shoot lightning bolts, a triple rocket launcher, jesus christ did i mention a shotgun that shoots grenades too? (The Flak Cannon, considered the number 1 best gun of all times by PC Gamer). Also, with the ability of limitless dodging, walljumping and even double-jumping, the potential for amazing acrobatic moves to evade your enemy's attacks are so great not even Dante from Devil May Cry can keep up. Yep: he cries every night because he cant be as badass as you, when you're playing this game. But this is the bare basic - to survive in the Online arenas, you better be backflipping over your enemies and giving them an instagib headshot while upside down. That's how you play this. However, to be good you have to have absolute keyboard coordination and aiming abilities - it aint easy to do those moves while scoring headshots airborne. Its so hardcore, they say ninjas have to play this game to graduate in Ninja School as their last test. I'm not even kidding. The maps are varied, from skyscrapers reaching space and low-grav to gothic dungeons, futuristic egyptian pyramids to spaceships blasting in hyperspace - there are over 140 maps in this game (thats almost 5 times more than any CoD), ranging from Deathmatch maps to Capture the Flag, Double Domination, Onslaught (Battlefield-esque map node domination), Assault (from the original UT) and even Bombing Run (Its soccer. WITH GUNS). And kid, that's not even taking into account the thousands of maps released by fans - that's right, the modding community is huge for this game. (No DLC crap, no. You get all those maps and access to mod maps for free. Welcome to oldschool shooters)The soundtrack and graphics certainly do not falter. We get badass tracks like the one in DM-Asbestos, and others have more epic orchestral music (for actual epic scenes: assaulting an alien mothership to save Earth) and the graphics, for their time, were considered to be amazing (Even modern games, like Killing Floor, use this game engine as base). The visual and audio presentation certainly do not lack, but to this day this game isnt known for having pretty trees, its known for being the best shooter of all times and god damn it does it right. Together with the classic Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament 2004 is known by shooter veterans worldwide to be the best competitive shooter experience that ever existed. Think you're ready for that? Take off the Angry Birds shirt, the Casual of Duty cap and get ready for a terrific head-hunting experience with the game that INVENTED Double-Kills, Headshots and Killing-Sprees (that all games rip-off nowadays).Final Score: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion, this is the single greatest arena first person shooter of all time. When it comes to competitive play, absolutely nothing beats this game. This game itches absolutely every desire I have for an arena shooter perfectly.From the fast paced movement to the weapons sandbox, it plays like a dream. No other game thus far has impressed me as much as Epic has with this game. The dodging system adds skill that compliments other skills such as tactical skill and aiming skill.One of the biggest complaints I have with modern games on PC is a lack of features. This game features a full editing kit, great community driven content, a hub to display that content and a plethora of other features that hardly any other games have in comparison. Yes, that does include a FoV slider. The thing that all FPS games should have no matter what.If this game were to only be available by going to E-Bay and paying $200 for it, I would in a heartbeat. If you're a fan of arena shooter games like Quake, you're really missing out if you haven't played this. If you want to try out arena shooters for the first time, this is your best choice. I have personally bought this game for a good few people simply because of how much I believe in it. Get it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It was quite a fun game to play with a lot of user created maps and mods (a lot of them were very well made).I have had so many fond memories of very good matches that I wish I've made video recordings of but I didn't know much about making videos back then :(Even though it's quite dated, it is still an awesome game after all these years.

												Played UT2004 an insane amount when it came out, and up until a few years ago. Once I saw it on here, I had to get it again. It is just as awesome as it always has been. It is THE best arena shooter, just above Quake 3, and is an absolute classic! Plays as good today as it did 12 years ago! Recommended for anyone that's into FPSs, past or present.***Side note***It has issues running on Windows 10 at the moment.

												This is THE game that got me into gaming, I was 9 when I started playing it in 2004 and I still come back every now and then to play some good 'ol Unreal.Almost every game-mode is fun and well designed, they range from regular old Deathmatch to Capture the Flag with Ion-Canon tanks and Jeeps with blades on them, invasion was always my favorite, it was so well designed in fact that games like Killing Floor were born from it.The weapons are also a blast to use, PC Gamer even crowned Unreal's 'Flak Cannon' the best gun in PC gaming, but it doesn't end there, the are plasma and laser guns to mess around with, but you also have your trusty old rocket launcher and even a steerable mini-nuke. If you don't like messing around with such a huge arsenal you can play with an Instagib instead, which is a slow-firing weapon with 100% accuracy that instantly kills (and gibs, as the name suggests) anything you hit with it.Another thing that made it so vastly different from all the boring arena shooters we have nowadays was the crazy mobility, you could do double jumps or jump against a wall and then jump from there again, leading to some pretty hectic but awesome gameplay, you could enable a handy little device called the Translocator that allowed you to shoot a disc and teleport to it with a simple click, making camping virtually impossible.The game has tons of maps from itself, but Unreal has a very lively modding community and thus hunderds of maps for every game-mode are available for download, you can also download costum skins and even entirely new weapons, just a shame that the game has no steam-workshop.Even though the game is pretty old by now, there's still a reasonable amount of people playing this gem, if you want to play one of the best sci-fi shooters on the market I'd suggest giving this one a go (And not Unreal Tournament 2007, it didn't live up to the standard of the Unreal franchise in my opinion).

												Unreal Tournament 20049 / 10 (2004)When released in 2004 this was the third iteration in the seminal Unreal Tournament franchise. Renowed for intense and over the top deathmatch in single player and multiplayer mode, this game delivered unprecedented adrenaline overload and cumulative sleep deprivation following installation to your hard drive. I installed this game (2015) and played single player mode on a W7Pro 64bit / Radeon 6870 without any hassles and no 3rd party DRM. I reconfigured my keys in game to my traditional FPS set up and was fragging away within minutes, and then came the adrenaline, I loved it. This was my first time playing this particular release; the controls are responsive, the weapons (10) balanced and very tight, and the giblets abound. I played for an hour on maximum graphics quality without a single hiccup. I did not test multiplayer.Previous versions that I have owned and played extensively include Unreal Tournament, Unreal Championship (Xbox), Unreal Tournament GOTY (2000 PC / XP), and  Unreal Tournament 3 (2007 PC / XP). This version fits perfectly in the expected rank of the series for graphics, map design, and audio quality which of course was top notch for 2004. This Hall of Fame franchise belongs in everybodies collection.Q: Why did I install this game? A: They added cards. It's madness ; ) [note: I purchased this in 2010 in a bundle, not just for the cards!]Buy this game Unreal Tournament 2004 if you want to taste classic deathmatch style with polished maps and gameplay from this era. Purchase Unreal Tournament 3 (2007) if you want more recent graphics with much larger and better maps, improved graphics and more complex gameplay options.Addendum From wikipedia (PC release dates)Unreal Tournament (1999)Unreal Tournament 2003 (2002)Unreal Tournament 2004 (2004) *Unreal Tournament 3 (2007)Unreal Tournament 4 (2015 pre-alpha)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many a day of my life was lost playing this game as an early teen. I returned to it now, 7 years later and it still smokes any non-military (meaning not in the vein of CS, Battlefield etc.) competitive shooter out there.As AlexOfSpades put it, ""before the days of shooters that holds your hand and aim for you, that regenerate your health and show you what to do like a baby, there was this."" Yes indeed. I have gotten so accustomed to these games that, when I bought this game and went straight to my old habit of a warm-up Masterful bot DM, I had my♥♥♥♥♥HANDED TO ME. Time. And Time. Again. Until my rusty inner gaming beast finally tossed away the awful crutches that today's games forced upon it and I once again felt the rush of a full-blown UT deathmatch.This shows what a bunch of wimps today's ""fast-paced shooters"" are made for. This game requires insane concentration, mental sharpness, quick decision making and finger/fine motorics coordination of a freaking Navy jet pilot. Stand still - dead, wrong weapon for the situation - dead, miss a powerup - dead, let the enemy pick up a health pack - dead, shoddy tactics in team matches - dead. No room for error (providing you have set the difficulty level high enough to actually be challenged). It's a wild ride and there is no better feeling than finally letting go of your poor, burned-out mouse and seeing your username at the top of the scoreboard.Technically, the game excels at everything. The weapons are perfectly balanced, the powerups are perfectly distributed, the gameplay is smooth and uninterrupted. The graphics are 2004 appropriate, but even today, they are a thing of beauty, the colors are clear and it doesn't have the murky, gray/brown ""drape"" like UT3. The only thing that kind of bugged me was no native widescreen support, but the fix is super easy, no problems there.However, as much as I can gush over the ""old days"" of adrenaline-fuelled arena bloodshed, it's dated. Not the game itself, as I said, it is arena mayhem at its most perfect, but the concept itself has sadly fallen out of fashion. There will always be devout maniacs such as myself and a lot of people who gave this game a thumbs up, but ultimately, I think there's little hope of this kind of action coming back in this form.Long story short: if you spent days trying to find a tactic to bring down a Power Core in a certain map, or spent days honing your no-scope headshots, get this, and feel the rush. If you're a modern gamer new to this game, get it, take it easy at first, up the difficulty when you feel you have the grasp, and realize that CoD is about as intense as PacMan. If you're expecting to get your mind blown by anything other than a Flak Cannon, don't get this game. This is nothing new. It is something old. And it still kicks gobs of♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just bought this game during the flash sale for the sole reason of recommending it. Unfortunately, I have the 2004 original DVD version added to my account so I couldn't write a recommendation.This is the game that shaped my initial PC multiplayer gaming experience. I've logged about 4000-5000 hours (just an estimate) in the last decade. If it wasn't for this game, I probably would have discovered PC gaming much later than I initially did. Moving on to the official recommendation: the single player is very simple, but holds an interesting enough story for its time. The graphics are dated, yes, but honestly I think the game still looks very aesthetically pleasing. There is a general play mode called ""Instant Action"" where you can choose your gamemode, and play! This includes classics like deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and newer gametypes such as Bombing Run, vCTF and more. All of which are very, very fun.The multiplayer community was thriving from between the initial release of this game all the way up to about 1-2 years ago. The community is still somewhat active and there is a good 20 active servers out there with different gametypes to play. There are also several mods that you can download. The modding community within this game is still somewhat active, too. The UDK is also a great tool for learning to map.I still play this game everyday, and have done since 2004 when I was only 11 years old. It is very cheap right now (and offers trading cards, so badge collectors, it's worth the buy alone for that).This is my all-time favourite game, and if you decide to purchase it, I'll introduce you to what's left of the very tight-knit community.Buy this game.

The review is written strictly from single-player perspective!Short version: 94%UT2k4 is, with little doubt, the pinnacle of the Unreal franchise with the largest variation in game modes, best maps, biggest arsenal, and one of the best AI opponents of its time.Long version:It took almost four years for Epic to create a sequel to Unreal Tournament, and they were aiming high with a proposed yearly series. Sadly, they started with UT2003, which changed and removed so many things that despite the initial success it flopped hard: so much so that they had to release Unreal Tournament 2004 well ahead schedule. Thankfully they listened to the fans, and not only gave back every removed game element, but created an amalgam of the best features of UT2003 and UT ’99.The action is faster than ever, but not to the point where it is disadvantageous to a new player. Old weapons and map types complement the new ones, offering a variety not just in play style, but in game modes– including a Halo-inspired vehicle-using war scenario.The campaign also received an overhaul. You still need to complete all but one game type to win, but the small changes made sure that each play through can be different: instead of set maps you are given a small pool for each stage. For death match enthusiast 1v1 and team DMs are offered as optional challenges, boosting the possible team management strategies and game time to even higher levels.Some of the game modes like Bombing Run (a cross between Blood Bowl and Counter-Strike) and Double Domination (Domination with camping strategies) weren’t received well, but against bots they can be one of the fastest-paced modes you can play. And even if you dislike them, the other modes and the myriad of high-quality player-made map packs can ensure longevity even after all these years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First played this installment of the UT series 11 years ago. Nostalgia kicked in, so I had to get it on Steam (used to have the CD). Let me tell you, all these years later, it's still a blast to play, and the graphics are still great. People still play, there are still good servers running.Would recommend for veterans and newcomers alike. You are playing a PC classic when you get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Obviously we all know UT2k4 was one of the best games ever created. Probably one of the best FPS's ever created. But does it hold up today?Arena shooters are basically dead - the most popular one at the moment is Quake Live. So if you are looking for the current most popular shooter with the most people, go to Quake Live. Now if you are trying to re-live the glory days, you MAY have the ability do so here.People do still play this game online. Most of the servers are the Onslaught gamemode. Very little servers running TDM/DM/CTF etc. So if you were into Onslaught, your in luck. If you enjoyed just pure TDM/DM/CTF, you might have a hard time finding a server. You can easily get the game to run in 1080P, and it runs smooth on W7. So no compatability issues at all. Price wise I think $15 is a bit much for an old game, even if it was good. Make it $10 or less and I think it's worth the money. Out of all the UT's you could buy, this one is probably your best bet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dont let the age of this game deter you. This is one of the best arena shooters ever to be released along side classic UT. I still cant believe how good the graphics and sound quality are for a game back in 2004. The bass is going off!I really feel sorry for the kids who grew up with the games today. They really missed out on the glory days of gaming and will never understand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it's release saw a nearly unprecedented surge into e-sports, it's decline has been slow and community transforming into a group of avid twitch FPS players. The game remains challenging with mechanics and gameplay that will readily adapt into most other FPS games. It's fun, and the graphics remain detailed enough to go unnoticed with the fast-paced action.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A pinacle of FPS games, a master piece in every respect. Unreal Tournament 2004 succeeds at being one of, if not the best  arena shooter of all time. The tight controls, excellent AI and ""unreal"" amount of mods for this game could have easily kept someone busy for 10 years. Games like Killing Floor, Damnation, and Red Orchestra all have their roots in the Unreal 2004 mod scene. Combine the excess amount of content, the amazing base game, and ""god-like"" AI (which helps since the multiplayer community is very small now) and you get the best first person shooter I have ever played.

Remember when games, back in the days, let you customize your matches/lobbies any way you wanted and included AI bots that are not only smart, but also challenging? Pepperidge farm remembers!Regardless of its age, Unreal Tournament 2004 (a.k.a. UT2004) still remains one of the greatest and most competitive FPS games of all time (along with the other entries in the series). Still works well on modern systems without any tweaking necessary.+ UT2004 is a fast-paced and chaotic game where accuracy and awareness are the main requisite to ""frag like it's 1999"", also thanks to a wide range of guns that are different from each other and have both primary and secondary firing modes.+ The 2004 edition is an UT game at its core while still adding many new features and gamemodes, for example Onslaught, which gives the game a ""Battlefield 2"" approach with vehicular combat and nodes to capture on huge maps. The old Assault gamemode from the first game in the series has also been improved thanks to less linear levels and vehicles.+ While the vanilla game has lots of content and variety on its own, the still-active modding community offers so much more (for example, important mods to mention which have then turned into stand-alone games like the wave-based Killing Floor and WW2 shooter Red Orchestra).+ This game is multiplayer-centered. You can host listen servers with port forwarding required if you want to play with friends, or host dedicated ones, but even offline it offers a great experience: bots are human-like, they work on all gamemodes and you can choose from many difficulty options for them, along with more customization options.Well worth the purchase, wether you're an online or offline player!

												This game is often called the ""last hardcore arena shooter"".Epic refined the arena FPS action pioneered by the Quake series and the original Unreal Tournament.There are few games I have enjoyed more than this one. All of the gamemodes from deathmatch to CTF to Bombing Run to Assault require a different skillset than most gamers are used to. This game was ahead of its time.The music is absolutely phenomenal, as is expected of the Unreal series. I listen to it even when I'm not playing the game.Somebody had an interesting metaphor that I will use: in the FPS genre, Wolfenstein 3D was the wheel, Doom was the horse drawn carriage, Quake was the combustion engine, and Half-Life was the Ford Model T. In my opinion, UT99 was the Ferrari 458 or the Noble M600.Which makes this game about the equivelant of an F-22 Raptor.However, there is one thing that I wish this game had,The weapon with which I defeated Xan Kriegor in the original Unreal TournamentThe RipperRIP the RipperBut Hey: at least the Lightning Gun is fun.And my second favorite weapon, the shock rifle, is still here. Please, Epic: make the new Unreal Tournament more like this.10/10 would try turning the safety off again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even after a decade after it's release, the modding community is still around as well as the multiplaer. If you're going to buy this game, go get some custom maps, skins, characters, and etc. because you will get more enjoyment out of this game.

												The way to success lies through failures, and only those who doesn't fear critics, will master this road. Unreal Tournament 2004 — not simply doubled number of the cards, new textures, game modes and tons of pleasant trifles. It is attempt to grope the style lost in motley UT 2003 tinsel and to get back to the ideas which in due time have made the best-seller the first UT; fruit of two years' evolution, thoughtful studying of responses and careful introduction of new concepts. Certainly, about any aspiration to start everything with a clean slate the speech doesn't go — UT 2004 at least on two thirds consists of old materials. Well familiar modes are attached to thoroughly propatchenny frame of the previous version — дефматч usual, дефматч command, CTF, Double Domination, Last Man Standing and Bombing Run, and 50 of 106 available cards already ""stayed"" in UT 2003 and free a bonus-pakakh from Epic/Digital Extremes. Copied them not blindly — the levels which design caused special complaints, are changed or processed, and the balance of forces got rid of lameness. So, the spring ability of players decreased and ""adrenalinic tablets"" fell in price, adding now on only two units ""is flown into a rage"". But after all game should be tried, I advise all! (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The 26.6 hours on my account is only a fraction of the time I've spent playing unreal tournament 2004.I had a physical copy on release, and the game of the year edition as well.I must of clocked in 1000's of hours in this game in my life.This game is so much more than when you get in the box.And what you get right out of the box is,10 game modes.Vehicles.Mutators and built in game mods.over 100 maps.17 weapons, all with a secondary fire.32 character models.That right there is the content of 10 triple A titles released today, followed by years of shoddy paid dlc, all in one game on release.They literally don't make them like this anymore.The game itself has a wide community of modders, and even though most have moved on at this point, the mods still exist for download on many websites.This is the game that incepted Killing Floor, Red Orchestra, and Alien swarm, all of which used to be conversions of UT2004, which you can still download the originals of course.The gameplay is tight and still holds up today with the wall jumping, corner skiing, sliding, rocket jumps, ect.

												My favourite iteration of the UT series.Vanilla UT2004 has more than enough game mods and maps to swallow up huge amounts of your time. The bots cater for every skill level and do a good job of making offline matches fun in their own right. It also has a campaign mode that lets you buy and sell players, challening other clans to matches as you head on up the league table. It was very enjoyable back in the day and I was sad When UT3 didn't have the same sort of campaign.The game will run smoothly on all but the most basic of computers and has been a staple of LAN parties ever since its launch. It has aged brilliantly and was well supported by its community back in the day, making it worth getting for mods like 'Air Buccaneers' alone!Before UT2004 there was a 2003 edition which was very similar. There was outcry when this version was announced, with people accusing it of becoming an annual series, much like EA sport titles. I'm almost sad that that wasn't the case, since this 2004 version contains everything that came with the 2003 edition, doubled the number of maps, added new game modes (including a very popular vehicle mode which is better balanced than I had ever expected it to be) and generally rendered the previous version of the game obsolete.I still haven't scratched the surface of what this game contains. It's big enough that even if you only like a small fraction of what it has to offer, you'll still have more to play with than most entire games have to offer. An odd little side-note, but both girls I've shown this game to have loved it, even though they're not generally fans of aggressive, adrenaline-based frag fests. Odd.It's a thumbs up from me. The only irritating thing about it is that occasionally matches reach a frustrating stalemate, or you begin to lose through no fault of your own which is an incredibly frustrating experience. You'd expect that in online modes but offline, when you're outperforming the bots by a considerable margin, can get very frustrating. I've hardly touched the online part of this game, it's never appealed to me. Call me a noob, but the fact this game still holds my attention should pay adequate testament to the quality of this title. UT2004: 10 games rolled into one. Fun for all the family. 'cept children, probably not suitable for them. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Think of it like this: running around with Rocket Launchers, Miniguns and a gun that can shoot mini nuclear missles, fighting Aliens and other fellow humans to stay alive and make a profit to run your team.This is an extremely fast-paced game that requires your constant attention to even STAY ALIVE. Just remember the one rule: BLINK. That is how intense and great this game is. I have speant many a minute screaming in pain from forgetting to blink.All in all, I would highly recommend buying this game. You have not lived until you have played it. 11/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UT2k4 is a legendary multiplayer FPS that made Epic more then a studio that made the engine Deus Ex ran on. It featured fast paced deathmatch and amazing balance with it's weapons. What made UT2k4 also legendary was it's bot AI, which remains unprecidented in intelligence. It mimics the movements of actual players and unless your a software programmer feels totally unpredictable.UT2k4 also had a very large modding community and games like Red Orchestra and Killing Floor were mods for this game. Truly a delight to play and reminds me of a nice Saturday afternoon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When it comes to mind-less FPS violence, I can’t believe people would rather play mediocre games such as CoD when they could just go with legendary classics such as this game. I’m a huge fan of this game, I’ve played it for YEARS, I’ve even been on tournaments of this game and even won two of those. However, I’m gonna try to leave that aside and give you a proper review of why you should or not buy this game, and as usual I will start with the negative parts of it. ...Or I would if this game had much negative stuff. Really, the only negative stuff I can think off have to be Assault maps, as they deviate too much from the other game-modes, and vehicle based maps can be a little weird at times. And maybe that it's multiplayer community isn't that full of people after more than 10 years after release. That’s it!Instead, what does this game have that it’s good?First and foremost, the AI. It’s good. It’s really f#cking good. In fact I’m an expert at bugging and breaking games, and rarely I’ve found the AI breaking and falling apart. The game also has the option to put a random difficulty mode and then analyze how well you do against it, then constantly change it so it’s all up to your skill level, something that I don’t think I’ve seen in other games and should be in most of them.Going right up to that are the maps. Not even one of them feels the same as others, only a few of them grow a bit stale because of them being too big or too small and sh#t like that. The game also has maps from previous games that are memorable, such as Facing Worlds, which is the De_Dust of Unreal Tournament, and even adding remakes and different versions of them.Another big-#ss point in favor of the game has to be the soundtrack. I ain’t f#cking arround when I say, IT’S REALLY F#CKING GOOD. The devs knew what they needed to make the action feel even more intense, and succeeded immensely. The gameplay itself is also kind of a master-piece, a one of it’s kind in FPS games. All guns (except the ones to start with) are useful in their own way and have their own flair to themselves. They all have their own ways of being used and are all fun to waste people with, although some need more aim than others, such as the Lightning-Gun/Sniper Rifle and Shock Rifle. And hell, any game that has an Anti-Air weapon turned into a shotgun with a grenade launcher option has to be a great game on paper.Something that’s also rather unique to this kind of game are the sprees, and the game announcer on it’s own. You know how in these modern fps crap games you get rewards for killing multiple people on a single life? Well f#ck that, here instead you get to hear insane voice clips from the announcer not believing how could you just do what to a human being. From the classic “KILLING SPREE!” to the infamous “HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥”, they’re all memorable. Also, the game keeps track of what you do in a match, and hitting F3 will show you information about it, such as how sh#t your aim is or how many sprees you got in that match.All and all, is this game worth it?  Did you even pay any attention? Of course it is. It’s WAY superior to the sequel it got later on, which kinda sucked, and it has really good mod support. Infact, games such as Red Orchestra and Killing Floor started as mods for Unreal Tournament 2004, it’s that good. I seriously recommend it to any FPS fan out there who just wants to chill out and have fun murdering anything that f#cking moves. And if you want, install the Bloddy Hell mod, which makes, between a ton of other crap, blood and gore more sadistic and makes it stay on the map forever if you feel so, which is BLODDY F#CKING GREAT. TL;DR Edition: A classic FPS that never seems to age. F#cking good and cheap. If you like FPS and you don’t have it, you have serious issues either in your brain or your wallet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UT2004 is one of the best games ever.   Onslaught, Invasion, and even standard DM are all quite fun.  One of the very best things about the game that keeps it fresh today are all the great maps, characters, mutators and mods that you can use.  All 100% FREE. User made DLC is the best.Want to go racing?  There's a mod for that.  Have more than 30 weapons at your disposal?  Mod for that too.  Play a creepy survival horror game?  There's even a mod for that.  Fight hordes of monsters, level up, and use awesome RPG skills?  Mod for that.  The possibilities are almost limitless.  It's a fun single-player experience, but where it really shines is multiplayer.  Even after 10 years there are plenty of servers for most popular gametypes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IF YOU AREN'T PLAYING UNREAL TOURNAMENT, YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED VIDEO GAMES. IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED VIDEO GAMES, GO GET A LIFE!(BEFORE STARTING OFF : if you are experiencing troubles regarding your screen moving without you touching it, you're going to have to uncheck the following : mouse smoothing, reduce mouse lag and enable joystick. I haven't figured out yet how to play with a controller).All honesty though, this game has come quite the way from it's original conception. Back in the day Unreal was an amazing shooter and still to this day still holds highly to it's acclaim. The mods have helped significantly to keep the game interesting. Unreal Tournament is most likely known for it's obscene commentary, extreme gore, and weapons that aliens look like they developed. Before you start playing multiplayer, there is a campaign available that will get you ready for multiplayer. In UT, you may customize your character from a large select group of races in which each have their own attributes. The guns in this game are absolutely fantastic. They range from basic shotgun and rockets to energy weapons that will vaporize an opponent. I should say the guns are one of the main reasons why this game got so big; the fact they also introduced alternative firing with both the same amount of strength really plays to the shooters advantage. The game play itself compared to other shoots is a little fast as players move throughout the map with speed. Movement/controls is quite basic but includes sprinting, crouching, jumping, lateral movements and double tapping a movement button will make the player roll forward. Like Halo, you won't find many players standing still to take a shot as you are absolutely vulnerable when not in motion. What blew my mind was one map I played online where I was not only able to enjoy the basics the game came with, but some crazy yahoo out there took his time to make vehicles (that resemble warthogs), ghost sort of looking vehicles that can jump vertically up and down, tanks and of course a ship that flies through the air. The mods get pretty crazy and some maps feature fixed guns. Game modes that are available in this game are standard deathMatch, team deathMatch, capture the flag and double domination (which is sort of like King of the Hill). Upon killing a lot of opponents or collecting adrenaline, players can use it for regeneration (Down, Down, Down, Down), invisibility (Right, Right, Left, Left), faster rate of fire (Up, Up, Down, Down) and faster movement speed (Up, Up, Up, Up) - (pint size and berserk are also available but I do not know the proper combos... yet). This adds an extra depth to already an enjoyable game. Picking up more health, armor or even ammo is quite easy and shouldn't be too much of an issue to get the gun you want. It's how much can you dodge while you're getting there. I should also add the maps I've come across so far have been superb.The visuals are as good as they can be for their age and an update to them could make or break the game. It's vintage-ness is what's really appreciated. Sounds are pretty good, although basic and not extremely varied but provide a good context for the gun you're firing. I would absolutely recommend this game on sale to anyone. It is simply a fun FPS that can be enjoyed by anyone. You will quickly see some players that have really taken their time to precise their movements and their shooting patterns.RATING : rock solid 8/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :  Looks almost nothing like it Using a link gun to disable an air unit  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's no question about it. Unreal Tournament 2004 is simply the greatest multiplayer FPS of all time. Back when I first got this game in 2004, I played nothing else but this for 3 whole years. It was just that great. The community was booming, and new mods and levels were being released each day. The gameplay is the perfect blend of fast-paced action and strategic map control, something that no modern shooter has ever been able to replicate.And guess what? Even with the game nearing the 10-year mark, it's still active! You can still find some Deathmatch and Onslaught servers with a steady community if you decide to start playing right now. A true testament to the absolute quality of this game.It's unfortunate that UT3 failed to capture this game's success, and that Epic has pretty much abandoned this series in favor of Gears of War, but for any big-time multiplayer FPS fan out there, this is a must-own.

												Adds to what made the first Unreal Tournament a masterpiece.Based mostly on the GOG.com (DRM-free) version and Unreal Anthology (DVD ROM).When making a sequel to the much venerated Unreal Tournament (1999) you better damn well get it right. Fortunately for both Epic and UT fans, Unreal Tournament 2004 does precisely that. Taking the misteps out of Unreal Tournament 2003 and adding some cool new features paid off in spades for Epic and UT fans.This time around, UT looks dazzling - even in 2017. Deathmath, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Dominiation, and Assault all make comebacks. Domination has a noticable difference in that teams must control TWO check points simultaneously for a few seconds as opposed to multiple check points at any given time. Added to the modes is Onslaught, which involves controling nodes until the opposing team's core is exposed. Both Assault and Onslaught now utilize huge environments and...VEHICLES. Removed is the option to have four teams at once (R/B/G/Y) in TDM and DOM. From the obvious graphical enhancement, which has aged quite well, to the varied gameplay, UT2004 delivers.While Unreal Tournament 99/GOTY is my all-time fave FPS, UT2004 slides in right behind it for some damn good reasons.For those wondering where UT2003 went: it's all in UT2004, minus some parts that put fans off. In fact, there's a Mutator that allows for using the UT2003 HUD. So UT2003 is in UT2004.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UT2004 is absolutely amazing. So much content and it can still be increased by an enormous amount for free by the community! There are a plethora of maps, characters, modes, weapons, vehicles and it all seemlessly works coherently together without feeling too over powered and out of place. Plenty of action offline or LAN with mates (and the online community is still there!). The game has been around for a while and yet is still good to go back to. Music is good and so are the sound effects as well as those dodgy one liners from the original UT plus new ones. The game is very moddable and easy to use to install mods. Still prefer this version to UT2003, UT3 and in many regards more than UT1999 (the original!). Let's Rock!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DISCLAIMER: If anyone notices I left out UT2003 completely, there's a point to that, and that point is likely parallel to why it only took a single year for another UT to come out.What can I say about this game? The Steam hours say nothing about how much time I've actually put into this game. I first bought it a day after it was released in Canada (That would be about 4 weeks after it was released in the US, based on exchange rates at the time), which would have been when I was 15 or 16 years old. I'm nearly 27 now, and I still hold many fond memories with this game, and will continue to make great memories. It doesn't often see a lot of replay, but the once or twice a year I do jump back into it, I stick to it for at LEAST a week before moving on. That says a lot for an 11 year old game. A lot of other games that age I just can't jump back into because it's just too outdated for me. That, or I've grown up enough to realize that the game actually sucks balls.UT2004 is an FPS, and like the name says, you're in a Tournament setting. You get points for ""frags"" (kills), capturing flags, holding positions, or whatever else depending on game type. The game is won when either team, or individual player in Deathmatch, reaches a certain goal parameter set by the campaign, yourself in Instant Action, or the Servermaster in Multiplayer. For example, in a Team Deathmatch game, the goal is always going to be the team with the most points collectively. This can be either a set limit, or it can be a timer countdown in which the team with the most frags at the end of the timer wins. The best part of this game, though, is HOW you get your frags. Even in the vanilla game, there are at least a dozen weapons to choose from. For the most part, these weapons are ranged, but there are one or two melee weapons (Who wants to use those, though?). I don't want to spoil the fun for those who are new to the game, so I'll tell you about my favourite: The flak cannon. This weapon was in the original Unreal Tournament, as well, and in it's return, it's packing a meaner punch. Here's what it does: The primary fire throws a dozen or more slugs of white-hot shrapnel at fast speed, ripping your oponent to shreds. Use this fire up close, and like a shotgun, you're bound to make it messy. The secondary fire is more of a mortar, in which the shrapnel is launched still encased, and then explodes into shrapnel on impact. Imagine taking that out in Call of Duty. I have to be super honest, I've never actually fully completed the actual TOURNAMENT (The ""campaign"" of the game), but I was never really looking for that when I bought the game. I had spent the previous five years playing Unreal Tournament, and 99.2% of that time was playing Practice Sessions, or in the case of UT2004, Instant Action. This is, in my opinion, the Brains of the game. Instant Action is where all the experimentation unfolded. Anything that you downloaded or created yourself was first tested in Instant Action, where it was put to the test with or against computer AI bots. The bots in this game are incredibily intelligent, and also very customizable. To find out more, and there's a LOT more about Instant Action, play the game and experiment yourself. It won't ever get old.When it comes to modability, that's where UT is the most memorable. You get the basic package, which is amazing on it's own and has hundreds of hours of gameplay, but then you also get FULL modability of the game. They even include a full UTEditor where ANYONE can jump in and make maps, good or bad, mods, skins, sounds, graphics, textures, ANYTHING. It's one of the most awesome things I've seen when it comes to a game. And then those who aren't so good with game editing could easily just check community hubs and sites for content. This was what DLC was before it was corporatized and had a price slapped on it for good measure. This is how it still SHOULD be, and I'm glad Steam came up with the workshop. I'm happy there are still a lot of good developers who provide open modability, as well. I just don't see it in this scope anymore. UTEditor was relatively simple (For those who are into it) and basically right there for you to curiously click on and figure out. To put it in perspective, I was creating maps and doing minor mods to UT99 when I was 12. That's about all I can muster for UT2004 right now. There's WAY too much to really rave about, and I don't want to talk circles around anyone. HIGHLY recommend this game. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best classics of our time, this game has unique map structures, you like Quake? Well step up to the big leagues. UT 2004 has been recorded as the best Arena Shooter of its time, and future. Pick from one of many weapons to choose from, Rocket Launcher, Lightning Gun, Machine Gun, even a gun that shoots acidic balls that'll melt you into goo! Each with a primary and secondary function. Pick up Health items and Armor items to give you the edge in battle against other opponents. This game does require lightning fast reflexes to be above the competition. If you are into shooters and fast pace action, this is the game for you. 8/10  even in today's gaming world.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It took me a long time to review UT and i didnt even played it that much ( on steam ) but this game was together with Counter Strike in my childhood and i can say this lil sh*t actually made get rekt at many exams. I always liked getting blown apart at multiplayer matches, it was so fun to watch the madness of the gameplay. You really gotta try it. You'll obviously have a good and bad time playing this cause it's not that easy to master all the weapons, but it's really fun to get attached to one and play along. The ""terrible"" graphics back then were amazing and i feel amused to be able to do it all again.It's indeed in pair with HL:DM but being more fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game. Fast-paced, fun, requires skill, accuracy, a bit of thought, quick reflexes, and the ability to actually move around properly.Dodge, wall-jump, and double-jump mechanics allow you to combine these in any order. They allow you to move quickly and be all over the place, making yourself hard to hit, and allow you to get across the map faster.There are a multitude of weapons to be picked up off of the map, all of which are unique and have their own special functions, and alternate firing modes.Hundreds of maps, most with great art-style, environments, geographical design, and music.Being a game from 2004, the game still looks fantastic (better than many games today, unsurprisingly), and has a multitude of great bonus features.-Press F11 and the game opens a built-in in-game music player that allows you to play any of your own, or in-game songs, instead of what the current map is playing.-In the audio options, there is a feature that enables built-in text-to-speech for the chat and IRC areas of the game, that way you don't miss a word as your head spins on a swivel, while you are caught up in the fast-paced shooting and battles, with no time to read.There's a ton of game modes, Deathmatch, Bombing Run, Double Domination, Assault, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Vehicle Capture the Flag, Onslaught, and many others.Get the game, play against bots (start off on just below masterful, trust me. Just BELOW Masfterful), and have some fun. Instant action and campaign, once you find a decent community, play some online. Do NOT play sniper camping, zark (especially), or ballistic weapons mods exclusively (24/7, or primarily). Also do NOT play DM-Rankin all the time.SUPPORT the servers that don't suck balls and have ACTUAL map rotation!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possibly the best FPS I've ever played. As the name would suggest, realism is kept to a minimum and it's all about the action. Your character can dodge jump, double jump, use a translocator to jump around the level really fast. Your weapons are equally unrealistic and therefore fun. It supports a wide array of game modes from Deathmatch, to CTF, to Vehicle attack the enemy base, and more. It's also got over 80 professional quality custom maps that can be downloaded for free on the internet.While it has full bot support, it's best played with other people, and while it's not the most played game in the world anymore, it's still played by some.The free demo is cross-compatible with the main game, meaning you can join a demo server and play with players playing the free version.

One of my best early PC Gaming memoriesUT2004 was one of the 1st shooters I ever played, along side Call of Duty 1. I used to meetup with at a LAN Cafe most weekends and play it before I ever had a PC of my own.I recently picked it up on steam and Still love it. Graphics still look good enough to this day, Gameplay & gunplay is perfect, AI is quite good and somewhat of a balanced challenge. The Campaign is tons of fun and has many different game modes. My favorite being Assault, an attack & defend objective game mode. There are powerups and different abilities that you can obtain from getting max adrenaline such as Speed, Regenerate, Invisibility, Berserk, Pint-Size & Camouflage. There are loads of mods such as the original Alien Swarm & Killing Floor. Theres was also a mod I played but I cant remember the name, You started on a roof with fences on both sides and a spiral stair case going down into a lab, Only weapon you had was a translocator & bullpup machine gun. You could set the number of AI players & zombies. AI would run down and you'd hear over the radio (were under attack, man down) etc. 2Spooky4me :SDefinitely try it out if your a fan of Fast paced Shooters.9.5/10- Perfect for its time, wish there was more then 11 assault maps ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It shows how EPIC games are dedicated to their servers, unlike some old games with online game, who discontinued the online services. I totally recommend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy the game, mod the hell out of it and have more fun then it being vanilla. Have fun wth this, gamers!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best arena shooters of all time. I've logged thousands of hours playing this since it's release in 2004... Amazing game, lots of replay value, and a ♥♥♥♥ton of fun.Also, this game is extremely moddable, and has a very dedicated modding community, even to this day. The possibilities of expanding this game are endless. This game has spawned many great mods, such as Ballistic Weapons, ChaosUT2: Evolution, Mars Wars 3, Out of Hell, Unwheel, Gunreal, and Tripwire's mods-turned-commercial-games Killing Floor and Red Orchestra.Speaking of modability - ever wanted to see Gordon Freeman from Half-Life, and Link from Legend of Zelda duel to the death with heavy artillery? Now you can, because Unreal Tournament 2004 has literally thousands of downloadable player skins and models you can find online.Even the stock game has a staggering 6gb of content. Lots of awesome maps, dozens of game modes, a single player campaign, custom solo skirmishes, and much more. The re-playability of UT2004 is endless.Lastly, If you like Unreal Tournament '99, there's even more reason to buy and play this game, as there's now a very faithful adaptation of UT99 for UT2004 known as Unreal Tournament: 2341 - http://www.moddb.com/mods/ut2341-hd-arsenal ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's fun to relive countless hours againt friends from all over the world in one of my favorite FPS.   Any video card should be able to run this fine, unless you have something worse than my Pure 3D that I had in college.

												I spent many hours playing UT2004 (& 2003) back in college.  My roommates and I would set up a LAN in our house, which common at the time.  Besides becoming a ""standard"" for arena shooters, this game offers a variety of other game modes, which can be played MP or SP, like team DM, assault, bombing run, double domination, CTF, etc. Playing against the bots is not to be taken lightly...UT games have always had solid AI, which can be set at different skill levels.The graphics were amazing at the time the game was released, and are still decent today.  There are a ton of stock maps. Presently, there is still a small online community, and you can always find at least a few matches. Great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never had gotten the chance to play this game growing up. I stuck with the Unreal Tournament 99 GOTY edition. I had long let that game go until I bought a new computer. I installed it via Steam and was deeply immersed in it for a few weeks until that computer took a crap on me, too. It was just an old computer I bought off of a coworker for 50 bucks. When I bought the computer that I have now, I reinstalled UT 99 and played that for a few days, I was very curious to try UT 2004. I kind of held off on it seeing that my favorite computer game remained UT 99. I was worried that it would not be the same.However, change can be very good! I was SO pleased buying this game! It was like going back in time and playing UT 99 but with newer graphics and interesting versions of the same guns but upgraded! Guys. I'm hooked. I love it. Seeing updated versions of some UT 99 maps was so awesome! (When I got to the map, Face, I was like giiirlll this is the nostalgia right here!!!) If you're like me and afraid to try this in hopes it will be similar to UT 99, I can assure you that you will love this game equally or very closely to the original.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played the Unreal series since 99. No moddern FPS can even compare to this: the Michelangelo of games. At the time, I'd also played Quake, Doom, and CS. But Unreal....oh my, Unreal. My first true love. She snuffed out all others like candles in the rain.Every gamer has that one game that just consumes them. Their pulse quickens and their eyes plaster to the screen, your very soul trapped in an enigma of endless time. Years pass as you watch you life fly by at 60 HZ. Your wrists build strong lasting muscle and hardened tendons from hammering on the WASD keys for hours on end. Your index and middle fingers become your future wifes dream toys as you hone your dexterity with years of mousebutton rappid firing. Your heart races as you shotgun dance with your enemies states and countries apart.This game....This game needs no introduction. It's name is simple and rightfully fitting: Unreal.In it's prime, there were thousands of servers on Game Spy. Close your eyes and point, you'd find one packed with dozens of players from all over the globe. My personal favorite was Instagib (one shot kills). CTF, or TDM. I played in a clan that utilized a player built map system called ""giant maps"". They were maps that looked like your living room, kitchen, dining room, dorm room, bathroom, etc... but you were the size of a penny. 20 guys buzzing around looking like red or blue dots againt a refridgerator or television. ""BigPapa290"" is strafing on the floor by the door stop, dodging lasers from an onslaught of enemies flying over the cookie jar. Your clan noob ""SparklesTheElephant"" is straight walking along the bathroom tiles, still figuring out the controls and somehow lands some lucky shot on your enemies veteran ""X-L4X69"" who's stalking him from the toilet paper dispenser. ""DarkCarnage49"" is camped up on the shelf by the fabric softener sniping guys off by the furnace pilot light, but ""DeepDishPizza"" teleports up from the floor in some crazy zig-zag pattern and an epic battle ensues as they jump and double jump and spin back and fourth until one lands a shot. Then, somehow you've found your way into the clothes dryer drum where there is no wall and everywhere is a mirror. There's no telling which way is out. ""HabaneroFarts"" has also stumbled upon this trap! Son of a B****! In a fury, you start firing at ghosts. Did I hit him? No, that was his reflection. Why isn't he dead?! How the F*** do I get out of this hell!So you just stand still, hopefully he can just end your misery and you can just die and spawn in the kitty litter box like you were hoping for to begin with.GREAT SCOTT! the memories :)I really doubt you could find games in Unreal that are like this today, but nevertheless, all other game modes are just as fun. This game, is one of 2 game that gets my full 10/10. It consumed my life, man. And I loved every minute of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Take everything that was great about the original Unreal Tournament, upgrade the graphics, throw in physics, and toss in lots of maps, game modes, weapons, and even vehicles, and you have Unreal Tournament 2004. It's one of the best multiplayer shooters around, even today, and the singleplayer is surprisingly challenging (the bots are competent and even as good as real players!). Not only that, but there's a plethora of great mods available for it. Well worth grabbing for any UT or online shooter fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best game of all time!Why? Because, there is a lasting desire to play this game even after having played it pretty much since it came out. I can't resist the challange, the multiplayercommunity is still active and keeps bringing me back every single day.Back in time this game was the first in an era of game-engines where you could walk, drive and fly with a perfect experience and control. The learning curve to master weapons, movement, the surrounding and your opponent is endless. Totally different than any regurlar shooter like CS, BF or COD which are far less rich on dynamic and have a far less joy factor.The best that this game offers is a game-editor. Make your own custimazations or download them as there is an extreme amount of wide-ranged mods available for both off and online play. The community enriched the game with content, a reason for them to love this game and a reason for them to keep playing this game. I wonder why new games don't offer such a thing as this concept has proven itself in extreme over time.The graphics are extreme good for a game that is 10 years old. You can easily select a high resolution without seeing pixels. Maps have been designed on arena playability, not pure as a show off for the engine possibilities.The sound is awesome as UT2004 is a game that supports digital audio. Windows XP supports digital sound, Vista and 7 do not. Windows made a recent move with Windows 8 by supporting digital sound again. Want to experience digital gamingsound yourself? You like to experience yourself why early PC gamers start watering in their mouth of digital gamesound?The game runs flawless on any Windows version that runs Steam. Just make sure to check the guide for Windows 10.

												This is what a competitve shooter should be. A great game at high level skill but simple enough for casual players to join in. The surviving game modes currently are Deathmatch, CTF, and Onslaught. Onslaught is a good start for players, it does not requrie as much attention as CTF or Deathmatch; it's comparable to Titan mode in BF2142 where you have to destroy the other team's main point. There are a large ammount of weapons in this game, each with there own unique use. Most guns have a secondary fire, ifnot they use a zoom function.The movement system is something that will be missed in FPS games. You have your simple Jumps and Double jumps, but then you have dodges and wall dodges. They're like a far reaching side jump, so when your about to get hit you can quickly move off to side into safety (or impending danger) faster than you would have jumping. Since you are unable to rocket jump, shield guns are used as a subsitute. The shield gun's primary can be charged up to deal a damaging wave of force in front of you to kill people who get to close or push up just a bit higher. The longer the charge the higher you can go up, but the more you get hurt.The game is pretty much dead but if you have friends i absolutley reccomend this game, it's an experience you won't get from other shooters made today (mabey other the Quake, and Warsow)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where has this game been all my life? Despite just picking it up, it feels like a game I've been playing for years. The controls are smooth and fluid and the gameplay is fun and exciting. This game is about four dollars right now. I can easily say it's worth every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Taking everything that was good about UT2003 and stepping it up a notch. UT2004 is one of the best competitive shooters out there today. The game is STUNNINGLY optimized for PC and achieves a steller amount of options for your unique gaming experience (somehow though, they forgot widescreen... but a quick look on the forums will change that). Unreal has never felt so true to a warrior's spirit before. With weapons of destruction, deadly one liners, advanced A.I, and so much more, UT2004 seems to have thought of it all. It's no wonder there was no UT2005! When it comes to a game such as this, I find myself lost for words as it's more of an experience you'll need to experience yourself. I can't explain to you how fun it is to bungee jump, you'll have to go and try it yourself to truly find out, and that's how I feel about UT2004. Seriously, you can NOT pass this masterpiece up.10/10 - Pure Excellence at It's Best!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another Unreal game that, for its time, was understated yet an innovation in technology, graphics and perhaps gaming AI. In retrospect, after hours of gaming on my old laptop, is the sort of game that you'd end up playing in phases, rather than throwing to dust after so long. This introduced me to gaming, and is worthy of so much more than it has been given. The new options added on from UT2003 have been spectacular, but perhaps have damaged the first-person shooter theme of it with the introduction of vehicles. Its successor, UT3, has considered this point well, but nonetheless fails to uphold the options on this game, with team selection and game controls. Despite some minor loopholes that emerge, it would still not be deservingly praised with a 'Game of the Decade' title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UT2004 is 10 years old now, and it shows in its graphics, but it still plays as slick as ever. Given that it is so old now, it should run great on just about any computer you throw it at. It works fine on my Windows 7 64-bit machine too, although I did have to tweak my ut2004.ini file to make it run in 1080p as the highest resolution it offers out of the box is 1680x1050.The player population is a lot smaller now than when this game was in its heyday, but still out there. Playing it now (May 2014) brings back lots of good memories of when I first played it when I was in college back in 2004. Onslaught is still my favorite game mode! Beware though, it seems that almost everyone still playing has been for years and they will kick your♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every game comes with its positives and negatives. That being said, I think this game is one of the greatest games made to date! I absolutely love it! Epic Games and their engine really did create what I'd consider a masterpiece that is UT2k4. Originally, I got introduced to the Unreal series through the predecessor UT2k3 when I was just a little kid and I almost instantly fell in love with the game. My family was fairly poor at the time, so they could never afford to buy me the game, so I had to get a pirated copy to play. Once 2k4 came out, I loved the even greater variety of game modes that it had to offer as well as the old game modes that were only offered in UT99 at the time. As soon as I started working and made a steam account, I bought Unreal Tournament 2004 because I really do think it's well worth its price. Heck, I even bought it for a few of my close friends for them to play too just because the Unreal series NEEDS to be known, or at least I think it should be. I'll start out with the positives and the things I love about this game.Positives:- Multiple multiplayer game modes- Very different difficulty levels of AI's that do test your skill well, or can help you learn easily- Generally strong, polite, dedicated community (I've met moderators of maps that still hang around ever since the game launched!)- Immersive and very well balanced gameplay- Fast paced- Challenging (In all honesty, I think this game truly tests your weapon handling skills in terms of shooter games)- Fun community game mods and a very well done game editing kit- Competitive- Satisfying gameplay- Many gaming and option features- Character design is fresh and different, many maps to play on, and large gun variety (as well as some sweet vehicles too!)Negatives:- Arena shooters aren't as popular as they used to be- Graphics are outdated (Who cares?)- The rare but occasional hackerHonestly, for me, the negatives don't even hold a candle to the overall game and my rating for it is an easy 10/10That being said, if you want to test your shooting, dodging, reaction time and/or any other skills I highly recommend this game!

												Temos aqui o terceiro (em ordem cronológica) título da série Unreal lançado no Steam. Lançado em 2004 e que teve o Unreal Engine 2.5 como base. Um FPS frenético onde tiros de metralhadoras, foguetes, plasma e ogivas nucleares vão garantir que você não saia vivo. Agora temos a presença de veículos, mais classes e novos modos de jogo para garantir a diversão por muitas e muitas horas.Avaliação:Classes/Raças: 9/10Temos poucas opções de customização de personagens, nada além de opções de rosto e cor das vestimentas, porém porém isso é mais que suficiente pois na maioria das vezes os corpos simplesmente explodem no meio da partida. Apesar disso, temos cerca de 11 raças para escolher. Não faz muita diferença, pois o importante é destruir o adversário antes que ele te destrua.Modos de jogo: 10/10Unreal Tournament 2004 traz diversos modos de jogo. Muitas horas garantidas e muita variedade para todos os gostos. Estes são alguns dos modos de jogo disponíveis:  -Onslaught: Neste modo de jogo a grande jogada é o uso de veículos, e você precisa destruir todas as bases inimigas para capturá-las em link, todas elas espalhadas em um mapa enorme. Capture todas as bases para ter acesso ao Power Core da equipe inimiga, e destruí-lo. Há grandes conflitos concentrados em bases-chave.  -Bombing Run: Uma espécie de futebol assassino. Você tem que pegar a bola que está no meio do mapa e atirá-la no arco (gol) inimigo. Arremessando a bola você faz 3 pontos, pulando junto com ela você faz 7 pontos. A bola pode ser passada aos aliados, e é derrubada se você for morto.  -Capture the Flag: Este clássico ainda está presente. Faça pontos capturando a bandeira inimiga e levando-a até a sua.  -Double Domination: Seu time faz pontos ao capturar os 2 pontos de controle e mantê-los por 10 segundos. Cada ponto fica em um lado do mapa.  -Mutant: Uma partida Deathmatch comum, e o primeiro a morrer se torna o ""mutant"". Este jogador recebe munição ilimitada, camuflagem e super-velocidade, mas perde saúde com o tempo. Quando o ""mutant"" é morto, os poderes dele passam para quem o matou.Música: 9/10A trilha sonora do jogo é interessante, se diferencia um pouco do estilo das músicas de seu antecessor, mas continua sendo bem ""animada"". Ideal para um jogo frenético como este.Gráficos: 10/10Belos gráficos, muito melhorados se comparados ao Unreal Tournament anterior, agora temos mapas em vastas florestas, cavernas subterrâneas, naves espaciais, mapas submersos e até mesmo do lado de fora de naves no espaço!Controles: 10/10Os mesmos controles de um FPS comum. Algo que pode ser difícil no começo é o sistema de esquiva (apertar duas vezes rapidamente para alguma direção faz seu personagem ""desviar"" para aquele lado. O que também pode fazer um novo jogador se confundir são os atalhos para as armas, pois temos um total de 19 armas!Arsenal: 10/10Ah, o arsenal de UT2004 continua sendo letal e variado. Dentre as mais interessantes temos:O Translocador, que te permite atirar um disco em qualquer lugar do mapa e se teletransportar para o local onde o disco está;O Bio Rifle, que atira placas de lixo tóxico que grudam nas paredes e na superfície da água;A Link Gun, um rifle que atira rajadas de plasma quente ou uma rajada contínua do mesmo;O Flak Cannon, uma arma que atira estilhaços quente de metal nos inimigos, que ricocheteiam nas paredes;O Rocket Launcher, dispensa comentários, lançador de foguetes que também pode lançá-los em forma de granadas temporizadas. É possível soltar até 3 foguetes ao mesmo tempo;Redeemer, a arma mais poderosa do jogo. Lança uma ogiva nuclear com imensa área de impacto, o que garante diversos Multi-Kills. No tiro secundário, é possível controlar a ogiva com uma câmera. Apesar do poder de fogo, a Redeemer só pode carregar 1 ogiva por vez.Servidores: 8/10Temos diversos servidores com a grande maioria dos modos de jogo disponíveis ao redor do mundo, sendo assim o lag pode ser algo a atrapalhar, ainda mais num jogo com ritmo frenético como este. Apesar disso, o Single Player ainda pode ser um grande desafio nos modos de dificuldade mais avançados.Nota final: 9.4/10A série Unreal Tournament foi (e ainda é) um dos grandes pilares dos FPS, ao lado de jogos como Quake e Counter-Strike. É um FPS especialmente interessante para se jogar, pois proporciona uma experiência bem diferente da que outros jogos de tiro podem te dar. Vale muito a pena.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another Unreal game that, for its time, was understated yet an innovation in technology, graphics and perhaps gaming AI. In retrospect, after hours of gaming on my old laptop, is the sort of game that you'd end up playing in phases, rather than throwing to dust after so long. This introduced me to gaming, and is worthy of so much more than it has been given. The new options added on from UT2003 have been spectacular, but perhaps have damaged the first-person shooter theme of it with the introduction of vehicles. Its successor, UT3, has considered this point well, but nonetheless fails to uphold the options on this game, with team selection and game controls. Despite some minor loopholes that emerge, it would still not be deservingly praised with a 'Game of the Decade' title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I fully recomend everyone get this game, if you enjoy arcade shooters that is. The graphics are a bit dated sure, but the gameplay is amazing. It has a good variety of the weapons, and every gun seems to have a alt fire that compliments the gun nicely. Same with vehicles. It has a giant viaration of levels and gametypes, and you are free to download maps that other uses have made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic!My dad brought this game back in 2004 when it first came out, and us little nooblets just loved it. My brother and I spent a lot of our younger years playing this game. Although it’s old now and not many people really play it anymore, (The servers are pretty dead) It was pretty fun when it was packed. The single player campaign was fun and the online multiplayer was even better. There were always different mods and maps out that kept the game fresh and fun and it really did last a long time before dying out. It can still be played, mostly with bots, and it’s still fun, it’s just not the same as it was back in 04.There’s a wide variety of characters all with their different stories and backgrounds, and a lot of game types to play.It’s great fun and for me a major classic.

												Just hold still and I'll make this quick.My playtime on Steam may not make it clear, but this was the formative game of my high school years. I am firmly convinced that there has never been a better shooter, either competitive or not. You can have just as much fun fighting the insanely good AI as you can real people. And the mod community was the best there ever was. You can still find most of them online today. Buy it. It's amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pull your friends together, put up a private server, and play the heck out of this game.I only recommend UT2k4 if you have a group of people to play with. Singleplayer can be a lonely experience, and the last time I checked I found the public multiplayer scene to be underpopulated. If you do find a server, you had better be skilled.If you decide to pick up UT2k4, I have some mod recommendations for you:- Get the first two Community Bonus Packs (CBP1 & CBP2). Together, they comprise three volumes of the best maps that the UT2k4 community produced.- Pick up the Ballistic Weapons mod, by Runestorm. It provides an overhaul of the game's weapons and mechanics, and it serves as a nice diversion from vanilla.- Also, check out the Fraghouse Invasion mod. Its maps might not be as pretty as the Community Bonus Packs, but it's great fun,Have a great time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arguably the best of the Unreal Tournament games, which seem to follow a popularity trend similar to that of the Godfather... Taken with Unreal Tournament 3, we can see the sad consequences of a gaming industry that increasingly tries to mimic the film industry (is there a real difference anymore?), though the evidence for that claim is a little more implicit between these two titles... The later has fewer maps: Unreal Tournament 2004 has 106 maps (http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/Unreal_Tournament_2004#Maps) compared to the 47 that shipped with Unreal Tournament 3 (http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/579659-Full-UT3-Map-list)One only needs a brain to realise this is less than half. Furthermore, UT3 spreads these maps over 8 game types compared to 10 in UT2004. Why then did UT3 Cost $60 when new, and UT2004 cost $40 despite having only 3 years between release dates? The obvious answer is, it looks better. Many more people are needed to create a new Engine than are needed to create new maps; many more people mean many more salaries to pay whilst maintaining agreeable profits.Why should the gamer settle for less and pay more? The argument that better graphics make up for the defecit can easily be exploded by taking it to its logical conclusion: Would one pay a very large amount, say $100 or more, for a photorealistic game that lasted only several hours? If the answer to that is yes, it in turn begs the question: Why not buy a film?Of course, very little can be done about this trend in practice; big developers will continue to develop, with teams of thousands, games that look fantastic and gross multi-million figures. These games will be short and expensive. These games will have neither pretension nor surplus content (except that that must be brought later). This should not manifest as defeatism however, and least of all complacency.  To undermine this trend, at least in part, one can: Support indie developers by purchasing their games, and being more vocal about them, not pre-order games that promise in advance to be lack-lustre, not pay double the retail price for a bas relief tin and a pamphlet; I am talking here of Legendary Editions and so on (What is legendary about a metal case, art book and a making of... DVD?), be dubious of games released in a yearly fashion, or jack it in all together and find a new hobby.In any case, UT2004 remains a great game in its own right. The volume of content ensures many unique experiences by definition, and the game still has a strong online aspect to be enjoyed. It is fun in the sadistic way that shooting things is, and it sets itself too few pretensions to have any serious flaws. It discarded very little from the original title and updated the graphics to the standard of the time, and it did this without skimping on the things that make a game a game, namely characters, levels and modes, showing yes- it can be done, so yes- I recommend it.

												This game and the whole Unreal Tournament series of games are my favourite by far. Unreal Tournament 2004 is just amazing from all corners. It features a wide variety of gametypes to suit any player. This includes, but is not limited to: Assault, Invasion, Mutant, Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag, Bombing run, Osnlaught and Double domination.There is also a huge amount of mods and addons for this game that can expand the game by adding more gametypes or modifications called mutators that can modify bits and pieces or even large parts of the game making it more fun and interesting. Graphics and performance are both really good for a game so old, getting 100+ FPS with a modern computer is a piece of cake showing it is well optimised. If all the time I spent playing this game was recorded, I would definitely have over 2000 hours of it which shows you how much fun I've had. I definitely recommend this game to any arena shooter fan or anyone who might enjoy the fast-paced action this game brings you. Give this game a try, you won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This brings back so many memories... The first actual pc games i played were Unreal Tournament 2003 and Unreal Tournament 2004. These two games got me into pc gaming, not just because of the gratuidous violence or the simple way the game is laid out to you, it was the fact that they have almost endless replay value. Yea, the graphics dont look as good as they did back then but they were never developed for the extreme high definition displays we use today, But they still look amazing, especially since even if you have a lower end gaming rig, you can still play it with graphics maxed out. The fact that Steam only has UT2004 and not UT2003 is a big letdown especially since they are missing a few other Unreal games, but with the supply of mods (if you know where to look and find them) adds even more fun, i didnt know about modding when i first played, so with the user created content floating out around the web...it basicly creates a whole new experiance .The Pro'sLow end rigs should have little trouble if most of the hardware is from the last few years (i even tested it on my old compaq laptop that hated running games and got 30-50 fps on medium to high settings)Nearly unlimited replay valueMultiplayer is still up//LAN//Dedicated server/hosted(pay-to-host)/listen servers(you host as you play)Tons of mod content ranging from skins, voice packs, maps, mutators, gamemodes and more.Includes unreal editor in game files so you can create contentCustom Mappable ControlsSetting to toggle gore for people with weak stomachs or childrenPlenty of weapons and vehicles for all the violent funSingleplayerVoice Chat for those who know how to set it upPower-ups granting damage bonuses, invisibility, and morePlay alone in instant action with bots and manipulate the ai difficulty ranging from a basic dummy ai that can get kills on you occasionally up to the God-Like ai that paints whatever is behind you with your blood (useful for practice)So much more that cant even be describedThe Con'sOften first time startup can be problematic with some higher resolution displays(simple fix by changing certain values in the games config, search google for fix)Mod content can sometimes be hard to find due to some file servers permanently archiving files or hard to understand install instructionsSteam wont allow multiple instances of the game running (For example you open the game and set up a dedicated server, you cant open another instance of the game to play on your dedicated server unless you are smart enough to outsmart steam...hehe im not sharing my secrets..)Some resolutions dont always scale just right when using an HDTV as a monitor (lots of trial and error finding a resolution you are comfortable with)Overall Unreal Tournament 2004 gets a 9 out of 10*hops in scorpion, drives across map running down every enemy player/bot hops out to get in goliath, gets sniped . Respawns, grabs rocket launcher , Gets revenge*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought it on release date back in 2004 and still remember how great that time was, the game was made with passion by the veterans of EPIC games, you can feel this clearly after you join a random match.By the night, for about 4-5 years i joined a mature server with the best people i ever met, we start with vCTF (Vehicle Capture the flag), then switching to TAM (Team Arena Master). I can tell you i was one of the worst players but the awesomeness of the entertainment made me feel the opposite!The community was very creative with huge selection of custom maps and mods, also they invented new game mods like Trials (adventure like maps with various trials, long jumps, etc) one of the most  relaxing fun social aspect of online gaming.My rating: Unreal Tournament 2004 <> My Favorite Game of all Time.

												Top notch game. it has a fair amount of bugs and flaws but thats kinda what makes it so great. you can download tons of maps and mods/mutators and play them online or offline. this game has a really fun singleplayer mode that can get boring after a little while but meh.The multiplayer is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥because theres barely no one on anymore. and for some of us, the servers we can find have really high ping. But thankfully this game has an offline mode where you can fight bots (which by yor choice can become really over powered and un killable) and stuff. 10/10 would play this game again.This is my first review so sorry if its not that great.

												Seven years since the release of Unreal Tournament 2004, and it still stands as a paragon of the FPS genre.  Gameplay is fast and furious, but death is seldom instant, a feat rarely accomplished in today's world of a-bullet-scratched-me-take-cover health regen games.  Health and shields are static, restored only by pickups.  Ammo and weapons must be picked up and are not granted with perks.  Everything from vehicles to weapons to ammo is out in the field and just waiting to be grabbed.  And there is a great variety. UT2004 features instant-hit weapons, slow moving projectiles with fierce power, inaccurate but fierce automatic weapons, continuous-stream energy weapons, sniper rifles, sticky grenade launchers, and even moving, intelligent mines that can be redirected by the player with a laser.It's colorful, enjoyeable, open to modding, and perhaps the single best shooter of the last decade, even if it wasn't the most influential.

												Great Game, Very skill and smart oriented for Competitive 1v1DeathMatch(Duel) Play and you need Weapon skills for Long/Mid-range and Close Combat which is very fun to Master for each Weapon is awesome in its own way... It's a fantastic Game All around because each Game-Mode has it's own style and polish but hands down TAM(TEAM ARENA MASTER) 1V1 DEATHMATCH AND TEAM DEATHMATCH & CTF(CAPTURE THE FLAG) Are the Most Excitable & Active Game-Modes still Available and I recommend using UTPUGS.Com For Competitive PUG's and I will say the only game that can match is QUAKE & it will keep you coming back for more because there is so many aspects of bieng Pro, Skill-Wise.

												If you don't have this game, well you are missing out. It is to this date, the best unreal tournement... With some of the best third party mods, levels, and a lot of fun maps. Killing Floor was a mod of this game for a while, before it became its own game. Really the only problem with this release is it is the windows only one, the orignal release had the linux builds on the disc, which I don't understand why Epic hasn't included it with this release....

												I have played over 5000 hours in this game since its release. Started off with vehicle Capture The Flag (vCTF) and then moving into the Team Arena Master (TAM) mod. Due to the age of the game, you are unlikely to find a large number of populated servers, however you should be able to find a large number of TAM ones about. The premise of TAM are two teams (5v5 usually) start a round, with a standard set of weapons, with the aim of being the last team standing. First team to get 10 rounds wins. Very simple, but extremely fun.If this game had a playerbase like it did at release, I would still be playing. Keep an eye out on the horizon for UT4.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even after all these years, UT04 not only holds up both in terms of gameplay, but is actually better than most current offerings. There are 2 main reasons for this: Simple but timeless gameplay, and massive amounts of content. Games like this remind us all of the sad state of the current games industry. This game was released in a era where people expected their games to have content. There was no DLC. And oh boy, does this game have meat on it's bones. Yes it does, with huge amounts of maps, many different game modes, and even a single player tournament mode where you put together a team and fight other teams thus giving a sense of progression in what would otherwise be just a simple arena shooter.  The graphics also actually hold up pretty well. This is largely because the graphic style is a bit cartoonish and very colorful, and thus it doesn't fall into the trap of ""not looking realistic anymore"" like so many other games do.For 15 bucks, there is no reason not to recommend this game. 10/10.

Game also becomes challenging, and tests you're wits.If you're a fan of FPS, this in my opinion would be the perfect game to take a stab at, believe me, if you're into full chaos, and challenging FPS's, this game is FOR YOU!

												This game is a hallmark of the Arena shooter era, and was definitely a match for Quake in its heyday, along with its older brother UT99. The game is fast paced, fun, and frenetic - you dodge around all over the place, rockets zipping past your view while you nimbly kill your opponents with a variety of weapons.If you like a game with superior gameplay, then this is definitely the one for you.

												This game is bonkers. One of the best, if not the best online shooter of all time. Praised by critics and players alike, in 2004 this was probably the best game made at that time. No wonder.I personally recommend this as a good starting point in the franchise (unless you hate older stuff with passion, then you can grab UT3). It's VERY fast, VERY brutal and unforgiving, and it requires so practice to get good, but the end result is very much worth it. Pretty easy to learn but hard as hell to master.Best multiplayer shooter ever. 10/10.(Also note that I have probably put over 600 hours into this over the years)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not very good by defaults, but has mutators which configures the game like UT99, vehicles are rather fun to use, the amount of maps is huge, especially with the user made ones, though many are quite mediocre. The biggest reason to get this is the mods, this can be turned into a rts, mms, sandbox, dogfight, tactical shooter, coop survival horror and more with an almost endless amount of content, mod tools are included and relativly easy to use. Examples of mods are: red orchestra, killing floor, ballistic weapons mod, psionics, d3nnisK's FORTS and CTF4.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top notch game. it has a fair amount of bugs and flaws but thats kinda what makes it so great. you can download tons of maps and mods/mutators and play them online or offline. this game has a really fun singleplayer mode that can get boring after a little while but meh.The multiplayer is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥because theres barely no one on anymore. and for some of us, the servers we can find have really high ping. But thankfully this game has an offline mode where you can fight bots (which by yor choice can become really over powered and un killable) and stuff. 10/10 would play this game again.This is my first review so sorry if its not that great.

												A true classic arena shooter. Perfectly playable today, with pretty decent server population. Definitely pick this up if you're an FPS fan, or if you want to hear that announcer yell ""Holy shiiiiit!"" again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unreal Tournament '99 was one of the first serious FPS games I played. I'd played good ones before, like DN3D, and Doom and stuff, but then came this, THIS game, and it blew me away. Then I played Unreal, as I recall. I played that afterwards, I don't really know how I missed it.Anyway. That was it. I was a huge fan of UT from then on. It was great fun with friends and family.Then UT 2003 came out, and that, that was an awesome game. I loved it. I loved it... but I actually preferred '99. I don't really remember why. I still played the hell out of UT 2003 though. Then, we got 2004. Which was so awesome I instantly switched to it and never really looked back (until now, really, I still love '99 because 2004 doesn't really capture the same spirit that '99 had).UT 2004 however is unbelievably fantastic. When it comes to turbo-classic FPS games, this one should be up there with Quake, Doom, Duke Nukem, Daikatana (pfft), whatever. It's considered by many to be the grand champion of the UT series, which is still going strong today (sort of).I, for one, am super hyped for the UT '99 remake, or whatever it is that Epic Games are doing. But until then, UT 2004. It's got mods, it's still being played, it's great. Get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unreal Tournament is a classic franchise, one of the founding forefathers of the first person shooting genre.  UT2004 is no exception, it adds to the great formula that set the foundation and improves on it with better graphics, smoother gameplay and easy to add new mods and maps to the game, extending lifespan by years.UT2004 also has a great multiplayer aspect, if you can still find servers.Oh, and I do NOT recommend getting the Steam Version, as there is a fatal glitch that corrupts the configuration file in this game.  The CD version is cheap and generally more reliable than the digital version. Sorry Steam, but when you give us a broken game for 15 bucks, it's gonna get panned.Still, UT2004 is a great FPS Arena shooter game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of world's best FPS in the world, the single player mod is just hours of intense gameplay, understanding AI tecs, visiting numbers of great maps, and playing different unique game modes. And when you grow tired of the campain, go Multiplayer, more game modes, more weapons, more enemies to shoot. In my opinion one of the best games in the world.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bit of nostalgia from UT99. Definitely a great game. One level includes flying a space fighter ship! Space figher ship games also one of my favourites. Progress through the ranks unlocking new characters and your own team gets better over time as they play more.+space ship fight+nostalgia+vehicles+instagib+replay value+enemy challenges-enemy AI always target you first. So you will die a lot.Very fun game never thought id play this game for 20+ hours and enjoy it 90% of the time . Happy to give it 9/10 (-1 for the not fun part where AI target you all the time)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very intense fast paced fps. Honestly, I only bought it so I could play the old Killing Floor mod, but I enjoyed the game anyway. I felt a bit overwhelmed by the contents of the game, multiplayer is pretty active. Maps seemed well designed. Graphics are dated but fit. People seem to enjoy jumping over you and shooting you in the back of the head before you can react- pretty much what I meant by fast paced and intense.Overall maybe an 8/10, havn't really given it enough of a run to be really accurate.
