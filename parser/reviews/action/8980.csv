												-Large, sandy desert-Bandits and psychos everywhere-Redneck car dealers-Alien creatures out to kill you at all times-87 bazillion gunsMan, Texas sure is greatEDIT: 15/01/2015So, it's come to my attention that this review, which initially began as a joke, has become tremendously popular on the store page (huge thanks to all who voted so positively!) so I decided I should actually include something in this review to keep it helpful to newcomers or fans coming off of Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel.What is it that keeps Borderlands so good to come back to, and compulsively play on a consistent basis? If you were to ask me this question, there would be no way I would know how to respond simply. But, I can at least try to break it down.Gameplay-wise, Borderlands has all the fundamentals of an FPS, shooting feels good and there's a wide range of guns with a unique feel to all of them (more on that later) without sacrificing movement. FPS makes up the core gameplay and how you interact with the world and NPCs in terms of combat, and it feels fantastic. However, the RPG elements are what give this game that extra depth that stops it from being 'just another' shooter. Every character has unique perks and skill trees that can be customised in different ways to alter general combat and your unique action skill. It keeps combat fresh and skills balance across characters really well. You might not see trees as unique as Zer0 or Krieg from Borderlands 2 but you can expect deep customisation nonetheless. No one character defines a playstyle, any of the four can be decked out with the according loot to keep you tanky, but the action skills and trees prevent the protagonists from feeling same-y.Storyline wise don't expect a deep tale, or even a sweeping adventurous romp like Borderlands 2. Instead, Borderlands goes for a strong atmosphere communicated through mission structure and world design, and yet I have no complaints about this lack of story. Gearbox balanced innumerable quests with a consistent world to combine for a truly unique experience. This is a game that, thanks to an RPG quest system, lets you get out there in the game world and get lost in it doing missions for insane amounts of time but lets you stay immersed in the storyline and world at the same time.Now, the meat of Borderlands. Let's be honest, RPGs have had shooter elements before, but, in my opinion, never has an inventory system in an RPG felt this good. Borderlands has my favourite inventory/loot system because it cuts the crap and gets right to the stuff you care about: guns, guns, guns! Don't expect to be picking up some arbitrary ""Lord Generic's Gold Coin #74 with Blue Palette"" to sell later. Borderlands gives you gear you use practically, and can sell for money. Expect to pick up grenade modifications, shields, class modifications which power up your skill trees even further and of course, guns. Perhaps what keeps the loot so good in Borderlands 1 as compared to 2 and Pre-Sequel is how they function relative to your character's level. I love Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel, but I found myself selling guns a lot more than in BL1, because Gearbox opted for a more balanced weapon system. Borderlands 1 has a different experience to opening loot chests. You could open something and still have the same giddy eagerness as when you first opened one in your early hours with the game because genuinely powerful and versatile weapons can be found. This is due to levelling and some manufacturers having incredibly unique traits that set them far above other manufacturers. Take, for example, the fact I own a Hyperion shotgun with a level 15 requirement that I still use on my level 44 Mordecai and you get an incredible idea of what this game can offer you. Not to mention the amount of guns outnumbers Borderlands 2 by around 3 million (5 mil vs 8 mil) and this game keeps a lot to see in it. Like the other Borderlands games there's a lot to see in the way of second playthroughs, offering more quests, even better loot and more challenging enemies.I feel as though my review barely scratches the surface even after typing all of this, but overall, I highly recommend you purchase this game if you want to get lost and spend countless hours in one of the deepest shooters I've played this past decade.10/10, would fight Texans again and again and again.

												This game is not like any other Shooter, it mixes with RPG-like elements to create an ultimate gaming experience. I love the cartoon-like environment and the story about this planet of Pandora. Even if you beat the game, you can do it all again with harder enemies and better loot and I certainly did it because it was so fun. This game is one of my all-time favourites and for the sale price it was totally worth it.I would recommend it to any gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start out by saying that I do not like shooters.  1st person, 3rd person, or whatever.  I have never liked shooters.  My son came to visit and brought his Xbox 360 and he said he had a game that if I would give it a chance, he was sure I would like it at least enough to play with him when he came to visit.  When he loaded up Borderlands, my first reaction was ""Oh God!  A Shooter.""  I reminded him that I didn't like this kind of game at all.  He talked me into trying.  He suggested that I play Mordecai.  To make a long story short, within an hour I was so hooked I lost all track of time.  Between the pop culture knods and puns from my era (the story writers have GOT to be close to my age... which we won't mention what is) and the shere enjoyment of the game itself, it felt like we had only played an hour or so and I looked at the clock and it was 7 hours later!  I went on to play the 2nd AND the presequel!  I am still not very big on shooters, but I am at least a little more open to them because of this game and my son's persistance.  Borderlands have you laughing hard one second and then wondering ""what the heck!?"" the next.  The story is extremely engrossing, and the characters very relatable in their actions and motivations.  When you get to the end (is there actually and end??)  You will feel like you have acomplished the unachievable.  If you are even looking at this game and wondering, I have only two words:  ""BUY IT!""  Whatever genre is your preference, you will fall in love with it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved this game, the mix with FPS and RPG is just fantastic, and the fact that you can level your character and spend points in your talents tree is awesome! The art is great as well, and there are lots and lots of different weapons that you can try, until you find one that you really like! Playing by yourself is great, but it's a lot more fun when you play it with friends, the enemies get tougher and the loot gets better. 100% recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why I love this game. It is so totally asocial that it's a little bit sick. But I guess there come times in everyone's life when the only thing that suits your mood is to melt the faces off some midgets with a gun that shoots acid, or set bandits on fire and listen to your character laugh her head off as your victims run around screaming ""Mommy, mommy!"" It shouldn't be funny, but it's as funny as hell. It has some absolutely classic characters, not only in the main players like the siren Lilith, who has a ghastly giggle every time she hurts someone REALLY badly and who will abuse you if you leave her on hold too long, but also Dr. Patricia Tannis, the insane archeologist whose only reflection when a colleague is devoured alive by one of the local animals is ""He always had the more comfortable chair....I took his chair,"" Scooter, who could so easily have become a simple hick parody but turns out a great deal more, and funnier; and General ""Doesn't Like Mondays"" Knoxx, who is condemned to the hell of being commanded by a six year old child who outranks him because of nepotism gone insane. Just don't expect redeeming social value, unless there's some redeeming social value in getting rid of your less healthy desires in a relatively harmless way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Growing up on games like Quake and Diablo really helped me to appreciate the greatness of Borderlands. There’s been a lot of games that have tried to pull off genre hybrids, but they either fail to deliver or just fail to program a game correctly. Borderlands is one of the few games that manages to feel like an RPG and a FPS at the same time.Coming from a shooter side, the game is a very fun classic style shooter, meaning that the realism has been replaced with you getting to unload a clip into someone before dropping them. Sniper head-shots can generally take a foe down with one shot, but most all other guns are going to require you to get dirty. It feels an awful lot like a classic Quake shooter too. It’s just action based. Your ‘cover’ system is generally using you strafe and jump at the right time. By all means, this a welcome to some older gamers since most of today’s games are just striving to hit a certain realistic feel.From an RPG point, the game does take a few tumbling points in certain areas. The biggest problem is the skill tree. It’s pretty bare and some of the skills just feel useless. There’s also not enough skills to pin you into one type of character. Are you a Hunter looking to just be the stay-back sniper? Well, you can max those skills out but you can’t invest only points into one branch. It would have been nice to borrow a few more of the Diablo elements, allowing you to create an amazingly unique character from branches. Instead, you’re left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the skills. The only other problem with the RPG element is the characters all feel about the same. My Hunter manages to be a jack-of-all-trades character instead of just a hunter. While I might technically do more damage with a sniper rifle, my dark-orange rare machine gun that does 4x fire damage is going to take down the enemies faster. While these two things are a bit critical, the rest of the action role-playing feels genuine. Looting is fun; leveling up is fun; and having a huge inventory is very nice.From a graphic standpoint, this might not be a masterpiece, and some may feel a little turned off by the cartoony look, but by all means, you can at least distinguish this title from the other 90% of shooters that look like Modern Warfare clones. The one problem with the game’s graphics is some unstable frame rates, mainly when there’s a lot of blood on screen, a lot of elemental damage, or just towards the end of the game. It’s not unplayable, but the slowdowns shouldn’t be happening at all. Aside from that, it’s a nice refreshing look and feels more like a video game than a simulator.There’s a story to the game, but even after playing through the game two times, I don’t think I could tell you what it’s about other than treasure hunting. Personally, I think the lack of story kept me more interested. I wasn’t worried about progressing to the end as much as I was trying to kill as many things as I could to find the next best weapon. While the story lacks in a big way, it would be nice to have a bit more of it in the next title release.Where most people are probably going to go wrong with this title is trying to play this game as a single player game. Don’t bother. This was meant to be a co-op game. It’s like playing Left 4 Dead alone. It’s possible, but you’re going to actually enjoy playing the game when you have friends around. A benefit of having more friends play with you is that the game rewards you with more rare items. Plus, if you want to break away from the typical gameplay, they’ve installed arenas around the area to help you test out your gear against other foes, or to just play a little smack down with a friend.And for you achievement/trophy treasure finders out there, this title is pretty easy to get 100% in. What’s more interesting is the Medals (or challenges) you can try for with each character. Trying to get 2,000 head-shots or get the max number of cash in the game is wildly fun. It actually feels more like an extra quest in the game, since each challenge gives you a nice pot of experience points.My final thoughts on the game: it’s a fantastic game, and for a new IP, it’s refreshing to see that there’s companies that still want to bring new or greatly tweaked genres to the table. While there’s some work to be done in some areas, the game had me fork over $60 and supplied me with $100 worth of entertainment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like GUNS?! Do you like Loot?!Well boy do I have a game for you! Gearbox and 2K's Borderland game is essentially just that - game based around guns and loot, and yet as you play you're invited into the very believable and 'live' world of Pandora. It's not long at all before you realise that this is more than your basic FPS, sure it has the First-Person viewpoint, and you, er, shoot, but there's an adventure in here too. It's rare that a FPS shooter has characters and humor injected into as rich as Borderlands, and looking back from when I originally played this on the 360, I'm not sure I've really played a game like it since.It blends FPS and RPG elements together, and embraces our natural greed for better loot, to provide what I can only describe as a really fun time. It might have aged terribly since I last played, it and Borderlands 2 (and it's endless DLC) has been released since then too, but the first Borderlands game will always have a place in my games collection. It was one of the first fun Co-Op experiences I had, which in part was due to the 4 unique characters you could play as. Each character had their own traits and specialist role within a team, but could be equally as well-rounded if you played Solo. So you never really felt like you had 'picked the wrong class' when playing. Sure the game would change slightly depending on who you picked due to that character's 'natural' play style shaped by their traits and abilities, but nothing that would make the game less enjoyable.In essence you had the Soldier, The Sniper, The Tank & The Magic classes to choose from. Each class comes with a speciality ability, and there are 3 seperate talent trees to spend skill points in to allow you to customise your characters abilities somewhat. The way the Co-op System worked was interesting, and one I wish was used more often. Every game you had saved was YOUR game, and it was up to you if you wanted your friends to join in and help YOU out in YOUR game. So you could play Solo and progress, or you could call in your friends and progress. The game wouldn't progress without you being there, so there was no real need to worry about slowing down other people's progress due to other commitments. Sadly, the PC version of Borderlands seems to come with a really terrible gamespy client that is hard to navigate compared to the Xbox360 Party System, which can at times make finding a party difficult and irritating. As mentioned previously, the ship might have sailed on Borderlands due to Borderlands 2 being released, but I still enjoyed it and for those with an older PC unable to run Borderlands 2 this might still be worth checking out if you're looking to scratch an itch when it comes to collecting guns...

												Commonly described as Diablo with guns, Borderlands can't really be explained by comparing it to other games. The closest you could probably get is Hellgate: London (as long as you were playing one of the gun/first-person shooter classes), but even then there are some pretty major differences.If you haven't been paying attention to this game at all, Borderlands is a first-person shooter with action role-playing elements. You choose from four classes -- The Soldier, the Berserker, the Hunter, and the Siren. Each has a unique ""action skill,"" which is basically that classes special ability, and three different trees to drop skill points into. While every class can use every weapon in the game (the only limit on what you can equip is determined by your level), most characters have skills in their skill tree that enhance one or two particular types of weapons.The Soldier is best with rifles and shotguns, the Berserker with explosive weapons and his melee attack, the Hunter with sniper rifles and revolvers, and the Siren with any weapon that deals elemental damage. Luckily, there is enough flexibility that these don't feel like absolute restrictions. If you wanted to make a Hunter that mainly used rocket launchers, that's completely viable. Sure, it won't be the best build for the character, but you won't feel like you have no options other than to use the ""recommended weapons"" for each class.You may remember some minor controversy a while back when Gearbox announced that they had scrapped the game's initial design in favor of cel-shaded graphics. I'm happy to report that I believe Gearbox made the right choice in changing the graphical direction of the game. Not only does it make Borderlands look unique, but it's gorgeous on top of that. Looking back at older screenshots of the game, the original art style seemed so generic and bland -- I'm really glad they decided to take a chance and mix it up. Other than some minor texture pop that resolves almost immediately upon loading and some slight screen tearing (VSync option please!), I didn't really run into any other graphical issues.The game begins with you being tossed off a bus. You meet your first Claptrap who explains the basics of the game, and gives you a short mini-tutorial. After making your way to the first town, you're assigned your first quest and the game really begins.There's a massive number of quests in the game, and Gearbox has done a reasonable job of mixing them up. While every now and then you'll be assigned a ""Kill X enemies"" quest, they are few and far between. For the most part, you'll be exploring various locations and recovering different items, usually with a bunch of bad guys standing in the way. Even after completing the game, I was still going back and finding quests that I had missed before.One of the reasons it's been compared to Diablo is because of the emphasis on loot. The initial stories were right -- there are TONS of weapons in this game. There are seven main weapon types: pistols (this includes repeater pistols and revolvers), submachine guns, shotguns, combat rifles, sniper rifles, launchers, and a seventh that could be considered a minor spoiler. Every weapon has a variety of stats: accuracy rating, recoil, how much the weapon can zoom, how many bullets the weapon can hold, how fast the gun can fire, how many bullets fire at once, how fast the weapon reloads, and more. In addition, weapons have a chance to have one of four elemental properties: Explosion, Fire, Shock, and Corrosive. You also have slots for grenade mods, your shield, and a class mod that will boost your skills and provide some benefits, each with their own special aspects and variations.Combat in Borderlands is a ton of fun. While the game is a first-person shooter at its core, some strategy is needed. Each enemy has a ""weak point"" that you can attack for critical damage. For humans, its their heads. For Skags (the world's dog-like beasts), it's their mouths (but only when they're open, which is not often). While initially combat will seem relatively simple, once you progress the game will get reasonably difficult, and you'll find yourself very carefully having to manage your cover, your shield/health level, and your surroundings.Borderlands blends the regeneration aspect of many popular FPSs with health-pack grabbing. You have shields and life, and your shields regenerate, while your life doesn't. While this will give you some leeway to run into dangerous situations with guns blazing, you can't just stand still and blow everyone up. If you're going to make a rush, you'll have to take out your opponents quickly.One criticism I do have of the combat is the lack of variety of enemies. Skags, bandits, and spiderants make up the majority of what you'll be fighting throughout most of the game. A few zones have unique enemy types, and the flying Rakk are occasionally around to harass you. But for the most part you're going to be fighting the same enemies over and over again. One of the ways Borderlands differs from games like Diablo and Hellgate: London is that nothing is randomly generated aside from items themselves. The maps and locations are exactly the same every single time you play, and immediately upon entering an area you're given the entire map of the zone. Quest items will always be in the same spots, vendors will never move, and even the chests, safes, and weapon caches will always be in the same locations in every playthrough.Luckily, the repetitive feeling goes away quite a bit when you're playing with friends. Borderlands was designed as a co-op game, and co-op is where it really shines. Gearbox has done a good job of adjusting the difficulty in co-op games, in that you'll need to work together carefully with your friends to avoid dying. I actually found myself dying more when I was playing through the game with a friend than I did in single player, because we had to think a lot more strategically and be more careful. Since the enemies have significantly boosted health and damage, if even one or two get through your defenses you'll get taken down pretty quickly.The final thing I want to touch on is the story. While Borderlands starts out with a reasonably interesting story, it kind of takes a backseat to the action. This is somewhat understandable, since this is an FPS game at its core, but be prepared. The ending of the game is massively disappointing. Think Fallout 3, but worse. It's a shame, because the initial story has a lot of promise, and it's sad to see that potential squandered. This doesn't really affect the gameplay, but I found it to be the biggest disappointment I felt from my entire time with Borderlands.Luckily, even with these complaints, the first playthrough of Borderlands is an absolute blast, and will provide you at least 25+ hours of gameplay as long as you don't avoid all the sidequests. With tons of weapons to find, a great co-op system, fantastic art, and a whole bunch of exploding bodies, Borderlands is worth your money. Even when I feel that the game is starting to get repetitive, there's something about it that keeps me playing. Even my plans to jump into the game for five minutes to grab screenshots would suddenly turn into hour long play sessions without me even realizing it, and even having done most of the quests twice, I still want to head back and try again with a new character class. Despite a few imperfections, the game is simply fun -- and at the end of the day, that's what really matters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will go as far to say that Borderlands is a perfect game. It took me a few half play throughs to get through, but this is not because the game is not enjoyable, I just loose track of where I am in a game if I put it down for a few weeks, this past week however, I blastered through the whole game, the full game with all of the side quests took me twenty hours to complete.  I am now starting ""playthrough #2"" which is essentially, the same, just with scaled up enemies. I love the looting system, the gun mechanics, the quests, the story, I just love this whole game. Yes I am a little bit late to the party, and yes most people will already have Borderlands sitting in their library, but play it, finish it, enjoy it, it's an absolutely joy to play. You get a real feel of success when you reach the final stages of the game, there is no better feeling than finding a phat gun, that you can rip through tons of enemies with, dropping your defense turret to shield yourself while you finish off another fifteen skags.I seriously cannot wait to get stuck into my second playthrough and jumping into some online games. One again, this for me, is a perfect game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Long Review  (short review at the bottom)This game is amazing, it's an FPS RPG that has a stunning art style and a lot of replay value.The main purpose of this game is basically leveling up and getting loot.The story isn't all that, there is little to no voice acting, so if that's the only thing you care about in video games, you'll probably not gonna like this game.Although the graphics are a bit old, especially the low resolution texture and shadows, the art style they used (cel-shaded) really holds up the game even for modern gaming.Some graphic problems can be fixed, like adjusting FOV, enabling Vsync and Anti Aliasing, but personally I haven't tried them because I didn't feel it was neccessary. Negative Points There are a few problems with the game, so I'm gonna list what mostly bothered *me*, maybe you won't care about these problems, and maybe you won't experience them, so it's just my opinion. Some glitches happen sometimes, the worst I got was in the Underdome DLC where enemies would spawn/fly off outside the arena and there's no way you could kill them, and you'd have to do it all over again (can take up to 3 hours) Some of the achievements are ridiculous, like the Claptrap's New Robot Revolution DLC where you have to collect a bunch of *VERY* rare drops  (like pizzas and bobbleheads)  and I haven't gotten all of these achievements yet, even though I've already put hours into drawn-out farming and grinding. The Underdome DLC has these ""larger challenges"" where you basically have to play 3 hours back-to-back, 3 times (so 9 hours in total, #Maths) and if you quit or disconnect (or get the above glitch) you'll have to do it all over again, which is just painful. The DLCs don't have any ""Fast Travel"", so you'll spend a *LOT* of time just running around from place to place, especially in ""The Secret Armory of General Knoxx"", which to be fair, has a lot of ""Catch A Ride"" stations (for cars), but it still takes too long to get somewhere. Positive Points And now my most favourite things this game has to offer The variety of weapons: which is what -I believe- makes this game standout. Replay value: when you finish the game, which is a quite linear mission flow with a bunch of side missions, you get to play it again in a second ""Playthrough"". you get to keep your weapons, keep your level, skills, and basically everything from the first playthrough, but you'll face stronger opponents and better loot. and this system works perfectly (apart from overleveling and making it too easy). The Multiplayer: in this game is what I would call ""Perfect"", the entire party gets experience from every single kill, and they all get cash from loot and doing missions, the only thing not shared is the loot itself, which I still prefer, especially since different classes require different weapons/gear. The DLC: is really good, it's almost the ideal DLC a gamer would want: it adds a lot of content, increases level cap, adds more weapons, interesting backstory, more achievements etc.. the game by itself is really good, but with the DLC it's even better.The game is not very long, but it takes a decent amount of time to 100%.And it is a LOT better to play with friends (more experience, more fun, and more co op achievements). TL;DR Game good.RPG very.Story not very.Friends invite.DLC buy.Collectibles bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Borderlands Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: FPS; RPG; Cooperative; Lighthearted; Action  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-65 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEWBorderlands is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.Borderlands also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like Diablo, loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.Another defining aspect of Borderlands is the self-identifying art style and graphics scheme. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.  Finally, one of best aspects of the game is the multiplayer functionality. Also borrowing from the style made popular by games like Diablo, you are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.If you have yet to give this game a try, then I envy you. It is one of the hallmark games of its generation and will forever live on as a masterpiece of its time. So stop reading this and get on with it!Addendum: After the Gamespy shutdown, multiplayer functionality has been moved over to Steamworks in 2015, so it continues to work properly.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												The first question that comes to mind when most people see some screens from Borderlands or watch a trailer for the game is, ""Is Borderlands an RPG or a shooter?"" Well, that's not necessarily an easy question to answer. On the one hand, it's far more an RPG than a shooter with its classes, experience levels, skill trees, quests, and all of the usual trappings of an RPG. On the other hand, combat is not a slow-paced methodical affair, being neither turn-based nor a simple matter of selecting the attack button and letting the CPU roll the dice. You need to aim, move, strafe, and everything else that you need to do to survive in a first-person shooter. So what we have here may be one of the finest shooter-RPGs. A hardcore RPG gamer may not appreciate the twitch-based combat, and a hardcore shooter gamer may be a bit put off by the fact that there's some dice-rolling going on behind the scenes (what do you mean I'm too low level to hit that monster???), but everyone else should have a great time with the game.Borderlands takes place on the planet of Pandora, a backwater planet with a character that's a bit Mojave Desert and a lot Road Warrior. Pandora is the kind of planet that wouldn't garner a second thought from anyone anywhere else in the galaxy except that it's also home to The Vault. The Vault is an ancient structure left behind by some long-gone alien race, but it's rumored to contain treasure and artifacts of vast power. The presence of The Vault has attracted the attention of fortune seekers from all corners of the galaxy, in spite of all of the dangers on Pandora from the testy local fauna and aggressive bandit groups. You are one of those fortune seekers, and while it may seem that exploring The Vault would form the bulk of your adventure most of your efforts will be directed at just getting there - but that's alright because Pandora is a pretty interesting place in its own right.Borderlands gives you the choice of one of four different characters, and unlike a full RPG there's not really much available in the way of character customization. There are four classes available, a soldier who uses all variety of weapons, a berserker who's basically a tank and can cause some serious damage with his fists, a hunter who specializes in sniper rifles and has control of an attack bird, and a siren who's a stealth-based character with the ability to turn invisible for short stretches of time. Each character provides a different experience, and that experience can be further tweaked by specializing in one of the three skills trees available to each character. While you can certainly complete the game as any of these four classes, it's when you play the game in co-op mode - either split-screen or on Xbox Live - that you'll realize how well-balanced a team these four characters make. And when you do play online, the story progress will be set to that on the host's machine but the level of the enemies will be adjusted to reflect the mix of levels of the characters taking part in the game.One of the great things about Borderlands is that there is always plenty to do. In addition to the story missions there are always a number of other missions available, either from characters that you meet in the game or from job boards in the friendly settlements. Even after you finish with The Vault, you can return to the wastelands of Pandora and continue taking on side quests.The developers of Borderlands must have spent at least a little time playing World of Warcraft, because they understand how much fun (and how addicting) it is to find a huge variety of loot. There are an amazing number of weapons in the game to be scavenged from defeated enemies, discovered in foot lockers, or pulled from corpses discovered in the wastelands. There are several classes of weapons such as pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles, and they come in standard and rarer varieties. Each is rated on damage dealt, range, and ammo capacity, but some of the better ones will include the ability to use special ammunition like incendiary rounds, fire grenades, or even come with blade attachments to increase melee damage. You'll spend a fare amount of time in your inventory screen, deciding which combination of weapons to have equipped, which to save for later or to sell, and which to drop to make room for something else, but it's more a labor of love than a chore. The game is even kind enough to mark loot in the area with a small beam of light, and you'll more often than not decide it's worth the risk to fight through a group of enemies just to see what's sitting under that little beam of light in the distance.Borderlands has a great look to it - it's not quite a fully cel-shaded game, but it has a distinct comic book look to it. The violence also tends toward a comic book style, and although it would be pretty graphic in a game with realistic graphics it comes across as slightly humorous in Borderlands and fits the game's dark, subtle, and subversive sense of humor perfectly. Pandora certainly has its own unique look and feel to it, and it stands out from the myriad of alien worlds that you've visited in countless other games before. And it's not just the look of planet that makes Pandora, Pandora - everything from your chipper robot guide to the colorful locals to the mysterious woman who appears to you in brief visions, makes exploring Pandora a very interesting experience.Highly Recommended!

												Borderlands is simply one of the best games ever made.  They blended RPG and FPS elements and the result is wonderful.  Coupled with a great underlying game engine and terrific storyline/atmosphere, this game shines amongst the game choices out today.  Throughout the game, you're consitently challenged without the RPG elements becoming too repetitious.  Overall, Borderlands is a wonderful game that will have you coming back to it over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands! what a great title for a game. I've never heard of it 'till I saw it on sale this summer and I bought it thinking ""look at this guy (-psycho-) on the game's art.. he's a proper lunatic this one definitely must have story"" sadly he hasn't much. All he wants is to throw his machete and blow things up including himself, kinda like mad max movie scene -witness me! anyway...The story is about an ancient Vault in a planet called Pandora, rumors say that inside that vault there is Chuck Norri's priceless loot -who knows! and guess what; you're the one badass Vault Hunter that will open it.  My heart started pounding crazy at that point of the story and then... my journey began.---info---here some pros/cons that I've experienced playin'+beautiful environment+faded cartoon color graphics+realistic enemy foes in foreign planet+four characters to choose +Smoothly 4 player co-op +Great story that made me feel like I want to visit this planet +Open world and quests flow at your own pace. +tons of loot $ (guns/armor upgrades/bomb upgrades/skill upgrades..TAKE IT ALL!+Character Level system and skills tree to choose one per level+Fast teleport system+Halo vehicles! (jeeps)+psycho fellas+funny dialogues and xp challedges-Lack of a codex/journal (lore background)-Unfulfilled ending -Overall easy AI if you play solo (AI gets harder in co-op)-Lack of a storage chest to put my badass gun collection (edit: added in Mad Moxxi's DLC)....It would be grand if I could play solo and the rest of the characters join in like an offline co-op9/10 ***TK Baha would need more braaaaaaaaaaaaaains! though.

												Borderlands was one of the first games I ever played, and coming back to it today, I still love the damn thing to bits.I got this game a couple of years ago via a USB that was circulating around the classroom at school, and instantly fell in love with those trademark, cartoony-realistic graphics the game is famous for. Having beaten the game on that presumably illegally downloaded copy, I jumped at the chance to buy it on sale (Humble Bundle is OP :D), hence my low playtime.This game has so much to offer the player, whether you be an experienced FPS player or an absolute n00b like I was on my first playthrough. This accessibility is primarily due to the RPG-like experience point system, that allowed me to level up and eventually defeat bosses despite my lack of skill.The story in this game is above and beyond what you would expect from your average FPS game. I guess you can't really consider Borderlands a shooter more than it is an RPG, and this is one of the things that is so attractive about it. I would say that the game excels in many areas where other RPG's do not, namely the openess of the world and the fairly sizeable ammount of free choice you have when completing quests (I'm looking at you, Far Cry 3). The humor in the game is also brilliantly executed, and had me cracking up at many points throughout the story.So is the game worth your hard earned money, even if it was realeased almost 6 years ago?HELL YES.

""If RPG and FPS made a baby it would be Borderlands"" The first part of the Borderlands series was a marvelous breakthrough. Some Diablo fan developers of Gearbox reinvented the way of co-op fighting and looting in a post apocalyptic world named ""Pandora"". Containing 4 different iconic characters which you can levelup by XP gained from kills or solving quests is still today (6 years after release) a highly addictive game concept. The other thing is the random weapon looting generator which produces practically an infinite variation of all kind of weapons (with elemental damage, multipliers, rarities, weapon classes, character class mods, grenade mods and shields). You can buy weapons from vendor machines but mostly they are hidden in weapon cases, lockers or stashes all over the landscape or they drop from killed enemies. So you cleanout an area in action loaded sequences (the AI is great) and after that you compare stats of dropped and looted weapons.You better play together with your friends. The game is up to 4 players co-op which is a great experience. Even if there are sometimes loot conflicts or quest solving / achievements asynchronities. Whatever is the reason it still makes fun.Very innovative was the unique cell-shade graphics at that time which gave the game the perfect comic look. Mixed-up with FoV and depth sharpness effects it felt quite modern and fresh. Today it feels a bit blurry but still nice to watch. Shooting at enemies let drop several damage numbers and criticals hits out of their bodies which is quite funny. The Bossfights are totally epic. Everything seems very story driven. Other things like quests of collecting things are rather repetive. If you finished the main story you will reach lvl36 but on a second playthrough you can farm enough XP to levelup to lvl50 and lateron with DLCs to lvl69 (max level).   The 4 DLCs content is quite extensive storytelling and new epic bossfights. You cannot miss all the DLCs in the GOTY version which is totally recommended and worth to buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a first person shooter with strong role playing elements set on a distant and hostile planet.You play as one of four mercenaries who have come to the planet of Pandora seeking the legendary “Vault” and its many promised treasures.There are four different characters to choose from in Borderlands, each with their own set of skill and abilities. The four characters include Lilith ""The Siren"", Mordecai ""The Hunter"", Brick ""The Berserker"" and Roland ""The Soldier"". The missions and side quests can be quite rewarding in Borderlands and allows characters to score all sorts of loot and weapons to help them accomplish the game's main objective.In the multiplayer co-op mode up to four players can choose any one of the characters and play through the same single player campaign.Borderlands is an excellent mix of RPG elements without sacrificing FPS game play. It is a perfect choice to play with your friends, definitely worth to buy.Sounds 8/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. The game had a lot of unique features and settings. A first-person shooter set on a sci-fi planet - Pandora, with a lot of focus on RPG elements. The game was very well reviewed and recieved a various amount awards, including several Game of the Year's. Visually the game is beautiful and covered in cel shading, giving it a very comic book / hand-drawn look. The game took cel shading so far, that people often associate the game with that specific art-style. Thanks to the cel shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.Pandora is a very hostile planet, as you quickly get to experience with the regular human bad-guys and also a selection of aliens and mutations. You get to choose between 4 characters to play, each with it's unique ability and weapons. There is a leveling system where you gain experience and level up specific perks for your character and set-up. When you level up, so does your enemies, and occasionally you encounter a 'Badass' (stronger and more dangerous than the regular), as well as a bunch of unique variants and bosses. This game rewards you with more loot than your grannies wrinkles. You will drown in a sea of a billion different weapons, with different ammo types, reload speeds, firing speeds, scope zooms, damage etc. IT NEVER ENDS! There are 4 types of bonus damage; fire, explosion, shock and corrosion, all with an advantage and disadvantage to specific enemies. Luckily, you don't wear or find any armor in the game, only a shield and health augmentation, that has about as many billion combinations as the weapons.A lot of people compare Borderlands with Fallout 3. They are in reality very different from one another. Borderlands is very humoristic and bright, while still being twisted and deteriorated. This game is not set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been beautiful. Pandora itself never was a peaceful place, and the name should hint it's secrets within. Borderlands never really focus on a good story either, it's just about the loot, man, the LOOT!This game shows it qualities when played in Co-op, where 4 people can do all this nonsense together. It really starts feeling like an MMO RPG when fighting the harder bosses in co-op, grinding everywhere - and then then rewarded with loot. There even is PVP arenas for fighting over the loot too. If co-op is not an option you can still enjoy it in Single-Player.Pick this up if you are interested in a unique experience, with friends - or without - with a ton of loot and silly things to shoot.Note: Borderlands is the prequel to Borderlands 2, you might be looking into that game too.

												Updated review.Borderlands has to be one of the best RPG's that utilises guns out there. It's up my list with STALKER and Fallout, though the settings here are completely different!9/10 art style and personality; very original all around and it sticks with you; funny and relaxed; the only game that has a better personality is I think Portal 8/10 sound effects, music, voice; it all blends in to form this captivating world8/10 game mechanics; leveling like the classic RPG's have, meaning getting imba in just a few levels and also grinding IS part of the game, guns are fun to customize, combat is visceral with varied enemies and missions, quests are a little boring they look  more like MMO quests but there is a multiplayer option which is the best way to play with a few friendsNot that different from Borderlands 2. You're getting the same experience if you play BL1Not very immersive, but extremely fun to play. Great multiplayer. It can really drain hours from your life without you noticing at all.

												+Great introduction to the world of Borderlands+Best shooter rpg ever (+Great comedy) +Many Guns and loot!+One of the best CO-OP experiences ever for 4 people+Graphics seem unique and the game doesn't feel that older because of that also+All characters (Hunter, Sireen, Berserker and Soldier) seem unique and are awesome in the own way, and yet they keep it simple at the same time - Wanna go with your fists and guns blazing? Go with Brick.. Want to Snipe and have the best bird pal? Go Mordecai.. Want to be the best pal for your teammates and be good with every gun? Go with Roland.. Last but definetly not the least (imo the best) want to go with elemental SMG and destroy everything? Go Lilith, she's the boss!+NPCs are interesting and a hell of fun - for example Athena, TK, Tannis, Claptrap, General Knoxx, Scooter +Boss fights are fun and challenging+So many references and jokes+DLCs are top notch! Except ""The Underdome"" - IMO it goes like this: Zombie Island of Dr.Ned>The Secret Armory of General Knoxx>Claptra's Robot Revolution>Moxxi's underdome- Story may not be the best thing in the game, seems rushed some parts of the game- Respawning mechanism seem broken at times, when you've just killed the enemies, and then you leave the area, comeback, and baam here they are again- The Underdome DLC it's just awful, so much grinding for so little reward, and repetitive as hell- Way too much walking and no teleports in DLCs Overall - 9.1/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It combines FPS and RPG and it is so much fun. As good as Borderlands 2 if you play it with friends its even more fun. The story is great and the gameplay is also flawless. I got this in a sale though, but it worth the price and if you don't own this I don't even know what are you waiting for. If you like guns, guns, guns, guns and loot, loot, loot, loot, this is absolutely for you.Ps: Get GOTY, I didn't and I regret.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After having owned this game for about six years, I finally got around to playing it in its entirety.  It's a great take from the early stages of the RPG/FPS hybrids that are outrageously popular these days.  The gameplay is a blast and stands up to the test of time and the randomly generated loot is always exciting to pick up.  One gun could be entirely different from the next even if they're of the same category and you never know what kind of crazy weapon you'll be adding to your arsenal next.My only real complaints are that long range sniping could be improved and that by the time of the final DLC, if you're playing through all of them consecutively, the game starts to drag a bit.  Sniping seems to snap to a grid for particularly long ranged shots without a great scope which is unfortunate for those of us who have a sniper rifle preference.  The DLC is fun, though it's mostly more of the same.  There are new enemy types but the quest format is unchanged and they often feel like very well done skin swaps.All in all, I highly recommend the game if you have a friend or three to play with and consider it a worthy purchase even if you don't.Just make sure to have your volume control nearby for when Claptrap decides that he wants to start talking.

												It is a bit odd going from Borderlands 2 down to Borderlands 1. There are some things which you take for granted in Borderlands 2 which do not appear in this game i.e. automatic looting of health packs and a decent map.That being said, the game is actually fantastic. It may take a while to get used to it after playing Borderlands 2, but once you get there you WILL have a ton of fun.Highly recommended, particuarly if you pick this up at a discount price.

Borderlands Review - Rating: 8.6/10General ImpressionBorderlands is a great combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). I had a lot of fun with this game. Off to the features: The graphics and the textures are pretty nice, they are 3D cartoonish, and well-designed. The atmosphere is huge, there are many maps to explore and to complete their quests. Many of them are side quests, which are not mandatory, but you need to complete some of them, in order to level up with the quests’ level requirements. You can kill enemies around the maps, doing the quests, or simply riding with your car. The audio, the voice acting and the music are fine. The gameplay is nice, there are a ton of missions, and they differ a lot, which is a good thing. You can kill a lot of diversified enemies, you can explore areas, you can ride your car and do stunts, you can buy from machine vendors whatever you want, and many others. The story is interesting, you can play with up to 4 different characters (Ronald, Mordecai, Lilith and Brick). I won’t spoil what’s happening in it, but 1 thing is sure: if you are going to play with all of them, you would basically spend a ton of hours (more than 200). Without the DLCs. I haven’t tried out the DLCs, but from what I saw on YouTube, they are pretty great. I recommend that you buy the GOTY edition of the game. This game also has a CO-OP option, where you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in the game). The user-interface is pretty nice, with additional designs and well-synthetized information. The controls are well-chosen. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, except with one thing: from time to time, you will get stuck in random objects, but it isn’t hard to get out of them. Overall, Borderlands is a nice combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). A fun game! Made with love!Positive PointsPretty nice graphics and texturesHuge atmosphere, many mapsPretty nice audio and nice musicAwesome, fun and challenging gameplayMany main and side quests availableGood humorMany guns, types of enemies, types of environments, types of missions, etc.A well-designed user-interfaceWell-chosen controlsSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsMany Steam achievementsNeutral PointsTrading nice and Steam items would be some nice featuresNegative PointsSometimes you will get stuck in random objects Some missions are not very interestingIf you level up too fast, the game becomes pretty easy ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finished every Borderlands game multiple times on launch. This time, however, I decided to replay all of them right after each other. Just keep in mind that while reviewing this game, I might compare some aspects to other Borderlands games.Borderlands lets you play the story of a vault hunter, while shooting your way through thousands of enemy's and looting everything they drop. And you will be looting. A lot. Borderlands has tons of loot, and millions of different guns, shields, grenades and more. Loot comes from killing enemy's, completing missions and opening thousands of chests, containers etc.  One downside to the loot system in this Borderlands is, after a while you've seen about everything since weapons start playing the same. In future Borderlands games, weapons have a lot more weird effects and abilities. This causes the loot to be even more interesting and random, since you keep finding new and unique weapons. Future Borderlands games also have even more loot, so more chances for awesome guns! Nevertheless there's still plenty of awesome loot in this Borderlands! Before the game starts, you have the ability to choose from one of the hero's to play with. Each hero has unique skills and abilities to level up and use. Although some skills you can unlock feel kind a useless.Borderlands is the most fun with friends. Comparing your weapons, deciding who gets the loot etc. The game has some really great humor to enjoy with friends as well. A lot of funny characters, dialog and enemy voice lines. Especially Claptrap is great. He's this funny little robot that helps you through the game by giving information and providing missions. Speaking about missions, there's a ton. Main missions will take you about 20-25 hours, but that's just the start. There's a lot of side missions and when finished, you can start the whole game over with higher levels, better loot, stronger enemy's and more skills to unlock! Keep in mind,  if you don't do sidequest, the game can get a bit harder at times due to high level enemy's. When switching to a sidequest, be sure to remember what the current main mission is. There's no indicator that shows what type of mission it is.Borderlands has cartoon-style graphics, which are a bit more grittier/darker than future Borderlands games. This is a great choice on the one hand, as it gives you more of a feeling you're in a wasteland with bandits. On the other hand, Since all locations have the same color pallet, they can feel a bit repetitive at times, even though they're not. Gunplay can require some getting used to, as they feel a bit clunky if you're used to other shooters, but after a while it plays great!The main game has an ""okay"" story, it's nothing special and can feel a bit empty/unsatisfying at times. Especially towards the ending. Now, does this really matter al that much? No. Yea, of course the game would be even more fun if the main story was a bit better and had a bit more content. But there's some funny sidequests which makes up for it a bit, and the game is aimed more towards looting and having a blast killing everyone you see anyway! DLC's are fun, and add some new locations,enemy's, missions and loot. If you can't get enough of the main game, DLC's are recommended for sure!Would I recommend Borderlands? Yea! All of the Borderlands games are amazing, and so is this one! Even many years and playthroughs later I still enjoy every minute of it! Great locations, funny characters, different enemy's and a TON of loot make this an excellent game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 “If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs.” Borderlands is a science fiction first-person shooter (fps) game with role-playing elements developed by the company Gearbox Software. It represents the first game in the Borderland series.  Atmosphere & gameplay: + It features a grim and unclean cel-shading-look in combination with strong contrasts, which results in a cartoonish graphical style.+ The unusual, humoristic events and cinematic moments contribute to the game’s atmosphere.  + Elaborate loot system creates a broad spectrum of weapons and items that support different play styles. + Four classes with various skill trees and weapon priorities offer sufficient customization options. + Well done online collaborative campaign gameplay allows for a flexible and fluent multiplayer experience. o Each of the four DLCs introduces a challenging mini-campaign.  o Solid sound design.- Repetitive side missions offer little variety. Ranging from go-get-it-boy-and-bring-it-back, over collect-all-the-stuff-I-dropped to kill-a-bazillion-of-those. They are tedious.      Characters & story: + Selected illustration of stereotypical side characters with a cynical attitude and wry sense of humour.o Solid voice acting.   - Simple storyline. As if a lobotomized zombie has been given a pen to smear down a one-liner.    Summary: Borderlands is a challenging and entertaining fps experience with (over-the-top) humoristic moments, and the right amount of loot collecting aspects. However, the paper-thin story remains uninteresting and most of the monotonous side quests lack long-term motivation.  Achievements: Estimated time for 100 % completion: +60 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 72Multiplayer achievements: 8			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is the first game in the Borderlands Series, originally released in 2009. It is a mixture of RPG and FPS where you can play as one of four characters, a Soldier, Hunter, Berserker, and Siren, and complete missions for various NPC's. You start on the planet of Pandora, where you are sent by the Dahl Corporation to locate a vault containing alien technology, which is believed to exist on the planet. The planet had previously been abandoned by several large corporations due to their inability to find any alien tech, so it is a broken wasteland of desert and scattered settlements, with wild creatures and raiders a plenty. There is more to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the surprises for anyone.  The graphics look a bit cartoonish, almost a comic book feel to them; However, there are settings and even Mods available to make the game less cartoonish. Borderlands has a Single Player mode, Multiplayer, and Co-operative mode.Each character that you can choose from has a different play style. There are mulitple DLC's available for Borderlands such as; The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. The game also spawned a Sequel, Borderlands 2, and a pre-sequel, Tales from the Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Even though I don't personally like the cartoonish way the graphics look, there are workarounds for that and the game is still fun to play. It has a pretty good tutorial and very little learning curve, so anyone new to the series should be able to jump right in and learn from the playable tutorial. the NPC's are amusing, voice acting is pretty good and the game has decent music. Borderlands is worth purchasing, for those who like RPG-FPS games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Precursor to the legendary Borderlands 2, the original holds up very well alongside its more popular sibling. The best comparison I can offer if you've played the second but not the first is to expect a little more vanilla as far as gameplay and graphics as well as a number of small issues that were ironed out in the second game. These include some leveling issues with enemies, forgettable boss fights, vehicle problems, useless fall damage, falling through parts of the map to your death, too much money, random bugs, etc... However, all the strong points of the second game are present in the combat, humor, leveling system, and overall aesthetics making the original a great experience. All in all, it's a lot of fun and especially so if have the ability to co-op with someone. A definite recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that started it all. Without a doubt the first game to start putting out ""shooters with RPG elements"", but at heart Borderlands is truly half shooter and half RPG. This can be either a downside or an upside to you. I find it amazingly enjoyable to run around interacting with the world, but if you're looking to just shoot things it can get slow. If you're considering buying this after playing BL2, you should definitely do it. But there are several differences between the games. BL1 is less arcade feeling than BL2 but in return you get more of a questing and exploring experience. The world is less colorful than BL2 but it's also more human. The guns are less flashy, but you'll find more of them to be more useful. The legendary guns are more plentiful, but less unique and gimmicky. The playable characters are more generic and dull, but less polarizing than BL2's (there's several skills in BL2 that do just.....nothing)Personally, I find the dry wit of BL1 to be a huge step above BL2's more...pie-in-the-face humor. You can see this in characters like Patricia Tannis and Claptrap. In BL1 they're fleshed out and have a degree of sad charm to their quirks, but in BL2 they sort of become walking charicatures. It's a matter of personal taste, and I'll always love BL1 for kicking off my favorite franchise of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've never played Borderlands 2 and want to play this for the story or just to expeirence the series origins, definitely play this first because the second game blows it out of the water and you won't be able to come back to this and have as much fun as you once did.It's a decent game and had a lot of promise which they fully flushed out in #2 and it's worth a playthrough or two.

												I've been running this through wine - specifically playonlinux using 1.7.53-steam_crossoverhack.  It works well although the FPS is not great but definitely playable.  Increasing/decreasing graphics options does not change the FPS so you can max everything out without worrying about performance.  The game itself is really fun.  I'm coming from BL2 and TPS so it is definitely a step backwards but remains a great game.  Like all the borderlands games it is built on loot and skills which are plentiful.  Really the most frustrating part is not have a mini-map which makes me keep opening up the map for directions.  I really like the Borderlands universe and it is fun exploring this planet again.  The opening is set in Fyrestone which is also playable in BL2, only in BL2 it ceased to be an abandoned Dahl village and was instead turned into a post apocalyptic environmental disaster by Hyperion.  The game also gives insight to many of the characters you run into in the later games.Overall, highly recommend it to Borderlands fans and if you are a Linux user it works fine with wine.  If you are new to Borderlands it is probably best to start with Borderlands 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game, an old classic, this is probably my current favourite RPG, it's great fun and challenging with many fights and bosses, it gets harder to level up as you go on as do your enemies to balance the game very well. It is beautiful, once you get in to it it really is fun, the graphics are a shock at the start but you adjust to them quite quickly. It is long and it keeps you interested throughout, the storyline is amazing. I've really enjoyed playing so far and it is very fun. It is diverse and at the start the boss enemies are a couple of levels higher than you so it is very challenging. With cartoony graphics it is very unique and interesting to play.I'd rate this game 88/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SO. what can i say about this game.I've played this 100's of hours !i've had this game since it was a non-steam game (hence the little hours here)the field of view isn't all that great but there are workarounds for it . the graphics are fine (even though they're just a little outdated and wonky at times)and it's filled with puns.! the best part is that it's replayable in 4 different ways since you have 4 characters to play with with all different styles. and theres literally HOURS of gameplay which you will enjoy a lot. i'm pretty sure there might be one of em that suits you're likings.+MULTIPLAYER this is loads of fun when you play it with a few of you're friends!ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BLOW STUFF UP WITH 4 FRIENDS BECAUSE .. REASONS !!!! i was surprised at how the mechanics were and how this game progresses throughout playing it. it's a solid buy, runs pretty well and looks good for it's time.i would recommend you buying the GOTY version if you do though to get the full understading out of it.EXPLOSIONS/10 !

Welcome to Pandora___Disclaimer___I put only 43 hours into this game and i finished the whole base game and the DLC but the only reason i have this many hours and not like 500 hours, is because i played this game back on the Xbox 360 and i played Borderlands sooooo many times back then, i might of have put like 600 something hours back on the Xbox so the only reason i have 43 hours on the Steam version is because i played this game so much that im burned out at this point. ___---------____Borderlands is my all time favorite game or may i say. Series. I played this game so much that even though im burned out with this game, i still love it to death. And to show how much i love this game we have to start from the beginning. Back in 2010 i was planning to get a new game, all of my friends from school were playing the brand new Call Of Duty games and i was not interested in it, i wanted something else, so i started watching this series on YouTube from this one YouTuber and it was Borderlands, i was bored and was interested in it so frankly i watched it. I loved the look of it from first sight and i knew i had to buy it.So the next day i brought it and fired it up on my Xbox 360. It was a very confusing game at first, it is an RPG game and i never played one before so frankly it took me a while to get used to it, do note that i was also a bit young back then so it was a bit more confusing for me. After some days of watching videos and reading a bit i got the hang of it and ho boy, did i love it. I played through the whole game, i explored every little bit of area, i finished all of the DLC's and after that i still wanted more. So i played through the game the next 4 times with each of the characters and through my time of playing i never got bored. I played as all four of the characters and finished the game 4 times before after moving up to the next game. But whenever i felt like playing something i played Borderlands, When i made a new self account, Borderlands was the first thing i played. I even played this game soo much that the disc one day broke, i won't lie, i was super heartbroken back then, so i had to buy a new copy because i loved this game to death at that point, 2 years later the disc broke again and then i was kind of burned out that i did not feel like buying it again, but later on after 2 years i had an urge to play it again, so i went to the Game Shop and i brought the game yet again and this time it did not break, i still have it on my game collection and even though i don't play it on the Xbox 360 anymore this game does remind me of how much i went through with this game and how much i love it. If you have friends to play this game with then buy it by all means, you will enjoy yourself and if this is your first time playing this game then you will put many hours into it. You have many enemies to fight and many guns to grab, the loot in this game is total madness, with other a bazillion guns for you to find and collect and use. You will never run out of fun playing this game unless you get burned out with it like i did. The performance on Borderlands is fantastic. Running it on a rarther medium to high end PC and i was playing it on high settings and did not drop a single frame, it runs like a wonder and i can tell that you shall have the same performance unless by any chance you have a 9 year old PC with a Intel Cerelon and a GT 240.I recommend this game or may i say game series to everyone out there who wishes to try out a good game to either play singleplayer or CO-OP. As a big fan of Borderlands i recommend this to everyone.You can buy it on sale when its cheap or buy it on other sites such as did when i brought this game on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Full game + GOTY for only £2.50.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Insta bought this game back in the day for console and played an estimated time of 200+ hours.I think everything had already been said about this game and since i played it before Borderlands 2, I'd liketo address the one issue that Borderlands did so much better in than its follow-up.And that is definitely the lootpool.While i couldn't care less about Blue- or even Purplegear in Boderlands 2,i sometimes found myself drooling over Green- and Whiteequipment.The reason behind it is that when i find a gun in BL2 i can already tell or estimate the usual min. and max. numbers of every stat.But in this game i often times had to check every gun and every stat because there was a small percentage chance that a gun that was seemingly an ordanary weapon, had one of its stats way over the top and i would love to have this back in the upcoming series.So i suggest to play this game especially for people who came for the loot factor.

												Guilty pleasure. Don't get me wrong, the first 20 lvls or so are a great satisfying experience, but after that the stereotype comes rather quickly. Even though the ratings are quite high, I think it is overrated. The gameplay is fueled by MMO-style questing and a complex random stats weapons and loot system. What I liked was the cel shaded graphics, brilliant music by Jesper Kyd et al. and the addictivity of it all. The game is suitably challenging and entertaining. Being quite long it will take you about 45hrs to get through most of the content of the main game. The DLCs, especially the Zombie one, are well-done, however the car one has way too long transitions between quests and the arena one is a complete nonsense. There are many bad design decisions throughout the game that will make you wanna rip your hair out. But it isn't insurmountable. The game attempts at being humorous, using memorable characters like Claptrap, Dr. Ned, T.K. Baha or Scooter. Overall impression is good though, buy it, a must-have for achievement hunters.

Oldie but goodie.Borderlands realizes exactly what it promised - a great shooter and a pretty good ARPG. Farming of items is as in any decent game of this type, addictive. Hours run away quickly when we move smoothly from one task to another all the time killing hundreds of inhabitants of Pandora. Lacked a little bit to perfection. Failure to include a sharing mechanism of items between players, effectively deterred from playing with strangers, and friends are not always online. The script presented here is so vague that it is difficult to be drawn into the story of the search for treasure. What is important is not the goal, but the road itself, and that better overcome with buddies. However, if you have a group to which you can always count on a lot of free time and like to shoot with a gazillion of guns, that Borderlands is a game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is an action-RPG / first person shooter. It features cooperative-play, phat loot(tm), and vehicles. This is a game designed to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. In this regard, it's a success.But what do I think of it? Well... eh. I mean, I like Borderlands well enough... I guess. When it comes to this game, the best statements I can muster come off as half-hearted and wishy-washy. I've always been a fan of loot-driven games, but there has to be some sort of hook beyond the basic qualities. It doesn't have to be something particularly clever, but it has to make the game stand out. I think Borderlands lacks this quality, but it's still an alright way to spend a weekend of four. Oh wait. You're probably expecting an explanation of what this ""quality"" is supposed to be aren't you? When it comes to videogames, originality can only go so far. Oft-times, we just have to accept the fact that not every game we play is going to be completely unique and excellent. Sometimes we end up buying games because they look interesting, are in a genre we enjoy, or our friends are playing them. Borderlands is a perfect example.To me, the words perfect and mediocre, are two sides of the same coin. Today's perfection is tomorrow's mediocrity. What was once the gold-standard, has now become the base-line. Borderlands has everything it needs to accomplish its goal of being a competent FPS Lootemup, and nothing more. The shooting mechanics aren't anything brilliant, the controls are acceptable, and the story/writing serve their purpose. The skill-tree system is neat, but only in a ""that makes sense"" sort of way. The build you create isn't really important, because the same two or three abilities tend to dominate every encounter.The guns, the aspect that should set this game apart from the pack, are merely okay. One commonality among loot-based games (especially more recent ones), is that very few character-builds actually use their weapon. By that I mean the sword, polearm, or otherwise is merely a stat-boosting piece of equipment. Usually, the player just uses their skills in order to kill enemies, instead of swinging a large piece of metal around. Practically the sole method of killing in Borderlands is through the usage of guns. Unfortunately, 98% of them are useless. This is especially true of the ""gimmick"" guns dropped by bosses. More often than not, you're going with the standard weapons, just because they're actually effective. In other words, instead of swinging the boring swords, you have to fire the boring guns. The inability to create an identity through play-style is the #1 reason why this game fails to stand out. A game like Borderlands could have really benefitted from more intricate level-designs, as well as a greater level of depth in terms of controls. I'm thinking that the developers could have come up with all sorts of crazy manuevers to pull off. Sliding, air-dashes, back-flips, shoulder-charges, some parkour stunts, you get the idea. Not all of these moves would have to be in the game, but even a couple of them would have lended more dynamism to the combat. This would also make the maps more fun to explore, well... if there was more to them besides wide-open spaces to catch a ride(tm) through, or the bog-standard ""rooms filled of cover"" that's in every other FPS. The RPG elements, while appreciated, sometimes make the game feel too much like an MMO. I know it's just a guideline, but when everything has a level suggestion next to it, the atmosphere is lost. While I always enjoy the immediate pleasures of leveling up and finding better gear, the world-building gets pushed away. Didn't TellTale make a Borderlands game that addresses this very concern? Hm... Perhaps I should look into it.When a game makes an attempt to stand out, it can instead become flawed. The developer tried something different, and either it was a bad idea to begin with, or they didn't quite get it right. Borderlands doesn't take these risks. It's a perfectly mediocre product that delivers enough incentivization to keep gamers playing, it doesn't strive to do any more than that. I don't think that makes this game worthy of praise, but I still enjoyed it well enough... I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Borderlands is one of the Greatest FPS/RPG game ever made, for me. The makers of this game have twisted both the elements together very finely that you won't be bored if you're an FPS and RPG fan. Its very AWESOME if you play it with friends or not (i mean single player). In this game the hunt for bigger and better loot for guns never gets old. Its always AWESOME when you fight your way into the wave of enemies and get loot of better weapons, Shields, Class, Health, etc. and many more. You aswell face many different Bosses aswell as new soldiers to fight and after the fight when you get the access to cases you feel like you're rewarded.Theres also Vehicles in this game,  it gave me feeling like Mad Max as bandits created a conflict in a desert area with me in a vehicle.there are 4 vehicles in this game and some you get by buying DLC.The main story is a blast evenn if you play it alone for Hours and hours without getting bored. and if you play it with your friends its an AWESOME experience.I havent tried all DLC yet but still will write for what i have,For DLC,The Secret Armory of General Knoxx starts players off in T-Bone Junction. This small town is a rest stop on a sprawling stretch of highway raised above the dry basin of an ancient sea. In other words, it looks a lot like the other stretches of beautiful wasteland in Borderlands. Players are required to drive a good distance along these roads to get to the surrounding areas, as there are no teleport locations. There are a few new vehicles, one of which is quite a bit faster than what appeared in the main game, but you'll eventually get tired of the extended driving segments that come with each quest. The four person Lancer allows crews to travel together, but it is slower and not much fun for two of the passengers. If you enjoyed Borderlands and still wanted more, then definitely buy and download The Secret Armory of General Knoxx.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands retains its value through intricate skill trees for the time of release, mounds of loot, and its crude, dark humor. We're talking psychotic bandit lords with spiked nipples.In comparison, Borderlands 2 is more colorful, it has dedicated focus on a villain, and the skill trees have extra variety. However, the first game rewards useful weapons more often, bolstering the arcade experience. As for the setting, you might even find the desolateness of Borderlands to be more fitting for the vault hunters.Grab the GOTY on sale, for the DLCs introduce more guns and class modifications, as well as environments with new enemies. Don't look for a memorable story, but instead enjoy the spirited action present in all Borderlands games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I guess that since I now have over 340 hours on Borderlands, I ought to write a review for it.  As you can guess, yes, I recommend it.  It's a really good First Person Shooter and plays well even today (2016).  If you're wondering whether you should play this before Bordlerlands 2, I'd say yes.  It's not mandatory.  But, with what happens here, it will make the story in Borderlands 2 even better.  There are some quirks (i.e., small bugs) with the game though.  But, since it's long out of maintenance, we just have to live with them.  Probably the biggest I ran across was in the multiplayer area:  the microphone doesn't work well.  We worked around this by turning the microphone off in the game and using Steam's Friend voice chat instead.As to whether or not it's a good deal, well, I see that it currently lists for about $20 barebones and about $30 as a GOTY edition.  That's crazy talk.  Wait for a sale or buy a Steam code for it somewhere else.  I picked up a GOTY edition for a bit less than $9.  Of course, given that I've played over 340 hours so far, it really doesn't matter how much it cost:  it was worth it.BTW:  the last playthrough of just the base game took me about 55 hours.

												Lets put it this way. What do we want from an RPG game ?  A massive world with hundreds of quest, a detailed power / stats system with unique character classes. Nice bossfights ,fun leveling system, lots of loot and long-term replayability. This game offers all of these things PLUS ITS MULTIPLAYER. And while in voice chat with your friends you can play this game for 1000 hours with awesome DLC's and Playtrough system. It's one of my favourite RPG's even though its kinda old. Pros:- Massive world- Around 250 fun quests- Bazillion weapons / gear- Unique artstyle and designs (For characters and enviroment)- 4 Very fun and unique classes - Very impressive gameplay and fun shooting- Great leveling system with multiple playtroughs- Lots of content and endless playtime- Nice and satisfying sound effects and voice acting- Great presentation- MULTIPLAYER ! Cons: - Weak story- Lack of music- No mini-map (is a lot frustrating then you might think of)- Lots of bugs and stupid game mistakes- Some missions are repitive and boring- Unfair situations (f.e : flying bosses when you are playing melee berserker)- Second wind system should be a bit less forgiving.Overall Score:  8.5 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In nerdy terms, it's pretty hopeless. The bosses are a pushover, the guns are all over the place; some useless, others ridiculously powerful. It's a team coop game, but you have to stick with the same team all the way through, thanks to the rubbish levelling system and mission flags. Baddies are initially rather difficult but after a few missions way to easy to defeat for the rest of the game. There are no field of view settings so on widescreen it looks like you are viewing the world through binoculars....the list goes on.......so it's no wonder that Borderlands didn't get rave reviews.  But despite all the problems, it's a brilliant game! The music, atmosphere and sheer playability are second to none. The comic book style graphics are fantastic. And get the Game Of The Year too, because the DLC are great. The Underdome is so much fun it’s absolute must have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the 2nd oldest game I still play on a regular basis. Borderlands is a game about 4 ""Vault Hunters"" who traveled to the planet ""Pandora"" to find an alien treasure known as ""The Vault"". Each character has a certain ""special"" skill and 3 different skill trees. Each skill tree supports a different playstyle depending on the character you're playing as (EG: Stealth, Medic, Tanking, Pistols). PROS: Each character is fun to play with several diverse ways to play Countless guns Funny side characters DLC adds a lot of content to the game Great soundtrack Lots of questsCONS: Once you've beaten the 2nd playthrough, you can't start a 3rd playthrough on that same character (you can complete side quests where all enemies, DLC quests, and weapon drops scale with your level, but the rewards from quests don't scale with your level.) A bit outdated by Borderlands standards, but still very fun to play If you're using a mic on Multiplayer it's either always on or always off, no ""press to speak""Overall, I'd give it a 8.5/10.

												Borderlands is a pretty great game; an even better co-op game. Amazingly good for the brain-dead gaming sessions whilst listening to music or podcasts. The story of borderlands isn't anything spectacular, it's not something I cared about whilst playing, however there are some charming characters to be found within. Aesthetically the game sports stylistic comic book-esque graphic that not only look great, but is a nice change from graphically realistic games. Soundtrack is stronger at some points than at others, overall it's generally decent. As far as being a first-person shooter goes, borderlands does most if not everything right, and let me say this now; reloading whilst sprinting is a godsend. Not only did I enjoy the combat but the loot system is great, always nice to find a better gun, and well guns are pretty much Borderlands' thing. I highly recommend buying if you have the friends to play it with.Those interested in buying the GOTY edition can see individual DLC reviews below;The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - The Secret Armory of General KnoxxMad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you were like me and was wondering if you should play Borderlands 1 before the rest of the franchise...Yes, absolutely, yes. It's an amazing introduction to one of my favorite franchises ever. Trust me, you will not appreciate borderlands 2 nearly as you would if you played Borderlands 1, first. The world is so atmospheric with a clear inspiration from Mad Max.Yes, it will take some patience as playing this game may seem almost depressing knowing that Borderlands 2 is available to you. But, yes, this game is definitley worth completing in order to get a true sense of the franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

huuntz huntz huntz - check me out!PROS+ It was GOTY 2009.+ The graphics, like every other game of the franchise, make me feel like its a timeless game. Played in 2017, and it never felt being a 8 years old game.+ The mecanics of the game are great.+ Fantastic Co-op game.+ Sense of humor!+ Hundreds and hundreds of guns, a huge variety.+ Wide variety of missions.+ Completionists have some dozens of hours in this game.+ Skilltree, perks - everything a rpg fan likes.+ Good Story.CONS- Mini-map would be usefull sometimes- Some bugs here and there, almost every in the environment but never in missions.- Saving system sometimes gets a little buggy when playing co-op. Had to repeat a couple missions.OVERALL 9.2/10 - A timeless game! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a FPS Action RPG game set in a planet called Pandora.You're a Vault Hunter, a mercenary that arrived on the planet seeking a place called The Vault. During your journey to riches beyond imagination, you'll have to stop and help the locals with their silly and insignificant problems, it's not like it takes much of your time and in exchange, they do help you get closer to your goal. Like in most RPG (and actually not many FPS) you have classes, skill trees, levels and more guns than you can carry... Or count. A must play experience for any Joplly Co-Operation fan and an absolute must play game for any FPS lover. It's funny, you know, I mean, the p... No, never mind, you'll see for yourself.★★★★☆ | Liked it ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most addictive games I've played. The first couple of hours, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot."" After that, though, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot, and I don't care.""It's a great shooter. It's a great RPG. The ""87  Bazillion Guns"" promised in the trailer are fantastic. I love the variety. A big part of what makes you want to keep playing is the desire to see what kind of weapon you find next.The ending was... an ending. Not much more to say there.Bottom Line: If you're only into really story-rich games, maybe this isn't for you. Everyone else should play it.EDIT: I've now played the DLCs, and I don't love them.The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned features irritating undead enemies, including birds (so grab your shotgun), but I did like the ambience.Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot seems to be all about arena combat. I didn't play that one for long, because that's not really my thing, but it was well done for what it is. I HATED The Secret Armory of General Knoxx because it covers an enormous area, and no matter what progress you've made previously, you always start at the beginning location. Don't get this one unless you intend to play it in one sitting.Claptrap's New Robot Revolution is the best of the four. If you're just going to get one, get this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns, more guns, and yet more guns... if you have an insatiable need to shoot things and sift through hundreds upon hundreds of dropped items, in the hopes of finding that one rare gun that's marginally better than the one you already have, then this is most definitely the game for you. Oh, and it's pretty dang fun too. Borderlands is a sci-fi loot-fest shooter set on an alien planet. You play as one of 4 ""Vault Hunters"", on a quest to find and open a mythical vault that may or may not hold untold riches. Each of the characters has one unique special skill, plus a set of strengths and weaknesses (better in one weapon type versus another, etc). Unfortunately you can only pick one character at the start of the game, so if you want to try different characters out, you'll have to start multiple games. That kind of sucks, but it's not too big of a deal ultimately, and adds incentive for multiple playthroughs (if you are into making that kind of time investment). The shooting mechanics are pretty good and it's cool how many different types of weapons there are. It allows for tons of experimentation and variety. Gameplay basically consists of discovering a new area, collecting a bunch of quests that need to be fulfilled (though many are optional), completing said quests, getting more loot, leveling up, and proceeding to the next area. Rinse and repeat. Even though that might sound slightly boring on the surface, I assure you it is not. The game mostly stays fresh throughout and the writing is pretty good, bordering on laugh-out-loud funny at times (the game doesn't take itself too seriously). And oh yeah, there's a cute little robot named Claptrap... 'nuff said.There are a number of DLC campaign add-ons available as well. I believe all of them come with the GOTY edition, but if you don't have that version, I'd say it's worth picking them up after completing the main story (except maybe the Underdome DLC, which I haven't played), assuming you enjoyed the base game. In summary, if you like games with a cool sense of humor that involve first-person shooting things and/or lots of loot drops and weaponry, pick this up. It has a great style, good mechanics, and enough content to keep you occupied for many, many hours. A-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Borderlands is a First Person Shooter, which has very witty humor, a great story, and at times a very challenging level system. Because this game is now rather “old” (seeing as it’s 2014) a lot of the mechanics and quest-style will reflect that age. But if you can overlook that, you will undoubtedly enjoy this game.-Long Winded Review-Hail Vault Hunters!  I will try to organize my review into sections, if you want a short review, look at my conclusion, if you’re interested about a certain part of the game look up the specific section, hopefully this will be useful instead of annoying. I hope my review will be useful to you.Introduction: (you can skip if you don’t care)I'm a firm believer in “gamer loyalty”, so I wanted to play borderlands so that I got the bonus stuff in borderlands 2. So I came into the borderlands backwards, started with the second, then played the first.So naturally there’s a risk doing something like that… you’re basically playing the higher quality game first, then moving on to an older one. It’s like if you played Mario Galaxy and then went back to the N64 Mario games. Analogy aside, you need to appreciate a game for how it plays to play a game in that way, and I do.Story-Review: (spoiler free)Something I have always liked about the borderland games is its story, and weather you’ve played the first or second borderlands, trust me, the story is excellent, the second expands on what has been done in the first, but you don’t need to play the first to understand it! (That is good game design if I’ve ever seen it.)The story has humor, drama, and twists and turns. Not only that but if you get the DLC you can to continue the fun with some side stories of your favorite (or new) characters in the borderlands!One final comment about the story, after playing through borderlands, I understood things a whole lot better in the second game, just because you have a foundation, and it give that whole “coming back” nostalgia feeling too it in the second game.Combat: (pew pew pew)I played at least a little bit of each class in this game, but I ended up leveling Mordecai, (Because I tend to prefer the sniper play style), although I played as Mordecai, I found myself testing out many different types of weapons. The initial thing that attracted me to borderlands was the concept of having guns that had different stats and abilities. (And believe me, they have many.)Choose between a high attack weapon, with terrible accuracy, or high accuracy + low damage + burst fire while zoomed. There really is unlimited potential to the types of weapons out there, the best is when you get weapons with unique abilities like bullet ricochet.Achievements: (I like achieesements, if you don’t – skip this)I know not everyone cares about this in a game, but for those that do, I have soloed most of the achievements in this game however there are plenty that you will need a friend to get. I intend to finish them out, but most of the ones left require some heavy grinding. It’s a very fun game that you get most achievements for just playing through.Anyone who’s spent much time going after achievements there’s just that point in the game where you’ve gotten all the easy achievements and everything else require grinding out the work or farming until you get those last few achievements. I still recommend this game even if getting several of the achievements is a headache.Final thoughts:Whether you get this game for the shooting, the story, the multiplayer feature, the classes, or the achievements, I recommend this game for anyone who is wanting to play a FPS in a more “quest” oriented story, even if you started out playing the first, it’s not that rough at you to go backwards into the borderlands, you’ll be glad you did. Fair warning, when you start out it does require a bit of work to get the hand of (or it did for me) but you can do it once you catch up in levels and gear.Best of luck, see you in the Borderlands Vault hunters!------Edits and updates------Borderlands 1Edit/Update September 18, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for  Borderlands 2Here's the URL to see my review for  The Zombie Island of Dr. NedHere's the URL to see my review for  Mad Moxxi's Underdome RiotHere's the URL to see my review for  The Secret Armory of General KnoxxHere's the URL to see my review for  Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Get this game and get stuck in hours of massive gun battles, some smooth questing and leveling up for you to sink your teeth into! I'm keen on the graphics and going the route of different rather then normal in gameing these days. A fresh breath of air when it comes to Borderlands and the extent put into making this game one of the best out there to date. I got the game on sale for $4.99 which made me finally buy the game but for full price it is still worth it!Game Rating: ***** 5.0 out of 5.0			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a really (really) good action game with rpg elements.In my opinion it would be best if you explored the game treating it as a rpg and not really an action game like other action fps(like counter-strike or even call of duty games).Can't wait to purchase the dlc's as well in order to completely explore the entire game.Pros : 1)Extremely fun storyline(jesus christ so much craziness),2)Easy to use customization,skill-trees,skills,3)Rpg elements that motivate you to build steadily your own character,4)Action elements so that even when you finish the game you can easily fight alongside with your friends,creat incredible strategies and have tons of fun,5)Incredible cel-shaded like toonish visuals,awesome musical effects,voice actors andCons: I didn't really find and serious con that would make me stop playing the game.Only thing that makes me a bit disappointed is the overpriced dlc's.P.S There ain't no rest for the wicked ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like any RPG, there are quests galore to complete for items, cash and experience, and the more of these you complete, more areas of the game will unlock. All quests can be completed in single player, although two players on the same system works just as well, as does three or four people playing together via the internet. All quests offer a set number of experience points, but experience gained through monster kills depends upon the level of the character and the level of the monster he is slaying - more experience for tougher monsters, and little or no experience for very weak monsters when your character is far more powerful.The art style is amazing, I know a few people who were put off by the cell shading look but once you're in game it all makes sense and the game wouldn't look right any other way, the characters are varied enough and some of the enemies are downright hilarious, shotgun toting midgets who fly back from the recoil when they fire at you are just one of the neat animations that this game is filled with.The storyline is a bit faint, your dropped into the game with the overall target been to find 'the vault' but there are hundreds of missions to do as you go through each area, most areas finish with a boss and some of the boss fights are pretty interesting (Boss's tend to drop their weapons after you fight them which is nice).

												Gosh I haven’t done a review in a while. Like others say and how obvious it is with the intro and trailers, Borderlands is a game about 4 ""Vault Hunters"" who traveled to the planet ""Pandora"" to find an alien treasure known as ""The Vault” With the hours played I have finished the whole game with a friend and I really don’t know what to say. It has an MMo feel to it (skills unlock and many quests to get with a massive world), personally I find the art style of the game very attractive and unique and very glad I have this game within my library. I feel it has become a “classic game” for its originality and style as well as creating a vast universe within their games. Borderlands as a series is a game that I feel is even more fun with friends and should be at least experienced by all. The enemies, the quirky characters, the weapons and the story give this…feel from a game that I can’t just explain in words. I hope this helps and good hunting Vault hunters!!A solid 9/10!!

												This is the third time I've finished Borderlands, recently I've purchased the second game and so I wanted to go back, way back. Also not to long ago I've finished Tales from the Borderlands which became one of my favorite games and got me more interested in the series.Borderlands is a great first-person shooter with role-playing character progression, it can be played solo or up to 4 player co-op online. The original title used GameSpy servers for multiplayer modes. As a result of GameSpy's shutdown in 2013, 2K Games patched the game and moved the servers to Steam, as well as providing Steam-versions of the game for those that purchased the title through retail channels.The art style still looks good: #1, #2, #3. Also the soundtrack is great, just listen for a while.Next up for me is the DLC from the first game, somehow I never played any of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great...For Its TimeConsidering the release date (2009), I imagine this game was top-tier for its time. Borderlands is unique, it's funny, it's got balanced classes, and a great new mix of FPS-RPG. It was fresh...in 2009-2011. However, I can't recommend this game to players who are used to the streamlined gameplay mechanics and witty dialogue that its successors possess. I tried picking this up three times. It's very hard to get into after playing Borderlands 2. Unless you're a masochist...or a really dedicated fan of the series and wanna finish it just to say you did.There are a lot of flaws in this installment that was addressed in the latter games. For instance, you're given quests to do only to run all the way back to turn in and fetch another quest—and tedious sidequests are mandatory if you don't wanna insta-die to mobs three levels higher than you. But if the mobs are one level higher, they're suddenly no match for you (doesn't make sense). For a game that's supposed to be open world, it plays very linear. Many quests are hard in the worst possible way: mobs are difficult—not because they have challenging mechanics—but because they come in swarms and they have massive health pools. That gets boring really fast. There is no ammo sharing, you have to manually pick up eeeeverything, no mini-map (you have an incomprehensibly broken compass), and there are rarely any voice-overs. The world feels as bland and lifeless as its sidequests—don't expect the vibrancy of Pandora that we see in Borderlands 2 to be here. It ain't there.For its time, it was brilliant and fresh. For now, where quests no longer feel like chores, it's deeply flawed. I see why some fans of this game don't like Borderlands 2—it's sillier and full of memes and pop culture references (which I enjoy). It's rough around the edges but I'm glad I played this because I appreciate the sequels that much more.If I played it first, 8/10. But I didn't so—4/10 (I'm sorry ;~;).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderland's biggest problem is that it's a loot game that actually OVERWHELMS you with loot, then gives you a pitifully disorganized mess of an inventory system to deal with it all.It's easy to fall into the familiar grind of stopping every few minutes to check the gun you just found against the guns you already possess to see if you've happened upon a small incremental upgrade. While this type of gameplay is inherent to many loot games, Borderlands' poor systems slow this whole experience to an insufferable crawl.It's a shame, because Borderlands is the type of world I could easily get immersed in, were it not for its constant need to scream LOOOOOOOT in your face all the time. There isn't a single corner of the vast open world that isn't stuffed with some variety of loot box, and each one has a bright shiny GREEN LIGHT that sticks out like a sore thumb in the brown and yellow tones of the world. This is intentional, because Borderlands really really wants you to care about loot. It wants you to loot everything, and you will spend more than half of your time in the game opening boxes for weapons, ammo, and cash, really for no other reason besides the fact that it's just so ♥♥♥♥ing GREEN and IN YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME. You could easily get through the game by looting 20% of what you find, and yet you will have your psyche exploited by the mechanic as you run around everywhere and loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot lootIf it were a well-designed mechanic, it might be a perversely enjoyable activity, the way it sort of is in better loot games like Diablo. But like I said, the game's biggest sin is its inability to let you manage the loot in an efficient way. It can't be overstated how cumbersome and unhelpful the whole loot system is. You can see a gun's specs hovering in front of you before you pick it up, but it will only represent whether its stats are better or worse than the gun you are currently holding, and only as vague up or down arrows signifying better or worse. The problem with this is that comparing a rocket launcher you've found to the pistol you're holding is strategically useless. Even if you ARE holding a launcher, HOW MUCH better or worse the stats are isn't visible, since your equipped gun's stats are hidden. What this works out to in practice is picking up every gun you see and going through your entire backpack every 5-10 minutes to slowly figure out what's worth keeping. Alternatively, you can ignore many loot drops, but since the game's common-uncommon-legendary-exotic-whatever classifications are pretty arbitrary, a relatively common green drop might outperform your rare yellow drop, so it's advantageous to always, always check. This becomes very, very dull.This might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it affects you constantly. Even the inventory menus themselves make no sense at all, and figuring out how to compare and even equip weapons is dumbfoundingly illogical to new players.It seems like it would have been so easy to design a system wherein the SMG you just found is instantly compared to the best SMGs in your backpack, all displayed visually next to one another in the game world. It's as if the devs knew that most of the loot you find is garbage and weren't really expecting you to think too hard about it, which undermines the entire point of the game.The bottom line is that Borderlands makes the whole process of finding better guns and becoming stronger a tedious pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It's just not fun. And it's a shame because the variety of Borderlands' weapons are what makes it so special compared to other shooters.Mechanically, as a shooter, Borderlands is just okay. I found precision weapons to be a chore to use, since your screen ""flinches"" too often to get steady beads when you get shot at, and the RPG nature of accuracy means your shots will often miss even when the reticle is lined up correctly. There are too many charging-type enemies (read: zero AI) that require you to jump backwards while shooting as the only effective strategy. Each class' special skill feels very underpowered and aren't that fun to use. And on a whole, animation is stiff and jerky which makes predicting enemy movement pretty hard. The guns do look, feel, and sound good though, which helps a lot.Challenge-wise, it's a purely mathematical level-based RPG, where missions over your level are hard as nails, and missions underneath you are cake walks. There is so much XP to earn though, especially with the DLC included, that it's very easy to only focus on missions that are at or below your level, which makes the entirety of the game very easy. I was vastly overlevelled for the last third of the game, which wound up being a good thing since I was so bored of it by that point.The story is barebones, interesting NPCs are sparse with practically no recorded dialogue, the enemy variety is lacking, the missions are mostly stale fetch quests, the vehicles are garbage, and there is a lot of backtracking required through areas you just cleared to go turn in said quests.It's actually a pretty miserable experience the more I think about it.Fortunately, a boring, lonely game like Borderlands is much less boring and lonely with friends. Kind of the way I imagine working an assembly line would also be less boring and lonely with friends.UNfortunately, I wound up completing the campaign solo since I couldn't find anybody to play with. (I can safely say that my Borderlands 2 co-op experience was superior.)Borderlands doesn't hide its multiplayer focus, with certain cutscenes referring to you as a group even when you're playing alone, and class-specific items dropping that you can't use, and better loot only accessible when you're with other people.I invested 48 hours into this product, giving up in the DLC playthroughs when I realized certain achievements required either heavy grinding for lucky drops or a second playthrough to finish. Also, I was bored senseless. It's hard to explain how someone can choose to not recommend a game they put that much of their life into....but just because I wasted my time doesn't mean I suggest that YOU waste YOUR time.Why didn't I stop? The answer is that while Borderlands is mostly a pretty below average game, it taps into gaming compulsions very successfully. It includes literally hundreds of quests to check off, one of which is ALWAYS displayed on your screen. No single quest takes particularly long, and there are always multiple quests to do in your area, so bouncing around from one to the next ""just to get them out of the way"" is an easy loop to get trapped in.Borderlands also features the operant RNG schedules inherent to the genre (read up on behavioral psychology in gaming), which means that every loot crate opened is a wild card chance at something good. I don't think it's designed maliciously, and one could argue that it's a generous game with its loot, but it's the type of system that will hook gamers no matter how bored they feel with the actual core gameplay.In conclusion, as this has been an intensely negative and long review, there are a few good things I want to mention.:D GOOD THINGS! :DSome of the voice acting feels really natural.The writing can be clever sometimes.It's relentlessly depraved.The arid atmosphere can be immersive.The art style is gorgeous and highly detailed, especially manmade constructions and signage.The whole game has lots of personality, from NPCs and bosses to cutscene direction and dialogue.You can shoot crazy midgets sometimes.

												Best FPS/RPG game ever.Not that hard to play, you just need to understand how the game works, pretty big map exploration, 2 gameplays, a lot of tricks including easter eggs.Definetly the game I enjoy yhe most to play.DLC's are amazing, at least 3 of them, Moxxi's Underdome is just an arena, not some bonus content, and it takes a lot of time to finish all 6 of them. But would recommend them all definetly.100/100!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the... DRM-free version of this soon after it came out, around 2010. Now I've completed it again for the achievements. The graphics haven't aged well. While not utterly terrible by today's standards, they get tiresome quickly. The cel-shaded style has not stood the test of time here, perhaps due to how ""dirty"" and ""rusty"" everything is supposed to be. The core gameplay is fun though, definitely worth giving it a go. In terms of design, Borderlands is a piece of gaming history. Not a big piece mind you, not deserving a chapter of it's own but at least a big footnote. For maximum enjoyment I suggest just going through the main story and ignoring the DLCs. If you're a lore- or achievement-completionist you'll need the DLCs but then be ready for tedium and even worse writing than the main game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some aspects are better than in the second game. The weapons look less like toy guns and more like actual guns. The random loot is more useful. The main story is way weaker, but I enjoy the DLCs more. Overall, if you want the ""hardcore"" loot-grinding-FPS gameplay, there is no reason to pick this over the second game, since it is superior regarding the core gameplay. But if you just wanna do some casual shooting n' looting on Pandora, this one is just as good, sometimes even better.If you have a weaker computer, or a lesser budget, yet still want the ""borderlands vibe"", then this game is for all intents and purposes, the same as the second.

Classic shooter with the most guns EVEREven after all these years, the original Borderlands feels like a true classic, playing it like coming home - even for a short time - to a well-known spot. The story is more than decent, although a bit drawn-out: you're a vault-hunter, lookng for the ultimate prize on a most inhostible planet, Pandora. You make progress through the vast landscapes of the planet, fighting lots and lots of monsters, bad-guys, and some VERY badass bossess (they're even labelled as such!). The actual fighting and shooting is extremely well done: every gun, every type of weapon has a great ""feeling"" to it and firing it is very satisying.But there is more, much more to Borderlands. First of all, there are literally thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands of guns waiting to be looted. The game makes use of a random-generated drop-system, with ligher level enemies dropping more interesting and more unique loot. These are devided into several colours, with white being the most common ones, and going right up to purple and very rare green items. This system just works perfectly for me: it's so satisfying to keep on fighting, just hoping for that even better gun to drop.But Borderlands is not only a very well crafted first-person shooter, it's also a RPG up to a certain extent. There is some sort of levelling-system which gives you action points, to be invested in better skills. You can also choose from four quite different classes at the beginning of the game, and having played each of them, I can say that all four have a unique feel to them. This really augments the singleplayer experience! As for multiplayer, it's almost - but not quite! - dead by now, but you really want this game for the immersive, action-packed singleplayer. Highly recommended!Gameplay: 25/30Graphics: 16/20 (shell-shaded and very atmospheric, but sometimes a tad dull, brown and grey)Sound: 7/10 (I like the totally different gun-sounds, but ambietent sounds could have been better)Replayability/longelivety: 14/20 singleplayer has really tons of gameplay, potentially you could play four times as each class)Technical/stability: 18/20 (very smooth experience, tons of options to scale according to your rig)Overall: 80/100Played on a Intel Core2 Duo @2,66 GHz; Radeon HD 5850 & 4GB RAM			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game Time as of this review: about 114 Hours Achievements: 80 / 80 — Some good humor in some spots in the game, especially in the Knoxx DLC. Wacky characters and some funny references. — It feels pretty satisfying to melt enemies and bosses with insane amounts of bullets. Ammo is abundant in the world, especially when you can cheat the RNG making it so you always get bullets for the weapon types you want. After a while, bullets become unnecessary if you use an Ammo Regeneration mod, making it less annoying since you don’t have to keep looting it. — Looting is this game’s major annoyance. Press a button to loot an item, and then repeat the process for each other item scattered on the ground. Certain enemies, like bosses, drop a ton of stuff, making it so you’ll spend most of your time in Pandora looking at the ground and looting. You can hold the loot button to execute an area loot, but the range is extremely short and you inventory is very small, meaning you’ll stop being able to loot items after half a dozen of these, at best. — The loot/weapon system is a mess. Weapons have a huge array of variable stats, including shooting speed, magazine ammo capacity, inventory ammo capacity, damage per bullet, bullet accuracy, bullet lag (I’ll come back to this one later) and elemental damage. The first time you play through the game, you obviously won’t have any idea of which elements are effective against each type of enemy. Making things worse, you can only equip four weapons at once (late game, 2 weapons early game), meaning you will also spend a lot of time swapping guns every time you enter a different area. No, you don’t get to use your favorite gun all of the time. It just doesn’t work. Also, seeing as your inventory is very small even after fully upgraded (by saving Claptraps) most of it will be filled with guns of various types and elements that you will need, making it so you have close to zero inventory space for loot and have to keep running back to vending machines to sell your crap. Loot rarity is also mostly non-functional, since, thanks to randomly assigned bonuses, it is possible for the crappiest low level weapon be stupidly good until 20 levels later, due to RNG. — Bullet lag. That’s right. Some genius at Gearbox thought it was a good idea to make each type of gun have a different bullet lag. If you shoot a medium distance object with a rifle, it will take way longer that it’s supposed to for the bullet to reach it. Even with a sniper, it’s near impossible to hit a non-stationary enemy at long distance. And forget about hitting moving targets with SMGs, unless you’re literally on their faces. What were they thinking, honestly. — Quick Travel is a blessing, but it’s not present in the Knoxx DLC, which by coincidence, has Kilometers of highways and makes you travel for a long time every time a mission asks you to go somewhere (very often). Also the missions tend to be repetitive and sometimes you have to kill every boss in an enemy base every time you get a mission to do anything in said base. Also, having to go through the base game twice and then going through all the DLCs to reach the level cap. Also, weird level sync where monsters are always 2-3 levels above you making them excessively hard to kill…… — Heavy Texture popping, especially after loadings, collision detection problems, where a small rock or piece of metal on the floor will bring you to a grinding halt, which means certain death against most bosses. — Most achievements involve hours of mindless grinding and some are virtually impossible unless you use exploits or design flaws. And even then the Coliseum achievements take several hours of uninterrupted play. — Multiplayer scaling is weird, making every enemy have several times more health, meaning that unless you and the other players are always focusing fire, each individual enemy becomes near-impossible to kill, unless you have infinite ammo or an ammo regen mod. So there you have it. There’s no doubt the game has a lot of problems. I haven’t found time to start on Borderlands 2 yet, but I trust many of these issues are no longer present in the sequel. That being said it was a fairly poor first attempt taking into account that we’re talking about Gearbox.

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | *2* 3] = ~62% (50%-75%)A pure shoot-and-loot game. Even though this review is mostly for Borderlands 1, it applies to all three, so I copied it to all three. Since the games have been out for quite a while, there are convenient bundles with two or all three of them etc., make sure you check them out before purchasing.At first, I didn't get ""it"" and thought that the game sucks. I thought it was just a generic shooter (and once again with failed FOV - *sigh*) with gimmicky cartoon shader, very generic loot containers, guns with somewhat randomized values, and the super obvious fetch quest cliché.But then, a year later, I tried again - and I got ""it"". It's a well done generic shooter (whose FOV can be edited in a file) with an interesting fun-depressing otherworldly feel, cartoon shader, reliably balanced generic loot containers, a surprisingly powerful procedural weapons system, and simple quests that make you deal with all these things in various places and that give you some story background. What makes all this work is the whole that emerges from it. It's like acid music of the 1990s. The Roland TB-303 alone sounds boring, but if you use it right and let it play together with other stuff, it's a very powerful driver, and music history might remember you for it.I ended up buying and playing through BL1, BL2, BL The Pre-Sequel (which came out after 1&2 but whose story plays between 1&2), and almost all DLC. No regrets. It was not a perfect experience, but there's a reason I bought and played all three games, and the story didn't contribute much to this reason. It's just the mix of all the gameplay ingredients and - excuse me - the mindlessness of it. A simple but sufficiently deep shoot&loot trip that goes on for tens of hours. (According to howlongtobeat.com, roughly: BL1 20-60, BL2 30-80, BLps: 20-40)The quests become available over time, and you can choose freely which of the ones you soaked up into your quest management screen you tackle at which time. There's an indicator expressing how hard they will be for your current character level.I thought the procedural weapons approach would probably be stupid, that it would be e.g. just a bit more power or range. But no! There are many changing variables, even the weapon designs (and visual effects) change, fitting the weapon's character. Hunting / comparing for the best weapon and learning about where you'll probably find those and where rather not turns into a passion.WHAT'S WRONG?Too bad the inventory interface is not half as good as it should be. Well, at least you can mark weapons as garbage so that you can bulk-sell them once back at a vendor or machine, and you can even do a buyback for the identical price. But what complete idiot thought it would be a good idea to have the inventory interface move around incessantly? And you need to realize: You'll spend several hours with this interface, because comparing your guns is a core element of the game.Then there's the fact that the game will just forget where you have already killed people - they'll just be back on your next visit and loot containers will be refilled, you don't even have to die or reload/restart the game for this. This has upsides, of course, which would be why they decided for this, e.g. now you can keep grinding, and you can enjoy your new toys and your leveled-up character against old foes. It's rather important for balancing that you can't just wipe the world clean. But even though hypothetically, people would repopulate fortresses in reality, you will have to make yourself blind to the feeling that all you're doing is in vain, your actions leave almost no lasting consequence in the world. Just like in real life, right? Except in real life, you don't constantly whip the lands with powerful guns.What also sucks (but again makes sense, of course) is that you lose a lot of money whenever you die. There will be deaths, though, that are just unnecessary or unfair, or you might even get caught in a loop of dying, which maximizes frustration. This happened to me when I fought Wilhelm and didn't realize that I could just travel away via the obvious terminal. Why didn't I realize? I was mostly blinded by the fact that the arena is a place you can only reach by dropping in from a height that you can't jump, so you can't get out again. This clear message and the fact that I was still relatively new to Borderlands made me blind to the fact that there was an electronic exit right there.You can't save your game. At least it's not a classic campaign shooter quicksave that bakes every relevant world state detail into a nice file. Instead, you have your character profile which will change as you progress (e.g. incl. money loss from deaths; hint: If you Alt+F4 while you're still dying, nothing is lost.), and it's rather one of those ""general player state"" and ""checkpoint"" saves. On the one hand, this very character of savegame is a good thing: Checkpoints have the clear upside of getting you more involved and making the reality more real because you can't beat it into obedience by saving/loading at your leisure. The downside is: The game completely forgets everything but you. While fortresses have been repopulated when you revisit them even without loading, there are a few aspects of the world that stick - until you exit to main menu or out of the game and then continue playing, that is. It all couldn't revolve more obviously just around you. And there are the quite hard boss fights. Personally, I don't like boss fights, so ignore this paragraph as an actual negative, but I just find them stressful, and what others might misinterpret to be a sense of achievement in me is really just the relief that I managed to overcome this obstacle between me and more of the satisfying gameplay I want to enjoy. You know, like 1990s Eurobeat ""music"" (That I never liked.) where the painful hectic rap was the desert you had to endure before reaching the next fountain, making the refrain ever so slightly better than it actually was. The game does not have a whole lot of boss fights, but I had to throw everything into them and was often very frustrated when I didn't manage, because dying cost me a bunch of cash, and I had to start the fight completely from scratch.But Borderlands is fun. A well done shoot&loot world to forget yourself in.Not all Borderlands games have FOV settings, but with some config file editing, you'll always get what you want.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DRAn interesting mix of an Action RPG and an FPS.+ Loads of side-quests+ Well-balanced for both SP and MP+ Setting and atmosphere ('MURICA!)+ Memorable characters+ Humour+ Art style+ Loot (some items are viable for a very long time)+ Skill trees+ Replay value+ Soundtrack- Picking up multiple items is a chore- DLC achievements- Relatively weak story- It requires an external program to change the FOV- No manual saveREVIEWBorderlands is a FPS game with some RPG elements. A wise man once said: ""if Diablo and Battlefield had a baby, it would be Borderlands""*. This game combines the FPP and gunplay with level progression, skill trees, and tons of randomly generated loot.The action takes place on a distant planet called Pandora in the future. There are rumours of some treasure being hidden in a Vault. The player can play as one of the four Vault Hunters: Lilith (specialises in deception and elemental weapons), Roland (soldier), Mordecai (sniper and gunslinger), and Brick (brute, specialises in melee and explosives). Each of them is memorable and adds to the game's replay value. Nevertheless, the story is quite weak, especially when compared to Borderlands 2. Pandora is modelled after a post-apocalyptic world, with a number of futuristic elements. Its ambience is enhanced by the unique cell-shaded graphics, marvellous soundtrack, hilarious (in a good sense) voice acting, and sense of humour. 'MURICA!The gameplay revolves around shooting the bad guys in the face, getting their loot, and completing quests. There is a myriad of side-quests and even more weapons. Albeit the gunplay has been heavily consolised, it is fun to use all the guns. Apart from shooting, every character has a unique active skill and a skill tree. For instance, Roland can deploy a turret, which can be further upgraded to provide ammo and health to everyone nearby. Moreover, there are weapon proficiencies (bonuses for using each weapon type) and challenges to complete (e.g. scoring a certain amount of critical hits, collecting dollars, etc.). Apart from getting the loot from chests and enemies, one can also visit a few types of vendor machines. There are numerous open areas which the players can explore on foot or by car. There also is a fast travel system to navigate through them.There are a few nuisances. Firstly, picking up mutliple items at once has a very short radius, making it somewhat tedious to gather all the loot. Secondly, in order to change the FOV, one has to use an external program. The default FOV may work fine on consoles but it is not suited for PCs. And lastly, the DLC achievements require a huge amount of grinding and some of them are purely luck-based.In summary, Borderlands is a great game that can be enjoyed while playing solo or with friends. Its ambience and mechanics make it an outstanding title even now. I strongly recommend it.*Or something along those lines.P.S.

												Although offering considerably lesser amounts of content than its successor Borderlands 2, and having a couple of both technical and design flaws, Borderlands 1 still offers a great amount of content for a fair price. The best way of playing this game is with a full 4-man-squad - it does get kinda repetitive after a while when playing alone. My personal rating: 7.5/10, rising to 8.5 when playing in CoOp. Everyone who was too young for it when it first was released in 2009: Check it out! It's a classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've recently started playing Borderlands again after taking a short break, and in that short time it's made it's way in to my list of favorite games. It can be challenging, yet easy at the same time. But no matter what difficulty the mission is, it's rewarding and fun. With the exceptions of some of the DLC missions. A few of them are very annoying, such as Ned's Zombie Island's TK is alive! Brains series of missions, or the Clap Trap revolution DLC where you have to collect Clap Trap components. Other than that, Borderlands is amazing, and still holds up well with games today, and is easily one of my favorite games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a fan of the borderlands franchise, I can only recommend this game. The artstyle is very unique as well as the sense of humor (especially Claptrap). It has a very interesting plot, which will be continued in the second part of the franchise and a nice presequel.After finishing the main story and all DLCs, I can only recommend this great game with its DLCs (Moxxi's arenas were not that great, but the other three had some nice story and quests). It's a great game to play together or grind on your own.8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First time I played it on my friend's Xbox 360 when the game was released, and I was really impressed! I just wasn't expecting to see such a good game.It's a pretty simple FPS with hordes of enemies and petty basic RPG elements, but it's SO BRILLIANT!+ Atmospheric insane and dangerous world+ Nice art style and soundtrack+ Many jokes and funny situations+ Open-World gameplay and replayability+ A lot of challenges and side quests+ 87 bazillion guns+ 4 Playable characters with different skills and builds+ Online and LAN multiplayer (Thanks for fix after GameSpy's shutdown)+ Memorable characters, especially CL4P-TP, also known as Calptrap- Weak main plotThe main plot disappointed me a little bit, but you know what? I'm here to play the game not follow the story!It's still a GREAT game, and I recommend it for all*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. An excellent FPS is more like sci-fi FPS, that occur on world called - Pandora - and counts with a few RPG elements, since loot, to level up system. Is great! Graphically speaking could be a bit weired for some of you, i still remember the first time i saw a trailer and i was meh.. but i started liking the details, textures. Thanks to the cell shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.Before we enter Pandora we have 4 characters to choose - The Hunter, Soldier, Siren e Berserker - that are all great and in case you play COOP, is better each of you use a different class. then you have the lvl up system, you will gain XP when you the main, secondary quest, also doing the challenges the game offer is great way to rank up.  After you get your character, you are now good to enter in Pandora, and i must say is not a pretty place to be - laughs - lot of bad guys to kill and some weird dudes too. about the game difficulty, well is not too hard perhaps if you play solo some parts could be a little tricky but you will do it for sure. After beating the main boss you can do a new playthrough, there enemies/boss will be a bit tough, is like doing transition from normal to hard. If you are someone like me, who love loot you will love this game, loot everywhere. There are a lot of ways to get the better loot, farming boss, chase the safe etc.. Like in normal games loot has many categories - green, blue, purple, orange e pearlescent - and of course everyone wants that orange one! Also Borderlands has a huge variety of guns to choose, so you won't get bored of it. That's it, i totally recommend you play this game, solo or in COOP and enjoy your journey in Pandora. ~ 8,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like Fallout 4 but feel like it's ""meh"" due to it using Skyrim's engine/ just being boring at times? Have you played Destiny but absolutely hated its looting system engrams and want a better version of its loot system? Do you like goofy over the top jokes with crazy characters? This game is for you! Well... maybe. Borderlands is a great game and it takes time to get through, it doesn't feel like a game I could take bite sizes of and play here and there, it feels like a sit down and play whole title. This game leans heavily on its writing and characters, and without them, it would have utterly failed imo. This was a single player play through, so this is a review written by a lone experience. Here's some pros 'n cons!Pros:- Interesting cast of characters that are rememberable and unique.- The game will break the 4th wall but tastely and not rip you from the immersion. Great writing, and plenty of jokes that will actually make you laugh out loud, no lie. LOL- Looting weapons is great and it's nice to find some badass epic or legendary weapons not given by bosses.- Unique skill tree building will allow you to build your unique vault hunter the way you want to play them.- Does a great job making sure you feel like you're in a trashed planet with a bunch of scum bag bandits who can't write nor barely speak proper English. - Fun unique DLC that came w/ the bundle I got was fun and fairly more entertaining than the original game.Cons:- Long treks back 'n forth from quest boards to waypoints on the map.- Game is not fully optimized for controller support. All interactions will specify pc UI/button usage, and unless you've figured out the buttons and usage through the menu, you'll have a bad time. - This same Wasteland is nice, but also bad? It would have been nice for a change of scenery to be honest. Most of the game makes you feel like you're stuck wading through trash piles and barren, lifeless and dry/dead plains just to hope that the quest you've been treking across the map to get to will be fun and exciting.- by the 3rd quarter of the game weapons are unique in nature and have some cool effects, but the weapons you may have looted hours upon hours back are better than legendary loot? Kind of makes it feel like you're stuck with the same  ♥♥♥♥ for the rest of the game's experience. (Even the DLC)- Claptrap never SHUTS THE  ♥♥♥♥ UP ABOUT HAVING NEW QUESTS AT QUEST BOARDS OR PERSONNEL! More than half of these extra tagged on quests are lame, agrivating, and annoying to do. Mainly the ones where you have to build weapons from scattered parts only to cash the quest and get a  ♥♥♥♥   ♥♥♥ gun you'll vendor 2 minutes after cashing.- Menu for quests sucks in its organization and is hard to use since it doesn't work hand in hand with your map to figure out where you have to go. - No mini map.- Vehicle gets stuck one every little  ♥♥♥♥ing rock you accidently run over (or guard rail) and you are forced to get out, blow that stupid  ♥♥♥♥ing piece of  ♥♥♥♥ up and run your  ♥♥♥ the rest of the GOD DAMN WAY TO THE QUEST MARKER. UGH.Anyways, yes, this review had many faults to pros, but I honestly enjoyed this game. I'm currently still playing some of the DLC before continuing my venture in BL2 which imo is far better than the first in almost every way. If you start w/ BL2 I don't blame you, the first can seem boring, but not uninspired. The game lacks much, but if you play the second, trust me, you'll love the characters so much you'll want to play homage to the first game. On a scale one 1- 10, I'd give this sucker a 7/10. Good game, even great at times, but not without its set of issues. Good luck out there Future Vault Hunter! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Slower than the second game, the first incarnation is still eminently fun. Indeed, if you're looking for a good time with friends, you really can't beat the levity and wit of the Borderlands franchise. This first game has only very minor issues (and I'm nitpicking): co-op can be unbalanced with different rewards and disparate leveling at times (depending on what your build is, you can level up much more quickly than your mates). Besides that, rare gun drops are few and far between. Make sure you get the DLC as nearly all add to the fun, with the exception of the tedious Moxxi's Underdome.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enter a big world, where i had a lot to explore and show the enimies who has the biggest gun. At the beginning, the game is really easy, maybe a little bit difficult, since I  recognize which enemies i can take on und which not. After i cleared of the first and second area, i thought the game would now be very boring but lucky for me i was wrong.  Why? Because on the next step of the story, i met a lot of interesting new buildings, new characters and i had a lot of fun to explore the region also to compare the new weapons i found.Normally, a very good game and i enjoyed playing it, really, but there are more than one areas, where the enemies are fully overpowered and its very difficult to beat them. Fortunately it is more in the middle of the game and at the end. But even at the end i did not recognize what i had to do to beat the last big enemy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For you germans guys :Ich hatte sehr viel Spass mit dem Spiel, startete in einer großen Umgebung, wurde sehr gut mit der Steuerung des  Spiel vertraut gemacht und konnte völlig entspannt starten. Etwas schwierig fand ich es herauszufinden mit welchen Gegnern ich mich anlegen kann und mit welchen nicht. Naja, nachdem ich dann die ersten Karten erkundet habe, hatte ich schon die Befürchtung das es nun sehr langweillig werden wird und sich alles wiederholt.Glücklicherweise lag ich hier vollkommen falsch, da ich in den neuen Bereichen, die ich nach und nach freischaltete absolut beeindruckende Charaktäre, und auch Landschaften kennenlernte, die mich offen und sprachlos erscheinen ließen.Nicht weil es so ungewöhnlich ist, sondern weil das Spiel nun schon fast 10 Jahre alt ist und ich es beeindruckend finde was damals schon möglich war.Da könnten sich viele Spielehersteller eine ordentliche Scheibe von abschneiden. Jedenfalls hat mir das Spiel auf lange Sicht gesehen sehr viel Spass gemacht, einzig an einigen Stellen droschen die Gegnermassen derart auf mich ein, das es mir sehr schwer gefallen ist zu erkennen, auf welche Art und Weise ich dieser Gegnerübermacht Herr werden kann.Ganz besonders hat mir auch die Hintergrundmusik gefallen. Da macht es mir wesentlich mehr Spass Gebiete erneut zu erkunden, da es oftmals vorkommt, das in eigentlich abgeschlossenen Gebieten neue Aufträge freigeschaltet werden.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember reading about Borderlands. It sounded cool. Procedurally generated guns? A neat-looking world? Awesome. Then they made it cell-shaded, which was... well, weird, but fun. The resulting game? Pretty fun too. It's seared into my memory as nothing less than pleasant awesomeness. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun I had pretending to be someone's hat by riding around on top of their car in my own.I was the best hat.Finding a loot chest felt good. Spending time jumping around the maps felt right. The enemies were neat, the guns inventive, the bosses kinda fun. It took me a long while to kill the final boss--where a friend killed it in less than half a second. Okay, so I didn't get the best loot on the planet, but I still had a blast. The game was funny, too. While the actual plot could have been better, the story told in logs and lore was amusing, and the character barks were great.Where Borderlands really excelled, however, was the DLC. Doctor Zed was a minor disappointment, not because it wasn't funny (it was hilarious), and not because it didn't have a lot of content (it had a lot of content), but because some of the content was an awful lot of ""hey, go there, kill a thousand of that, bring me back some brains."" This got a bit old after a while. Moxxi's arena DLC was, well, an arena DLC. Not all that fun. But then, like a spark of inspiration from the gods, we got The Secret Army of General Knoxx, which had like twelve to fifteen hours of content, cost $10, was fun, well-written, smart, and excellent. It is still the gold standard for DLC. After that we got Claptrap's Robot Revolution, which was not quite as excellent, but we're talking Jaws to Jurassic Park here--still greats, regardless of which one you value more.Borderlands is still, years after its release, a game worth playing. I still know most of the maps by heart, still have memories of some of my finest battles ingrained in my mind. Still feel a bit odd when playing the sequel and not having Bloodwing by my side. You definitely don't want to just skip it and head straight for Borderlands 2.Only complaints? It wasn't a great PC port, so it had no FOV slider and used Gamespy for its online multiplayer component, meaning it was really hard to play with certain people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic shooter with some light class-based RPG elements. Game was designed with cooperative play in mind and this was done very well. Humor is well written into the story and can be quite snappy at times which keeps the story entertaining. Tons of replay value with the 4 different classes and multiple playthrough mechanics. Lots of loot too. Game is a very stylized shooter-looter where the player is constantly battling foes to aquire better gear and weapons as they progress through the story. 87 Bazillion guns!

												One of the best games I've ever played. This is the game that starts one of the best series of video games. And though this game isn't the series' pinnacle, it is definitely one of the best in there.Pros:Amazing humorCreative gameplayTONS of randomly generated gunsUnique characters with skill treesFun multiplayerAwesome DLC'sChallenging bossesInteresting plotCons:2009 graphics (which is expected since it's a 2009 game)Quite a few fetch quests (though not always plot quests)Repetitive dialogue (I know, the rakks got Jess)But I definitely recommend this game. The negative reviews were mainly from people going from Borderlands 2 to Borderlands 1, so you can assume that going from a new game to an older game would make you feel that the older one stinks, right? And if you buy the game, you should try to wait until Game of the Year edition goes on sale, because the DLC missions are really fun and usually adjust to your character level. Happy Vault hunting!

A game that sparked its own franchise - the craziness is addictive, exciting, funny... everything you need!Boasting solid co-op and single player action, it's not hard to see why Borderlands is (or was) a favourite for so many. While Borderlands 2 is often liked even more by the vast majority who have played it, this title still has a special place in my heart of heroism.The story is simple enough. You are a Vault Hunter - a title of some import in the game'ss lore - and you are hunting for a Vault on Pandora. Pandora is a world full of wild animals and bandits (and the occasional semi-sane person offering quests and the like) all intent on getting in your way and making life rough for you. As for the Vault... I think the hype for what's inside it has inflated the locals' expectations a bit. The promise of godly weapons, abilities, etc. You get the picture. Every bandit and his meat bicycle wants in, even though it only opens once every 200 years.Getting the Vault Key fragments is about what you'd expect - shoot lots of guns to kill lots of things. The descent into combat is made simple by convenient colour-coding, ranging from throw-away white-grade items to beautiful yellow and orange rare treasures (and even ultra-rare pearlescents if you have the General Knoxx DLC) that often have hidden abilities on top of their already impressive abilities, such as improved rate of fire, clip size or even the addition of elemental damage.The graphics style is cartoon-like, with black outlines around most every object. This is a good thing as it meshes well with the gameplay style and humour. It's even possible to change the field of view, if you are willing to invest a little time on the internet. Controls are not hard to get used to - as you progress you'll eventually be able to equip four weapons at once for quick switching, allowing you to focus more on combat and less on micro-management. Of course, with the game engine's random gun generator allowing for thousands of different weapons to spawn, choosing just four to equip poses its own problems! Even grenade mods can vary wildly - from rubber grenades that bounce around with no fuse, to cluster bombs, health stealing grenades and even teleporting grenades! Other equips include relics, shields and even class-specific mods that alter your specific character's skill set and abilities.The classes themselves number just four, but they each have their own special ability in combat that makes each of them unique and fun to play. Brick, Mordecai, Lilith and Roland each have Berserking fists, a pet bird Bloodwing, Phasing magic and turrets respectively, and with a grand total level cap of 69 the builds can get very powerful indeed. New Game + games will make it seem like you aren't powerful though, as everything scales to just a bit over what your current level is. It's still entirely doable.I've mentioned the humour briefly. There may not be much when compared to the sequel, but it's there. Some great dialogue includes:""Smokin' Jesus ♥♥♥♥♥ cinnamon! That is a monster!""""Never look at my fist, ♥♥♥♥♥!""""I uh, I hate to send you away, you're great company and all... but I, I gotta go take a dump. I gotta take a dump something awful! Something real awful! Oh.. never mind... it's gone now.""""That's the beauty of the undead - if you kill them they're just dead again, and I just fire up the mojo, and make them re-undead and they're back...""Brick's laughter and insane hooting noises during his special ability are a personal favourite.I probably haven't covered everything. If you love a good FPS (this game is more like a role-playing shooter) you'll give it a go and discover the rest of it for yourself anyway. Which I urge you to do. It's a game I'll definitely be coming back to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is the cult classic loot shooter, where the main goal is to kill stuff and collect guns and guns and even more guns.Borderlands takes place on a planet of Pandora where danger lurks around every corner, we play as the vault hunters who came to Pandora seeking a vault, a place that contains fortunes. You can pick from four different characters Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai The game is an RPG infused FPS. You run around killing stuff and looting chest for better equipment. The game is very fun and getting better equipment is also incredibly fun. The four characters you choose from have different abilities. Brick has berserk mode where he punches stuff and in rage mode regains health, Mordecai releases his pet Bloodwing which is a one hit kill on a random enemy in the battlefield or damages bosses, Roland puts down a turret which kills anything it sees and Lilith goes into phaselock mode where she goes invisible and after that releases a shockwave which kills or damages anyone around them. Each character is awesome but it's best to use the one to suit your play style the best.Graphics are awesome. The cell shaded look is awesome and even though some of the textures are mediocre this game is very appealing. The environments are very bland since all of them are deserts. I'm still very glad that the change from realistic to cell shaded happened.Audio is mediocre, I like some of the soundtrack but overall it's very bland. The gun sounds are awesome and everything but a lot of it is re used and some of the sound effects are quite bad.  Overall very mediocre sound design The game can get quite tough at certain points, some of the enemies are higher levels than you and will kill you in seconds. Your best option is to do every side quest to level so the later sections in the game aren't as tough.Level design is alright for the most part but some of the maps in the later sections of the game get really confusing. Overall it's okay for the most part.The main game itself took me 18 hours to complete everything with every side quest, with all the dlc it took me around 30 hours. The game also has tons of replay value, you can play Ultimate Vault Hunter and True Hunter which are more difficult versions of the game and you can also try the different characters and not to mention you can always play the game with friends which is a lot of fun.The game has one big problem. It's incredibly buggy. I've had many problems playing the game and DLC and constantly look for solutions to the problems I was having. Some of the issues were quests not showing up, I couldn't turn in quests. get stuck in the environments and fall through the levels. Overall there's nothing too game breaking and with enough time you could find a fix for the problems.Borderlands is a must play for everyone. To date this is one of my favorite games of all time. This game is incredibly fun and funny too. This is incredibly fun game and even despite the issues this is a must play for everyone. My suggestion is get the main game and skip the DLC's cause they're not very good but if you want more then sure go ahead and buy it but I suggest saving your money for Borderlands 2. This is a must play for everyone. I give Borderlands a 9/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've played it through with 3 characters and still playing.  The graphic style is unique.  It was easy to get used to on the PC, great control with mouse & keyboard.  Kudos to the writers, developers, and publishers.  I hope you guys keep pumping out more of this kind of FPS.

												Borderlands is a humorous, top-notch, first-person shooter. With a gorgeous art style, very well written text and a permanent feeling that the game does not takes itself too seriously, your first adventure in Pandora is bound to be a blast!Although the game is ""old"" by today's standards, it's visuals have aged nicely, mostly because of the art style. The gameplay is tight, controls are responsive, and the world itself is very interesting, albeit it is a bit too shallow for all it's ""openess"". The ending seens a little rushed, but other than that, this game is a good purchase.I recommend Borderlands and all it's DLC, with the notable exception of the Moxxi's Underdome, which is a terrible chore (seriously, avoid it).

												One of the best games I have ever played. Great story, tons of action and as the trailer says ,,87 bazillion guns"" I have yet to find more than two of the same gun! Very rewarding missions, epic feeling after killing an enemy that you really shouldnt be able to because you are underleveled. TONS of locations and enemies. Action packed, no joke the action never stops. A lot of achevements and weapon effects! The game is even fun after you finish it! You can choose to play it all again ( I recoment that ) with your whole inventory and level kept the same! 4 Player co-op is just the cheery on top! I don't think it would be as fun as it was playing it the first time with my friend! The one thing it does lack however is vehicles, it only has one (Or two if you count the rocket launcher and machine gun types different) and ofcourse you can customize the colour. But still the lack of vehicles in the game is not a setback. Also a good thing is that this game can run on a ,,potato"". I have a bad computer and I have no problem runing it on 60fps with medium settings. You might need to tinker with the resolution though. To sum up, if you like good story , grinding, epic missions and shooting everything you see, you will like this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is truly a classic. It brings in an innovative plotline, with twists, turns, and everything around. It also adds 87 BAZILLIONONDIEREST GUNS, allowing players to really shoot 'n' loot, and kicks a** in general.Plot:Borderlands isn't linear. You can choose your way through Pandora, and do whatever the crap you want. It has approx. 30hrs. of Singleplayer gameplay for ONE PLAYTHROUGH, and countless more for the 2nd playthrough, four characters and DLC maps. In addition, there are progressive enemies, scaling up so you're never bored!Graphics/Performance:Borderlands is widely regarded as gray, grey, brown and grey. While I agree, it does have some beautiful art, and amazing guns. It can run on the modest of computers (mine is 2GB RAM, and it worked well on low settings), but is also a monster on those 16GB Alienware computers. Lag is non-existent, and the stuttering you get from COD: Whatevercrap doesn't exist.RPG/Skills:Borderlands adds a plethora of things to the shooting genre; customize your character with skill points, and morph them into whatever builds you want! In addition, players can swap out elemental relics to customize action skils, and that decisions in-game result into different out-guns, largely allowing customization. The guns in-game truly allow personality, with four elements, and 8 different manufacturers.Really, Borderlands is a great game. While it isn't Borderlands 2, it's great for those on a budget or Borderlands fans. GET THIS GAME NOW! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's only one way I can describe this game so far.... and that is GUNS. Tons and tons of guns! This game is honestly just perfect. There's plenty of enemy variety and guns that your character specializes in that makes combat diverse and entertaining. The world of Pandora is yours to loot as you constantly keep searching for that better gun, and trust me, that itself is very addicting. I often find myself just running around looking for a new gun to blast some bandit's head off with. And the Eridian Weapons.... my god, the Eridian weapons. Ever wanted to snipe a Badass enemy with a bolt of lighting? Maybe you want to kill some Psychos with exploding energy balls? You can do all that and much more here. Many different elemental weapons provide an entertaining and brutal kill. If you like ANYTHING I just mentioned above, you need this game. It's mandatory. (And this is just the tip of the iceburg, there's much more to enjoy)EDIT: Now that I have more experience with the game I can safely say that eridian weapons are garbage. But they're fun to use in playthrough 1. I just got a bit overhyped about them when I first started out :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think I've started and restarted Borderlands about a dozen times since I first played it. I keep coming back to it because it's a solid game, but after a certain point it's so tedious that I don't want to play any longer. I'd first played it back before the first DLC came out, and I still haven't finished it.Borderlands is a good FPS. The art style is unique, the shooting is great, the weapon types are varied, and the randomly generated enemies and weapons keep it (somewhat) fresh. There are many missions (ranging from ""kill this"", ""survive them"" to ""push this button and kill something else""). The HUD and UI are laid out well. The four characters and their upgrade paths play differently enough that you can get a lot of replayability. But...Pandora is interesting and exciting. You get a backstory as you go along, if you're listening close enough. And you wonder what's being left out. Was it always such a s***hole? Or was it because the Dahl corporation released its convict labour when they pulled out? Because it looks like it's been falling apart for a very long time, and we're just the latest bad thing to happen to it.But...The characters are interesting. Their random banter fills in the void, and the mission text adds to the character of the world. The human enemies are varied, and so are the creatures. There's no one strategy that will get you through the game, you have to work at it, and see what works. Getting killed has a penalty (just money, really), but it doesn't slow down the game, and it is possible (at times) to get through an area by sheer attrition (though not in arenas and not against boss creatures).But at some point, it gets tedious.I hesitate to call it ""backtracking"" because it's a pretty open world (with a definite direction as you move from area to area), but enemies respawn when you travel back through an area that you've visited before. And I'm sure it's okay for folks wanting to ground out a few more levels, but it leaves me without a sense of accomplishment, because as soon as I move on, the bad guys will be back. I'll rush through areas and then rush back because I don't want to fight the same fight so soon after. In spite of that, I still come back to Borderlands, because it is a good game, and I keep wanting to see if I can find that next gun or shield, and if they'll be better than what I have now.Would I recommend it? Yes, I would. Borderlands is a solid shooter, and I expect it's a lot more fun for those who enjoy co-op (unlike me). And it's good fun even when you're on your own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For anyone coming from Borderlands 2 wanting to see where it all started here are a few pros and cons in comparison with BL2:Pros:- Much better loot system. Anyone who has clocked in enough time in Borderlands 2 will know that finding anything better than Green is fairly uncommon, but in this you will be find 10 times better and more varied loot and twice as often.- Fairer Scaling. The scaling in this game is Linear instead of Borderlands 2's Exponential, meaning that when you find a powerful weapon, it will be useful for much longer before having to replace it with a more powerful weapon.- Easier to run. Granted this is just due to it being older but even still, it's something I guess.- Cheaper. Again this is just due to it's age, but still, the GOTY is cheaper than the bsae game of Borderlands 2.- Backstory to Borderlands 2.- Able to play as Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai. Awesome NPCs, Awesomer Playable characters.- Modding ability. This game can actually have modded content, although it's not officially supported by the devs.Personal Opinion:- Different feel. This game has a more dark and serious feel than the second Borderlands game. Some people may like it, some may not.- All the Areas have the same look to them. Every area is either a desert-like area, run-down buildings or Atlas buildings, with the Zombie DLC and the final area being the only exceptions. Again this can be a matter of opinion.Cons:- Skill Trees. The characters skill trees aren't as fleshed out as in Borderlands 2, with the major gamechanger 1 point skills not being there. While i'm not in any way saying the skill trees are bad, they're just lacking something that Borderlands 2 has.- Voice acting. The voice acting in this game can feel very hit or miss at times, with some characters sounding cool, while others feel very flat and last-minute.- Animations. Same as above, some animations are good, while others feel robotic and basic.OverallWorth getting if you want to see where it all started, although as a first purchase in the Borderlands franchise, it's better going with number 2. Get if on sale and definitely get the GOTY.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without a doubt, one of the best ""Shopping Simulator"" games ever made.    Do you enjoy killing a bunch of things, picking up lots of ""loot"", then going to a shop to sell and buy approximately 4,678 times in the course of a 50+ hour gaming experience? Then this is the game for you.    If, like myself, you would prefer to only kill one type of enemy about, oh, 800 times over, rather than 8,000 times over, the preposterously lengthy and repetitive game-play might wear a little thin after a while. Personally, I enjoyed about the first 30 hours, and only kept going all the way to the end out of principle (having reached the point of no return).    And the best part of all? If killing the final boss isn't enough for you, the designers have kindly offered the opportunity for you to KEEP PLAYING, even though the plot is finished and the credits have rolled. But hey, you still have MILLIONS more enemies to kill and BILLIONS more things to pick up and sell. So why stop. EVER..?Think I'll give myself a slight rest before Borderlands 2. Don't get me wrong...this game has tonnes of personality, fantastic graphics, a great world, amusing characters, and enough good ideas for a good many games. But you really, really, REALLY can have too much of a good thing. And whatever you do, don't even HUMOUR the notion of tackling it single player. If ever a game needed friends with headsets, this'd be it. WAY too much brainless ""fun"" for one person to endure alone.Verdict: 7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off let me say, you do not want to play this alone. It's a much better time if you play it with at least one other person. Getting past that, this game is an odd gem. Released around 2009, this is a first person shooter/open world/rpg game with quite a bit of weapon variety across the 4 classes you can play as. You have (as I just mentioned) 4 choices, Lilith the support character, Roland the most black support gunner in gaming, Mordacai, the sniper with a cool bird that kills things, and my personal favorite, Brick, a bulky hamfisted guy with a bad temper. Each of these classes have ""action skills"" which are unlocked at level 5. Brick being able to go beserk and punch things, doing very heavy damage and recovering health. Mordacai being able to use bloodwing, a bird that homes in on enemies and does damage  no♥♥♥♥♥♥. Lilith, being able to phasewalk (don't ask me how that works, I don't play much of the siren). And Roland has his turret, which is very useful if you do decide to play alone. Moving on, the game itself is quite large, but the locations are level locked with the foes. So if you're level 20, going back to the start you will still fight the level 1 enemies there. Grinding is also a debatable issue, but it's not terrible in this case as there are plenty of side and main quests that will fetch you decent XP. The gunplay is what you would find in any other fps, exept this has more of a Halo feel to it due to the slight moon jumping and grenade physics. Another big part of this game is the driving, which feels amazing once you get used to the mouse sensitivity on the steering  unless your a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who uses a controller, then your sensitivty should be fine from the start.  Again, the driving goes to the Halo style of control, floaty yet tight turns where the camera controls the car. Now on to the gun variety. I think that the marketing strategy they pulled for this game (and the ones after it) of having billions of guns, is a lie. You may have quite a few guns, by quite a number of in-game gunsmiths, but they are mostly the same gun with slighty different stats and maybe a longer name or a model change. Guns also have elemental effects, as do your action skills, going from explosive to corrosion, they make fighting some enemies go from hard to easy, or the other way around. Moving away from that, the controls are tight and the keybinds are set just fine. Maybe it was just my game or my pc, but voice chat is a little iffy on my reciving end. All in all, is this a good game and worth the $20? Maybe. If you're looking to have a good time with a couple of your friends, then yes, by all means get this. In my opinion, this is the best game out of the current three. I also advise getting the DLC along with it, at least the one that increases your level cap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bite Size Review - BorderlandsThe Good:+The gameplay is solid, the process of getting new guns with cool attributes is addicting+Art style still holds up, even if the animations can be a bit stiff+Plenty of stuff to do, a lot of quests and enemies to shoot+Different classes to play and try out+High QualityThe Bad:-Quests can sometimes be ""get 100 items from fallen enemies"", can be a bit tedious, but they are not the main story quests which is good-Other than the main story quests, most other quests are not that interesting (no spoken lines)-Enemies fall into two types - those that are numerous and pop easy, and those that are bullet sponges, not that interestingThe Verdict:By now most people should know what Borderlands is. This game is really good, it's rough in some spots but the good really does out way the bad with this game. If you are looking for a better game though, Borderlands 2 is technically better in every way, but this game started it all, so I highly recommend it. It's fun, there is a tone to do, and you can't go wrong with this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun. This game is fun with three friends.As Left 4 Dead made Co-Op in this from popular, this piece of software nearly perfected it. The only big issue is the lack of a good story. Like in all Action RPGs (one part of this game) the missions are either about killing someone or about finding something. But how the game presented this is amazing! But you have to love such type of optic.So for all who have at least three good friends on Steam, who like the ""Just-One-More-Mission""-gameplay should really buy this game. And also all DLCs (beside the Moxxi-DLC, as this DLC offers no real story, just shooting in an arena).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Borderlands is honestly one of the best FPS games I have played in a while. Not only did it offer a great story line, but it enhanced the player experience through multiples quests, superb sound quality, and a unique graphic style that was very pleasing to the eye. Pros+  Large amount of quests (216 to be exact)+  UI was very user friendly and easy to follow+  Great game to play with friends, however... (listed in Con)+  An extremely large amount of weapons and gears available+  Sounds were very realistic and the music, while not the best, was sufficient+  Graphics were a huge plus (and based off of games that I've played, unique)+  Game play was challenging, but not too challenging where you couldn't progress+  Dialogue: usually I like to skip conversations, but these were too good to pass upCon-  Lack of a mini-map which threw me off (map available in inventory)-  A lot, a lot of DLC's required to make gameplay the best it can be-  Of course this is preference, but I found that this game was a lot more fun to play with friends; offers a fairly lackluster single-player option-  Be prepared for some glitches and bugs: While I did encounter a minimal amount, they were enough to make me rage. The one I came across, as I think many others have as well, was in General Knoxx's DLC. If you decide to loot the hundreds of crates instead of progressing through the quest, you will be barred from entering again (which means you will not be able to complete the quest). Quite silly how they don't allow more than 3 minutes (I think) to loot the cratesDespite it having been released awhile back, this game gets two thumbs up from me. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.Overall: 8.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it's not as good as BL2. So I highly recommend to play this game before its sequel. It has almost everything that it's sequel has, just not as good. If you play those two games in chronological order, you won't notice how BL falls behind BL2 almost in every aspect, except for the loot system, perhaps. I finished BL and all of it's DLCs and then I finished the BL2 main story and then I switched back to BL again to play it with my friend, but it just didn't feel that great anymore. The character development and the story felt slow and only after we reached the middle of the game did things start to happen and it was the fun fast-paced action-filled post-apocalyptic experience everyone is looking for!Don't get me wrong! It's a great game. One of the best FPS CoOps out there. It's just that you need to get pass level 10 to see its true glory.PROS:- beautiful, immersing and vast deserted world (similar to that of Rage or Fallout)- tons of various weapons (even more than in BL2 and without the limitations of what the combinations might be)- cool upgradable characters (although, IMO, the Soldier's skill tree makes him by far the best, and that's a shame, if you want to replay the game with another character)- cool unplayable characters- interesting story; funny jokes- lot's of easter eggs and secrets to explore- DLCs worth of purchasing (I would even say that they're better than the main game)NEUTRAL: less enemies to shoot, which means less action, but also more time for calm explorationCONS:- Moxxi's Underdome DLC is too hard, IMO- It's not possible to complete one of the side mission's in the Secret Armory of General Knoxx, because you can't access the location, in which it's located, although you could before- 3rd party account/software is required for CoOp- Level caps and it's not possible to unlock all the skills- Picking up loot and ammo just by running over it was introduced in BL2; here you have to do it manuallyOverall rating: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When something is called Pandora, you can bet your marbles something bad is going down.For those of you who are not so well versed on the subject of Greek mythology, Pandora was the name of woman who was sent to earth by the gods as punishment for their disrespectful actions. Pandora was moulded by the smithgod and endowed with all the desireable traits anyone would want in a person. Lastly they gave her boundless curiosity. She was then given a box (or an urn depending on your textbook) and sent to earth with the simple message to never open the box. What was in the box you ask? Well...despair, terror, disgust, disease, death, pain, agony, greed, lust and lastly: hope. Pandora opened her box and the world was made miserable and the only respite was the tiny bit of hope at the bottom. Now that we have a context, can you image what is hidden on a planet called Pandora? Há! Wrong! It's guns! Guns and bullets and rockets and bullets and bullets. There are so many bullets on Pandora you'll be wondering why people are still paying with cash when you can get bullets and guns from everywhere. The whole point of the game is to open a mythological vault (Pandora's Vault. See where this is going?) On your way you'll be beset by all manner of horrors and fiends. So it is nice that you can pick up guns everywhere and share your bullets with everyone. Obviously I meant: shoot at everyone. Stuff gets a bit blurry after a while cause the game is so vast, so huge, you'll be dragging yourself from one end of the planet to the other over and over again, and everything looks the same. This is my chief complaint with this game: It is huge, but doesn't offer much in the way of streamlining. There is some fast travel possible, but only from certain places. You can also rent cars, but arbitrary barriers stop you from driving them all over the place. So if walking is not your thing, steer clear. However, if hearing the screams of bandits, as they dissolve into a sloppy pile of green goop after you shot them with a round filled with acid then you are in for a delicious treat. Borderlands drops a lot of weapons. You can compare and contrast to find what suits your class best and go to town on people's face with it. Zap 'em. Burn 'em. Melt'em or Blast them into tiny bits. All off course accentuated by delicious screams of pain and horror. What do you mean ""thats grim?"" That isn't grim at all. That's life on Pandora man. You better get used to it, cause you'll be doing it a lot. A funny thing about how the game presents itself is its classification system. A normal wolf-like enemy would be a normal wolf. A big one would be an Alpha Wolf, and a giant, burning and barking monstrosity would be a Badass Wolf. This trend developes, and it makes it easy to gauge what you can deal with, and what will certainly kill you. Dying then triggers a short moment where you can save youself by killing anything on the screen to prevent a hefty ressurection fine. Of course, you can mitigate all of that with the help of some friends. You can play the game with up to three friends at the same time. Everyone helps both eachother and themselves when completing quests. However, don't think it is weird to have all out brawls over who gets the good loot. It is a veritable melee of conficting interests that will inevtitably result in the death of many enemies who simply stood in you and your friends way of riches and glory. Unfortunately, the game is connected with an archaic netcode, to actually getting together might be a pain. However, there are workarounds, but it would have been nicer if it would have worked straight out of the box....Pandora's Box! I am ashamed for making this cheap pun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story: The story takes a back seat in this game to guns and more guns. But really gameplay and coop was the main focus, with the story there to provide entertaining situations. To be honest I don't have a great recollection of what the plot was... it never really stuck with me but it didn't bother me or seem out of place. That being said they could really get away with whatever they want because the game doesn't take itself seriously at all. I'd say some of the missions have memorable bosses like slege and krom, who I enjoyed facing off with. Other than that, you're a vault hunter hunting a vault. On your way you kill lots of things. Plot summed up.Gameplay: I like it! But don't love it. The gun-play is pretty satisfying with headshots looking sick. Your player moves nice and fast but seems sluggish when jumping or changing directions, not terribly though. The gun options and types are pretty vast and I liked most of the damage categories. I just wound up using the same op weapon for 10 levels until I found another. Not until the end game did I actually have multiple viable guns. The main way you interact with game world is talking to npcs and receiving missions. Now the missions are very mixed bag... lots of them are fetchy to death. Sometimes I'd look at my missions log and see fetch quest after fetch quest. They really feel insignificant to, with no plot or interesting reward. It just looks like these items were scatter-shot across the map, just so you would explore the whole map. On the other side of things, some missions have more plot significance and have you walking up to the front door of a bosses stronghold and blasting your way through. This straight forward action was good fun and could be challenging.DLC: I can't recommend any of the DLC's outside of the armory. The others look and feel under-developed, with boring mission after boring plot points in uninteresting areas. And the map design seems horrible here! I found myself running doing nothing for hours in these maps.The armory on the other-hand has vehicles! Thank goodness! Also you get a ♥♥♥♥-ton of great weapons. I feel like this DLC focused on the good aspects of the original game, while the others amplified the annoying aspects.Overall: I'm pretty neutral on this game. I'll recommend it for coop play and for those you can easily skip stupid missions and achievements without it bothering you. Expect fun gun-play and some goofy, outlandish settings and characters that you'll hopefully not get sick of too fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much a must-have game for any open world shooter/RPG/Diablo fan.It's an extremely fun open world romp that can be played as casual or hardcore as you want, with DLC's that just add extra flavorings to an already solid and complete base game.The only downside to this game is how much life this game can suck out of you as you joyfully tear though this immersive world shooting and loot-whxxing.

												My Borderlands 1 ReviewSUMMARYBorderlands 1 is an awesome mix of FPS and RPG; Taking a procedural weapon system like Diablo then adding in a tactical FPS system like Stalker. After having played Borderlands 2 then going back to Borderlands 1 out of nostalgia, I can say this game feels much less polished. While still a pinnacle gem of its time, Borderlands 1 now feels more like a beta engine containing the prologue to Borderlands 2. This prologue still has much to offer, but read on for details on my opinions of some of the game's features.TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIESFirst issue I had coming back to Borderlands 1 is the FOV [Field of View] on my 1080p monitor. The FOV defaults to 70, which long ago I didn't notice was so bad on my 1440x900 16:10 monitor I used way back when. On my new HD 16:9 1080p monitor it looks like I have training goggles on that are creating tunnel vision. I had to search the web to find workarounds for this issue, but could only come up with a quick key binding as a solution. Unfortunately, my FOV continues to reset to 70 every time I mount a vehicle or gun placement. Borderlands 2 doesn't have this issue and allows FOV adjustments in the main menu settings.PROCEDURAL WEAPONSWhile innovative at the time with plenty of stat variation, weapon brand names were not as distinctive in Borderlands 1 as they are in Borderlands 2. Most of the weapon models felt reused constantly no matter what the brand was. The weapon mechanics and procedural system mostly made brand name a stat adjustment. So going back to Borderlands 1 with some brand loyalty didn't lead to any feeling of distinction or difference in tactics. The lack of brand distinction made Borderlands 1 weapons rather shallow with no lore behind them.Finding new weapons in Borderlands 1 was a rather odd ball inconsistent process of trial and farming. I didn't realize this at the time, but it appears that even a level 21 bandit can drop a level 4 standard weapon. At least in Borderlands 2, the loot drops were very close to the enemy's level rather than so far away. The feeling of reward vs. difficulty in Borderlands 1 is not as good as Borderlands 2. There is a slight bug that causes weapons to appear lower in level when equipped. Looking into it further it seems to be related to the proficiency of the weapon type. From what I hear, this is residual left over code from a feature that was canceled at launch that allowed players to equip higher level weapons as if they are lower level. The change has nothing to do with the weapon's function, which concerned me at first when I started noticing it.STORY AND QUESTSIn a lot of ways, the content of the story and the way quests are handled felt very much like Stalker-lite, but without the immersive element.  Voice acting was limited and the way quests were logged was a bit too simplistic. The compass tracking system was almost useless to me along with feeling clunky. Navigating the map in the menu was also clunky due to how it handled the current active quest. In Borderlands 2 this was considerably fixed up and even optimized. The plot was all over-the-top brutal humor with a ton of awkward fun. But was only skin deep, consisting of some villain monologue [which was always hilarious], but mostly instructional dialog by various characters you meet. The characters you meet didn't offer much beyond their initial introduction. There's really no emotional attachments to be had with any of the NPCs. The lack of NPC interaction beyond getting some transmission chatter kind of made Borderlands 1 feel lifeless, which was an issue that was addressed with Borderlands 2. COMBAT AND AIMy first impression before Borderlands 2 was actually quite good [and still is], but I've played a lot of games before coming back to Borderlands 1. I notice things now... things I didn't see before that are important to me. I've always been annoyed by horribly inaccurate weapons that give me that ""Naked Gun 2 1/2 - Gun Fight"" feeling.  I am especially annoyed when an enemy that is dead center on my scope takes a missed shot to the point of emptying my ""sniper"" rifle.  It doesn't help when you stagger from every single hit you take even if it's a distant glazing blow impacting upon a fully charged shield. Much like Stalker, weapons in Borderlands 1 can be weird and misleading when it comes to accuracy through aiming. This issue was fixed in Borderlands 2 since you can see the crosshair shrink for a moment as you focus in allowing for a more precise experience with an aimed weapon.Enemies in Borderlands 1 can also feel a bit awkward, but they still have that signature hilarious dialog that leaves you giggling hysterically while trying to shoot straight with an already inaccurate weapon.  AI navigation is a bit more problematic as midgets have a much harder time moving up ramps or even around corners to charge at you. If the navigation was any worse, you would think that you were playing with Doom 1 AI programming. Even AI vs. AI interaction was sketchy at best as the AI would prioritize the player at random intervals without ever checking line-of-sight. Some modest improvements were done to the AI in Borderlands 2.The enemy spawn rate is very aggressive in Borderlands 1, giving players no real opportunity to truly clear an area before another wave of enemies hit the field. This was a double edged sword as leveling and finding loot was easier to do in Borderlands 1 because of the aggressive spawn rate. On the other hand, if you were struggling in a large area while trying to escape back to the fast travel station, you would be in for a constant wave of ambushing on the return trip. Borderlands 2 toned that spawn rate down quite a bit.There is one big problem that has not been address in Borderlands 2. There are a ton of bad navigation issues that involve getting stuck on terrain and being blocked by invisible walls on ramps. On several occasions, I'll get stuck on a hill of loose debris or the corner of a small ramp while attempting to kite an enemy.  I really wish Gearbox took the time to smooth out their levels before launch.CUSTOMIZATIONYou get to pick a different color for your character and vehicle. That's it. You don't even get to view your real model when you do the customization - just a 2d portrait is used.  Thus another thing that was totally fixed in Borderlands 2.OVERALLStill addictive and still playing despite its flaws, but will likely be logging more hours into Borderlands 2 here soon.

												My first impression, a shooter with RPG - nah, this will not work, after launching the game, and this cartoony graphic, meh, how people can like something like this.... after many, many months of playing... WOW ..what a game :) The game feels perfect, the difficulty is going up with you, the looting is fun and surprisingly is working with the guns and additional gear like shields. I'm playing as Hunter, although I tried Lilith for a bit, but I just don't feel complete without my upgraded ""bloodwing"". There is also quite a lot of dark humour in here, the car fights are nice as well. My only small nudge would be the world itself. I know it's unique but in some way the one big garbage dump is a bit depressing...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RATING6/10GOODDon't get me wrong from the rating perspective, this game does not deserve more than that. (I will explain why in the BAD section) I've spent around 30 hours into this game so far, and I must admit that this is one of the best CO-OP games to have fun, I finished it with my girlfriend and we are still having fun getting all possible achievements and finishing the rest of the ""story"" on DLC content. This is the game for those who have 1-2 hours per day to spend on something and have fun with someone (in this case girlfriend, boyfriend, friends etc...doesn't really matter) since it's an awesome experience. I highly recommend you gettings this game, altho I can't recommend DLC content because it's simply not worth the money, well it is if you're buying full package (in the end you finish spending only 10€ on all 4 DLCs instead od 8€ on each).BADOky doky now bad things, where do I start? This game has some pretty bad issues with performance, whole game was running on 60FPS (since it's locked at 60) and once I got into DLC areas it simply drops to 30FPS sometimes and gets locked down, no matter where you look it's 30FPS no matter what. I don't know why, is it because DLC content wasn't optimzied but just ported to PC or something? There are some connection issues also, party members not able to joinn the game once you start it, not being able to rejoin from the invite section, some items doesn't display correctly for people in party, and loads of problems with invincible and disappearing enemies, now you see them, now you don't. I hope that second game in the series doesn't have the same issues, since I'm planing to play Borderlands 2 also. One more thing to note...seems like developers spent more time working on DLC content than the actual game, which is a shame, they simply put every second into polishing and finishing the DLC content in every single detail, it's much more rich content wise than the actual game (more things to disconer in one area of the DLC map than you will find in the 40% of the actual game), the only problem with DLC content is performance.

												This is definitely a classic and I still enjoy playing it. I have been a fan of the game since day one. Borderlands is about – finding weapons and shooting things with them! It’s all about the guns: combat rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, revolvers, pistols, rocket launchers, and many that can’t be categorized! Seriously, there are a lot of guns! The gory Mad-Max feel of the desolate planet and the people you meet on your way is the bulk of the story! It goes like A) Go somewhere B) Kill some♥♥♥♥♥♥C) Flip a switch or something D) Kill some more♥♥♥♥♥♥E) Success! The game is fun! Its like Diablo loot with guns! The NPC characters are hilarious - yammering some schizophrenic one liners every now and then. Choosing what weapons to keep and what to toss is the most difficult decision in the game. Discovering a quality weapon stash is a very satisfying feeling! The four-player coop is the games shining moment! Going on a rampage in the hostile wasteland with 3 friends can be a lot of fun. It just feels good to level up, get new skills, new more powerful weapons! Bottom line is that everyone should have played this game by now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In Borderlands, Gearbox and 2K Games has crafted a gem of a game, combining elements from first-person shooters and role-playing game genres to forge a memorable experience.Set on the remote, back water planet of Pandora where lawlessness and danger abound, the game invites you into an adventure wrought with intense gunfights and satisfying treasure hunting. With more variation in weaponry than you could ever hope to shake a stick at (or anything else for that matter...), Borderlands does a good job of keeping things interesting while you progress.While proving to be lots of fun in single-player, the fantastic multiplayer capability contributes a whole new level of enjoyment.Throw Diablo 2, Fallout 3, Mad Max, and a slice of science fiction and cell shading animation into a blender, and the successful result is Borderlands. In the words of Linkin Park, ""The journey is more important than the end or the start."" So go and embark on the exciting journey that this game offers!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never been one for nostalgia. Plain and simple really. In fact, there are literally only a handful of games I'd willingly replay in their original entirety. And Borderlands is one of them. Around 2011 I got in a near-fatal accident I'm STILL recovering from physically. My whole world flipped upside-down and I stopped talking to most people I knew after. Even the people I did know...I started to slowly float away from. To say Borderlands was an escape is an understatement.Games these days are insecure. They have drawn out tutorials, boring or complicated UI, and to be honest...not usually worth a second playthrough. Can't say any of that about BL. The one thing I love most about this game is the atomsphere. You're doing your thing, but you don't really feel like everything is about YOU. Moreso, you're a part of this huge world and you're able to explore it. The writing...oh my goodness...moar. now.I can't really finish this review because all I'll do is gush. Get this game. Game of the year edition. Play it with headphones and get rid of distractions. You won't regret it.Now if you'll excuse me...I'm gonna re-download this for the 7th time ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is my first go at Borderlands series, I've made up my mind that I will start from B1, go through it and then move  on to B2 and presequel. It was a great choice, I've made a team of 3 people and we're playing in COOP mode. Game brings me joy and altough a bit old it still has a stunning graphics. I have heard that the B2 is much better, but to truly appreciate it you should play B1 first. That's what we're doing. Game costs pennies now, so if you're thinking dear Player, about buying it - don't wait and just do it. You won't regret this decission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10 out of 10!!! I played this game for at least 200+ hours on Xbox 360 like 2 years ago and decided to buy it on Steam and have currently put in another 100+ hours and I'm still playing it. Borderlands is a truly amazing game, however, this is based on my opinion and style of gameplay. This game is not meant to be realistic in any way!!! It is a humurous RPG, FPS game not meant to be taken too seriously. With thousands of different guns and and a ton of things to shoot, this is still one of my favorite games to this day. I do recommend getting the DLCs for this game because it adds so much more to it!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is definitely a classic and I still enjoy playing it. I have been a fan of the game since day one. Borderlands is about – finding weapons and shooting things with them! It’s all about the guns: combat rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, revolvers, pistols, rocket launchers, and many that can’t be categorized! Seriously, there are a lot of guns! The gory Mad-Max feel of the desolate planet and the people you meet on your way is the bulk of the story! It goes like A) Go somewhere B) Kill some♥♥♥♥♥♥C) Flip a switch or something D) Kill some more♥♥♥♥♥♥E) Success! The game is fun! Its like Diablo loot with guns! The NPC characters are hilarious - yammering some schizophrenic one liners every now and then. Choosing what weapons to keep and what to toss is the most difficult decision in the game. Discovering a quality weapon stash is a very satisfying feeling! The four-player coop is the games shining moment! Going on a rampage in the hostile wasteland with 3 friends can be a lot of fun. It just feels good to level up, get new skills, new more powerful weapons! Bottom line is that everyone should have played this game by now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never been one for nostalgia. Plain and simple really. In fact, there are literally only a handful of games I'd willingly replay in their original entirety. And Borderlands is one of them. Around 2011 I got in a near-fatal accident I'm STILL recovering from physically. My whole world flipped upside-down and I stopped talking to most people I knew after. Even the people I did know...I started to slowly float away from. To say Borderlands was an escape is an understatement.Games these days are insecure. They have drawn out tutorials, boring or complicated UI, and to be honest...not usually worth a second playthrough. Can't say any of that about BL. The one thing I love most about this game is the atomsphere. You're doing your thing, but you don't really feel like everything is about YOU. Moreso, you're a part of this huge world and you're able to explore it. The writing...oh my goodness...moar. now.I can't really finish this review because all I'll do is gush. Get this game. Game of the year edition. Play it with headphones and get rid of distractions. You won't regret it.Now if you'll excuse me...I'm gonna re-download this for the 7th time ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In Borderlands, Gearbox and 2K Games has crafted a gem of a game, combining elements from first-person shooters and role-playing game genres to forge a memorable experience.Set on the remote, back water planet of Pandora where lawlessness and danger abound, the game invites you into an adventure wrought with intense gunfights and satisfying treasure hunting. With more variation in weaponry than you could ever hope to shake a stick at (or anything else for that matter...), Borderlands does a good job of keeping things interesting while you progress.While proving to be lots of fun in single-player, the fantastic multiplayer capability contributes a whole new level of enjoyment.Throw Diablo 2, Fallout 3, Mad Max, and a slice of science fiction and cell shading animation into a blender, and the successful result is Borderlands. In the words of Linkin Park, ""The journey is more important than the end or the start."" So go and embark on the exciting journey that this game offers!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I thought this game was pretty bad, I started it with a few friends but in honesty we were useless at it, we didn’t get very far and were playing it in completely the wrong order. I wrote the game off as bad and I was convinced I would never finish it.  I restarted with someone else and I was actually very surprised what an impact the people you play with can make. This time it was played properly (no offence, guys) and the game grew on me very quickly.Admittedly it’s slow when it comes to storyline, it took a little while for me to feel like there was actually a purpose to the game and I wasn’t just doing the same stuff over and over. When I look at it that way, you pretty much are doing the same thing over and over, but as the storyline unfolds I didn’t even really notice that anymore. There is a lot in this game to keep you distracted, one key part of that being the weapon system. It’s the first game I had played where “loot” was a big thing and it being a first person shooter only made that even better. There’s a massive range of weapons with different stats and abilities for you to find, in all kinds of shapes, sizes and rarities.That being said, I would never play this game solo. The co-op in this game is what makes it for me. That is very likely to be different for a lot of other people, so most people should just ignore that part, for me it just wasn’t something I would do on my own. I know for a fact I would get bored long before the end if I was on my own. So if you are like me, make sure you bring someone along you enjoy spending your time with.It’s a fairly lengthy game, and there’s a number of classes you can complete it with. The characters all have certain charms about them, they are all completely different from each other and with the whole RPG like elements in this game it’s a good reason to come back and play again. Which is always good, replay-ability in a game is never a problem.As well as this being the first first-person shooter RPG-like looting game I had ever played, this was also the first game I had ever played that used cell-shading in the graphics, and I have to say that I loved it. I think it’s a great style. I would say that I hoped more games used it, but I’m pretty sure that after this franchise released it rubbed off on a number of other game makers as well.All in all, I ended up really enjoying this game.(Not as much as I did Borderlands 2, but that’s another review all together)I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great game to play with friends.

												An amazing game with a great atmosphere. The storyline is great and there are a lot of optional missions to do. The downside is, however, that the most optional missions are very repetitive after a while. Playing with friends (4 players max.) will make this game more fun, however playing solo is also loads of fun. I can recommend this game if you don't mind playing some repetitive missions for the sake of an amazing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You just go same thing all over again only with mobs at higher level. I don't see the point.-Boring DLC's			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original Borderlands, while it might not have as shiny a package as its descendents, it's still a fantastic game. It set the bar only to be exceeded by Borderlands 2. Really, this game series is one of the finest I've ever laid hands on. The hours, days, weeks, months, years of entertainment these games have brought me have bore me no regret.The story in this game sets up the second story, which leads into the pre-sequel's story. This game's also great to run back to although nowhere near as much as Borderlands 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Jokingly I said ""Hey, watch me snipe that guy on the bridge"" and the bridge itself was far away. So I aim my gun through the scope and fire. It was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ headshot. The moral of the story is that shotguns with scopes can be lethal at long range.Borderlands is a great game especially with friends and I highly recommend getting the GotY edition because the game is much more enjoyable with all the DLC.

												The original loot n' shooter from Gearbox Software, Borderlands is a game guilty only of spawning vastly superior sequels. While far from a bad game, Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel simply eclipse the original in every single aspect. The environments are mostly just the same desert terrain throughout the entire adventure; the scenarios are nowhere near as memorable; the characters, although still entertaining, are represented much better in the later games, and the gameplay feels more monotonous and slow. I don't really hold this against Borderlands, as it clearly feels like Gearbox was trying to find its niche with this first entry. Again, this game is not incompetently made. It still can be some good fun, especially with some friends. It just happens to be the first game in its series, with the sequels improving every single aspect of the groundwork. I would recommend playing this game, particularly if you've never played a Borderlands game before. But only to be able to understand and appreciate what the original did and all of the improvements that were later brought to the table.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can be a bit challenging for a new player to grasp some of the mechanics in the game but from then on it's smooth sailing. The game id sort of a mix between an FPS with some roleplay. You kinda have to play it to get the jist of it.ProsLots of replayabilityVery involved in the game, no just passing it off as another ""FPS"" Well thought out art style, fits the game very nicelyFun characters with different personalities and traitsGetting all the legendaries you could every wantConsThe grind is just slightly to much at the end game IMOMuch better played with friendsDLC's cost a lot so get the GOTY edition while its on sale :)I highly recommend this game if you have not played it yet.

												Borderlands is an RPG FPS hybrid that is primarily based on gaining loot, which is most commonly in the form of more guns. The single player is decent enough to get through on your own, but its much more enjoyable with a full co-op cast. The story isn't bad either, and there are tons of collectables that attribute to both the story and gameplay. This game would be a good choice for anyone looking for a primarily co-op centered RPG/FPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands. Great intro vid rare in games today the vid intro is what I would say one of the best parts for my experience with the 2009 hit from Cage The Elephant ""Ain't No Rest For The Wicked"" first time I watch it a year ago I am like ""Oh yeah I used to hate this song but now I am digging it and it's fits so perfectly with the game's settings and all"" etc. Anyways the intro vid is what grappled my attention so well but asides a video the game itself is just......MARVELOUS. This is not like Bioshock for those who have played that form 2KGames. This is Borderlands it's own game. Very originnal and you can get endlesss hours of fun and gameplay either by yourself or with others. THis game is one of those few games that asides great comic effects and visuals the MP is actually worth every cent the game is. The MP is where it's at the SP is good too but the MP is what makes this game epic. This game is like a much more graphic version of Serious Sam and less serious than Mad Max series. I would reccomend this game to anyone literally especially those looking for challenge, in depth gameplay, lots to do and MP based gaming. The Game should run decently on almost any pc for my HP G56 laptop it works like a charm on lowest settings but the game is best on a real gaming pc etc. Game itself is a 9.5/10 in my book only lacking a few settings and optimization options. But this is amongst my favorites and is not overhyped like many other games. THis game is a lot like the films: Mad Max, Titan A.E., Heavy Metal 2000, Heavy Metal (1980), I am Legend, Escape From NY, Treasure Planet and other post-apocalyptic films. This game is centered on one of four characters/classes, a Siren, Soldier, Hunter, and Brick. Each one has it's perks and downfalls, but the game is mostly the same experience just certain things easier and others not. Anyways amongst the four whichever you choose gets a random vision/message from a mysteirous girl/woman, to instructions to getting to the mythical but real vault treasure of the planet Pandora which is filled with wonders, and Loot. The point of the game is to be alive, kill bandits, and to get as much loot as possible and of course get the mythic treasure for yourself. The game is a lot like Fallout 3/New Vegas, Serious Sam kind of themed but it's truly a full on original fun experience with a lot of comical relief compared to the any of the examples mentioned beforehand I mean this game is filled with humour and it's good in general. One of the few FPS's I have respect for since it's not a COD or anything of the sort all in all the game is a hit, Fresh, and just a truly amazing game in general the sequel is even better on almost every aspect must have game for everyone!

												Always a blast, and a great game to play with your friends. The vanilla game is wonderful, and the DLCs just add on to the fun times there are to be had with Borderlands. The unique art style of the game has given it a look that will age very, very well, and the gameplay is fast-paced for all you fps junkies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm a bad*ss! I'm going to 360 noscope a raider right in the d*ck with a rocket launcher!""And so I did.After that, I ate breakfast with the hot siren chick. And f*cked Hella b*tches.So the game kept saying,""Bruh,do your freaking quests and stop f*cking Hella b*tches.So I beat the game on Swag Mode.And Micheal Bay gave me an award for exploding the map with my EPIC JOHNSON OF SWAGALICIOUS DERPATRONIX MC-HELLAB!TCHF*CKER!!!!!!!!!!And that was my experience.(No drugs were involved in the making of this review.)

												I own all 3 of the Borderlands games so that should tell you right there I just love them. This is the first game I have ever enjoyed playing a female character. Normally being a female I play all male characters as I like their skill sets better, but borderlands made their females badass! The Siren in Borderlands is an awesome character to play. She has great skills and I chose to have her use smg's and pistols making her a powerful gal to mess with. I love all the quests in the game and the weapon variety is awesome. If a game lacks weapon variety I have a hard time sticking with it if it is a long play through. Again this is a game you will play through more than once. You have to try all the characters and their skill sets not to mention you miss things the first time through. I played this game the first time through in co-op and as with any game co-op is much more fun. However I did go back and play through on my own because I had so much fun the first time. And lets face it if you play through with friends you just have to prove to yourself you can do it on your own! I would highly recommend this game to anyone as well as all DLC and all the other two Borderlands games that came after it as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is an outstandingly fun to play game. With the intreaging story line and rememberable characters the game will ingrose you in the hours. The various wepons bring an intresting way toward fighting your enemies and customizing how you fight them. The fun is even doubled, trippled, or even quadrupaled with up to 3 additional players you can play with online. I've played the game once though just by myself but still am having fun playing this game with my friends beating the story together with new ways possible. I still have yet to pick up Borderlands 2 but after playing Borderlands, I without a doubt am fully excited to play this new game. But for now I'll still happily be playing Borderlands with my friends and you should definatly too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very fun game to play together with friends. I highly recommend choosing 3 other people and sticking with them throughout the adventure, as playing with strangers can be frustrating, a la Left 4 Dead & Left 4 Dead 2. Playing solo is pretty boring, and I recommend against playing with strangers, for they will likely do things that go counter to your personal interests, such as keeping all the loot for themselves.If you can get a team of 4 friends together and schedule your games, you will have a great, great time with this game, if you like anything at all about FPS or RPG games. One thing of note, for example, is the immense variety of ways that enemies die screaming, which is very entertaining. The visuals are quite unique and of course the bajillions of guns provide an  endless upgrade path. All in all, lots of fun, 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played through Borderlands 2 before I played Borderlands 1 GOTY edition. If you've already played BL2 but not BL1, then all you need to know is that the gameplay mechanics are the same. The story in BL2 picks up from BL1 and the environments are similar since you are on Pandora. BL2 feels more refined than BL1 but if you really enjoyed BL2 and haven't played BL1, then I'd recommend picking up the first game for at least one playthrough. If you've not played any of the Borderlands games and want to get into them, then I'd suggest starting with the first game. I currently have 52 hours on BL1 and that's going through the game and most of the DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands...the marriage of FPS and RPG. But does it work? Let's find out!The Good:------------1.  Excellent art style - Borderlands looks great and plays silky smooth. Using cel-shaded graphics, Borderlands has a unique and alien vibe about it, displaying the world of Pandora in lush and vivid detail. Although many may feel that this look is somewhat cartoony and basic, I love the art style for the game and felt totally engrossed by it.2.  High Replayability - The player can choose from 4 different pre-made characters, with each one having a unique skill tree to develop. The soldier, for example, gets a machine gun turret, that can be upgraded and made more powerful. Add in the fact that the game has a massively randomized loot engine (more on that soon) and the ability to keep levelling your character once the game has ended makes Borderlands almost seem like an offline MMO at times.3.  Fun and addictive gameplay - Borderlands is simply fun to play, albeit mindless fun. Getting in a vehicle and driving around Pandora, plowing over bandits as your drive, is immensely satisfying. I often found myself wanting to see what was in the next ""zone"", and trying to face it's challenges.The Bad :-----------1. Very weak story - If you value a deep and immersive story, look elsewhere. The gist of the game is that you are dropped off on the planet of Pandora and using the telepathic image of a woman, you seek out the fabled ""Vault"", a legendary place of untold riches. There is a main quest, but the game basically is a bunch of ""fetch this, kill that"" mini-quests to grow more powerful to fight the final battle. There are bosses, but they are devoid of character and seem to serve no purpose other that saying ""hey! We got bosses in our game!"" The game feels very weak in the story department.2. Online is a mess - If you value your games having a strong multi-player feature, Borderlands falls flat. Servers are rarely up, and when they are you will find chat options a pain. There isn't a very good view of messages recieved by other players, and the game offers no microphone support.3.  Not optimized for PC  - This isn't a major point for me, but I know a LOT of people get salty when there aren't a lot of graphical options and PC-centric options. Borderlands feels a lot like a console game at times which is okay, but I really would have liked the menus and UI to be more PC friendly.Overall Rating:-----------------   Borderlands is definitely worth at least one play through, especially if you are a fan of shooters and RPGS. While Borderlands doesn't do either one perfectly, it does enough to give the player a pretty enjoyable experience.  6/10  - GOOD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good combination of loot-collection based rpg and first person shooter. Borderlands is full of pop culture references, bizarre looking enemies and diverse guns. Go for the Game of the Year Edition, the 4 DLC packs add a lot to this game. Unfortunately there's no proper trading or loot sharing system, so I recommend only playing this with friends or alone, though you might run into some nice people in public matches. Now that the multiplayer is handled by Steamworks online co-op has become a much smoother experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. Infact, I love all of the Borderlands series because it offers a wide variety of weaponary, classes, and skill sets depending on how you wish to play. Very smooth controls too. AND HEY! On your way to the quests destinations, you see some spectacular map designs, scenery and wicked creatures that you could have never thought to have exsisted. Bravo! The DLC has some very interesting content aswell. <3 I also adore the characters you meet along your journey (Ex. Lilith, Brick, Mordecai, Roland, Maya, Gunzerker, Zer0, Axton, Scooter, Moxxi, etc. These are only just a few to name!)Further more, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a leveling up system, skill points system, people who love guns, FPS, Quests and have a good sense of humor.

												Borderlands 1, debatably the best Borderlands and most certainly better than the pre-sequel. This game is awesome and you should get it, but the only downside is that the arenas, which are many, are very monotonous and moxxi's underdome riot will make you want to kill yourself.

												The game really hooks you, just cannot stop playing it! As the enemies start to get stronger and more difficult you find better weapons and upgrades, just a perfect level of difficult to make you addictive. The story is a bit weak though, if they had added some cut scenes and a bit of more story action would make it perfect.The S3D is also ok, but does not impress much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands was a very fun game that I have now completed three times. I really like looters, and this game did a great job with tons of interesting guns to use. The story is interesting but is missing something to make you care more. The side quests are mostly just tons of fetch quests that get boring quick. Occasionally there will be one fun side quest that is quite memorable, but most are just rehashed version of go there, kill this, come back.     My biggest complaint is with enemy variety. After the first 15 minutes of playing, you will see the things you will be fighting for the rest of the game. The bandits and rakks just level scale and become more challenging. If you can get past this problem and the dull ""fetch"" quests, this game is really fun. For an FPS, this game moves fluent and leveling is great. Multi-player is where this game shines. Those dull fetch quests and same mobs don't bother you near as much when you are playing with a friend. The boss fights are also fun, but nothing too special. You will also find the characters you meet are not very memorable. Finally money is near useless. You will get money everywhere but never really need it.     My first run through, I had no complaints. The game is often fun, but never really so compelling that you can't turn away. You will even get a few laughs out of it. I myself really liked The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned. Generally by the end of Borderlands, I had fun, but I had no urge to keep going. Here is my take away in a pro con chart.ProsLots of guns with lots of effectsTons of looting, making it worth checking around for hidden chestsMulti-player is really funStory line is fairly interestingFluid game playLots of little goals to accomplish (such as 1,000 SMG kills, ect.)Good for some laughsConsVery boring side questsAlmost no mob variety Very little voiced lines, meaning you will be reading a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton.Money is almost completly useless All in all, this game is worth your time to play it. So if you are wondering where in the series to start, I would recommend here if you got a friend or two to run it through with. I'd give the game an 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cons   - Annoying FOV. Good thing I'm not claustrophobic cause I'd have a hard time playing it   - Racism against midgets and mutants. Nah, just joking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best FPS of this kind, pretty awesome in cooperation or alone, there's a possibility to play it up to 4 and make all missions together. By the way, the best DLC is Mad Moxxi's Underdome, according to me.A lot of final boss and a story very interessting (even if you I don't like the ending, but Borderlands 2 is there for that).

												The goal of this segment is not to review the game it is  to organize information that can optimize your Borderlands 1 settings to make the game run correctly.I like this game a lot. I played it on the Playstation Triple and it ran much better than on Steam. It has been a few years since I had played the first Borderlands game and initially on Steam it ran so poorly that I didn't want to play one of my favorite games on last-gen consoles.Until I used these tweaks in the .ini files to make the game run perfectly. By that I mean without the horrible screen tearing and without what I would like to call ""the buttery mousepad effect"". There are also some other quality of life changes that are available to fine-tune your Borderlands to your own personal preferences.1. The screen tearing issue is caused by a setting in the .ini files that makes the game cap itself at 62 fps instead of 60. This is the most important change that you should make to your Borderlands 1 files. You will want to go to this link and follow the directions to correct this issue.http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10924562. Several fixes can be found at this next link but the most notable ones are removing the unskippable intro movies (NVIDIA, 2k, etc), removing mouse smoothing (the buttery mousepad effect), enabling vsync, and changing ""hold-to-aim"" to a ""toggle-to-aim"". Many of the changes here are personal preference.http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1463861These changes will optimize the game and make it far more enjoyable.Overall good game but poorly optimized for the PC platform without tampering with the flux capacitor.

												This game is awesome, easily a good 60+ hours of replay value here. Buy GOTY Edition since the DLC is really good. In terms of the DLC I'd rate it: Claptrap > Secret Armory > Zombie Island >>>>>>>> Moxxie's Underome. The Moxxie dome is absolute garbage, I only played it for the achievements. The other 3 are good.If you like diablo 2, buy this game. Its diablo 2 in a FPS			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like a MMORPG, but without the massive and it plays more like a first-person shooter (FPS) with role-playing elements. You can choose up to 4 types of characters and level them according to your style of action. Although there are no decisive choices to be made, Borderlands plays more like quest-filled open world that you can invite your friends to and have a great time. The game also supports singleplayer, but it should be noted that most of the DLC packs rely on cooperative gameplay since they are far more challenging than the main game's quests. In all, Borderlands is truly unique with its comic-like graphics and healthy blend of FPS and RPG. No subscription fees required!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pack your bags guys, it's time to go to... PANDORA! No, not that expensive alien pocahontas rip-off, I'm talking about the RPG-like FPS that is Borderlands!The game is about 4 vault hunters. Mordecai the Sniper, Brick the Tank, Roland the Soldier and then there's Lilith the Elemental Cougar (and the only female). With their powers combined, they scour Pandora in search of the fabled Vault, hidden deep within Pandora.Now that sounded awesome, right? NOPE! That is just the sugar-coated, honey-glazed, dipped-in-caramel with a double serving of sweets way of describing the story of Borderlands, the story is actually crap.For a game meant to be played by 4 players, single-player is boring. It can get pretty lonely in Pandora with only one guy (or girl) out and about. The main point of this game is co-op. Now THAT's where the party starts. The game's multiplayer mechanics are simple but effective.More players = Tougher enemiesTougher enemies = Better Loot!!Overall, I give a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is an outstandingly fun to play game. With the intreaging story line and rememberable characters the game will ingrose you in the hours. The various wepons bring an intresting way toward fighting your enemies and customizing how you fight them. The fun is even doubled, trippled, or even quadrupaled with up to 3 additional players you can play with online. I've played the game once though just by myself but still am having fun playing this game with my friends beating the story together with new ways possible. I still have yet to pick up Borderlands 2 but after playing Borderlands, I without a doubt am fully excited to play this new game. But for now I'll still happily be playing Borderlands with my friends and you should definatly too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a combination of F.P.S. and R.P.G. that results in F-U-N.  The story is solid, the gameplay is great, and the humor throughout the game is hilarious.  The dlc packages are worth it as well, especially the zombie island of Dr. Ned.I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone, on sale or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, so I played BL2 first, then borderlands, which is the wrong order.   BL2 is mostly a better version.Still, that said, the core gameplay is still there.  BL1 starts slow, it takes time for your class skills to kick in, before that you don't really feel special.   but once you get to lvl 20 or so, you really get rolling.If you find the game of the year edition on sale, and you have coop buddies, it's a romp.   Get BL2 if you have to pick only one, but they are cheap nowaways, wait for a sale and get both. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great. Some of the missions are tedious and boring, but somehow remain fun. The gore is so over-the-top it's just amusing. There is a seemingly endless amount of weapons. A wide array of humor that will make you laugh outloud is sprinkled through the game. The class trees are effective and makes you eager to level up. highly reccomended.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics are different then most games, however I found  them visually appealing after getting used to. The games mechanis are solid, and the various weapons you get throughout the game are hilarious to use. Some turn into a gernade on reload, etc. The story is great, and the sequel is great as well, so this is a series worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I loved it so much I got all the DLC, Borderlands 2, The Pre Sequel and all of the DLC for them as well minus the costumes.

This was possible in 2010 because Borderlands ran on Gamespy servers, and not steam servers. Got into the original Borderlands again because the Pre-Sequal is just a cash grabber. The second installment of Borderlands is fun, but it's just missing some side missions, I.e. In Borderlajds 2 there isn't a side mission where you have to help a charater, such as Cl4p-, give the character something they need. When you give that item or objective to that character you get loot.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would reconmend this game for anyone who loves RPGs or First Person Shooters. *If you like Destiny then please play Borderlands, becauuse Borderlands is the ""superior"" game compared to Destiny. Eventhough the pre-Sequal was the worst borderlands game, it's still more fun than Destiny. Destiny requires you to have people play with you, and those people have to be on your friends list.

There is so much in this game to do, whether you enjoy collecting the loot, messing around, or dueling in MP.  With the variety of weapons and compelling skill choices, it's nearly impossible to get an identical run like the one you just did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a pretty fun game, spent a while in it and enjoyed the hell out of the missions in co-op and singleplayer. The story is about as thin as a wet tissue paper, but that isn't too much of a concern because you are a treasure hunter looking for treasure. what else do you want? I highly reccomend Borderlands, because it is one of the last games Gearbox has made before their games overrall quality started taking a sharp nose dive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Borderlandsis original FPS/RPG game for co-op expierience. This game is unique idea of mixing FPS with RPG elements, adding some replayability after finishing the game. It's great fun to play with friends and smash some midgets or skags. The game offers us 4 characters with 3 skill trees, which u are free to add as u like. Because of high level cap(50 without dlc) u can easy master even 2 of 3 skill trees. Game have specific for this series dark humour, which is funny and entertaining. I need to say I've played borderlands after playing Borderlands 2 so I can now clearly compare them and see the pros and cons between them, and choose which one i would like to recommend u more, but for sure both are worth of playing if u want to get into the Borderlands story/universum.Pros:+Funny story+Great gameplay+Best fun with friends+Many items/upgrades for character+Graphics still looks cool because of it's unique style+Many hours of funCons: (u will notice them after playing Borderlands 2)-Lack of music/soundtracks-Walkthrough 2 is too easy.-Not many party bosses to farm-Low replayability (it was boring for me after 1-st walktrough)-Maps are way too similar to each otherOverall: 7,5/10. I think it's fair comparing to series. Ofc it was first game so we can't blame that it has lack of some aspects, but still it's really decent and i would recommend it for you. Play with friends for best expierience and fun <3.About DLC's:Zombie Island of dr's Ned is typical smash'em zombie. It adds some hours to play and kill tons of zombies with decent plot about undeads. Anyway it's not giving much improvent to your character after walkthrough, so i would recommend only for people who likes zombies.Overall:7/10MadMoxxi's Underdome Is DLC's with 3 different arenas on which u take challenge to survive waves. To be honest it's the worst dlc and I won't recommend it to anyone. I was trying to like it, i did beat 1 of 3 arena's and i must say: After 1-2 hours of playing it's so boring. Drops are craps, and u can't save beetween rounds u need to finish whole arena at once.If u get it with GOTY edition, enjoy ur bank store,otherwise don't buy it.Overall:4/10Secret armory of general Knoxx Is probably the best of all DLC's for Borderlands. Its decent lenght story for several hours, with good expierience gain, many quests, and new different enemies. What is more when u finish it u gain acces to place with tons of loot chests, so this DLC is for sure the best improvement for ur character after ending main story walkthrough. Moreover DLC is increasing ur level cap by 11 levels so it's a lot. At last i must say, in this DLC u have the hardest boss in the game which is Crawmerax The invicible, so it's great opportunity to try urself out with friends or alone, and get some additional loot. Only con is there is no fast travel in this DLC, so it may be kinda annoying.Overall:9/10I would recommend this game to u for story and fun with friends, but if i would choose between Borderlands and Borderlands 2, pick the 2nd one. It got a lot of improvements comparing to 1st game, and have more replayability which gives u an opportunity to play hundred of hours. Anyway BOTH games are really good, so play both if possible ;) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a sci-fi action game that combines the best elements of first-person action with player customization and massive arsenal of weaponry.Play as one of four mercenaries in this amazing experience as the player adventures himself in the lawless planet of Pandora, focused on finding powerful alien technology, also known as The Vault.This game also features an amazing cooperative experience, allowing up to 4 players to play the campaign simultaneously and the game's content provides an near-endless variety in missions, environments, enemies, weapons and character customization.Fun is guaranteed with Borderlands and it's definitely one of the best games I've ever played.I highly recommend Borderlands aswell as all of the content released.

												From the small bit of this game that I have played, it is marvellous. The art style works a lot better than I thought it would. The combat and controls are very fluid. I personally changed melee to Q, but that is just my preference. I'd describe this game as a good mix of Fallout and Bioshock.Pros:Good gameplayPretty worldSatisfying combatCons:Textures take a second or two to load when going from area to area.I would rate this game 9/10 from what I have played of it. That could change up or down depending on the rest of the game.I recieved this key from the Steam Group: Accidentally Reviewed. I thank them very much and encourage all to join.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start this review by saying this: Borderlands 2 is, so far, the best one in the series in my opinion, but only because the core game it was build on was pretty solid. That core game was the first Borderlands.The first Borderlands is a bit raw: the skill trees are pretty basic, the inventory layout can be pretty confusing at first, there is very little dialogue in this game (unlike in its successor), and so on... For some this may be a letdown, for some a charm.But the game already has everything what a good Borderlands should offer: lots of action, tons of different guns to try out, challenging at times especially at later playthroughs (don't let my hours fool you: I've played this game on console before. I never played the DLC, and then saw GOTY for 7.5 bucks, so I didn't hesitate for a single moment to get it), and the many different ways to kill your enemies can be really satisfying (a headshot with a sniper makes heads explode in red mist, and I'll never grow tired of it).Old, but very cheap when it's on sale, and fun with friends, so definitely give it a try if you like shooters. It's a good introduction in the Borderlands series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark humor, cheap plastic sound effects, pretty rad weapon system, unique and iconic locations, characters ranging from badass to nuts and a wide variety inbetweenId be lying if I said that I found even a single rocket launcher useful, but god damn if it wasnt still fun to use.This is the quintecential alien-wasteland shooter, something that unfortunately was not carried into the second installment (Probably cut to make more room for injokes, references, and memes. Well, it worked for Nukem: Forever--... Right?)This game holds my favorite level series in almost any video game, Fort Knoxx. Partially due to its pitched vehical battles, sweet jumps, and blatant boss advertising; is a game I often go back to with friends jus to shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥(and talk also :P)Grab a couple friends, throw some music on, have a great time~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game will definitely make my list of top gaming experiences, because it not only treats us with fantastic gameplay and a unique graphic outlook, it piles on a 4 person co-op of the singleplayer. Now I have a game that left me begging for more content (other than Fallout). I think i'm going to buy the DLCs for this very soon. Oh and not to mention, this game supposedly pales in comparison to Borderlands 2, which is head and shoulders above the previous... I bet i'll just have to get the second to find out.

												You emerge in the stylised landscape of Pandora, a barren wasteland filled with excitement and hostile alien creatures. Whilst all this would amount to a pretty good game already, Borderlands ups the ante with it's Diablo-like gameplay. All pickups and drops are randomised, including the guns you get. Because of the almost limitless amount of weapons, class builds and strategies that follow. Borderlands still remains replayable just throughout singleplayer.Multiplayer however is pretty lackluster, especially if your playing with random players. It comes highly recommended to play multiplayer with a few friends rather then just game surfing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a very unique game with a very funny and well thought out storyline. The characters are memorable and the landscape across Pandora has its own special feeling.Driving the runners feels great how smooth it glides across the terrain and the infinite guns gives it a diablo feeling of loot progression. One of my favorite aspects of this game is the New Game + system where you can play the game a second time with renamed enemies who are much tougher than before, which turns what used to be easy missions into a nightmare.The DLC is fun and rewarding even though Mad Moxxi TD can be very tedious. As a game I own three copies for and have beat over a dozen times I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fps/rpg elements with a funny and progressive storyline.I give it an 8.5 out of ten for replability, story, and great gameplay that will keep you playing for hours.

												I played this game AFTER Borderlands 2, so, obviously, if you compare it to that, it's NOT as good. That said, it's still pretty amazing, and you can see why they MADE another game (and made that game better, oh, so much better). On the other hand, I also played it after the Pre-sequel (yes, in terms of story I played the games BACKWARDS), and it was certainly better than that overall (being longer - with the dlc - and less glitchy, and certainly cheaper).      The levelling and story are not as good as Borderlands 2, but it's still fun, still funny and still pretty damn violent. It's shorter than Borderlands 2, and without the dlc (this is the only one of the three that I got the full edition of, with all four dlc), it's probably shorter, or equal to, the pre-sequel. This makes it clear to me that these games were made to have the dlc - and, amazingly, that I got NINETY hours out of Borderlands 2 WITHOUT the dlc, which is impressive, and just goes to show that games just aren't long enough anymore. The idea that you don't get the complete game without paying EXTRA for dlc now is one of the things that annoys a lot of people in the gaming world today, but this game is fairly old now and very cheap on sale, so the full edition is worth getting (especially as without Moxxi's Underdome there isn't even a bank to store your stuff).       I played the zombie dlc with my eyes shut, but, other than that, 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really loved playing this game co-op with my boyfriend, we spent a lot of time playing this game together. I don't think I would have played this in single player, I think my review would have been worse if I had played it alone.There are a lot of things that I disliked more than I liked about this game. FIrst off, I did not like the story, a lot of people say that the missions don't seem to tell you WHY you need to do them, and it's true, for the mayority. I think it's just mainly for leveling up and adding extra content to the game which had really nothing to do with the story. Honestly I got lost with all the side missions, I kept forgetting what was happening. Lots of the side missions were also very repetitive, a lot of times I found myself wanting to stop playing. Honestly I would have liked that there were more story related missions to the point that you absolutely have to reach level 60 to finish the game in its entirety. And that's probably too much to ask. I don't like that I would find that one awesome gun and use it for almost 10 levels, to the point that other types of weapons became more useful than that one I absolutely loved. It would take another 5 levels to find one of the same type that might be just as awesome, but that may be my personal opinion I guess.I HIGHLY disliked that the bosses were REALLY easy.. most of them didn't even touch my shield, and I know, it was co-op, but even so I think it was way too easy to the point that random enemies that spawn as you explore the map seemed to be harder than a boss fight? I don't think that's right. I also noticed that the game become very easy after maybe level 20, maybe even before that.. a bit disappointing to be honest.Honestly, I liked the fact that I could play this with someone else, otherwise I wouldn't have even touched it, even if I had bought it. I like the game mostly for its FPS more than anything, and the RPG style of the game when it comes to the skills. It's really fun to play co-op I can't deny that, I had fun playing it. I also liked the graphics. I don't know if I would recommend it to someone, maybe if they played with other people but for single player, I can't see myself recommending it to anyone. I'll give it a thumps up for the co-op.I can't wait to play BL2, since so many people say it's so much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HIdy hidy - Overall, I love the game and just can't play it enough (or rather, often enough.)Video: The art style of the game is very much heavy-line comic book within a 3D world, no matter the angle of sight to the object. This isn't bad, simply letting you know what to expect.All the action takes place on a deserted planet that has an unclear history, but appears as though it is the galaxy's junk yard. And I mean that, literally. Little LOOKS new, but can look interesting. The world also certainly looks alien enough and you'll find things in the sky that have no explanation.Audio: Perfectly good audio, plenty of excellent voice acting, even if the bad buys are a little cheesy.Gameplay: Not bad. This is a sport of post-apocalyptic world not too different from Fallout, but everything was built with junk because it existed, not because it couldn't be fixed up. You may briefly hear ""Dueling Banjo's"" during gameplay (I kid.)The AI in the game is actually pretty good and can give you a good groin stomp if you aren't used to FPS games or agile enemies. There are plenty of bandits to come after you. Running them over is always rather fun, too.There are plenty of easter eggs and suprirsies in the story, so I won't mention them here, but search everywhere and maybe even become something of a packrat if you can.Mods: There ARE mods for the game. Weapons, houses, characters, vehicles, etc. I was actually more shocked that someone hadn't really gone on to make any nude mods other than for Moxxi, but since it isn't a big deal, no worries.Overall:Audio: 10Visual: 9 (Lack of interactivity is all, such as blowing up a wall to get through it or osmething similar.)Mini-games/bonuses/easter eggs: 10As a whole, I'd rate the game a 10/10 - And this is coming from a guy who really doesn't care for FPS games.-Paladeus			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 It's a solid game. The story isn't anything special: you're looking for the Vault, like some other people. On your way you kill a lot of enemies, like bandits. That's basically it. The mechanics are satisfying and easy. The shooting is good. The loot is pretty nice and has actually a lot of variaty. The skill system isn't that interesting. It just gives you more health, you do more damage. Some upgrades are pretty neat, for example the special move upgrades, but these are unlocked after a long time. The enemies do miss some variaty. There are some pretty great ones and pretty creative too, but it feels like they use the same enemies to much. The multiple caracters you can choose and the different ways they play and the ways you can play the game, makes for a pretty replayable game. The game still looks good. Didn't have any performance issues either.The DLC really tries to pander out the gameplay: it takes way too long to get to some parts and it's repetetive. It just tries to make the game longer, but the gameplay and the enjoyment suffer under it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Funnny...l missed this when it first came out. Don't know how but l guess l was busy with family and other games that took my interest. Many years on and l freakin love this game and the 'hook' it has. l am an old school Diablo player and the grinding to level up is awesome and it has humour. If it was not funny l would not play this. Games are meant to not take themselves to seriously. Anyway l have all the Borderslands, 2 and the prequel but l want to beat this one first. Tales of the Borderlands by Telltale is also an awesome game and 'Scooter' is in it. Love the lore and the style. Graphics on my nividia970 are maxed out and runs so smooth with an xbox controller even though it has no support for it. Great game. l recommend play this one first if you are new to the series. Even though this is a great game it might not suit to everyones FPS style. If you like the Diablo mechanic you will love this but if you love the COD corridor movie production you might not enjoy this. I enjoy both but Borderland has the hook and charcters that l will remember years from now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A crazy action-adventure RPG where you play a vault hunter - a mercenary who desperately tries to find the vault to claim its hidden treasures. There are 4 different characters (classes) you can choose from that offer 4 different play-styles. There is an enormous amount of items found in this game - really, the amount of weapons you can find is just amazing. Colours indicate their extra features - this is similar to Diablo. The rarer weapons you find the stronger it is. There are tons of missions to complete and many conversations to listen to. It is a sin to skip even one single side mission as the dialogue is very, very entertaining and funny. In addition to this, the game has 4 DLCs that take you to different areas and continue the already silly story by telling you further adventures.I guess the only difference between this and its sequel is that the first episode lacks a proper antagonist. There's no main villain here which is a bit of a let down once you complete the game and encounter the final boss. Still, this one small flaw cannot ruin the experience for you as your walkthrough will be entertaining all the way.Also, the sequel has a bit more vivid colours that was a nice change compared to this episode where everything is grey or brown. Anyway, Borderlands is a great game and best played with friends (you need them for some of the boss battles). Playing the first one to understand the sequel's story is not mandatory. If it is discounted, though, picking up the game of the year edition can be one of the best gifts on Steam. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well lets say this. ♥♥♥♥ Cel Shader graphics, 1/10 for graphicsGameplay: Classic, mean, fun and overkill. Four words i love to say about games. Finding that epic gun that beats your other guns by miles is just a nice warm feeling.Pro's:- Great large levels- Epic guns- Plenty of♥♥♥♥♥♥to shootCon's:- Diabolical graphics- Maybe the maps are a tad too big at times8.5/10 - Get it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands, is a good game.Ya know, the game can't take the blame.Be a man, play this game.I'm stoppin doug, gonna play this game.(game, game...)This game isn't expensive and it will be alot better than you see in the screenshots. The screenshots are a joke, the game itself really shines. But if you want humour, buy Borderlands 2. Let's move on with the pro's and con's.Let's get the con's out of the way, shall we?- Travelling to another place/location takes some of your time.- Inventory space is ok, but not the best. Although I like the fact that it makes these games more challenging.- Some missions are impossible, even if your level is recommended.And now... *drum music* the pro's!+ Made in Unreal Engine 3, one of the best engine's in my opinion.+ You don't need a gaming pc to run this stuff, my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc handles this game with Medium-High settings on 40+ FPS. If you can run Team Fortress 2/XCOM: Enemy Unknown, your pc will probably handle this game.+ Loot, loot and... Omg! More loot! :'D And alot of weapons!+ Great characters like Claptrap.+ Good story.+ Scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me when I saw my first Psycho in the game.+ Many missions, open world. It's an official RPS (Role-Playing-Shooter) game.TL;DR: This game isn't the average Shilectronic Farts game, it's a great open world shooter. Try the experience for yourself.I rate this game 10/10, it kept me playin' ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Solo campaign is not bad, but with the pack of Your 3 friends it will turn into massive festival of loot, enemies, and of course - fun! :D. I know, it's a 5-years old game, and doesn't look good compared with newest one, but if people are returning to play this again, again, and again, then it's must have something making them to do that, right? Latest migration form GameSpy to steamworks are a smart choice, most people, who buy this game earlier (just like me), can still play without worrying about it. (thanks to The Borderlands granting tool!) If You want to get this one, buy the GOTY wersion, these 4 DLC's are worth well it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is one of my all time favourite games for many reasons. First off, its RPG elements are great. You get to choose the 'class' of character you want at the beginning of the game, and choose exactly which abilities and skills you want as you level up.  You get to choose which sidemissions you want to do, when you want (If you like it hard, do it straight away, or wait a bit so its easier. AND the GUNS, so many guns. the randomness in them are great and theres always the feeling like you have the best gun ever, only to play for another 30 minutes and find your new best friend. This game also has replayability, start as each class member and thats 4 playthroughs, and each one will be very different not only because of the different skill trees, but also due to the different weapons you'll encounter.

Borderlands.Published in 2009, this game belongs in the ""lifetime"" category, being always replayable no matter the advance on technology. People will come back for this game. Not necessarily for its geeky, retro, cartoony graphics (which can be a downside for some gamers), but rather for its never-ceasing ability to incite laughter and challenge at the same time.It runs on a modified Unreal Engine 3. While they indeed implemented cartoony graphics instead of polished ""realistic"" graphics, this approach allowed the developers to highly detail the surroundings in a way no other devs managed to pull off before using cartoony graphics.The general atmosphere of the game could be defined as a mixture between Fallout, Diablo and dozen of other FPS / RPG's.Critics and reviewers rarely give this game a lower score than 80/100 and with good reasons.If I had to critize something concerning Borderlands, I'd probably point at the considerable weak AI and the rather weak storyline. A gamer interested in a deep, attractive and emotional storyline shouldn't invest his money in Borderlands. The boss fights are intense and satisfying when won, something some developers fail at achieving.Summary:Pro's:Favoured amongst seasoned reviewers and critics;Intense and satisfying boss fights;Amazing weapon variety;Enjoyable co-op multiplayer;Astereotypical characters in an original setting with an abundance of dark humor;Very entertaining DLC-packs;Contra's:Rather weak AI;Weak storyline;Not many players online anymore for co-op;PvP, while available, almost nonexistent;Neutral:Cartoony graphics;Overal, I'd agree with most curators by stating that this game is an absolute masterpiece. It might not be for you due to the rather rare approach concerning graphics and setting, but I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a bit late to the Borderlands game. To be honest, I didn't enjoy this as much as BL2. Advice to anyone getting into Borderlands, don't think that you need to play BL1 to appreciate BL2. The second game is much more fun, and stands well on it's own legs. If you're aching for more after finishing BL2 and have checked off ""be disappointed by BL:TPS"" on your To-Do list, come back and play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And yeah, Borderlands will tell you the story which won't be flogged to death if you'll start game over and over again. But also the game won't spoon-feed you and I strongly reccomend you, loser, to get friends to play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is good but it does have its issues. When thinking about the gameplay the weapon handling feels clunky, but it feel that its actually a good thing, its feels like you really have to control them rather than just point and shoot.The story and world is really interesting, whether it be the main game or the expansions. However the gameplay never really changes, and is very hard to keep you interested.Its worth giving a go, but if you have yet to play a Borderlands game I would say that 2 is a better place to start.

												This game is just a helluva fun put together, it has lots of elements seen in other games: Call of Duty, Fallout, Halo... etc., yet the gameplay still feels unique and fresh.The sequel, Borderlands 2, has made a lot of improvements, and in general is a better game, but it was the original Borderlands that set the humorous tone and established a successful formula: explosions, loot and addictive fun.The ""loot"" part is arguably the best part of the game, I've finished the campaign years ago, yet I always come back for more.Now that Gearbox has released the Steamworks patch for Borderlands to restore its multiplayer, would you kindly pick up this timeless classic, and share the fun with your friends?

As a Vault Hunter on open world Pandora, you need to favour your way through the right people and fight your way to your destiny. Collect more powerful weapons and sell your loot for cash.

Sure, the amount of depth to the RPG elements isn’t really the same, but what is there is substantial enough to addict the get-up-and-go kind of player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have watched Mad Max, then you should really play this game. This game takes a desert world, and let's you play through the entire game in a similarr environment, without getting boring. That is true game design right there. For example, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel has most of it's environment on the moon, and that game to me is quite boring. As far as the Plot goes for this game, it's nothing too spectacular, however, the overall story is rememberable and enjoyable. Gameplay wise, I think it's a perfect merger of FPS and RPG, as your skill point alloccation really changes your gameplay with new and powerful techniques. Sniping is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however, the other guns are powerful, and the better guns have a rare drop rate that you can farm in certain circumstances; the DLC's have the most availabity,a nd the main game sucks for it. This game is multiplayer, however, when I've played it with a friend, it was laggy, and very precise with the missions (as in you need to be on the exact mission bit to turn in the mission, no skipping).If there is anything to take away from this, it's that this game is amazing, however,  if you want a great Borderlands expereience, go for Borderlands 2, then comeback to this one, as it can be glitchy, it punches in the face with it's ♥♥♥♥-you interactions (it's very enduring, nbot a bad thing(it's hard to explain)), and I think it gets cleaned up a lot in the sequel. I do prefer this game over the sequel, and I love this franchise so much. 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've not %100 been into rpg games like The Elder Scrolls, mainly because I feel the world was just to bland for me and it was too much like a fairy tale, also there weren't ♥♥♥♥ING GUNS. I mainly bought this game 'cuz I asked my boyfriend what was a good Borderlands game to play, and he reccomended the 1st one. I've heard a lot about people not liking the 1st one, but come on guys, we all start somewhere don't we? I really REALLY enjoyed this game, and it took awhile to complete it too! It's worth your time to pick up, definitely. But then again, you also should play the pre-sequal and 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The cartoonish style of Borderlands might be a minus for some, but Gearbox uses that to implement a particular gore style and a buttload of humour. Best Features:  - Loot, loot again and some more loot there. - Leveling. Even though it is a FPS, the leveling system let you play four different characters with each three different talent trees.  - Humour. The humour in this game is genius. Shooting to death a bandit at point blank with a sniper and stumbling across his arm a few feet farther is always nice in that kind of game. Plus the CL4P-TP robot makes me think of the hyperactive child GLADOS would have had if she could have one. - It plays well in solo and great in co-op. The game stays the same and you have many hours of gameplay. Took me around 40 hours my first time with a little try of every character and some fooling around. Minus : - It is kind of an open world but you can't really venture off to the high level zone if you're not yourself high level. The trash mobs will kill you pretty fast.  - Community is greedy. If you play in a quick match online, you might have to fight for the loot.  - PvP is not really insane in Borderlands. Though I had my fun on PS3 killing those hacked-shield wielder in the small arena in the first zone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent blend of RPG and FPS elements in a game that constantly refuses to take itself too seriously. Lots of fun as either a single-player or multiplayer game with pretty seamless transition, campaign-wise. I had low expectations and came away very, very impressed. The amount of content is also quite large, especially for an action FPS/RPG, so there's plenty of hours of fun to be had. Looking forward to playing the second! 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands Review.*Note: Review based on PS3 version.Borderlands is the game you may have dreamt of when you were younger (minus the gore!). A big open world to explore, a multitude of quests, and cartoon graphics in an age of gritty realism. What's not to like?The only downside to Borderlands is the fact it is basically a tech demo for things to come. But when you step onto Pandora, you forget about that, you just exist in this fascinating world that has been laid out for you. Sure, the lack of a solid story can and will disappoint you at times, but once you allow yourself to be immersed in this non conventional world, you will be hooked.I say non conventional, because really it is not your typical FPS game. Nor your typical ARPG. It's almost a new genre, where all you do is loot, shoot and loot some more. Never have I felt so restricted in my choices to carry loot I find, but this is a good thing. You are given a steady stream of improving weapons and upgrades that encourage you to change how you play on the fly. This really gives the game longetivity and prolonged enjoyability, it just doesn't get stale.The graphics, the world, the characters, the audio. All are wonderfully utilised in creating this game. You may find yourself shooting the same enemies over and over again, but that makes it even more exciting to find the ""badass"" version of them, and to beat the virtual stuffing out of them.Borderlands will continue to entertain you hours after you start playing. It is a funny, tough, exciting, non stop thrill ride (that's right, cliché time) from start to finish. In short, you need to buy this game. Come on, visit Pandora. Who know's what you'll find here....9/10Excellent			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(I may have taken a day off work this week just to play - don't look at me like that!) I can't wait to finish up so I can get back to Borderlands 2 (which I actually started first before coming back to play this one).

												Been playing this game on multiple platforms since 2009, This game may not be perfect, but it sure is addicting and fun as hell to play through alone or with friends. Just trying to get the very best equipment is fun and addicting. I still have yet to find an Pearls across my 10 characters, but the search for one is one of the many aspects that this game has me coming back to play again and again! I highly recommend this game over the sequel if you prefer more challenge and more mechanics to loot. If you do get this game, I BEG OF YOU, to look at the mods and engine configurations because this game is abysmal for us PC elitists, but it can be made playable with some minor tweaks.If you have friends, this is a must have to play.

												Borderlands is a classic, timeless FPS game.  The graphics areCo-op muitiplayer games, up to  four players, are a fun & welcome challenge.  The storyline is entertaining, engaging & comical.   All of the DLC's have a story arc that I found engaging.  The Secret Armory of Knoxx DLC is probably the roughtest part of this series.  There is no fast travel option which makes it difficult for players who play in shorter sessions.  Each time you load into the Knoxx DLC region, you start at T-Bone Junction & have to fight, walk & drive to your questing area.  Sometimes this push to the questing area would take 45 minutes.  The Armory was also dissapointing as you only have a limited amount of time to scour for weapon upgrades before you are booted from the safe, never to see this treasure trove again.

												Fun game, AI is stupid as♥♥♥♥♥♥likes to rush you often,but when they have you covered at all angles get ready for a fight for your life. I like the game which is saying a lot cuz I am not a heavy fps fan. Has 4 different classes,a decent amount of guns,open world (Mad Max Style) environment, and chuck full of replay based on how you play with the chars you pick. Even though the AI is dense as fog, its still fun to hunt them ,snipe them,rocket launch them,etc and they are and not dumb enough that the game is pointless to play.. The game is just right,not to great,not crappy. Out of 100 I give BL1 GOTY about 75. If you want it,pick it up when it on sale for %75 off. Wont be a waste of your funds at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game (and all the DLC's in the GOTY version) is reletivley inexpensive today... and is a great buy for anyone who is a fan of FPS in general. While not quiet as polished as BL2, you can easily pick up and play if you are at all familiar with the second. Many many hours of fragging bandits, skags, rakks and others... lots of fun and extreme collecting abounds!. Just when you thing you're done, the DLS's add three new stories to play through, two designed as interresting 'mods' of the main game, and one all new charecters and story (General Knoxx - introduces the mechs). All in all well worth the price i paid for 50hrs of fun :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Has some of the best weapons seen a modern shooter and the RPG element doesn't get in the way of the action, it just add an extra flavour to proceedings.

												Right off the bat, don't play this if you're looking for a single player game with lots of story or you don't have any friends.  Without at least one co-op partner, Borderlands will seem very, very lonely.  Assuming you do have a gaming partner (my wife is mine), this game can be a lot of fun.  You can choose one of four characters to play: Roland, Lilith, Mordecai and Brick.  All of them can wield the same weapons and do melee attacks as well, but some characters are better utilized with some weapons than others.The basic premise is paper-thin as you're a bounty hunter/mercenary/treasure hunter (and whatever else) looking for fame and fortune by finding something called ""the vault.""  On the way, you'll discover numerous towns, meet lots of unusual people, and fight tons of psychos and monsters.You can play offline, LAN or online.  You can use the same character offline or online, but beware: if you level up too far beyond your teammates, the game will hassle you about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is possibly one of the best games I have ever played.  The story line(s) are fantastic, the gun possibilites are endless and satisfying (if you want, you can have a machine pistol that spurs acid on your enemy along with regular bullet damage!), the graphics are pretty nice, and, altough it's a dark and depressing world, can be hilarious at times (like Claptrap!)  Even your charcter has certain skills and actions to do (spawn a turret, go in another direction, etc) and can be upgraded.  Again, one of the best games I have played to date, and can't WAIT for the sequel!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can you say about Borderlands? The game has hours on gameplay and fun tactics with plenty of different weapons and variety of different quests. When I played the game, I played as Roland and his turret was really good to fight with and I felt like a could stand a chance even when I was doing a mission that was above my level. The only downside i would give the game is the lack of intense story constantly reminding you to do stuff but the fact that there is a wide variety of colorful characters going along with your journey makes it that much more interesting. The world is very expansive and has plenty of missions to do so over all i would give it an 8/10 because it has a really nice charm and really fun and addicting gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game for people who are looking for a whole new aspect of... RPG/FPS gameplay lets say. I haven't finished the game yet, so this is not an ""overall"" review. What was really appealing to me was the fact that in Borderlands, in order to pass missions without retrying a couple hundred times, You need to grind, but only with some aspects of your character development (by this I mean advancing into different levels with your vault hunter, grinding weapons, ect.). The game runs smoothly, with very minimal lag for even the crappiest computers. I haven't tried the DLC yet so I can't say anything on that. Its really, good. Great. Perfect, if your the type of gamer that likes FPS/RPG Styled Gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have already played BL2 and/or the TPS and are not a bit of a completionist then this game is not for you, but if you are said completionist then you will like this game. Mostly because you can complete every main mission and side mission in 30 something hours if you play Lillith. I did enjoy this game and it does feel diffrent form the other borderlands. I does feel its age though, as the port is absoulte crap, it runs fine performance wise, but in terms of just general port, its meh. As in there is no AA to speak of, you can however force it in your drivers. The gun anumations are lack luster, aswell E and R are bound to reload, wich you cant dissable through the in game settings. And the splash screens when the game boots up are un-skipable by default. Also the game has no Mac or linux port, but it does however run fine through wine.Dispite its downfalls I can recomend this game, now I just have to get %100 completion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a fantastic game. Whether you play alone or with three of your buddies, youre definately going to add on hours fast. The story is that youre basically looking for a vault filled with treasure from a long told legend, ""The Legend of The Vault."" You can choose to play as one of four characters, all with unique traits and special abilities. The gameplay is very solid and super fun. You begin at level one and progress earning experience points by killing things, completing quests, and finishing challenges. One more thing, LOOT!! Loot plays a huge role in this game. There are rarity levels(White - Green - Blue - Purple - Orange) of loot and many types of equipment ranging from shields and grenades to rifles and rocket launchers. The game also generates thousands of weapons at all rarity types so the probability of finding the same weapon is near to impossible.8.8 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although I am biased in the fact that it was the first game I played that did not involve racing or mindless zombie shooting, Borderlands is the number one game in my heart. I love everything about it, from its rough-around-the-edges visual style to its witty and often nonsensical dialogue to its killer soundtrack. The playable characters are so carefully constructed that you forgo class for personality and their particular background and skills provide a completely different experience on each playthrough. The NPCs grow on you like weeds and you find yourself hesitating to shoot enemies just because they look so cool. The gameplay is very straightforward and the RPG elements not at all off-putting for those averse to the genre. More importantly, despite making for an amazing single player experience, it’s co-op that really takes the cake. I cannot possibly express how fun the Borderlands game series are when played with your best friend so I can only urge you to try it. Now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The little side quests were engaging and kept the passion of the game alive. The guns were amazing, they put so much into the detail of them even with a toon line effect on top.

												Good humour and doesn't take itself too seriously which is part of its charm. The art is a little bland and there's not much endgame but it's addictive and a great multiplayer blast that doesn't suffer from the bloody stupid difficulty setting problem of the sequel.It's a loot based game where you are a vault hunter who is looking for said vault. Legend has it that it's filled with loot. There are four classes to choose from that feel distinctly different. As you level up you choose (mostly passive) new skills. Each class has a unique skill they can activate that really helps them out of a tight spot. For example Brick (the tank class) goes berserk and gains super powerful punches, health regen and damage resistance.The weapons are wacky and nonsensical but loads and loads of fun. Rocket launchers that fire five rockets at once, shotguns that fire pellets in a wave formation, corrosive assault rifles, rocket firing shotguns. So many different guns its just silly, a good silly.Sadly there is an ugly side to the weapons. Modded weapons are rife in Borderlands, either with sensible stats or those that are just over the top (capable of one-shotting Crawmerax). If you hate modded weapons in your game being polite and asking for them not to be used is usually met with rudeness or plain defiance. Also be aware of the idiots that don't get you might be new to the game and don't realize that you are unaware that the gun you have is modded (modders like to hand them out). You try and explain you didn't realize and their tiny little minds still go into rage overdrive, unable to process that little bit of information. I'm sorry internet tough guy!Anyway aside from the human race occasionally buggering things up (again) you can also join plenty of random games without that nonsense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is a great game. There is co-op up to 4 friends, 87 billizion guns in the game, and it has RPG elements in a first person shooter. If you love to level up, get new guns, and play with your friends all at the same time, this game is for you. The guns range from snipers, rockets, machine guns, handguns, and shotguns. The guns are creative and bring a feel of the world you are on. Each character that you can be has their own special abilities and each one has it's own mod. The mods can give your allies ammo, health, boost to your current health, or a boost to your current shield. The game has a comic book look to the game and it fits just right. With the 4 other exapnsions you get with the game, you have hundreds of hours of gameplay with your friends. You can play with other people in public games, and depending on the host, it could be fun or just a waste of time. Borderlands has a feel of action with a little funnies to it, and you will laugh at the jokes they make. BUY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GUN FARMING SIMULATORPlayed the heck out of this game back when it was released. I found it tad difficult to get used to again after playing BL2 so much, but I must admit it's still quite good.If you're looking for a ""complete"" Borderlands experience, I'd recommend going for the second game (GOTY edition is good). First Borderlands felt like a beta for Gearbox to test new grounds, before they fixed everything and released BL2.I found Pre-Sequel disappointing as it was pretty much the same BL again for a full price and another crapton of DLC... also the writing was weaker than in BL2.I'd recommend getting BL if you can catch it on sale sometimes/somewhere f you've already played the newer games. It's fun for what it is. For newcomers to the franchise, go for BL2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most fun co-op campaign FPS games I've played in ages.  I've gone through it countless times on console, and find it quite serviceble on PC.  While it is balanced favoring the Siren due to the commonality of better suited drops for her, it's entirely fun and playable as all of the classes and an excellent way to spend an afternoon with friends.  It's a nice blend of modern MMORPG equipment collection with casual shoot 'em up action and a taste of snarky comedy writing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely hilarious and fun game.  There are some minor issues with the game, but the overall story and massive amounts of loot make up for the issues.  Co-Op is very fun, but you can play the game completely solo through multiple playthroughs.  Try out different classes to find out your playstyle.  I found that Roland was the best for me since he can regenerate ammo non-stop.  Since that is the case, I was able to hold down my fire button and never let go.  There are many possibilites in the game and it's worth the purchase just to see what guns you get at random!  Highly recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After nearly 150 hours at time im writting it, im sure that ill spend another 150 farming achievements, and trying to get better gear. So if u r bored, and dont mind shoting and going from place to place just to finish mission then go ahead get BL.

												Borderlands brought something new to the table and if you like RPG / FPS games then you will definitely love Borderlands. 4 classes to pick from each with different specialities which can be tailored to your liking and a random gun generator keep the gameplay fresh each time, it also has online multiplayer with 4 characters in a co-operative mode (although there is an arena and duels if you want also). Borderlands can be ran through in several hours if you only do the base story, each DLC adds several additional hours and the side quests can easily bring the total to 100+ hours of gameplay. I've completed all achievements on Steam and XBL and can honestly say it's perhaps one of the best games I ever bought.The game is very lighthearted and some of the characters add a lot of humour to the gameplay, the storyline itself isn't exceptional but you will often find yourself taking up sidequest after sidequest to get that extra loot. The game even features its own inbuilt challenges, allowing for proficiency enhancement with your favourite guns & extra experience for doing basics such as looting, killing, even getting a vehicle airborne for several seconds!Only downsides are some of the achievements, and the underdome is a little too long, that's only 1 part of the game though and the rest more than makes up for it.Can't go wrong with this game!

The co-op is excellent and the world is a bizarre, backwoods wasteland with a  tongue in cheek crude sense of humor humor. It's a loot game and there's always new weapons to pickup. The story is good althought the ending is a bit lackluster, but who cares. You're here to shoot everything that moves and ask questions later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FPS action with an RPG twist.The story does well to deliver an original and interesting plot with diverse and likeable characters while also delivering some nice humour to the mix. With four playable character classes to choose from you can select a character with skills that suit your play style and if you choose to play through again you can try out the other characters for a new experience.The guns? The enemies? Yeah there's heaps of both of them. Too many guns to count and a range of elemental and other effects and stats that make each weapon have their own advantages. The loot is definitely a big part of this game, finding big containers full of weapons, grenades and shields that are more powerful than any you have seen before is very rewarding; it's even more rewarding when you beat your friend to the loot and then brag about how good your new guns are. You can always share too but where's the fun in that?There are vehicles which handle well and allow you to take out enemies with the mounted machine guns. There's nothing really wrong with them and they do help to traverse large distances more easily but overall they're not as much fun to use when you have such a great arsenal at your disposal already.Each character class has their own special ability and unique skill tree to increase your power and abilities as you level up from doing missions and killing enemies. These different abilities complement each other well in co op allowing players to take out enemies more efficiently if they use their abilities right; enemies will adjust to your level too so if you're playing co op you'll get more difficult enemies to balance things out.Overall this game offers a whole lot of content and the choice of different character classes gives you additional replay-ability. Definitely worth a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FPS, aRPG, Co-op, AWESOME.The latter is the best description to this game.A perfect combination of Perk-based aRPG and Shooter (sans the aim twitching that a lot of shooters require, which makes this game far more ""approachable"") put in a blender with less than relevant NPCs, shallow and non-intrusive story and freaky enemies trying to skin your face to wear as a mask, added with some gore and ten tons of blood. That's Borderlands for you.And it's multiplayer mode is the best thing since sliced bread, to the point that some people claim this is one of those games that can't be fully enjoyed by yourself, playing solo. Well I say these people should be hung in a rope of Skag guts and left to rot under the scorching sun of Pandora, then respawned at a New-U station and beat to death with a Midget Psycho's arm - only to be revived yet another time and thrown again into the pit-fight/rat-race madness that is the planet's looming backdrop. Alone or with friends, this game is awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an FPS RPG. Sounds awesome, right? Well, it is. It apparently has a multiplayer feature, but I haven't used it, at least not yet. But I've had plenty of fun on my own.While Borderlands 2 is crisper aesthetically, funnier overall and polished better than this one, I think I've had just a bit more fun playing Borderlands 1. Enemies aren't quite as bullet-sponge-y as they are in Borderlands 2 and the risk versus reward is better in general.I'd say a $30 price tag is pretty reasonable for the GOTY version of this game. If you are bothered by the $30 price tag, wait for it to go on sale. Just note that it doesn't go on sale very often, at least in my experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, love every hour I spent playing it. Gameplay is great, feels very rewarding, and the story is entertaining but Borderlands is not mostly based on the storyline. For those of you that have not played Borderlands, its a ""comicbook-like"" shooter. the graphics are bold and in your face, but it makes the game creative and unique. It's very entertaining, and theres always something for you to do. ias you can see, I have over 30 hours in it, and I have not beat the game yet. Although I do have to say, I recommend Borderlands 2 a bit more, everything they lacked in Borderlands One, they made up for in the second game. If Borderlands two had not been created, would rate this game a 9/10 (no games are perfect) Definitely worth the buy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is pretty much perfect. You can spend so much time playing through the main storyline (twice with the same character as a result of Hardcore mode) and completing every sidequest available, just to doo it all over again with a new character. Add some friends, and it's a party. If I could make a few suggestions if you're someone who would be interested in buying this game, buy the GotY edition. I bought it for 15 bucks during the christmas sale, and it was money well spent. Each of the DLCs for this game can add another 10 hours of play time. Second, start off as Brick if you're completely new to the game, his muscle mass and hilarious look of him wielding a tiny SMG are things you can't forget about. If you're squeamish, good luck trying to bleach your brain of Borderlands, but this game is incredible in a special way, in that it's a game you can have endless amounts of fun playing.

I think I've put in about 900 hours on the xbox 360 and still keep coming back to it. If you're going to start the Borderlans series, definitely don't skip this game, or better yet start with it (especially since there's no handsome Jack). There's so much to do in the game and you can play it melee, mid-range or from far awat. The DLC are really good in this game too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have already played BL2 and/or the TPS and are not a bit of a completionist then this game is not for you, but if you are said completionist then you will like this game. Mostly because you can complete every main mission and side mission in 30 something hours if you play Lillith. I did enjoy this game and it does feel diffrent form the other borderlands. I does feel its age though, as the port is absoulte crap, it runs fine performance wise, but in terms of just general port, its meh. As in there is no AA to speak of, you can however force it in your drivers. The gun anumations are lack luster, aswell E and R are bound to reload, wich you cant dissable through the in game settings. And the splash screens when the game boots up are un-skipable by default. Also the game has no Mac or linux port, but it does however run fine through wine.Dispite its downfalls I can recomend this game, now I just have to get %100 completion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands has to be one of my favourite games. I can sit and play this alone or with my friends.It is a four player co op.Borderlands is a RPG and kudos to 2K. This game plays brilliantly on PC and is so varied it is impossible to get bored.You can choose one of four characters:Roland: A soldier. His special skill is a turret, levelling up the turret means it can fire rockets and heal allies. The best guns to use are assault rifles. Mordecai: A hunter. His special skill is Bloodwing, his faithful pet bird who will swoop and kill enemies. You can level up Bloodwing so enemies drop more loot when killed. Best weapons to use are sniper rifles.Lilith: A Siren. Her special skill is Phasewalking. Levelling up the skill means giving elemental damage when the skill ends. Best weapons to use are SMGs.Brick: A Berserker. His special skill is punching. Yes. Punching. You can level it up to the point where one punch will smash the enemy to pieces. His best weapons are shotguns.The main story is amazing and you will meet many allies and foes in your quest for the vault. You are guided by a mysterious woman who pops up on your echo feed now and again to point you in the right direction. You will also meet the infamous robot CL4P-TP or Claptrap. Annoying as he is you will find him querky and fun. During your quest you will come up against bosses. Nine toes is the first one and he is pretty easy to eliminate. The bosses get harder with each level as do the enemies. They level up with you as you get further in the game. However each area has different levels of enemies. Fyrestone has level 1-8 enemies so once you go past level 10 it is easy to kill them.NPCs play a big part in this game in giving out quests. You also have bounty boards in which to pick up side missions. You will find a bounty board in pretty much every safe haven you find. Scooter pops up with his Catch a Ride machines, giving you cars to run around in. You will find vending machines all over Pandora. Ammo Dumps provided by Marcus Kincaid, replenish ammo and level up your gun types to hold more ammo. Dr Zed machines will heal you and you can buy shields and health kits.Enemies on Pandora range from Skags to Bandits. There are a bazillion guns for you to find and use, each unique. Some fire explosives, some set fire to your enemies, other melt the enemies face off literally!! Grenade mods help you to have stronger grenades.Once you have completed the main story you will be given a special mission. This mission calls for you to take three friends into the lair of Cramerax. A level 62, he is pretty much invincible until you are a level 69 and even then he is difficult. Prepare and make sure you are able to keep moving!! In short there is many a mission to keep you busy for hours on end. I give this game a full 10/10, it is just that good!!Try not to die!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Should really be called ""Timesuck"" as this game, especially the game of the year version, has an insane amount of content contained within. A great game to pick up and play and also a great game to leave on the shelf for a bit. Just make sure you go to your Graphics Card preferences and turn on V-sync or the game will tear something awful!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let others tell you how great a game is. Get the game and experience it. Once you finish Borderlands, you'll want to go straight into Borderlands 2, of course once you finish the playthrough 2, 2.5, and get more loot, and maybe the DLC.Is too addictive. Buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Innovative Role-Playing Shooter game. Cool hand drawn graphics, nice RPG elements, and huge world to explore. All DLCs are good, they gives many extra gameplay (not just useless crap like hats and dresses).My score: 10/10 (Must buy! Get the GOTY version, base game isn't worth it.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a co-op, open world shooter with RPG elements, then Borderlands has you covered.Good: Borderlands is great to play with friends. You can create a unique characters with your friends, having different abilities and weapon proficiencies. You can run and gun through hordes of enemies, and laugh at the ridiculous stunts you’ll inevitably perform.Not-so-good: Borderlands can become repetitive, especially if you move through the game slowly. This is compounded if you play the game alone. By the time you complete the last quest, and get into the DLC, even with your friends, it will feel quite grindy.There is a story, but that’s mostly to provide arbitrary motivation to move around and shoot stuff. The characters are funny when you listen to them, but they don’t stay with you after you put the game down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets Just get right to the TLDR cause this game doesn't need a long review. It's just fantastic and worth it's full price. The art style is timeless, the gunplay is polished and impactful. The loot mechanics are addicting in a good way. The story is tongue in cheek with some seriously hilarious writing. It has a significant amount of dlc content, which is all great. For me this game is truly a classic. I played it on PS3, bought it again here to play through it with my friends again. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun with friends, not the biggest fan of Gearbox but this is their gem.The randomized guns and the pure amount of things to do with friends while leveling up and killing everything in sight is really great.The story isn't anything amazing, and the ending can almost ruin the whole adventure for you...but you don't play randomized lootfest games for the story, right?....right?The DLC's are equally as fun, some of them get VERY difficult. I highly reccommend trying this game out, as long as you have 2 or 3 friends to play with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The one and only original multiplayer coop post-apocaliptic slaughterfest. Huge with the DLCs, it provides a massive playground to go up to level 69 ;). So far I would recommend playing as the Siren, she's well balanced and her speed stealth phase ability lets you run through the levels in no time. There are some awesome bosses and settings, and facing a wide variety of hordes of enemies can be a good challenge (specially from the Crimson Lance) . The soundtrack provides a good blood pumping tempo for the endless waves of opposition and the plot can be quite cruel and overall less cartoony than the sequel. Nice and gritty, the game provides endless hours of fun even specially now that the multiplayer is back up thanks to steam!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I rushed through this game with friends when it came out, had fun, but most of the time I didn't know what was going on. They were always in such a rush. Borderlands 2 came out and history repeated itself, only this time everyone else got bored by the time we reached level 11.I started on my own and finished the whole thing, then all the DLC, then a second playthrough. Then I decided to go back to the original Borderlands. This game was where it all started. The DLC is great too, Zombie Island and Captraps Robolution in particular.Do yourself a favour, if you remotely enjoyed Borderlands 2 and you haven't tried this one, get it, especially if it's on sale. You'll either love this more than the second, or get more Borderlands out of it. There's plenty of story and fun to be had.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great shooter, that's for sure. You get a good and often hilarious story along with lots of sidequests, different kinds of loot and intensive gameplay. Not to mention the special graphics that only this game has. However, as I said this game is sort of hilarious, and to some this may be a downside since the game rarely takes the story seriously, so if you're looking for a ""serious"" game then this might not be what you're looking for, besides that, get it now!

												BorderlandsThere is so much I can say about this game good and bad, though mostly good. Like for example: The Gun-play in this game is very very good, it is very fun, it can be challenging (especially if you havn't played many FPS's before, like me), you'd think looking for loot would be boring but it isn't, it is always a treat to find a new gun or shield or a grenade mod that you feel suit you better than the last one. Another very good thing in this game is the dialogue and the writing, it is absolutly hilarious, if you don't burst out laughing at how fun the dialogue is then I do senserly feel bad for you. It took a few mintues for the game with it writing alone to hook me right on for the rest of the experience. And the RPG elements in form of skill progression is appreciated, especially for one such as me (a.k.a RPG lover).Unfortunetly there is a part of that game that is severly lacking, and that is the story. What story is there is very basic but  I found that the writing that was there still made it enjoyable. And all the boss battles you'll have along the way are fun. But to give a basic introduction to the story of Borderlands (No Story Spoilers): 'You play as one of four different Vault Hunters who arrive on the planet Pandora (no not that one) to seek out the treasured Vault said to contained riches beyond imagination and you are being lead to it by your ""Guardian Angel"".'However the ending isn't anything so write home about, it is disappointing and it does bring down the score and as unfortunate as it is it does take away a little from what the game tried to do.One last thing I should mention before I give my score is the co-op, I highly recommend playing with friends who also own the game. I did this I cannot even describe how much fun it was in the end, but to tell of the co-op. The way it works is that the more players there are in the game the harder the enemies will be, BUT and this is a big but (hence why I wrote it in caps) they also drop better loot. So it will become more of a challenge, more fun and more rewards.My verdict for Borderlands is a Good game and I highly recommend it to just about everyone as long as you don't mind FPS's or doesn't like playing with others.Score: Good!Thought the review was over? No not quite I want to tell you about the DLC's for this game as well. Three of them I would recommend and the fourth only if you like Arena Challenges. The four campaign dlcs are as follows (and the order you should play them in, after the main game).Dr. Ned's Zombie Island: This is a zombie DLC, but it isn't at all boring, quite the opposite in fact. It is mostly very fun, there is 1 quest that is very grindy and takes a lot of time to complete but overall I recommend it. And even as weird as it sounds a little but more story starts to come forward in this.Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot: This is a Arena DLC and a very annoying one at that, it was fun for the first couple of hours and the first Arena Challenge ""Prove Yourself"" was genuninly fun. But then the larger challenges was also fun when I started it up but it became boring and grindy a while in. And it never felt like it was worth doing since you gain no exp or weapon skill or anything, the reward for completing the quests didn't feel worth it either. I would only recommend it if you are really into Arena fighting.General Knoxx Secret Armory: This is what a DLC should be like, adds more to the story, feels relevant and deals with the consequences of the Main Storys ending. It is hilarious as always and as I played through I felt more and more drawn into the world of Pandora (no not that one). Highly Recommended.Claptrap's New Robot Revolution: The best DLC of them all and part of the reason you should play the other dlcs as well, since the DLC continues to build on the endings of the Main Story, Dr. Ned's Zombie Island and General Knoxx Secret Armory. This DLC truly captures the best that the rest original Borderlands and its other DLC has already created and does it all very well. Highly Recommended.And finally if you've made it this far down (which I doubt), then I just have one final thing to say: ""Buy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game already!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is the first in a groundbreaking series of games that changed the face of shoot n loots forever. Borderlands 1 by itself is a great game, but with community mods, multiplayer, and dlcs, the game turns into something amazing. I played it on my ps3 for a little bit when it first came out, but it got boring on console due to the lack of friends that would want to play Borderlands, but now, its amazing. If you are looking for a shoot n loot/rpg game that is easy to run on your pc, this is it. If you can't run it right away try right clicking in in your steam library and going to startup options ad putting in ""-dx9"" without the """"s.

												Borderlands is a fantastic game. Whether you play alone or with three of your buddies, youre definately going to add on hours fast. The story is that youre basically looking for a vault filled with treasure from a long told legend, ""The Legend of The Vault."" You can choose to play as one of four characters, all with unique traits and special abilities. The gameplay is very solid and super fun. You begin at level one and progress earning experience points by killing things, completing quests, and finishing challenges. One more thing, LOOT!! Loot plays a huge role in this game. There are rarity levels(White - Green - Blue - Purple - Orange) of loot and many types of equipment ranging from shields and grenades to rifles and rocket launchers. The game also generates thousands of weapons at all rarity types so the probability of finding the same weapon is near to impossible.8.8 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands brought something new to the table and if you like RPG / FPS games then you will definitely love Borderlands. 4 classes to pick from each with different specialities which can be tailored to your liking and a random gun generator keep the gameplay fresh each time, it also has online multiplayer with 4 characters in a co-operative mode (although there is an arena and duels if you want also). Borderlands can be ran through in several hours if you only do the base story, each DLC adds several additional hours and the side quests can easily bring the total to 100+ hours of gameplay. I've completed all achievements on Steam and XBL and can honestly say it's perhaps one of the best games I ever bought.The game is very lighthearted and some of the characters add a lot of humour to the gameplay, the storyline itself isn't exceptional but you will often find yourself taking up sidequest after sidequest to get that extra loot. The game even features its own inbuilt challenges, allowing for proficiency enhancement with your favourite guns & extra experience for doing basics such as looting, killing, even getting a vehicle airborne for several seconds!Only downsides are some of the achievements, and the underdome is a little too long, that's only 1 part of the game though and the rest more than makes up for it.Can't go wrong with this game!

												its a little boring at the start but after a few hours it gets really fun. This game is a classic and definately worth the money. It is the pure and unpolished form of borderlands 2. While it has no minimap and you have to pick up all the ammo and money from the ground yourself instead of just walking over it, the characters look better than in bl2, i.e. skags badass skags can be really scary here instead of just being bigger versions of the almost huggable skags in bl2. The overal atmosphere in this game truly pays tribute to the title. The plot is amazing. 10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have watched Mad Max, then you should really play this game. This game takes a desert world, and let's you play through the entire game in a similarr environment, without getting boring. That is true game design right there. For example, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel has most of it's environment on the moon, and that game to me is quite boring. As far as the Plot goes for this game, it's nothing too spectacular, however, the overall story is rememberable and enjoyable. Gameplay wise, I think it's a perfect merger of FPS and RPG, as your skill point alloccation really changes your gameplay with new and powerful techniques. Sniping is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however, the other guns are powerful, and the better guns have a rare drop rate that you can farm in certain circumstances; the DLC's have the most availabity,a nd the main game sucks for it. This game is multiplayer, however, when I've played it with a friend, it was laggy, and very precise with the missions (as in you need to be on the exact mission bit to turn in the mission, no skipping).If there is anything to take away from this, it's that this game is amazing, however,  if you want a great Borderlands expereience, go for Borderlands 2, then comeback to this one, as it can be glitchy, it punches in the face with it's ♥♥♥♥-you interactions (it's very enduring, nbot a bad thing(it's hard to explain)), and I think it gets cleaned up a lot in the sequel. I do prefer this game over the sequel, and I love this franchise so much. 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The co-op is excellent and the world is a bizarre, backwoods wasteland with a  tongue in cheek crude sense of humor humor. It's a loot game and there's always new weapons to pickup. The story is good althought the ending is a bit lackluster, but who cares. You're here to shoot everything that moves and ask questions later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not much story, but the action is fun.  You have to like your First Person Shooters to enjoy it because that is all the game is, Shooting.  The game is structured similarity to Diablo 2.  You get quests, leave town, kill things, back to town, hand in and sell your loot.  Borderlands has a levelling system which makes the game less dependent on player skill, and much more dependent on player level and talents.  The whole game feels a little too ""Pen and Paper""ish.  This is not helped by some of the failures of the engine. The one that annoyed me the most was enemies reacting to my shots before my bullets even hit them.  This was particularly obvious when sniping.  Although it suffers for being a console port, it is still a fun game.  It does have a terrible FOV but you can change it on the fly with only a quick edit of .ini file.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're a fan of the ""Lootin' n Shootin'"" genre, this game is for you. While it might not be as pretty or fleshed out as the succeeding titles, it still holds up remarkably well even to this day and has plenty to offer in terms of gameplay. Not to mention the fact that if you buy the Calptrap's New Robot Revolution DLC, you finally get the chance to kill (literally hundreds) of Claptraps any way you like. If that's not a major selling point then I don't know what is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets Just get right to the TLDR cause this game doesn't need a long review. It's just fantastic and worth it's full price. The art style is timeless, the gunplay is polished and impactful. The loot mechanics are addicting in a good way. The story is tongue in cheek with some seriously hilarious writing. It has a significant amount of dlc content, which is all great. For me this game is truly a classic.

												Pretty sure everyone has said all there is to say about Borderlands. I'll give you my 2 cents though... in a quick manner. My second playthrough about 2 years after I first played through it. Enjoyed the main campaign a lot more, the variation of loot is always good. The gameplay gets pretty stale later in the game, especially during the DLC.I didn't really like the fact that I couldnt have the graphical settings on full and get less than 30 fps, my rig is more than capable of being able to handle this game 6 years after release. I've read in places though, that the game is not very well ported for pc. For me, it was all about the exploration, the experience and story. Kinda wish they would have just left it at the main campaign and forgot about some of the DLC because the Knoxx add on just draaaaaggged on, Moxies was kinda pointless, Neds was ok and so was Claptraps. Otherwise a very uniqe and memorable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands 1 is the prequel to Borderloands 2. I don't know, I played like 2 minutes of this game then thought ""Why the hell am I playing this when I have Borderloands 2?"" so I uninstalled it and never played it again. 1/6 for thats how long i played. I know I said two minutes before, but that's become some sort of stupid joke that I keep making. I'm sure I won't find it funny in a year or TWO. Make sure to get rich black friend to gift for u. Otherwise, by a a sailboat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands has givem me a fun story driven adventure.  It has loot mechanics similar to Diablo yet it delivers a FPS style gameplay experience that is not overly frustrating for casual players like myself.The DLC's also further the story.  Mad Moxxi's Underdome is too frsutrating but I have enjoyed the Zombie Island of Dr Ned and am playing through the General Knoxx campaign.This is one to definitely grab especially when it goes on sale.

												This game is alot of get guns kill things get bigger guns kill bigger things, but it truly is loads of fun to play. It has a great sense of humor, it has tons of enemies, way more guns then there are in every COD game combined, lots of side stuff to keep you interested, and the cartoony art style is a nice break from all the gritty next gen super realistic stuff. There's also alot of strategy involved because you can only carry so many guns/items at one time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tired of the same old first person shooters, with all their ""engaging gameplay"" or ""non-repetitive quests"" or ""variable color palettes?"" Then Borderlands is for you! With the most cutting edge graphic capabilities, this game can constantly render up to 450 shades of brown, including Autumn, Rust, Sienna, and few more! Also, the ending is really something that will leave you speechless. I wholeheartedly recommend gifting this game to anyone you hate, and watch them squirm as they try to appreciate it.

												This game is one of a kind, bringing RPG and Shooter together with its great art style and crude humor. You can choose between 4 different characters, all with different stats and abilities, and then you go on an epic adventure of loot and battles which will blow your mind and keep you busy for hours.I would like to go over some problems the game has, though.No FOV slider- If you want to change your FOV, you have to go into the files and add your own hotkey for changing it. This problem was resolved in Borderlands 2 +No fast travelling to DLC areas- You can only fast travel to the starting area of a DLC, so if you are really far into the DLC you can't fast travel to your current quests are, you have to walk all the way there. This doesn't seem like a huge deal but when you are trying to farm bosses or something it gets super ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This problem was resolved in Borderlands 2 +No official mod support- This is a problem with all Borderlands games, they are almost un modable. Borderlands 1 is probably the most modable of the 3, but even thats pretty eh. Hopefully the next game has official mod support.Story- Most people complain that this game doesn't really have a story. I don't care since I don't spend the hundreds of hours I've spent in Borderlands for the story. But even then, it does have a story behind, the problem being that it tells most of it is told through text whenever you accept or hand in a quest. This problem is resolved in Borderlands 2 + though.The challenges- This is another problem fixed within the new Borderlands. Borderlands has a challenge system, which is much better in Borderlands 2 + with its badass ranks and stuff. In borderlands 1 its only really used to earn extra xp, but some of the challenges are ridiculous to complete. Like, for example, Winning 1000 duels. This means that you have to sit there for hours, winning duels with another player over and over and over again just to complete it. Luckily there is no achievement to complete every challenge in this game.Being someone who has played Borderlands since it first came out in 2009 (On Xbox), I think its fair to say that I am a pretty hardcore Borderlands fan. I would highly recommend every single Borderlands game to anyone interested in shooters or RPGs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TIME TO POUND...SOME MEAT PUPPETSAnd with that quote out of the way, onto the actual review of sorts.At first, I didn't like the game. But I'm a stupid, biased son of a skag that started with BL2. I thought BL was too empty, too dead, too devoid of any charm or...anything really. But, just like WATCH_DOGS, the more I played it, the more I came to absolutely love this game.It's Pandora, nobody cares about this place.It's got it own crude humor that I love.And the loot is so much more damn generous. I never thought I'd see two legendaries in the same vendor.HEY, if you're reading this, you've reached the end. Now stop reading and buy the game already! You steam library will thank you for it!

												Giving this a thumbs up because I'm a big fan of Borderlands 2. However, very shortly after playing this one, you can tell how and why BL2 exists. It's a great foundation, but was never taken to that next level. I feel weird walking around... like the camera is out in front of my body a foot or two. The menus and text are layed out odd. Coloring in area's feel weird.It's like they took a great concept and brought it to 95% complete. In BL2, you can tell a HUGE difference in just how everything feels. If you're looking to get more out of your Borderlands story and haven't played this, go for it. If you're new to Borderlands, i'd recommend BL2. You won't miss much, and you'll get a much better finely tuned product.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands is the first in a groundbreaking series of games that changed the face of shoot n loots forever. Borderlands 1 by itself is a great game, but with community mods, multiplayer, and dlcs, the game turns into something amazing. I played it on my ps3 for a little bit when it first came out, but it got boring on console due to the lack of friends that would want to play Borderlands, but now, its amazing. If you are looking for a shoot n loot/rpg game that is easy to run on your pc, this is it. If you can't run it right away try right clicking in in your steam library and going to startup options ad putting in ""-dx9"" without the """"s.

												Borderlands     It is the first of its kind, a FPS/RPG game. It has cell-shaded graphics which gives it its unique-ness. It has 3 skill trees per class and their are four class. Soldier, Hunter, Berserker, and Siren. They all have different playstyles, but all in all, its the same game. The game is ment for co-op, but the multiplayer is a little odd the PC. I believe steam is adding steamworks though the game is 5 years old. Super-fun shoot and loot, grab a buddy and explore Pandora. I do recommend the DLC, they all have the perks.Heard you huntin' for that Vault. You know, even if it weren't hogwash, would it matter? What're you gonna do with treasure anyhow?

												Just finished Borderlands. And it is safe to say I'm definately going to move on to the sequel. I was rather apprehensive about playing this with a gamepad on my 360 / PS3. And I have to say I'm glad I waited to play it on PC. The controls are pretty nailed and solid on start up. Only thing I changed was putting my Melee on Mouse-3. Personal preference. The Narrative in Borderlands (In my opinion) Isn't extremely important to have a good time. I usually dislike RPG's with quite a passion. However, The RPG elements in Borderlands work absolutely perfectly. I played through with a Soldier, And mainly maxed out my 1st skill tree, Which definately worked for my single player walkthrough. My university lecturer reccomended this game to play with friends, However, If you do want to play solo, It Isn't broken in the slightest. But destroying things with 4 people would have been a great blast. The loot system in this game is incredible. Never once did I feel like looking at all of the loot was a waste of time, And I was very excited to see what I would find every time something dropped. Even when Half of it actually turned out to be useless. The solo campaign took me about 17 Hours, and theres 100's more hours of sidequests which you can do. So its safe to say this game definately isn't lacking in content. My only gripe about this game is I'm a massive soundtrack nerd. And the soundtrack in the game is rather bland and samey, Which for me kinda sucked, But thats nothing when you put it next to the awesome gameplay and comedy. Would reccomend to at least play through once. 8/10 Claptraps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was awesome like Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel. But, the HUD just differents with the Borderlands 2 and Pre Sequel. Good job for the future. I like the fastest graphics. So, maybe on the future Borderlands have to make fastest graphics for all users. Thanks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick Summary – A First Person Shooter in an open world with a random loot drop system so you can grind for awesome weapons. Multiplayer co-op is built into the game so you can play with your friends, but you may want to go through it the first time by yourself so you can take your time and absorb the story. Overall a great game that will take you a long time to complete, especially if you play the game in “hard mode” after beating the story.You take on the role of one of 4 “vault hunters” recently arrived on the planet Pandora, searching for a mythical alien Vault, supposedly filled with treasure and advanced technology. While each of the playable characters has their own backstory, the real flavor of the game comes from the colorful characters that you meet during your journey. Not only are you up against the huge bandit population, but Pandora is stocked up on alien wildlife, and the powerful Crimson Lance army is here to claim the Vault for themselves.The game is played in the first person perspective, and most of the combat is with the various guns and grenades that you find all over the place. Borderlands was advertised as having millions of different guns, and this is technically true. There’s a behind-the-scenes weapon “component” system that randomly determines the attributes of every gun you can find (even the unique quest rewards and legendary weapons). 2 guns can have almost the exact same specs but one has slightly higher damage, meaning these are 2 different guns. For gameplay purposes though, just find the most powerful weapons you can get with a nice variety of “elemental damage” (fire, lightning, corrosive) so that you can do bonus damage to any different types.It’s not all about shooting though, the game also has an RPG-like skill system. When you level up you get a skill point to put into one of your passive skills, most of which are built around your character’s unique special ability. Depending on how you allocate your skills, your gameplay style will change drastically. Note that buying a skill respec is easy and inexpensive in this game, so feel free to try out various styles. Roland the soldier is good for beginners and Brick the berserker is good for experienced players in my opinion. Pros:+”Drop in” co-op multiplayer where you can just join a friend’s game and play along with them. The biggest difference between multiplayer and singleplayer is that if you’re with a friend, they can rescue you if you go down. If you’re by yourself and get taken down, you need to get a “second wind” by killing an enemy in about 5 seconds or you die.+There’s a huge number of side quests, and if you do them all you may find yourself a bit overlevelled. It’s worth it though, to experience the story and background of Pandora. Something I wasn’t initially aware of, is that you do reduced damage to enemies that are higher level than you. If you’re having trouble in an area, go do some side quests and when you level up, the enemies will be easier even though you’re using the same weapons.+As mentioned before, there are a lot of characters to talk to and work with during the game. Even the enemies can be funny (right before you kill them). Cons:-I really only noticed this after playing Borderlands 2, but in this first game it’s easy to miss the “flavor text” when starting a quest. It’s not read to you aloud, you actually have to scroll/read through it even though it’s presented as someone “talking to you.” Just a minor hindrance and it’s only a problem when you’re accepting a bunch of quests at the same time (you might miss out on why you’re doing a particular quest).-Playing the DLC missions can be a real grind fest. Especially the brain collecting missions in the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, and the arena matches in the Underdome. The DLC are definitely fun and worth playing through, but some of the collection quests take forever (just skip them if you want).If you’re going to try playing the game to its completion with all the DLCs, expect to spend at least 30-40 hours. There are a bunch of Steam achievements and many of them are easily obtainable if you don’t mind spending the time (there are no “beat the game on super hard difficulty” type achievements. The ones that may give you trouble are the DLC tournament missions which you may give up on out of boredom, and the collectible achievements in the DLC New Robot Revolution.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What Borderlands does better than anything is establish something deep and compelling quickly and with very little material. Though it might be more accurate to say that Borderlands is just very good at standing on the shoulders of giants. With clever use of archetypes, characters feel fully developed from the word go. The same can be said about the world of Pandora in which description is supplanted by an evocative soundtrack. There is no exposition detailing any of this depth, but the game still manages to imply it. Part of the reason this does nothing to disrupt the suspension of disbelief is that story is not at the game's center. Borderlands is about running around, killing varied enemies with varied weakpoints, and sorting through an infinite selection of weapons for the best one; anything else is secondary. None of that is terribly original, but every part of it is just so competently executed that it's a joy all the same. The little details the game does add, mostly through skippable mission dialogues, serve best as the context that leaves old, tedious actions feeling new and exciting. The RPG elements, namely the character skills, do much to relieve that tedium as well while also doing more to explain who the player characters are than any biography could. The four DLC packs do attempt to fill in some of the blanks left behind by the game's 'on-the-go' design philosophy, each with surprising extensive additions, Mad Moxxi's Underdome excluded. That pack does include a needed banking system, but unless you love the shooting aspect of Borderlands so much that you're aching to do it in one of three small arenas for hordes on hordes of the same enemies, it would be better to skip that one. The other three, however, add and flesh out new characters along with developing old ones, all clocking in at around three to five hours each. While they do stand as worthy expansions of the main game's content, they just can't match the amount of flavor and enjoyment the main game has to offer. It's a bit of a shame then that this 7-year-old game isn't going to be getting anymore plot-hole filling expansions at this point, but that disappointment only goes to show how well it's aged and how much it still has to offer.

												If you plan on playing the Borderlands series for the very first time, I definitely suggest starting with the first game. You may think that this is customary, and 'of course i'll start with the first game!"" but i'm warning you that if you start with BL2 and go back to play the first game, you may get bored. The first game is not as story heavy and the characters you meet don't quite feel as important or connected as they do in the second game. But the first is still definitely worth playing and is a good introduction to the world of Pandora!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an awesome game. Lots of good fun to be had. It's more than a bit like Diablo but with asplodey guns that go bang bang in first person and make the baddies heads pop! There's a good deal of originality and flavor to be had, though not the deepest main story. Bit rough around the edges too, but it's too much fun to get overly annoyed at that. The visual style is something you'll either enjoy or not, but it is great to not see gritty realism for once. Pro tip, probably best to stick either with multiplayer with friends or go single player on any one playthrough, as grouping while in different bits of the game was kind of (extremely) poorly implemented. 4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone who has played games since the age of 8 (that's 18 years on the trott now), I can safely say this is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. The amount of things you can do in the game is staggering. You choose how want to progress through the missions, either you stick to the plot ones to the storyline, or you can choose to do all the other missions and side missions first and come back to the main ones.There are 4 playable characters, each with their own special skill and focus regarding weaponry. The game uses a experience based progression system helping the player level up. After each level the player gains a skill point that they can choose to apply in 3 different branches for their character, thereby choosing the attributes they want. In terms of the graphics, the game uses a almost cartoon like style. Some of the maps really are huge with a generous amount of detail within. There are a couple of glitches and bugs, but not enough to detract from the wonderful game experience. If you haven't played any of the games in the Borderlands series, do yourself a favour and pick this first one up. It is the most streamlined of all the games, but in no way lacking in quality.

												Borderlands is a fantastic game. Whether you play alone or with three of your buddies, youre definately going to add on hours fast. The story is that youre basically looking for a vault filled with treasure from a long told legend, ""The Legend of The Vault."" You can choose to play as one of four characters, all with unique traits and special abilities. The gameplay is very solid and super fun. You begin at level one and progress earning experience points by killing things, completing quests, and finishing challenges. One more thing, LOOT!! Loot plays a huge role in this game. There are rarity levels(White - Green - Blue - Purple - Orange) of loot and many types of equipment ranging from shields and grenades to rifles and rocket launchers. The game also generates thousands of weapons at all rarity types so the probability of finding the same weapon is near to impossible.8.8 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can play for hours dipping in and out to complete a few missions here and there or have a mad day long Borderlands spree only remembering to sleep when I drop the controller. It does have its floors in that a lot of the questing is very repetative and having to go from place to place then back again then to somewhere else the other side of the world and then back to the place you started can be annoying. I believe these are the only down sides I have to this game. Buy it and enjoy people :-)p.s. I must add that almost all mof my game play, 500+, was on the xbox version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of my few complaints though is that enemies can feel somewhat cheap at times. For some of the later missions you might find youself doing a bit of grinding to raise your level since the difficulty of the mission depends on what level you are currently at.

												Highly addictive.Great Replay Value.Fun to play as a single player game but would recommend playing this in Coop.Big issue with game was the driving as you can get caught in invisible barriers quite a lot which is quite frustrating. Story was ok but you don't really play these games for the story.DLCs are great.Get the GOTY edition.Overall Score: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was my gateway drug to enjoying singleplayer experiences. I used to primarily play multiplayer shooters like Battlefield, but I decided to give Borderlands a go during a long vacation and I got sucked in hard. It's difficult to compare to other ""questy"" games when this was my first... I even like it more than Borderlands 2. Just the right combination of atmosphere, discovery, challenge and tight gunplay. Just like Sade once sang... it's never as good as the first time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The color/lighting/shading in this game use to give me a migrane. After I figured out that adjusting the saturation was all it took everything changed. Granted I don't play it as much as some of my other games. But it's in my top 5. Controls are easily learned.Dialog is great.Mission difficulty ranges from casual to monitor smashing.

												This is nothing less than sheer enjoyment. The setting is a perfect combination of wild west frontier and off-world alien planet. It sets the scene for a myriad of goal based missions that though essentially based on the same mold you never get tired of going for. There is a point when the missions do get repetitive, around the mid-point of my second play through, but the drop-in-drop-out save by location mechanism means you can play as much as you want and leave it, till your ready for the next time.Where Borderlands really excels though is the unique character types available and their diverging skill sets. This means you can choose a character that suits your particular play style and further customize it, to your preferred killing style - NICE!Singleplayer is great, but multiplayer is even better...  increasing the amount of fun to be had ten-fold! It also works seemlessly so you can switch between the two types with different characters.  Weapons-wise though the range is there, the best weapon you can get hold of is essentially the one you like best. This was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. The range is there but the differences are so slight I didnt bother changing loadout too often.Finally the DLC are all worth getting. Ive completed ZED Island and that was significant compared to the cost. Cant wait to try the others out. All in all worth the money and then some! Can't recommend this enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands.What can I say about this classic piece of art? It's fun and well a treasure in my book. I played this game first on my PS3. When that was ruined(my PS3) I seen it on here so I decided to buy it. Man I forgot what I was missing, i'm glad I bought it again and played it. Anyway, Borderlands is one of those games that are great for passing time or just wanting to kill a lot of things with a variety of weapons. Now I hope to get the other two in the future. It's a great game and I recommend everyone give it a SHOT. Get it? HA!(corny joke). ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before, I made a review about this when I was in the 6th grade. To this day, the game still holds up as one of my favorite to play, after what I would say is a decently long time, since I graduated since then and have played many games with story aspects that would rival this (like skyrim). I'd say however, that if you want to get this dont expect to do multiplayer since it was powered by gamespy at the time, which is now down. I havent bothered to look into a fix for multiplayer since I mostly played offline. All in all the game is a structurally sound masterpiece (comparing to more recent titles) and I would say that the more recent borderlands games have lost the challenge and excitement that the earlier 2 games had, that ESPECIALLY this game had.

												EDIT: Now that Valve has made servers for Borderlands online play, I have decided to change my review of this game from negative to positive.While many may consider it an instant classic, having played Borderlands 2 before the first one, my expectations were much higher. In Borderlands, you play as an errand boy. You run around doing whatever you're told to and in exchange recieve just enough XP and money to survive in the game. Useful items are scarce, the little story the game features is dry, bosses are boring, the entire world lacks color and character balance is non-existant. Having loved her in the sequel, Lilith was the first character I chose and every mission was a drag with her. The other three choices were fun to use, but Lilith is just so useless, she even has abilities that screw you over (one of them makes you leave a trail of fire behind you, which seems great until you realize how many explosive barrels you walk by). Rather than being the hero Pandora has been dying for, you're forced to do everyone's chores in the world's greatest drive-here-do-this-shoot-that-collect-this-talk-to-him-find-this-walk-here game for PC. There aren't even servers availble for multiplayer, since Game Spy decided to quit unexpectedly. The only reason I had bought this game was to play with friends, because I know how dull Borderlands is single-player. I wouldn't call Borderlands 1 a bad game, but it has flaws. Luckily, the game's problems were all fixed in the sequel. If you're a die-hard Borderlands fan, I'd suggest getting this, but if you're new to the series start with Borderlands 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A shooter with RPG elements and great for anyone who loves a game full of loot. The characters are great and all different in their own unique ways.

												Borderlands brought something new to the table and if you like RPG / FPS games then you will definitely love Borderlands. 4 classes to pick from each with different specialities which can be tailored to your liking and a random gun generator keep the gameplay fresh each time, it also has online multiplayer with 4 characters in a co-operative mode (although there is an arena and duels if you want also). Borderlands can be ran through in several hours if you only do the base story, each DLC adds several additional hours and the side quests can easily bring the total to 100+ hours of gameplay. I've completed all achievements on Steam and XBL and can honestly say it's perhaps one of the best games I ever bought.The game is very lighthearted and some of the characters add a lot of humour to the gameplay, the storyline itself isn't exceptional but you will often find yourself taking up sidequest after sidequest to get that extra loot. The game even features its own inbuilt challenges, allowing for proficiency enhancement with your favourite guns & extra experience for doing basics such as looting, killing, even getting a vehicle airborne for several seconds!Only downsides are some of the achievements, and the underdome is a little too long, that's only 1 part of the game though and the rest more than makes up for it.Can't go wrong with this game!

												If you have watched Mad Max, then you should really play this game. This game takes a desert world, and let's you play through the entire game in a similarr environment, without getting boring. That is true game design right there. For example, Borderlands: the Pre-Sequel has most of it's environment on the moon, and that game to me is quite boring. As far as the Plot goes for this game, it's nothing too spectacular, however, the overall story is rememberable and enjoyable. Gameplay wise, I think it's a perfect merger of FPS and RPG, as your skill point alloccation really changes your gameplay with new and powerful techniques. Sniping is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however, the other guns are powerful, and the better guns have a rare drop rate that you can farm in certain circumstances; the DLC's have the most availabity,a nd the main game sucks for it. This game is multiplayer, however, when I've played it with a friend, it was laggy, and very precise with the missions (as in you need to be on the exact mission bit to turn in the mission, no skipping).If there is anything to take away from this, it's that this game is amazing, however,  if you want a great Borderlands expereience, go for Borderlands 2, then comeback to this one, as it can be glitchy, it punches in the face with it's ♥♥♥♥-you interactions (it's very enduring, nbot a bad thing(it's hard to explain)), and I think it gets cleaned up a lot in the sequel. I do prefer this game over the sequel, and I love this franchise so much. 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I usually just play multiplayer online for versus modes or mmorpg. But never for co-op FPS team game. This introduced me to a whole array of looting craziness, hours upon hours of running around maps to do quests and having WTF moments with team mates when we go and deal with Boss fights.If you enjoyed playing the latest Borderlands version (2), then you should definitely try the original. You will feel right at home with it and you will also get to know the characters and the story of Pandora a whole lot more.Borderlands 1 is a great buy especially if you have friends you can play the game with.

												This game is pretty much perfect. You can spend so much time playing through the main storyline (twice with the same character as a result of Hardcore mode) and completing every sidequest available, just to doo it all over again with a new character. Add some friends, and it's a party. If I could make a few suggestions if you're someone who would be interested in buying this game, buy the GotY edition. I bought it for 15 bucks during the christmas sale, and it was money well spent. Each of the DLCs for this game can add another 10 hours of play time. Second, start off as Brick if you're completely new to the game, his muscle mass and hilarious look of him wielding a tiny SMG are things you can't forget about. If you're squeamish, good luck trying to bleach your brain of Borderlands, but this game is incredible in a special way, in that it's a game you can have endless amounts of fun playing.

												Borderlands is the first game of the Borderlands trilogy and it's an ok start to the series. This FPS with RPG elements a is stupid and violent looter shooter, so if that's your thing, grab yourself a friend (or 3) and fight your way through the deserted, eponymous, cel shaded Borderlands of Pandora, quite honestly a♥♥♥♥♥♥hole of a planet, as one of four classes.Pros:-One playthrough (with all DLC except the arenas) can last up to 60 hours depending on how thorough you complete quests-Playable in coop with up to 3 friends-4 different classes with unique skills, each with 3 skill trees you can combine after your hearts content-Effectively an endless amount of weapons with some juicy abilities-Big and diverse world-Action packed fights-Graphics-HumourCons:-Some bugs and glitches-Some quests may be repetitive-Depending on your equipment there can be segments which are full of bullet sponges and tough to get through-Story is pretty much non-interactive-Quite some DLC-Graphics-HumourPersonal opinion:Borderlands is an ok game as far as I'm concerned. If you're a diehard fan of the Borderlands series, then why don't you have it already? If you are looking for a good entry into the series, I'd recommend to start with Borderlands 2. Sure, there are some characters in Borderlands 2 that you would know a little bit more about if you played the first one, and some areas would be cool to go back to, but the second part is just way better rounded out and honestly, the narrative is not what makes you want to play a Borderlands game. Borderlands hasn't aged all that well, and it's not even all that old. If you can get it cheap, grab yourself a friend and play it, otherwise, there's not much harm in skipping this one. It's not bad, but it's not too great either, especially when there are two newer Borderlands games to choose from.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has multiple classes, special graphic style and many secondary quests with pretty good main story.1. StoryIt is not complicated one but it keeps you going. It will definitely take you some time to get to the end of it. The big finale was pretty insteresting eventhough the last fight was very easy, although the boss looked cool. The main story has some twists, but nothing that surprising. It also had some awesome voiceovers, especially the robots :)2. GraphicBorderlands has definitely its own graphic style and even I played this game many years late, I still had no problems with the graphic quality. I had to get used to the style, but never had some major issues.3. GameplayAlright. This one gets a little bit tricky. Some guns on some enemies acted weird and eventhough I hit 100% headshot, I didn't kill the enemy. The guns are pretty fun and it's nice that you have many options and can hold up to 4 guns at the same time. Also some other gears to put on later stage. Eventhough there is the car system and port system, there is going to be a lot of running. You can't go everywhere in your cart and shoot everything easy with it which I really liked because that would be just dumb. The gameplay itself could get sometimes repetetive and even intense because even with really good weapons and headshots it took a lot to kill the enemy and if there was more of them, well, then it was not pleasant. You get respawn though, but it cost you money. The money it cost is calculated on how much money you own at the moment which was nice. Also if you die you actually don't die right away and you get a chance to kill enemy which pops ""second wind"", basicly resurecting you on spot which was very handy. Although there was some weird things with some guns I enjoyed the gun play and the special class skill was also pretty cool.4. Final wordsFinishing this game took some time and I got sometimes a little bit bored, but it kept me going. Only thing what bothered me was that I had to clear some areas over and over again and a lot of running didn't help either. Nice touch is that you some enemies have different weak spots so you just dont go headshot everything. Story was decent and gameplay was enjoyable enough.7/10 - Good game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome. Although many people will say that this games sequel ""Borderlands 2"" is the better game, I feel as though both games are equally good, though for their own different reasons. In the original Borderlands, you are thrown into the world of Pandora without knowing anything about it as a player. As you explore the planet, you learn more about the people who live there, as well as grow accustomed to the kind of wildlife that lives there. And you blow it all the hell up. Good times.You play as one of four people: Mordecai: The hunter, Lilith: The siren, Roland: The soldier, and Brick: The Berserker.Mordecai is an expert of long range combat, specializing in sniper rifles. His pet bird Bloodwing assists him in combat by swooping down and attacking enemies with it's claws.Lilith is a Siren Warrior come to Pandora to learn more about her kind. As you progress with her she will enhance her Phase Walking ability in addition to making use of various elemental damage types.Roland is a former Crimson Lance soldier who is now going his own way. He has a special turret he can deploy that guns down enemies for him and restores ally health.Brick is a monsterous wall with legs. Although he is definitly not dumb, he is very simple minded with his approach: Punch everything in the face until it dies. As simple as he thinks however, he is very effective at what he does. If he is ever surrounded by enemies in a locked room, he is not trapped in the room with them, they are trapped in the room with him. He specializes in explosive weapons and anything that packs a punch.Each of these characters is a vault hunter, searching for the mythical Vault on Pandora. The Vault is said to contain countless ritches, enough money to grant it's owner fame, political power, and women (Or in a womans case, men). Guided by a mysterious being called ""The Guardian Angel"" or just Angel for short, they travel across Pandora collecting pieces of the Vault Key to find and open the vault before time runs out and it seals for another 200 years.With your character of choice, you will gradually grow in level as each enemy you kill grants you EXP. As you gain levels, you will gain SP to spend on character specific skills and perks. These skills could be anything from giving your melee attack an elemental effect to increasing how fast you shoot bullets. Each character has 3 trees to choose from, and each tree has different possibilities for different builds. Even two people playing as the same character will be different in capabilities.What's really important though, is the guns. Guns are all over the place on this planet, and they are all yours for the looting. As you travel across the planet, you will occasionally find chests containing guns in them. You can also upgrade your grenades with Grenade mods, allowing you to change them in different ways like leeching enemy health to give to you to setting them on fire. Guns can also drop from things you kill, and you will sometimes find gun loot rooms filled to the brim with chests. Don't expect to find these rooms without earning them though, whether it be by completing a long quest chain or beating a powerful boss. If you aren't having luck with finding a good gun, you could always try buying one from one of Marcus's vending machines. You can also buy Ammo if you aren't finding enough on your journey.The music in this game is fantastic. It's hard to describe, but I guess a try would be that it's a kind of orchastral environmental music. It's beautiful while you are exploring and dramatic while you are in combat. It fits perfectly with the theme of the game, and is definitly worth a listen.The visuals are fantastic too. Everything uses a cartoony cell-shaded look that makes the game look rather timeless. Originally, the game was going to be very realistic in appearence, but they decided on this look instead. Although the original concept video showing these realistic graphics was impressive looking and visually stunning, I am glad they went with this look, not only because it still looks great and will for a much longer time but also because the humorious theme that the borderlands franchise has taken on fits with this visual style much better.The story is simple but well written. The characters you meet are interesting and likable, while the enemies you kill are satisfying to overcome. It doesn't just feel like you are shooting things all the time, you are immersed in the experience, you are a vault hunter overcoming challenges and proving yourself to the world as you search for the vault. You go from being just some stranger to everyone that is going to get yourself killed to a great hero that most everyone respects or fears.Back to my earlier comparison to Borderlands 2, the sequal to the original game that started it all does bring many improvements to the gameplay, such as improved visuals, greater exploration over a larger area, an even better story, etc. But for what it is, Borderlands the original is still a fantastic experience that I can easily recommend to anyone who likes first person shooters. If I had to give any advice, I would say play Borderlands 2 first, If you like Borderlands 2, then give the original a try. This way you will not judge Borderlands 2 by what you experienced in Borderlands 1 in the event that it's not your thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best game I never realised... Until Now...Borderlands appear to be best played with friends. However, I don't really have any gaming friends and I think no one is playing it anymore since this is a 2008 game and I'm only playing it in 2014, so the lobby right now is empty. It's fun, regardless.Weapon loadout is *Dead Island* confusing... I think Dead Island loadouts were inspired by this... Lots of modifiers to keep each weapon pickup unique and confusing at the same time.**I should have written this review a long time ago but Steam got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at me for getting a refund from the unauthorized transactions that I have been trying to reverse; At least the hacker didn't win this time but my community profile got suspended for 3 months**			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands it's like World of Warcraft with guns, and midgets, and violent psychopaths, and violent psychopath midgets with guns that try to kill you like all the time.No, but really, Borderlands it's a pretty cool First Person RPG with an awesome and well writen story that gets even greater with the DLCs that add at least 20+ hours of gameplay.If you've played Borderlands 2 first you will find Borderlands ""slow"" or rather clumsy compared to it's sequel, but of course it's, Borderlands 2 fixed many things that Borderlands missed, but it's an amazing game on it's own glory and should not be dismissed,Geardbox updated it after all this years when GameSpy was shutdown and integrated it with Steamworks so you and your friendos can party up and wreck up mayhem on Pandora together. It's a fun and entertaining game, alone or with friends, and should be given an oportunity for it's great story, clever humor and countless hours of slaugther and loot party. Give it a go when in sale, the GOTY often goes 5 bucks and it's a cheap grab for many many hours of fun, laughs and murdering.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an FPS. It's an RPG. It's an adventure like no other!! Robots, mutants, psychopaths, monsters, enemies, allies, this game has EVERYTHING and MORE.  Huge, beautiful, open landscapes create an expansive environment that will take time to traverse, but there are so many missions, monsters, and treasures to be found that you won't care even if you're wandering around lost.This game sets the standard for the FPS/RPG genre and you must play it.  It's more than worth the cost and you'll enjoy every minute of every hour you spend hunting and looting and levelling and customizing and laughing and crying and JUST PLAY IT ALREADY!!9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
