												Greetings gamer wench! Or should I just call you Tina? I am DEATHSPANK, vanquisher of evil, dispenser of justice and a hero to the downtrodden. Review this game you say? Who needs reviews when we can have disco night? I, DEATHSPANK slay my enemies with impeccable grace while also looking good in purple (no actual chickens were harmed in the duration of this game). My goal is to find THE ARTIFACT, which I need, because of reasons, while my source of power comes from a special thong as well as a finely maintained dental line. But the most important thing of all is that where DEATHSPANK is involved, justice is served just like my tea: with two sugars, a little lemon, and a splash of milk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If DeathSpank has anything to offer, it is charm. And orphans. It's a simple action slash RPG game that does all the heavy lifting for you. All the armor and weapons you receive upgrade automatically, and really the only effort you need to maintain your inventory is making sure you have enough space for everything. There are a lot of side-quests but mostly all of them are pretty simple and straightforward, and aren't really necessary in completing the game. This is a funny game with an outrageous plot and wacky characters, so it just wants you to sit back and have a good time. It's not trying to be more than what it is, and it knows that. I recommend playing the game on Hard if you want some sort of challenge, reading every dialogue option to get the most out of the humor in the game, and to take your time. You can get all the achievements in one play through and it's really all you need.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deathspank is a comedic RPG where the eponymous Deathspank is on an epic quest to find The Artifact, a mysterious item of mysterious mystery. Armed with both heroic strength and sharp wit, Deathspank is a Dispenser of Justice, a Vanquisher of Evil, and a Hero to the Downtrodden. Battle your way through demons, orcs, chickens, leprechauns and many more while completing your quests and filling your bag with awesome loot (and orphans).Whether or not this results in a positive experience really depends on your sense of humor. Personally I found the whole game extremely fun, never frustrating and quite consistently hilarious, however I can appreciate silly “potty humor” which this game is overflowing with.(pun intended)Pros:Witty jokesLampshade hangingThongs and orphansCons:Not enough thongs and orphansNo orphans in thongsp.s. i will edit with pictures.....WHEN STEAM FIXES THEY'RE @!#$%^&*()			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All in all a pretty solid game. The humor is fun if it's your type of humor (ex: She took the ""fun"" out of orphan). The controls are smooth and easy to use (used a controller - not sure if keyboard/mouse is as good). The overall story is decent. The teleport system could have used a bit more guidance. Big + is the achievements are easy to get -- 100% in about 10 hours of gameplay -- for people who go for achievements. I enjoyed the animation as well. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I heard Ron Gilbert was gonna make an Action RPG I was thrilled and, as it turned out, rightly so. I suppose DeathSpank can be best described as the hilarious brother of Diablo. One example for the great humor: ""I once slayed a dragon!"" ""Really? That's amazing!"" ""Well, I didn't really slay it and it wasn't technically a dragon. What I meant to say is: I once kicked a cat!"" My favorite quote of the game!Took me 16 hours to completely finish it (including all achievements) and I had tons of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Diablo 2 meets Monkey Island?""Not so sure about that--but DeathSpank may just be Guybrush's heroic (albeit slightly slow) cousin, sword-spinning his way to defeating evil Lord von Prong. Plenty of bad guys, loot, and, uh, snacks await you on this epic quest.Environments, items and enemies offer plenty of variety. In terms of replayability, there is not much to be had there--although the game may be worth revisiting after a year or two have passed. Multiplayer feels like an afterthought, but it is actually possible to have an (offline) friend assist you at all times.For your money, you're looking at around 6 to 10 hours of gameplay (depending on how you play it and if you want to do all the side quests). You decide if it's worth it. While you're at it, you might want to buy the sequels (DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue and The Baconing) along with this game, or else the ending (or lack thereof) may disappoint you.For me, the verdict is clear: It's great.Works flawlessly in WINE, too.

												""DeathSpank"" is a great little RPG/Hack 'n' Slash game with funny and simple yet interesting story. It has nice cartoon style graphics which just fits perfectly with the colorful world. The atmosphere is really pleasent and the soundtrack is pretty enjoyable while killing creatures. The combat system is fun because it's pretty easy, like the game itself, actually. However, there are some difficult quests which will take you a little more time than usual to beat them. The dialogues are interesting and also, there is a plenty of jokes in them. The characters are interesting, well designed and voice-acted good. Also, there are many items to collect, many weapons to fight with and some delicious food to feed your hungry belly and restore some of your health!Overall, I'd say the game is a little bit childish, but it doesn't matter, because it's super fun. There is also a local co-op and you can invite a friend to play together.+ Graphics - 10/10 Personally, I really like cartoon graphics.+ Story - 7/10 It's kind of a cliche.+ Characters - 10/10 They all have their own individuality.+ Gameplay - 10/10 A variety of quests, with interesting objectives and many other side-tasks.+ World - 10/10 Big map with lots of locations and places to explore.

												Ahh Deathspank! This game is simply wonderfull!DeathSpank, our hero for this story, is an unstopable dispencing machine of justice and awesome humour!He his THE stereotype hero, defending the weak like orphans and defeating unfair villains like not other.While the game is your typical hack and slash looting game, getting better gear as you go along, the mechanics of combat are solid and fun. Especially when you get special moves type weapons, which allows from stunning all surrounding foes to attacking them while spinning like tornado of blade!!But the combat is only one aspect of the fun that is Deathspank! The best part being the humour! There is a lot of it!From the cheesy or quite witty discussions you have with the different characters from this world to the awesome flavour text on your weapon and armour, very well written text while give you some proper intertainement.So with the combat solid, the story interesting and the epic humour of a hero, there not much stopping you into joining DeathSpank the Vanquisher of evil in his rightous quest!

												Deathspank is a cute little Diablo style action RPG that is based entirely at poking fun at RPG stereotypes. Every line of dialog, every character name, every weapon description, hell, every damn thing in the game is an attempt at some form of humor and while most of it falls flat on it's♥♥♥♥♥some of it will make you chuckle.Artistically speaking the game is quite nice looking, the graphics are not great but the art style, where everything and everyone is really just a cardboard cutout, fits nicely with the theme of the game. The voice acting is pretty decent although it's hard to judge that in a game where nobody is supposed to sound serious in the first place.Gameplay is where the game is truly lacking though. You click on an enemy to attack with weapon A and right click for weapon B. The weapons and armor is a completely linear progression and rarely require any input from you.All in all, it's a fun little game that you will likely enjoy if you don't expect too much from it.

												Death Spank is a comedic action RPG similar in gameplay to titles like Diablo. While the game has the traditional tropes of equipment upgrades, character skills, loads of loot and lots of button mashing, the depth and complexity of the RPG elements are scaled back to focus more attention on the comedic narrative.Whether or not this results in a positive experience really depends on your sense of humor. Personally I found the whole game extremely fun, never frustrating and quite consistently hilarious, however I can appreciate silly “potty humor” which this game is overflowing with. There is definitely no challenge in this game once you learn the controls, and while I’ve heard some complaints about this, I feel that it was intentional (and rightfully so) in order to make the game more accessible to people not that into typical aRPG ruthlessness and instead is targeting people looking for a title filled with some great writing and comedy.I got this game a long time ago in a bundle and after playing it through to 100% I regretted not giving it a chance sooner.

												Entertaining for a quick game to jump in and out of when you can't commit a ton of focus to something. It is pretty much always amusing and the style keeps the game fresh enough for as long as it is (about 15-20hrs on average I'd guess for normal difficulty). I've tried the standard Diablo and PoE and Torchlight, etc and they are good too, but this game did it's job, did what it wanted to well, then it ended so I can carry on.The only shortcoming I could say is that it is very apparent they intended a nuch more robust enemy/item system, but all the cool potions and elemental items aren't really needed.Now on to Thongs of Virtue...

												Barebones hack & slash with more style than substance.Gameplay boils down to killing things with little variety in what to kill or what weapons to use; no builds or skills to speak of and equipment is pretty much bigger attack for weapons and bigger HP boost for armor, ensuring little replay value.Story is almost nonexistent, with focus on wacky characters and hit-and-miss humor rather than an actual plot.Graphics are fine: no slowdowns, unintrusive UI and ""2D buildings in 3D areas"" style that's somewhat charming.All dialogues are voiced and voice acting is good; music is not as good and often far too repetitive.Overall not a bad game for its pricetag but every one of the 12 or so hours needed to clear the main campaign could be invested in any other game with better gameplay, story or exploration.

												DeathSpank is a thoroughly mediocre action RPG that takes after Diablo but never manages to be all that entertaining.Probably my biggest mechanical issue with the game is the itemization - there's no randomly generated loot, and almost all items are just straight upgrades that require higher levels to equip. The only exception to these are the weapons which allow you to use your Justice Meter, which also have tiered upgrades, but deciding which of them to use is actually slightly interesting - though I found the spinning swords to be the best of them by far, to the point where I didn't really use the others much. This also affects the stores in the game, which have very little worth purchasing until you're level 18 and can just buy the best equipment in the game - before that point, items are far too expensive, don't offer a huge benefit (unless, as it did for me, the game basically refused to ever drop crossbows for you) and will likely be replaced quickly with items dropped by monsters or found in treasure chests.With the itemization out of the way, the game is on the simple side - except for a few difficulty spikes like the Pip Village, I found Normal to basically be walking through the early game and killing everything in 1-3 hits, and later doing it just as fast from range with the crossbow. There's a variety of consumable items, but I only really used the healing items because it didn't seem like I ever really needed any of the others, or had a clear idea of when element resistance potions or whatnot would even have been useful. So, yeah. The combat wasn't terribly interesting, and neither were the rewards for the combat.The parody elements were occasionally amusing, but frequently fell flat for me - that you're going on a set of stupid fetch quests isn't made any better by the game calling attention to how stupid the fetch quests are, for instance. It's one of my gripes about parody RPGs in general, that they frequently seem to think that it excuses replicating bad game design for the sake of parody. Some of the more puzzle-like quests were amusing, however, and weren't something I was used to in this type of game.Ultimately, DeathSpank is the kind of game I would mostly suggest trying if you think its style of humor would appeal to you. It doesn't really stack up well without that. (Unfortunately, it also seems as if DeathSpank never goes on sale any more, from what I've heard? So I can't even really suggest picking it up on the cheap, even though it's over five years old now.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the funniest, crudest, best damn time you will have, in a 2d action rpg. I love this series, though, I did not like the fact that eventually the game starts to get so much more difficult as you get to the mid to higher levels. Now I am not so wimpy that I cannot handle a challenge, but in some areas, you will be swarmed by enemies, some or all of which are tough enemy types, such as the tough mother spider types (it has been a while since I played so I forget a lot of the enemies) and the Jotuns. Yes, they will have minion types with them that just die in a few hits, but then you get swarmed by a bunch of regular spider types or jotuns or demons or w/e, and you are toast.Now, maybe I am missing something, and there is a trick to it to avoid getting swarmed like that and dying, a lot. But for me, if I die too many times, then it is no longer fun for me. I am not saying I don't like challenging games, I do, I just hate dying every 5 minutes or so, or dying until I figure out the secret... I am in no way saying that makes this game bad, it doesn't, I am saying I am probably a bad player. If you are a fan of crude humor, hilarious plot lines and quests, and hilarious weaponry and quest rewards and action RPGs, then this is your game. If not, or if you are like me and are not a fan of dying, a lot, then this may not be your game, still worth looking at though, to see if you will like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The fourth wall is broken repeatedly as means of telling the story. The gameplay is somewhat clunky in combat on PC, where mouse cursor adjusts where you are facing - meaning you may suddenly expose DeathSpanks back to attack when you just want to move past an enemy slightly. Still, this game is worth some time just for the dialogue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very funny dialogue in this game.  Totally reminds of ""The Tick"" and Big Blue Justice!!!Had me laughing out loud to start with, but did get old, but still humorous after playing through to finish the game.The controls and use of all of the XBOX type control options are done well. Game flows and is pretty easy up until the final battle.  Funny desctiptions of all of the wepaons and other items in the game as well.  Battles became a little monotonous, but didn't detract too much from the game as it goes by quickly.  Very good game that I highly recommend to fans of Tick type humor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If Diablo was a comedy you would get deatspankA brilliant underrated game Simple graphics with a very nice style that compliments the playstyle perfectly.Easy to use and easy to master controls for both controller and keyboard (i've noticed a lot of the time it can be either 1 or the other rarly both) Amazing dialogue that never leaves you bored and will make you chuckel several times (not nessicarily hilarious but highly amusing)If you've ever played torchlight or Diablo you should get to grips with deathspank very quicklyNow ive sung its praises but even a game like this has its faults.A couple of the enemies it expects you to fight early on are a little unfairly strong (i.e the pip's who can kill you in 1 hit) and can be very annoying and makes you feel for a moment like you need to grind up ( which you dont just use ranged attacks and eat )the time it takes before you can move after teleporting was a huge problem for me as it kept throwing me out of the immersion i was in.Overall i give this game a recommend and 4 out of 5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun short game, managed to finish it in 10 hours after checking every single side quest possible and seeing if I missed any passage.But let's get to the general review.Graphics: 8 This game has a pleasant graphics, although nothing overly special. It fits greatly the game style.Gameplay: 8Fun, quick, simple. Hack and slash all your way through hordes of enemies with little consequences. Sadly the game goes only up to level 20, and ends with a rather open ended end so...Replayability: 6Weak point of the game, is that once you did it all...there is nothing left to do. At most, you could attempt to restart the whole game trying to play it in the hardest difficulty setting, but nothing else. If only the ""good/evil"" bar actually did work and changed dialogues and stuff, it would had been more interesting with plenty of reasons to start all over again.Fun: 9I was throroughly amused through the whole game, with each NPC having something funny to say. Side missions, and even the main story has been quite funny, and it's hard to get tired of the simple hack and slashing of the game. Been a while since a game made me smile that much. The hint system works great as anti-frustration device too.Side note: DARN IT, WHY IS THE K RUNE MISSING?Final vote: 8A fun game for anyone that loves humor, fantasy settings, and smashing through waves of enemies.

												Fun action RPG. Lots of interesting quests to do which is nice. All the characters are fully voiced too. Graphics are crisp and works fine with the 360 controller. Couple things that kind of irritated me was the main characters voice- he sounds like Captain Quark from Ratchet and Clank and while its ok at first by the end of the game i was sick of hearing him speak. Also there is a quest to rescue several children -which is a main story quest- but you cant finish until you do other quests first. Not so bad except the game doesnt tell you this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An outstanding unique cartoonish visual presentation compliments the standard gameplay of this genre complete with alternate weapon sets and a well designed inventory mangement system.

												DeathSpank is a solid third person action RPG with a lot of ridiculous humor (my kind :)). It's fairly colorful, so don't expect a style similar to Diablo here. Actually, I'm glad it's colorful. It stands out from the rest this way. Anyway, there is loot (just not a whole lot) and there are quite a lot of quests for a downloadable game. The combat is solid and the skills/weapons are decent but not all that spectacular unfortunately. I did have a lot of fun with it though, and you can expect about 8-9 hours of gameplay. So more than enough. By the way, if you like this game, make sure you try out the other Deathspank games as well.[Rating: 78/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deathspank is best played with a controller, in my opinion, without one the controls are a bit weird and sometimes you move in directions you didin't ask to. It took me about 7 hours to beat the game and I felt bored about 30 minutes during that time, because I had no idea where to go in a certain quest. It's a pretty casual game execpt for 1 or 2 monsters in particular which are quite unbalanced and can cause problems.That game is very hard to review, because, while I had alot of fun and didin't see the time go by... The gameplay is very repetitive and there's not enough weapon variation and different ''skills'' in the game, in my opinion. Shoot until the monster gets to you, smash, smash, block, smash, block, smash, monster dead... That's what you do for about half of the time.I do believe it's worth playing, because of the dumb humor that's just wrong and funny... Though if you're looking for challenging gameplay or have a bad sense of humor, this game is definately not for you!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly good.  I was hesitating whether yo buy it or not, as neither the trailer nor screenshots convinced me, but it was $1 so what the heck. And it turned out to be a great investment. Some lines really cracked me up (especially at the beginning of the game), and the game itself has proven to be not only funny, but also very enjoyable. That's a 10 hour journey that will give you some good laughing and smashing. The last 4 hours felt slighlty like grinding though, but still it's a game you should not miss!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deathspank is diablo gameplay combined with...some absurd humor. I feel as if the humor fits a specific comedy style but I can't recall exactly what that is. In any case, the result is kind of boring. The jokes occasionally elicit a ""...heh."" in classic internet fashion and the gameplay is stale after 5 minutes. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A series of that everyone knows and the fourth part which introduced a modern war. Currently it was released remaster of this production. which is not bad but available only when you buy CoD: Infinite Warfare what I think is pathetic. According to me, this is one of the best CoD's that you can buy. The game is designed in most for the multiplayer gameplay but the main campaign is very good but short, as it always happens with these games. Online game lasts for many hours of fun, however, as once the game was a lot of dynamic now it is about hiding in the corners and wait for the kill. There is not a lot of weapons but it's good because we do not have to check every weapon that suits us. Modes are pretty cool, standard nothing outstanding. In the game there are different kinds of perks that will improve our game for example, faster reload. And if it was not enough in the internet you can find servers with zombie mod which are really cool. I think it's great production from which I have many pleasant memories. Many hours once I lost and so far nothing has changed so much that it is a little less players and there is not that much cheaters in game. Definitely worth it to go back to the game for those few hours to play with friends. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Meh, couldn't be bothered.  Sure, chuckled through some of Deathspank's lines, but the game wasn't there.  Action RPG, wield weapons in both hands, armor auto-equips, minimal ranged abilities means you get plinked to death by the enemy archers, when you die and ressurect you only get minimal health back, lots of time spent eating food to regain health.  Interesting art style makes the world seem like placing a LEGO minifig on a beach ball, so you can have instances where the enemy is over the horizon.  An important note is that this is one game for the price of three, as the story is divided up across the two sequils.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played it for a few hours but even before the first hour ended I just instinctively knew that this game looked a bit awful and would become very monotonous! It quickly gets boring and repetitive. It is only a slight parody of other action RPGs like Diablo & Torchlight but even these hardcore examples are better and Torchlight's cartoonish visuals LOOK A WHOLE LOT better than the art style of Deathspank, which isn't that great to look at. There is NO story to speak of and it's full of fetch quests and even the humour is low-rate (I have NOT laughed at any of the subtle joke inserts in-game!). There are plenty of better ARPGs to try, so forget about Deathspank. There are plenty of better examples with much nicer & more realistic graphics available out there like Sacred, Titan Quest, Loki and Grim Dawn! I'm going to uninstall it enthusiastically.

Shure the humor is pretty good in this game, but after a while it gets onboxious and irritating.The same goes for the gameplay, something that is fun at first soon becomes very grindy and a bit confusing. It looked way more fun in the videos than it really was. I'm shure alot of people liked this game, but I could not force myself to play it thru to the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Has some humor that sometimes gets annoying after a while when death spank repeats some of his line. Combat is pretty simple point n click an enimie till they've dead. Graphics it's a 3d word with 2d models gives it a pop up book effect really coloufull surroundings, the story is pretty flat just have to find items for the next quest or though it doesn't hinder the games over all score of 67/100 not great but playable.

												I have mixed feelings for Deathspank. It's very obvious it's from an Indie developer; the controls are kind of odd, but you can rebind them, or just ignore them like me and hack and slash your way to over 200k damage taken (no death statistic is terrible). The fact that you can't actually turn off click-to-move except while holding down a key is awkward. The music gets repetitive after a while, and it might get confusing as to where to head next. And the questing system is just your generic boring questing system. But where Deathspank shines most is the dialogue, oh my God. Even most item descriptions are pretty random and humerous. The graphics are pretty nice too, I like them, and I also like the very original enemy types (Kangamoos, Bearalopes, and Sabretooth Donkeys come to mind). Dragons look kind of strange, more like reptilian orcs than anything else, but all the others are just amazing and perfect. If you like randomess and don't mind subpar mechanics, you'll enjoy this a lot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You play as the silly hero DeathSpank in his quest to find The Artifact and kill the evil king Lord Von Prong. LVP wants DeathSpank’s magical Thong to become more evil, but in the mean time you need to do some saving of the downtrodden.The overall story isn’t much, but the banter with NPCs is what really makes you crack up with the obvious stabs at RPGs and other games. It will take different shots at the genre without even saying anything some times like one quest has you pleasing an orphan in the Demon Mines to put in your orphan bag. You must run into town and get everything she needs, but the store just so happens to have everything you need when you get there like a cell phone and a pony! This is an obvious jab at RPGs whose stores always have what you need.The game also has some more childish jokes like collecting unicorn poop, finding help letters in dragon poop, and helping villagers make their dirt and stone soup taste better using various animal parts. While this humor may not be funny to all, most will get a kick out of it and DeathSpank is chalk full of it. Of course the gameplay is important to and DeathSpank lets you assign four different weapons at a time to use and there are a ton of weapons, armor, and different types of potions to use. You can even eat various foods to heal up like pizza, fries, magic mushrooms, and root beer. When you whack enough enemies you get to unleash your Justice meter which are power-ups for certain weapons. The game consists of a huge map that you can wander around and travel via outhouses spread throughout the world. There are a ton of quests and you’re looking at about 10-15 hours of gameplay here that is very entertaining.The game has two major flaws and this is the fact that no matter how high you level up or how good your armor is you will be guzzling potions and healing items every 5 seconds. Enemies re-spawn when you re-enter an area and you can’t move on to some until you are a higher level or those enemies will kill you quickly. This makes progression slow at first and forces you to complete quests because that’s the only way to really level up. You get very little XP killing enemies even if they are a higher level than you. I found this very frustrating and made the game less enjoyable because of all these weird quirks. I also found that some quests were vague on where to go and using fortune cookies spread around give you hints, but those are just mostly useless.The visuals are nice, but technically the game is very simple, but there is a huge variety in enemy types and you really won’t get bored on that end. The best part about DeathSpank is the humor in the dialog and the funny voice actors who over exaggerate voices. Even as an action RPG the game is fun and challenging for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary to play, plus it has co-op play for anyone wanting to share the fun and jokes with a friend.--Score: 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun comedy role playing game, I wasn't expecting much from this but I have played it to death. Good arcade style graphics and funny dialogue that just keeps you going back to see what other ridiculous situations Deathspank can get himself into.I must say thpugh that the title put me off buying this at first, but dont let it do the same to you.

												DeathSpank is seriously the funniest game I've played in a long time. It's written by the guy who wrote the original Monkey Island games, which is pretty much all I need to know to recommend it.So I guess this is an RPG, but that's not the point. It's mainly a vehicle for jokes, which are delivered by great voice acting. Some people complain that this game is too short, or that it's not as good as a serious RPG. They're missing the point (and they've the Pointy Shoulders of Pointiness), this game is about fun. It's cheaper than going to the movies and lasts a lot longer. And why is it that this $15 RPG can have full spoken dialogue whereas some $100 RPGs do not? Great value. Sparkles!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deathspank is one of my favorite games of 2010. It combines the mechanics of Zelda and Diablo with the sly humor of Monkey Island's Ron Gilbert. A silly, forgettable, but altogether enjoyable storyline for this first installment of two will run you about 20 hours to fully enjoy. Combat mechanics work great when paired with the X360 controller, as that's what the game was actually designed for. Deathspank is a must own -- and since it's indie, it's cheap. While it's not your standard $50 experience, it's definitely worth the ~$15 or so it usually sells for. Pick up both Deathspank games for an interesting and humorous gaming experience you may actually enjoy playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A tad short, and it crashes on occasion for reasons that have not been fully explained, but it's pretty fun for those of you who like humor and also Diablo style games. I'd wait until it goes on sale again before buying though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hack and slash gameplay reminiscent of Torchlight or Diablo, but (sadly) with far fewer options; the RPG aspect of the game is rather flat. The paper cutout environment style is lovely, as are the cutscenes, but what really makes it successful is the humor. Although some of the silliness gets repetetive, there is enough witty dialogue to make Deathspank genuinely funny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Забавная рисованна я РПГ с юмором. Игра выглядит прилично красивая комиксная прорисовка плюс простенький геймплей делают своё дело а юмор очень разбавляет. Сюжет конечно обычен но это ничуть не мешает проходить игру с удовольствием.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like fetch quest types of games then you're gonna love this game, because all you're going to be doing is fetch quest-fetch quest-fetch quest. I know what you're thinking ""if that's all the game is about then what's the fun there to be had?"" Well don't worry because it is a fun game. The characters and story to the game is down right awesome and funny as all hell.You quest through a very large world killing many evil enemies and foes. The storyline isn't super uniqe but it's different none the less. However I wish they could have did more things to the game that would give it a different edge when you get to certain parts in the story,because doing fetch quest all the time really does it no justice at some points.But all in all it's a pretty fun game, if you're a fan of questing games or even want to get into these types of games then get Death Spank. You'll love it.Difficulty: Not really a hard game at all, just a button massher.Replay: Not a lot			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
