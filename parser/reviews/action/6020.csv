												Update: this review got popular so I made it a bit more detailedFor some reason dismemberment is copy protected on the steam version and will not work via the in game console, also by default the game doesn't support all resolutions via the in game options.So to get around this we make a file called autoexec.cfg and put it in the gamedata/base folder. In the file write the following, (the autoexec file is read from bottom to top for some reason).seta r_mode -1seta r_customaspect 1seta r_customwidth 1920seta r_customheight 1080set g_sabermorerealistic 2set helpusobi 1Once that is done you should see it show up like this in the gamedata/base folderhttp://i.imgur.com/szG45Aj.png(notice how the Type for the autoexec shows up as CFG file and not a text file, this is also where you dump .pk3 files to get mods to run)This is my autoexec for reference, it has a few more tweaks and i play at a laptop resolution because im currently on a laptop.http://i.imgur.com/6YnU2M0.pngNow you can enjoy maximum dismemberment and the absolute best lightsaber combat in the history of video games at your desired resolution. I would suggest not touching the in game resolution settings while playing, the other options are fine though.One of my favorite games of all time, enjoy it the right way.			",147,9,0,15,8,0,9

I play it for the player driven community. Be it on moviebattles 2, or my roleplaying clan, the people are why I havent left this game yet. The game is fun to play with a good saber system and it doesnt really get boreing with all the mods to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me this may be the Best Star wars game ever made, you really get the feeling you are in star wars, even that this game takes place a few years after star wars VI. the Storyline and Side missions are really great, and it's feels like it's an open world you are in. The controls are simple and easy to learn. if you want to make special attacks (most used in MP) then your keyboard will get a bit advanced since there are alot of special attacks you can do with the right combination of keys.Multiplayer is really great too, for me Single players is the best and could maybe need COOP but that what's we have mods to do, Multiplayer never gets boring there are plenty of game modes to play. Like Team death match, Death Match, Duel 1vs1 2vs2 4vs4 and alot more of  gamemodes,  The best gamemode: may be the Storyline game mode which focus on example jedies and Rebels has to storm a base and take down example the guns and Radars and the main core that controls the base. and a few more things.  A round can be very long and fun (based on how fast you and your team are to clear the way and destroy the targets). For me the graphics are wonderful i normally  remap everything with HD texture but this game doesn't need it at all. It's wonderful and if your a star wars fan you wont regret you bought it.

												Have you ever wanted to be a Jedi? The Force isn’t strong enough in real life for you to be one? Well then, this game is good enough to satisfy that need. If you never wanted to be one, then this game will show you its charm anyway and afterward, you’ll fall in the former category. Despite its outdated look,  the gameplay is engaging and the story has the SW charm to it. This game has the original trilogy’s atmosphere, but it has more action.  Despite its predecessor, the level design won’t get you lost and there is less linearity, as you can select your gender, race, lightsaber fighting style and its shape and choice you make in the (near)end, whether to stay in the light or give into the dark and the consequences feel strongly(the protagonists attitude changes, some die, some get hurt, everything is awesome). There are some great moments for a Star Wars fan, such as fighting alongside Chewbacca, force choking Boba Fett, or taking a station down with Wedge Antilles.

The gameplay involves lightsaber fighting(this is what made the Jedi Knight series famous) that inspired the combat of Blade Symphony, as there are many duels. Aside from those instances, chopping arms and heads of stormtroopers that actually can aim is really entertaining.  Jumping on walls, then on your adversaries is a good example of how fluid the combat can be. There are three types of force powers: light sided ones,  which involve sustaining health by healing and protection, and turning your enemies into allies, the universal ones like force push, pull, speed, sense and lightsaber throw and there are the dark sided ones, which are damaging and risky, as you’ll enter modes that strengthen you while draining your health, exposing yourself with force choke or force lightning, though the latter, when upgraded to its zenith, means pushing everyone out of the room while having bolts all over them.  You also have an arsenal of weapons to your disposal, that have primary and secondary types of firing.

The story has its charm, as you start up as a student and end up being a Jedi Knight, there are many iconic characters and there is Kyle Katarn, the hero of the other Jedi Knight games.  The plot isn’t really intriguing, but it has its mystery. 80% of the game you’ll be doing missions that don’t seem to be related to the plot, but more to being a Jedi, that is keeping the peace in the Galaxy.

The game last for about 8 hours, provided you tend to be alive most of the time. For Star Wars fans it’s a treat and some don’t exaggerate when they call it the best Star Wars game; while it’s a matter of taste, this game ends up on being on the favorites list. For newcomers, it’s enough to make them understand why people go crazy over Star Wars. The game isn’t complex, but is good enough to spend time with it and enjoy doing so. ",318,41,7,39,16,2,26

Lore-friendly & fun from start to finish // Recommended for Star Wars fans+ Voice acting is mostly passable, with a few notable exceptions+ Visuals, animations, and effects are decent for year of release, so it's hard to justify counting them against the game; they didn't necessarily age well, but certainly not to such a degree as to hold it back+ Movement and platforming feels smooth and organic; this is particularly evident when 'force jumping'+ Environmental puzzle elements are well-designed, and work well with the use of the player's core 'force abilities'+ Dark side/ Light side orientation can be chosen, but isn't necessarily influenced by dialogue, as in many other titles+ Audio design is ripped directly from the films, and does well to complement the final product+ Melee and FPS transition works seamlessly; both are fun in their own right, and neither serves to detract from the game's enjoyment+ Combat is both fun and engaging; this, clearly, was the primary focus of the developers, and the combat system is easily that which works best in the title+ Secret areas are available, offering tangible rewards for one's mission+ Controls are intuitive and adequately explained in the tutorial missions; however, there is seemingly no controller support to speak of+ Plot is nothing sensational, but it measures up fairly well to the rest of the franchise, and doesn't divorce itself from the established nuances of the Star Wars universe- Vehicle controls, notably turning, can prove a bit clunky in practice- Enemy AI is positively atrociousLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												Remember Jedi Outcast? With Kyle Katarn we needed to struggle through a couple of levels until we could, finally, get our hands on a lightsaber. Now, Jedi Academy completely skips these few levels. You are, already, a Jedi and in possession of a lightsaber. Make no mistake: the same array of shooting weapons are available, personally, however, I never used any.I liked this concept. In fact, at the beginning a few customisations are available: you can pick your race, the colour of your clothing and - most importantly - the colour of your lightsaber. Many missions can now be completed in the desired order but once you continue the main storyline it is, of course, the same old linear storytelling.The game runs on the same Quake 3 engine and - as already mentioned - has the same assortment of weapons available at your disposal. However, since it is soooooooo cool to wield lightsabers we now have the option to 1) have two lightsabers at the same time or 2) use the lightsaber staff Darth Maul had in Phantom Menace. Of course, the single lightsaber option is still available with the 3 stances already offered in Jedi Outcast.There is not much else to say about Jedi Academy. Fighting with lightsabers has never been cooler and the game heavily emphasizes this concept. The game gives us a long-lasting experience and I heard multiplayer is even better! Do note that enabling the widescreen option requires some tweaking - do head over to wsgf.org for the solution.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												PLEASE HELP ME!  UPDATE THIS GAME I HAVE FIGURED OUT WHY THIS DOESN'T WORK FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH WINDOWS 10 IT WILL JUST SAY IT HAS STOPPED WORKING.  SAME THING HAPPENS WITH JEDI KNIGHT 2: JEDI OUTCAST. HEED MY WARNING IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 10 DO NOT GET UNTILL THEY FIX IT SOMEHOW. (if they can even fix that.)  That has actually been fixed thanks to some friendly people who told me how.  Type in http://sourceforge.net/projects/gldirect/ and there is a dowload (make sure to press the right dowload button, ads that have download buttons,) then in your file explorer where all your dowloads go you want to go to your os then programs *86 then in that folder go to steam then steam apps then go into the common folder find your game folder then go into the game data folder.  Now with the gldirect thing you downloaded you want to extract it then when it's done extracting go into that folder then gldirect5 then go into the bin folder then release folder then it's there, now you want to move that in your game data file that you did earlier. Now you are able to play one of the greatest star wars games ever made. PS. i forgot to mention that customizing your character is a little glitchy at least it was for me, and it will crash if you go windows D while playing the game then trying to get back into the game so don't forget to save, you should save in this game often.  Also Jedi knight 2 Jedi outcast has the same problem and this fixes it also. MARK THIS REVIEW AS HELPFUL SO PEOPLE CAN SEE!			",13,1,0,1,1,0,0

												An amazing game, a large community, mods are EVERYWHERE, highly customizable game.  You can even port models from other games! Highly suggested, best Star Wars game for now!You can do a variety of things in the game, from mods which allow you to jump higher, enhance combat, and even have custom sieges! (Moviebattles II Peoples, you know who you are!) Perhaps if they make a good successor, it will be a great series. Using the Jedi Outcast assets to make the game what it is today, with enhanced graphics, gives you a variety of different things to do! You can explore secret areas, speedrun the game, spawn thousands of enemies and wreck them!I say this game is the BEST Star Wars gane if all time, let's see EA Top this game.			",75,8,0,4,8,1,4

												Classic Star Wars game using the Quake III engine. Despite its age; the saber combat still is better than the Force Unleashed games. One well placed saber blow can be lethal like the in movies. Single Player is fun to mess around in but MP is where its at. The game still has a small active community. The community is kinda cringey though.. They have a silly Bushido-esque honor code that's enforced like a religion on all the servers.			",322,60,6,66,40,3,49

TL;DRA classic game set in the classic universe. This is a must play not only for the Star Wars fans.+ Magnificent and balanced combat system+ Choose your style: single, dual, or a sabrestaff+ Variety of guns+ Use the Force, Jaden!+ The protagonist doesn't have to be a human :)+ Option of choosing between the light and the dark side+ Soundtrack+ MULTIPLAYER+ Tons of player-created content- Plot isn't an A+ material (but it's not bad by any means)REVIEWIt's a blast from the past – still fun after all these years. The game tells us the story of the Jedi struggling to prevent the Cultists from resurrecting Marka Ragnos – an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith.The protagonist, unlike in most of the games in the Jedi Knight series, is one of the Luke Skywalker's students named Jaden. One can choose race, gender, and appearance of the main character. What is more, the hero's lightsabre can be customised as well. Later on, there is also a possibility to choose either a single blade, dual blade, or a sabrestaff. Each of the weapons feature a different playstyle, animations, and moves. In addition to the elegant weapon(s) for a more civilised age, there are a few guns and explosives available.The lightsabre combat system is truly unique and works like charm. It is easy to learn and hard to master. It punishes the weak and empowers the strong, so to speak: it rewards well-timed blows and dodges as opposed to mindless mashing the buttons as fast as possible. Moreover, it is well-balanced: every playstyle is viable. Apart from fencing, a player can use a variety of Force powers which are divided into three categories: Neutral (e.g. Push), Light (e.g. Heal), and Dark (e.g. Lightning). In single player, a player can assign points to the Light and the Dark side powers (the Neutral ones grow as the story progresses). While single player is decent, the clue of the game is its multiplayer. I have put around 200 hours in the multiplayer alone and I definitely am looking forward for more. Despite the game being past its prime, it still has a small but devoted community. There also are myriads of mods, characters, maps, and other types of player-created content which further improve longevity of the game.Concluding, Jedi Academy still is one of the best Star Wars games in my opinion. I have yet to play a game with a more enjoyable and balanced combat system and I strongly recommend trying it out even today: it may look dated, but the core mechanics are timeless.P.S.

												It's probably fair to say that the single-player aspect of this game isn't as solid storywise as its predecessors (and I do recommend checking out the early incarnations of the Jedi Knight series) but the reason for playing this game is in the action and friends. LIGHTSABERS: You are able to choose between Single, Dual or Staff, which is a first for the series (only Single is available when you start the SP storyline. The others will become available later.)FORCE POWERS: You are able to pick and choose which ever powers are offered from both polarities of the Force. In SP you can pick any power at any time but MP is more restrictive -- forcing you to choose one side or the other. GUNS: Well, maybe not as exciting as the first two, but the some of the guns offered here are the sort of things that only the SW Universe offers and you'll be hard pressed to find similar items in other games. But what really takes the cake on this game is if you are able to play online with a great group of friends. You will spend countless hours with them. There is a community that has stood by this game throughout the years it has been around and I suspect they will be around for even longer. Much of the community functions in an RPG aspect where people will form their own groups and incorporate SW lore into their gatherings while other aspects of the community will focus on the skill of brandishing the lightsaber or Force. Even further, there are countless mods offered to further enhance gameplay and your experience.So yes! Buy and play this game. If you want to play this game however, you should do yourself the favor and play the previous games of the series so you are familiar with the storyline, lore and whatnot. It will make the experience much more rewarding once you arrive at this title. Aside from the hours Steam shows here, I've must of put in another thousand hours or so that are not shown. I have many memories of the good times I had playing. This is the game of my teenage years.			",167,9,1,14,7,2,17

												I've spent over 10 000 hours playing this game during the past 12 years. It's safe to say that it has a lot of lasting power.The game sports a very intricate lightsaber system unlike any other since then. This is what lightsaber combat should be like in all Star Wars games. The player has full control over his/her attacks unlike modern button-mashers where you are lucky to have an overly simplified combo tree.In addition to a very well crafted lightsaber system it features a tremendous modding scene, much like any other IdTech 3 engine games. The active modders hang around at jkhub.org and are actively pushing out new models, weapons and maps. There are even some characters from The Force Awakens available.These alone should keep you playing for days.If you are a fan of Star Wars shooter games and think Battlefront is a little too bland and unvaried in terms of gameplay, check out the total conversion mod Movie Battles 2. It will transform the game into a funky mix of Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2 with almost every single possible Star Wars character and location you can think of. For more information visit moviebattles.org ! Do note this is a shameless self-plug as I am one of the developers of the mod.			",56,14,0,2,1,0,6

												The graphics don't hold up compared to something like The Force Unleashed, but this game is still enjoyable to play. The ability to pick and choose certain missions gives you a little extra leeway in how you play the game, and what items you go into certain missions with. It even has two distinct endings, which is close to how many Mass Effect 3 had when it first came out. All joking aside, both endings do make sense in the context of the game and feel satisfying. The lightsaber combat can be a little BS sometimes, especially on higher difficulties, but whenever you have a good, long fight without randomly insta-dying, it's really satisfying and makes you feel like a Jedi.7/10.

												Howdy, folks! So, JKA.. This game is absolutely amazing. As you can tell by my recorded hours on Steam alone (add about another 1400 or so), I've played this game for a little bit. The lightsaber combat is, hands down, only matched (maybe slightly bested) by its predecessor Jedi Outcast. The gunplay, is okay, but come on, this game is called JEDI ACADEMY for a reason! The Force powers add a ridiculous angle to the gameplay in both Single and Multiplayer to keep things from getting too stale. The community for JKA is one of the most resilient communities I have encountered, they have stuck by this game for the 10+ years that this game has been around, and doesn't show too many signs of fizzling out. If you happen to be a fan of Star Wars, I would recommend buying this game, as well as Jedi Outcast, and playing the hell out of them!			",83,4,0,2,9,0,2

												I remember playing this game on my big clunky dell workstation when I was about 11. So that was like 2007. Anyway, I adored this game. I played EVERYDAY for probably 2 years straight. I loved to play it in the winter especially. Just the cool crisp way the room felt. Sitting at my desktop. Ah... Was a different life. What I'm getting at, is after all of these years this game still wears its age incredibly well. I just got done playing a little bit. I had $7.27 I made from selling a drop I got off of Counter Strike, so once I saw this... I used my a few bucks from my bank card, and then that 7.27, so that I could buy it. Didn't have multiplayer I don't think when I was playing back in 07, but it's pretty fun! I'm 20 now, and still love it!			",12,0,0,2,0,0,1

												Starwars Jedi Knight : Jedi Academy was one of the very first online games I played. I've spent years of my young life playing this game endlessly. I could tell you many great moments I've had in this game it almost brings a tear to my eye. This game is my most beloved game out of all games I've owned/will own. I've explored the many user created maps and watched great clans rise to fall. I've sat in a space bar drinking a Beer as a Jawa talking about what ever have you, I've watched epic light saber battles go on were the best of the clans fought. I seen G4 host the game in it's own tournaments and laugh at how they sucked at using force grip. This game isn't just a game it's a story for many starwars fans and a look back into the good days of earley pre modern internet gaming.Buy it at Full Price because you'll never love any other game more. I recommend joining the (JAWA) clan when you get in game, they are the best group of people I've ever met.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spent a lot of my childhood on this game, can't even imagine the amount of hours I racked up in Xfire! (thousands) I guess my highlight was reaching #1 on ESL leaderboards a few times in different categories. Still fun to play now, clans still going that were created years & years ago which is good to see. In fact I remember my first ever clan was {SnJ} back in 2003, and their server is still up and running now.. crazy. (10.06.15)Insanely addictive saber combat, simple to pickup and play. Easily in my top 10 games of all time! Purchase this game, you must..EDIT(25.10.15): A huge shame to hear about the termination of JK3Files.com network. A truly wonderful site and will be hugely missed. There is a dedicated website that has all files mirrored if anybody is on the hunt to pick up mods once more, also a great community named JKHub that contains lots of files and information too.

												This game is a must have for any starwars enthusiast. The gameplay is good and the story line is more than enjoyable. This is a game for people who value skilled timed attacks and learning moves over button mashing and hoping for the best. I have played a few of the other starwars games but this is the best in my opinion. I much prefer the aproach of the force powers and move sets over that of say force unleashed. The movement is fluid, for a game of this time, and the story puts you right in the middle of the star wars universe. Definately recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Luke, did I ever tell you about the time I watched a security hologram of my former apprentice, your father, murdering younglings? I tried to tell your mother, who was formerly the democratically elected queen of an entire planet at the age of 15, that I saw it happen, but she didn't believe me despite us having been good friends for nearly five years up to that point. So she took her personal diplomatic starship to a known Separatist world to find out the truth from him, even though she had no way of knowing that he would be on that planet, and even if she did she couldn't have known where on the planet he was, and even if she did she probably should have guessed the reason that he was there in the first place alone would be to either collaborate with Separatist leaders or kill them in cold blood. Luckily, I stowed away by hiding in a space closet, and, when things seemed most hopeful for the galaxy's future when your father decided to destroy the Emperor out of love for his wife, I heroically decided to stand on the landing platform of the ship like a total badass so that he could choke her and endanger the lives of her unborn children. Oh! I almost forgot, you were there too. Anyway, I ended up having to cut off your father's remaining three organic limbs and leave him to die by immolation, even though I thought he was a swell guy up to that point and could have killed him myself to spare him the agony. Oh, and I also looted his lightsaber so that I could keep it for myself in my hermit den, but not before attending your birth, which was overseen by a large white floating robot that said ""Ooba"" over and over again and, despite letting your mother die even though nothing was medically wrong with her, didn't lose her space medical practitioner's license after that. She was not a good friend.			",206,27,4,29,43,3,77

 Star Wars: Jedi Knight- Jedi Academy is pretty cool, I guess. You play as Jaden Korr, an initiate into the Jedi order and the super cool kid in his class because he already has his lightsaber. After the ship you're a passenger on crashes and you fight your way to the academy, you and some loser called Rosh are assigned as students to Kyle Katan, the protagonist from all the other games. From there you embark on an adventure to figure out who was behind the attack on the academy and just how many people you can sword fight at once.It's two, I can barely manage two. I'm not very good. As stated before, you no longer play as Beard Man, but instead as Jaden, a character who's race, gender, and appearance you pick yourself. The options for character creation are limited, but it doesn't really matter outside of appearance since your name, voice, and back story are ultimately the same. Unlike the previous game, Jedi Academy lets you pick your mission and load out before you embark. It's a little bit jarring compared to the previous game where the game flowed from planet to planet and mission to mission through the narrative. The levels are also a lot simpler this time around, with less opportunities to get lost. After each mission you get a single point to put into a force power of your choosing.There are both light and dark side powers to choose from, but the only difference there seems to be between picking Light or Dark outside of the obvious is what Luke says to you after you do enough missions to advance the story. The change isn't unwelcome but I did prefer the more linear story telling in Jedi Outcast compared to the broken up missions in Jedi academy. The gameplay is mostly the same, with a few changes that are mostly just cosmetic. Blaster bolts leave a noticeable black mark on Storm Trooper armor and your lightsaber leaves streaks of burn marks that no amount of Polysporin will fix. You still have the same weapons from the last game with a few new additions. In blasters you get what is essentially a rail gun that kills most enemies in one hit if you can hit them, but lets get to the meaty bits, the space swords.From Dark Forces II onward, Kyle used a single lightsaber, but since you are playing a customization character this time, you have more options. Jedi Academy came out in 2003 when the prequels were still coming out. So because of that, they gave you a few toys to play with. You can still use the normal singular space sword, but you can also use that double headed staff space sword, just like that goofy looking Satan guy from Episode 1  actually 4 . Other than those two, you can also just grab a second space sword and be like that weird kid from that Kingdom Hearts YouTube video.You know the one. Each lightsaber style has it's own moves and special abilities. The single lightsaber can change between three styles, the dual lightsabers are fast and you can use one at a time, and the staff can...Kick...I think, I'm not sure I only used it a few times. Like the last game I checked out the multiplayer, and not so surprising there's a rather large population this time around. Like Jedi Outcast, the dueling community took precedence over the other game modes, and is very much alive. I sat around and hung out for a bit with a bunch of them while they fought one another or ganked someone that was trying to break up duels. While I was hanging out someone in the fat Reelo skin sneaking up behind me and wiggling his lightsaber in my butt. We had fun. But should you play Jeddy Hogwarts?  Yes but only if you can name the blue elephant that played the piano in Jabba's palace in Return of the Jedi. In my opinion, Jedi Outcast had the stronger single player experience, it was a bit longer and better thought out. The last two levels of Jedi Academy were almost exhausting by just how long they were and how many Reborn you had to fight at once. Even then I had a few more hours in the Single player for Jedi Outcast than I did Jedi Academy. But if you're looking for lasting value, the multiplayer in Jedi Academy is still going strong, so you can probably find people to play with throughout the day. I'd still say get both, you can get them really cheap during most sales. Jedi Academy gets 8 Prequel references out of 10. Star Wars was originally supposed to be only one movie.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation ",282,25,4,43,14,2,59

												For those of you that hate reading, there's a condensed version of my rambling at the bottom of the paragraph.  Thought I'd write a review for this game but, the hours I have invested in it speak for me in all honesty.  This game is the epitome of my STAR WARS wet dreams.  Custom Jedi, Lightsabers, The Force, and Stormtrooper dismemberment; what more could you ask for?  The story campaign is really good and provides a good time for everyone.  Luke Skywalker is voiced by Mark Hamill and John Williams' original STAR WARS score plays throughout the entire game.  The fanservice levels in this game are just literally off the charts!  However, where this game really shines, in my opinion, is the mods.  This game becomes ten times better once you start sinking mods into it.  The moding for this game is super easy and definitely add to the experience once you've done all you can with the vanilla game.  The mod that gave me over 400 hours by itself was the MOVIE BATTLES II multiplayer conversion mod.  I personally believe the MOVIE BATTLES II mod is the best possible mod to get for this game as it is regularly updated and transforms the battle mechanics of the game completely to make it feel like a more realistic STAR WARS experience.  And that is just one of the thousands of mods for this game floating around the internet.So in short, game by itself is great.  The Story is ok and the STAR WARS fanservice is seemingly endless.  Game with mods is fantastic, tons of mods that add the experience in many different ways.  Highly recommend this game for any person who has ever wanted to swing a lightsaber.			",97,3,0,9,2,0,1

												Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is just awesome!The story is straight forward without getting dulll. The lightsaber combat system is great and well-conceived, beside from your lightsaber you gonna be able to use a huge arsenal of weapons every single one of them is different and  has their own advantage and disadvantage in the battle situations. It's gets even better you can use all kind of cool force powers you have seen in star wars movies on your journey through the mission you can increase those and become even more powerful until you become a jedi knight. The game provide a high amount of different enemy types all of them are differently to defeat. One thing I like the most about Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is the level design there is literally not one mission that feels  repetitive. I played the game from the beginning on the highest difficult which was a good choice because of that I had many intense and challenging lightsaber battles especially against siths who also get stronger from mission to mission. It took me almost 15 hours to playthrough so a must buy for star wars fans and definitely worth a try for everyone who simple likes good games.Next step checking out the multyplayer!!!

THE PLOTSTAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy allows the player to control a character named Jaden Korr, a student who is brought to the academy from Coruscant, after he/she managed to create his/her own lightsaber without any previous Jedi training or experience.Jaden is customizable by the player, with options like different races, different genders, different lightsabers and more.The game takes place after the events of Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.At the start of the game, the Jedi Academy is attacked by Imperial Remnant forces, as well as by unknown Sith.They manage to steal some information that is critical to the Jedi Academy and the Jedi Order.Jaden then gets dispatched after completing the training at the Academy, and he/she is tasked with keeping the peace across the galaxy.Along Jaden's journey, he/she meets a variety of legendary Star Wars characters like Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca, as well as the iconic Jedi Master Kyle Katarn.Jaden also meets new enemies like Tavion and her Disciples of Ragnos.Besides this, Jaden visits various iconic places like Yavin IV, Tatooine, Hoth & many more.THE GAMEPLAYThe game features a RPG-like system which allows the player to distribute certain points on certain force abilities (the previous instalment, Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, did not feature this feature).Besides this, the game also allows the player to partially customize their characters, with options to choose things like the race and the clothes, as well as the lightsaber style and colour.The game feels very similar to Jedi Outcast, with many of the controls as well as the hud elements being identical.The combat is very similar to the previous instalments in the series, but the lightsaber combat in particular feels much better than  the previous game. I found the lightsaber to be a much more viable option than the blasters, which were the way to go in Jedi Outcast. In the end, I managed to finish the entire game with only the lightsaber.For the first time ever in the Jedi Knight series, the game allows the player to choose from a number of different missions, which will lead the player to different planets and it ultimately allows them to meet different legendary characters.Before you start any mission, you get to choose what force abilities, weapons and utilitarian items you want to bring, which is a very neat feature in my opinion.The game features some very unique and dynamic levels that can be very overwhelming at times, but they are ultimately a joy to play through.Halfway through the game, you get to make a choice between the light and the dark side, with either option giving you a different path to follow for the rest of the game.The only issue that I have with this game is its length.I managed to finish the game in less than 8 hours, while I managed to finish Jedi Outcast in 12 hours.Nonetheless, I felt like the story and the gameplay made up for this issue, and because you get a choice between the light and the dark side halfway through the campaign, the game is highly replayable.THE TECHNICAL ASPECTSThis game did not have any issues on my end, with no crashes, freezes or any major lag spikes.The game felt very optimized in my opinion.The only reasonable issue that one could have is the lack of modern resolutions for the game, meaning that the game is only playable with black bars if you play on a monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio.Anyone that has played any of the previous instalments in the Jedi Knight series should not have any issues with this, newer players however might need to adjust to this.The game once again features the brilliant quick save and quick load system from Jedi Outcast, allowing you to quickly save and load at any moment during the game (except the cutscenes, obviously).Lastly, the controls are once again completely customizable, with the ability to rebind every single function at will. MY VERDICT All in all, Jedi Academy is a worthy ending to the Jedi Knight series.Its core gameplay feels very similar to previous instalments, but its story is completely fresh and memorable.If you have played any of the previous Jedi Knight games, or even if you are a fan of older games with some great gameplay and a good story, then you should definitely add this game to your collection.

												Light side, Dark side... These things matter little when you are trying to become the strongest one man army in the galaxy. Play as a new student (Jaden) to the Jedi Academy on Yavin and learn the ways of the force (and how many ways one can kill Rosh). Be nice, be mean, it doesn't matter anyways since you can always make multiple save points. This game was amazing in my childhood, but got even better once I discovered the world of JKA modding.Get a sword, activate blood and dismemberment, play Medieval in the Starwars universe. Ride a Rancor. Use realistic guns. BE Kyle. Jump over skyscrapers. Fly. Whatever you want.

This game is incredible and I for one want to lend a hand in the creation of a new Jedi Academy experience. Think of it. It could be simply called ""Jedi Academy"", with updated graphics, tweaked controls, and more attention given to multiplayer.

												I am an avid Star Wars fan but I had never played this before. I just completed the single player campaign and the story was epic. For once they didn't copy other story plots from other movies, it was sort of original. The combat is what is the most fun aspect of this game. And I feel the graphics are still ""good"" enough for today's technology. Also when you are done with the game pick up Star Wars Movie Battles II, an awesome mod with endless hours of Jedi slaying. I think it's more satisfying than ""Battlefront"". Did I say you can slay Jedi in this?			",217,20,2,18,8,1,14

												One of the games that introduced me to online multiplayer- STAR WARS Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is by far a well polished gem, holding up even today. The game allows you to create your own character, even your own lightsaber, straight from scratch, bringing you on a decently well-paced action-filled singleplayer that has an interesting take on the post-Empire Star Wars universe. Starting off: You are a Padawan named Jaden Korr, sent to a Jedi Training ground deep on the moon of Yavin 4, you meet a fellow Jedi-in-training Rosh Penin, and for some reason immediately become friends, despite Rosh clearly having some form of mental issue. Your ship is attacked, and you are sent careening towards the surface below, and forced to make your way towards the temple that is not too far off in the distance. There, you find the sith draining the Dark Side aura that remained on the temple ground for years with some sort of staff, and thus, you are thrust directly into the story's narrative. The way this game's levels work is fantastic- offering you a chance to pick your own mission and force abilities at the beginning of said mission. Want to be a sith? A Jedi? A well balanced Jedi with all the abilities evened out? You can do that. This game offers many of opportunities to change your playstyle and try new things. If a level isn't working out, you can always leave, and return later once you've picked up a new force power you like. The physics in this game don't support ragdoll physics by any means; but certain force powers let you pick up and swing enemies into walls like it does, and it's great. The multiplayer for me is where this game really shines: A skill based Lightsaber and Blaster dueling arena filled with mayhem and carnage, truly showing who is the best fighter at the end of the day. Sadly, one of the servers that got me into the realm of online gaming, the Purple Clan, is no longer around. But the game's community still lives on strong. This and Republic Commando are one of THE best, if not THE best Star Wars games ever. It even has the best (in my opinion at least) lightsaber physics of any game, scraping and sizzling through walls and insta-killing your enemies with a single swing. The only negative thing I can say, however, is that the Vehicle physics (like the Swoop/Speederbikes) are garbage. They bounce all over the place. Get this game if you can, it's definitely worth the money.			",101,7,2,8,6,2,1

												Jedi Academy is one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made, and possibly even one of the greatest Science Fiction games as well. It will always be a timeless classic, and although aged, its combat mechanics still hold the title of one of the most original, functional, intense, and absolutely fun engines for combat I've ever had the pleasure to experience. The lightsaber combat is at its best, tactical and precise, and at your worst, clicking furiously as Jaden slashes the saber frantically praying to avoid death, which is to say, still incredibly fun. The experience is concise and highly enjoyable, and the voice acting wonderful. The story is nothing new, but there are terrific moments, and never once does it feel unplayable, if only a bit redundant at times (which is quickly forgotten about once you get slashing and deflecting). The only major flaw with the game is a few puzzles that are unfair and require luck or prior knowledge, so keep a walkthrough open. But I assure you, to any Star Wars fan, to any Science Fiction fan, to any video game fan, there's something in here for you that's worth your time and money. I will always love this game and relish the hours of play and replay it has brought and will bring me, and I invite you to do so as well.			",126,42,0,32,6,0,42

												Buckle up, as I'm about to tell you a tale of one of the greatest games of all time: Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy is among the first games I ever played all the way back on my first PC when it came out. I remember dad coming home with the case and although some may call this game flawed story-wise and in its mission structure not exactly holding up all these years later, I fondly remember my first hour almost as if it was yesterday. The graphics were a huge step-up from the games I had played until then and I was amazed at witnessing that Star Wars intro I had grown to love so fondly in a game I had heard nothing about but praise from my friends. Immediately after the first cutscene, I was thrown in with a lightsaber in hand and it felt great! I couldn't wait to cut through some stormtroopers, even though I had no idea what the story was about, but that's what it was like back then. Not understanding English back in those days, I was all about the action. And boy, what a game to make you feel like a true jedi this turned out to be. Now that I'm older and have replayed it for about the 20th time (with a new pack of mods, but we'll get into that later), I can appreciate the complexity of the lightsaber combat even more than when I was a kid. Force management, and multiple ways to replay the game with an assortment of different force powers each time. Not to changing into two lightsabers or a dual lightsaber in the 3rd arc of the game, or keeping your trusty single saber from the start, now fully capable to handle any situation with all the saber styles at your disposal. That's what made this game feel like a joy to play, from start to finish, every single time I've replayed it so far (except for the mission where you collect parts for your ship which is a drag). Let's get into the meat, that is the lightsaber combat. Like I said, Jedi Academy was my first Star Wars game on the PC and although I played Outcast and Dark Forces 1/2 later, I never managed to appreciate them as much as this one when I was younger. Now I see Outcast for the amazing cinematic story it provides with the right twists and a progression system that forces you to adapt to the situation, which I honestly prefer over Academy's skill points between missions. Though one thing Academy's got over Outcast where it counts is its last arc where it's all about fast duels with a multitude of bad guys and their cultist supporters with annoyingly strong force powers. Outcast never had that. Its level design and story may have been better, but Academy's combat shines in comparison. This is how you refine a system you developed in your last iteration and make it the spotlight of your game. Everything post-Vjun in this game is pure action and I love it every time I get to that part. The missions up to it feel like a kid's play when you actually think about it, but that's just how great the pacing is too. It doesn't make you feel to powerful right off the beginning, yet by the end, you don't feel overwhelmingly powerful either. Also, the music... John Williams' tracks from the movies. Could've used a few original pieces of work but, not complaining as this is what defines classic Star Wars.The game has aged pretty well and is well-worth your $10 of investment for the ~6-7 hours of entertainment it should provide in a single run. However, let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, Disney now own Star Wars, and hence LucasArts is no more. That however benefited these older titles. Both Jedi Outcast and Academy have their source codes released to the public for personal use, which has given us some of the most amazing modifications that a game can have, keeping it still alive in the modding community to this day. I'm talking about the Serenity Engine, the Evolution of Combat. Among the most advanced mods for this game, bringing in a whole new feel to the long-time classic, in the form of manual parrying, new combat styles and animations, as well as reworked and rebalanced combat system. If you're not into trying new stuff, you may like some of the many mods at disposal all around the internet. I'd suggest into looking through moddb and most importantly http://jkhub.org (the definitive JK mods site since the filefront shutdown) to find some long-time favorites and fan-made side stories, or just expand your game with a few brand new models, animations or sabers. Some of my personal recommendations are Vengeance of the Sith (a really well-made mod that follows Mara Jade through the Jedi Knight universe with great pacing, difficulty and constant action in your face, and this came out in 2004!), Jedi Outcast Academy (JOA is a mod that ports the entire Jedi Outcast story into Academy's newer engine and allows you to switch between the two games on the fly. Really great if you have Outcast in your library and would rather play it with slightly better visuals and the new moves that JA brought to the formula. Though you need to OWN Jedi Outcast), the aforementioned Evolution of Combat (which is also getting a new version pretty soon), Movie Battles 2 and Movie Duels are Multiplayer and Singleplayer modifications, one of which is heavily-focused on teamwork and coordination, and is likely the most active among the Online community, and the other allows you to replay your favorite battles from the movies, and too many other mods to list.Bottom point is, after playing through all of the games through my life, multiple times in fact, I can say for sure that this was a heck of a way to end the series! Amazing combat, great pacing, lovely modding community and an online component that's still active to this day. Don't trust the hours I have on Steam. This is a game that I keep coming back to on a yearly basis to replay or mess around in for a few days, which eventually grows into weeks, months, and wouldn't you know it, I haven't had this gem off my HDD ever since I installed my OS back in 2013. Truly a masterpiece, worth your $10. If you're into this sort of games and would like a more story-driven experience, get Outcast. And if you're feeling like you wanna try them both, go for it! The BEST Star Wars games on PC, along Republic Commando and Battlefront 2.			",267,33,10,24,12,4,45

An excellent multiplayer game with a forgettable singleplayer campaignI'll go more in-depth with the campaign below, but I'll summarize my overall impression of the game first. Buy it for the multiplayer. The campaign provides a short but fun couple of hours, though you probably won't remember it in a year. The multiplayer, however, provides a much more memorable experience. The dedicated, albeit small, playerbase is testament to that. Okay, so the singleplayer. In terms of customization, Academy succeeds. You get to pick your species/gender/lightsaber from the start. Also, aside from the main narrative driving levels, you're free to pick or ignore missions at your leisure. Unfortunately, no amount of visual flair breathes life into the main cast. Kyle Katarn and Luke Skywalker make their returns, but only sporadically. Instead, you plays as one of many new students at the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. As interesting as that sounds, there just isn't a real spark to this game. The story plays out as another macguffin hunt and foiled attempt at resurrecting an ancient evil. The dialog is about as strong as the prequel trilogy's, in terms of tropes. I could critique the narrative structure forever, but you get the point. So ignore it, and just have fun wielding a lightsaber and throwing force powers around. The spontaneous, awesome moments of fighting squads of stormtroopers, or groups of sith-wannabe's make up for any faults.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Star wars - Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy			* 8/10The final chapter for the Jedi Knight Saga.Kyle Katarn is at last a Jedi Master at the Jedi Academy, thus we will impersonate his new apprentice Jaden, followed by his ""punk"" friend Rosh. Troubles will start at the very beginning when a bunch of sith will infiltrate the Academy to provide diversion while others drain Some force residuals from the temple and steal Skywalkers log records. A new Sith cult is rising and troubles spread over the galaxy so now it's time for the new Students to go around and solve them.With this new setting we are bound to customize our character's gender, race and appearance. Our lightsaber's hilt and color can be customized as well.The game genere is still a third person action while wielding lightsabers, and FPS when using firearms, but this time we have Lightsaber and force powers since the very beginning,and (after an intro and a training section) we're not playing through an ordered number of levels but we're given a set of 5 levels and we can choose which mission to accept. We're not bounded to accept all of them, as 4 will be enough, but considering for each mission we can improve one light or dark force power at choice it could be wise to complete all of them. After that we will proceed with with story related cutscenes and levels and after that we will be given another set of 5 missions again, rinse and repeat.Even though the story is nicely represented with some more coreographic cutscenes and situations it doesn't really impress and involve the way it happened with Dark Forces II or Jedi Knight 2. A good point is the choice for dark or light path, so once again we can choose which side of the force to join with one particular decision towards the end. As usual the most interesting ending is the dark side, but I'm not here to spoil anymore than this.The engine is once again the same from Jedi Knight 2, but this time the idTech has been polished and improved further with effects, shaders, reflections and saber burn marks on enemies as well. Level design didn't give me the impression of being constant, as I've witnessed marvelous and amazing sections well designed with lot of care and attention for details and decorations, while other areas or levels are more flat or... standard.Gameplay is the real core of this chapter as it has really been improved under many aspects. We have new set of moves such as rolling out or jump when grounded, bounce out when pushed or jumping onto walls, special attacks specific for saber combat styles and in the latest sections of the game we can wield the saber staff or two lightsabers. A particular note goes to one particular section, a mission where you must run all the way with a speeder bike. Even though it's a simplistic section I simply loved it and I'm sure EA had that secton in mind while working on Battlefront.The soundtrack is amazing as always. As in Jedi Knight 2 it uses the Classic tunes from John Williams with dynamic tracks, so fast paced tunes will be played while you're in action, while slow movements will be played while exploring and everything wil be smoothly linked with apropriate musical passages. A bunch of new tracks have been added for specific sections.Unfortunately the impression of this title is that of an expansion more than a new chapter. Of course there are lots of gameplay innovations, a whole new story, but still the story doesn't have the impact nor the importance of the previous chapters, the characters don't give great impressions, specially Jaden, the story is quite predictable and the level design even though it has many sections full of details and inspiration has other sections more standard making the game look... Rushed.+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. As in Jedi Knight 2 the combat system is very smooth but now it's improved with new moves, actions, stunts and the chance to use two lightsabers and the saber staff. New force powers are available in the game campaign (though they have already been used in the Multiplayer section of Jedi Knight 2). There are also sections with speeder bikes and Tauntauns to ride. SOUNDTRACK. Once again the game features the amazing scores from John William with the dynamic music system that perfectly fits and follows your actions. A fistful of new tracks have been added. FAN SERVICE. In this chapter there's Mark Hamill Voicing again Luke Skywalker, but there are more elements that might please fans: The Rancor, The Ice Wampa Creature with Tauntauns, Flying imperial troopers and Heavy troopers that really remind a lot of the Phase 2 and 3 troopers from the very first Dark Forces, and always from there... Boba Fett himself. VISUAL IMPACT. The game is getting old but it still looks pretty good thanks to a very good level design, familiar places, attention to details and inspired sections...---CONs--- LEVEL DESIGN. ...Unfortunately that kind of inspiration is not constant as there are sections and levels that look more flat, or less inspired. STORY. This chapter's story is quite simple and linear resulting in a predictable plot and situations. Even though it is well represented by good and coreographic cutscenes it doesn't involve as the previous chapters did, maybe also because the main character, Jaden doesn't have the same charisma as Kyle Katarn. AI. As in JK2 You will face enemies that won't recognize you or the mess and killing you made 10 mts away, or enemies that will run back and forth not knowing what to do, or falling down in pits. This is an aspect of the game that IF it had been improved, it wasn't improved that much. 4:3. Unfortunately, due to the age, the game doesn't support 16:9 resolutions natively. Luckily you can just edit the cfg to force your own resolution. Everything is explained in details in the steam community. CLUNKY ANIMATIONS. There are some clunky or too basic animations in the game such as ""non-breathing"" idle positions or slow running and walking animations that makes the characters look like they're gliding on the ground.

												Plays remarkably smooth for something as old as it is, and has a fun story to follow.  My only complaint is how random the lightsaber fights actually feel.  I could kill someone with a single stroke, or die over the course of three minutes.  I never found the trick to make it consistent, or seemingly skill-focused.For a game with a LOT of weapons to pick from, you'll rarely use anything beyond your Lightsaber, due to just how effective it is at dispatching opponents, and how well it can defend you on the approach.All in all, a great experiece and still a lot of fun all these years later.  Just minor personal gripes.			",185,12,3,28,14,1,31

												Sure the graphics are outdated, but you don't play this game for the graphics, it's all about the story, the setting and letting your imagination run wild.From vehicles in the desert to iconic music and locations, this game has it all.Explore the wonders of the Force as you learn the ways of the Jedi, then abandon it all for the true power: GUNS. That annoying sith warrior keeps killing you? Bomb him to oblivion, Stormtoopers? Shoot them with bigger guns. It works to certain extent, but guns are no match to the higher level sith warriors you face late game. It's just great and so refreshing to have the option to use different weapons. :)Enter Darth Vader's castle in Vjun ad fight your way through.Then feel like a badass when you finally get good with the lightsaber. Combat is amazing and truly evokes the feeling of being a Jedi.It brought up a constant feeling of wonder. Temples, deserts, forests, space stations, frozen wastes. The galaxy is yours to explore as you complete missions on your way to earn the title of Jedi Knight. This is a great game and I enjoyed it very much. I hope that we can see a new entry in this series soon. If you like Star Wars, this is a must. If you're an RPG fan like me, this is grade A right here.			",36,22,0,15,1,0,5

												Don't let my time played fool you (currently sitting at 29 hours), because I played for thousands of hours before acquiring it on Steam. This game was very much my life, my source of satisfaction and very much needed escapism, for the most formative years of my life.I nominated Jedi Academy for the ""Test of Time"" Award because, as of November 2016, there still isn't a game that comes anywhere close to the complexity, depth, spectacle and accessibility of its lightsaber combat. There's a good reason that people spent years learning the intricacies of a single lightsaber loadout, let alone the other two (two sabers, and dual-ended) and the three styles (Fast, Medium, Strong) of each. This game is astonishing because of how fantastic its combat remains.I mean, it's also got everything else going for it - enjoyable, memorable maps; distinct, unique Force powers; a delightfully cheesy campaign with surprising twists and turns; a great rhythm and sense of pacing; thousands upon thousands of mods...To me, this is as good as Star Wars games get when it comes to the action genres. There hasn't been anything like it since then. It's very much a product of its time, with the freeform multiplayer, open singleplayer levels, a vaguely Quake-esque undercurrent tinting the game's combat and flow, and more. But looking beyond the sentimental attachment I have to it, Jedi Academy remains the epitome of third person melee combat, and as such, it fully deserves the ""Test of Time"" Award.

												This game is different than it's predecessor. You are not playing Kyle Katarn but, like in ""Mysteries of the Sith"", an apprentice of Kyle, which you can customize at the beginning as well as the lightsaber color. Also the skill system is implemented again and you can decide whether you skill the light or the dark side of the force.The gameplay is quite the same as in all Jedi Knights. A very cool feature is that you can later choose between a single saber,  two sabers and a double-bladed lightsaber.Maybe some levels might be too short but that didn't really bother me. In this game you can choose missions beside the story but the story doesn't suffer.I want to say that this is a worthy part of the Jedi Knight Saga. It's a bit different but for me as a real fan this is a nice game. If you like Jedi Knights or lightsabers you shouldn't miss this game!Additional information: There are cool mods like ""Movie Dules"" too.			",111,18,3,19,8,1,17

												Jedi Academy is an instant star wars game classic and is probably one of my favorites. It feels awesome going through the game as a student of Luke Skywalker and Kyle Katarn, who was the guy you played as in a couple of the previous installments. This game SWAMPS its predecessors in terms of game feel, combat, and customability. Getting your own personal lightsaber was really cool, but later in the game you get to change your fighting style (dual wield, double-bladed, etc.) when you become a jedi knight. Combat is really smooth and using your force powers feels nice. The story, as i should mention, is a great experience and has multiple endings which is a nice touch. I also feel as though i would be at fault if i did not mention the wonderous multiplayer which is really balanced, fun to play, and I have never felt that i had been cheated. This game deserves a 9/10 despite its graphics but there is no harm there considering it is a bit of an outdated game.Totally worth the buy! :)			",110,20,1,12,3,0,5

												Don't let this game's lackluster first act fool you: this game can be quite a bit of fun once it gets going, with most missions managing to mix up the formula to avoid too much repetition and provide some memorable scenes. My personal favorite is probably cutting down cultists with a lightsaber during a speeder chase.The saber duels are some of the most stylish you'll ever see in a game, but sadly the enjoyability of them is extremely hampered by how luck-based they can get when you fight an enemy on even footing with you. I had to resort to save-spamming before and after every single encounter (and there are many, many such fights), and going so far as to abuse range limits and pitfalls to win half of them.Other than that, the only real downside to the game is that so much hack-and-slash, especially with the exhaustingly difficult Sith fights, can wear on the patience. And try not to let your customized character fool you: this isn't really an RPG. You choose your force powers and your saber style, but you only make one story choice in the entire game - right before the climax.All told I recommend trying it out. Just get used to saving your progress every two minutes.			",101,21,0,17,4,0,1

												I only have 11 hours on Steam but in my lifetime I have played hundreds. It's still really fun. I'm on Win7 and have no performance issue. The combat has aged quite well. It still feels pretty smooth. The saber fighting anyway. A lot fo really funny stuff can happen in fights like there player models doing something weird. Some of the level design isn't too great also. Still, amazing game. As far as lightsabers go this is probably the best star wars game that let's you fight with them extensively.

												Let me get this out of the way, nobody plays this game for the story.That being said, this game is highly entertaining, to the point where instead it's a the best lightsaber sim game to that it's G-Mod: Star Wars edition, yet TBH I think the mechanics here are far more fun and easier to manipulate than in source.Another way to label it in Unreal Tournament: Star Wars edition since it's got the same engine and mechanics. You'll feel like a real arena player again with the shooting mechanicsh ere, both in SP and MP. Of all Star Wars games, this still has the best lightsaber mechanics. Legit, you can keep fighting new sith or jedi, and you won't get bored because there are so many ways your lightsaber works here, and so many moves you can use to kick your enemy's♥♥♥♥♥ Mixed in with some awesome force mechanics, you actually can feel like a God if you put your moves right. Amazingly, the melee fight mechanics here in swordplay are actually better than some other modern games. I'm shocked that nobody has copied the formula from this game that's over 10 years old.I'll delve into the SP elements a bit: The story isn't really anything new, but it's entertaining to play through because the maps are so well designed and paced out, and you get to choose which missions to go on (though you probably will end up doing all of them). There are many enemies all varying in their strengths and weaknesses, and you can choose to either hack them to pieces of blast them from a distance.But here is what people really stay for this game: Cheats and Mods. You can warp between maps and play god at your own will. You can spawn countless NPCs to populate the map and then entertain yourself by killing them or watch them kill each other (I highly recommend spawning a rancor and a wampa. And this game also is pretty popular for roleplaying, as you can walk around with your friends and do whatever. There isn't terribly too much to do in terms of other than killing, but you can race in this game.So yeah, this game is freaking great. I don't know what else to say and my review is all over the place, but that fits with the context of this game.			",97,8,0,11,4,1,5

												""REMEMBER, ABILITIES AREN'T INHERENTLY GOOD OR EVIL... IT'S HOW YOU USE THEM-Jedi Academy is the follow up to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. It uses the same assets and--with the exception of two new lightsaber styles--has mostly the same gameplay. The graphics haven't aged well and weren't that great to begin with. The script is poorly written and the acting is terrible. Level design is hit or miss, with many platforming sections that just don't work and one vehicular segment that is god-awful. There's a lot wrong with this game.-But stay with me here.-Jedi Academy, despite it's numerous flaws, is one of the most entertaining Star Wars games in existence. It, along with Jedi Outcast, nail lightsaber combat with a very responsive system where every directional movement cooresponds with a unique saber slash. The force abilities aren't balanced that well, but they work well in the flow of combat.-You will enjoy destroying many stormtroopers, as they are the general cannon fodder of the game. After that, you will enjoy fighting dark jedi who become increasingly more frequent as the game goes on. Play your cards right in the end and you will be fighting four or five at a time in frantic combat.-Along with the saber you can use a variety of weapons, but really they're only useful for certain segments. 99% of the game will be spent chopping people up, and that's okay.-The story isn't all that compelling, though it has a few parts with great ideas. Kyle Katarn is at your side for a large portion of the game, though often you'll feel annoyed that you aren't playing as him. While you get to create your character's appearance and saber style, you have no control over who they are. Jaden, the main character, is essentially a blank slate who has been victim of incredibly lazy writing. It's hard to tell who to blame for the shoddy voice acting, but it seems like the direction of the script really didn't give anyone room to work with. All the story cutscenes use in-game engine graphics and animations, so it leads to very wooden conversations and some hilariously bad acrobatics.-If you can get over the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥story you'll get to experience some great combat and a unique handful of levels that go across several different planets. Even if you don't like Star Wars, this is something you could probably get into. Anyone with an appreciation for melee combat done right will find something to like here. Even if you don't care for the story, there's always online multiplayer (which I hear is still active) to participate in.FINAL VERDICT-Lots of flaws with this one, but it's a rough gem. Not many Star Wars game are this enjoyable. If you're looking for a good fix for Jedi action, skip buying the new Battlefront and give this one a try. It's a better game--cheaper too. While I'd ultimately say Jedi Outcast is the better one, Jedi Academy undisputably is more accessible and consistently entertaining. Give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've read one or two reviews which are critical of 'Jedi Academy' on the grounds that it is too similar to 'Jedi Outcast' and doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Whilst I do think that's a valid point, it certainly didn't detract from my experience of the game - an experience which I found immensely enjoyable. In 'Jedi Academy' you play Jaden Korr, who is canonically a human male but can be played as several well-known alien races like the Kel Dor (Plo Koon's race) and Rodian (Greedo's). On my playthrough I chose the Kel Dor, which I admit later regretting due to the fact that the voice sounded nothing like a Kel Dor voice. (Perhaps it's unfair to pick holes in a 14-year-old customisation system!) The rather superficial appearance of your character isn't the only thing you can customise, though. As you progress through 'Jedi Academy', you are introduced to different fighting styles, which culminates in the ability to choose your own lightsaber. If you thought this feature was good in 'Knights of the Old Republic', wait until you see what 'Jedi Academy' can offer. Overall, I'd say that whilst this game falls slightly behind 'Jedi Outcast' in one or two areas (e.g. a less memorable villain, a less challenging final level), it's a fantastic way to spend 10-15 hours (per playthrough, that is), and I'm almost certainly going to return to this game at some point in the future.

												This game has the BEST Lightsaber combat you will ever endure in any Star Wars Game yet to date. The story actually takes place after The Galactic Civil War, thus, meaning that their are EU characters starring in this game which may stray some average Star Wars fans away. But other than that, the game offers a plentiful story and some recognizable characters to say the least, and Kyle Katarn, the cocky but wise Jedi whom was the protagonist in Jedi Outcast. I could go on and on about this game, but honestly if you know a bit of the EU enough to tolerate most of the characters in the game, pick it up. If you'd like to have a fresh new experience on a game that features very impressive lightsaber combat even in today's standards, pick it up.			",171,11,1,14,14,0,18

												I always found it curious why Jedi Outcast and its sequel, Academy, dropped the Dark Forces moniker. I had figured it was for brevity and clarity, since Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy - Dark Forces IV, the name I would have chosen since it's a badass mind♥♥♥♥, alas isn't marketable.But I get it now. It's because the original Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II was very much a Dark Forces game, moreso than a Jedi Knight game. This is due to its pretty awful lightsaber implementation versus its pretty awesome gunplay. The original Dark Forces, just to be clear, had no lightsabers. It didn't need them. For the sequel, everybody wanted to use a lightsaber, so LucasArts tried to deliver. Unfortunately, Kyle Katarn couldn't block any incoming shots effectively, and I guess you could say it's because he was still in training and he sucked at being a Jedi. He was better at being a gunslinging mercenary, and thus the original Jedi Knight game made for a better shooter than a lightsaber sim. Hence, Dark Forces II.The Raven Software sequels are both lightsaber-centered, and ironically, they're both ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooters. Gone are the Dark Forces days where the gun fights had weight and speed. Now, instead of strafing around like madmen, stormtroopers are content to pretty much just stand there as you shoot at them, and fire back at such a constant rate that you could tap your foot to the blaster's beat. As you sink your shots back into their armor, they stand still, unflinching, as if they didn't realize they had lasers burning through them. It's all very smoothly animated, like butter, but it's also really boring.The guns are also wildly ineffective, since as an alternative, you can run through these guys with your lightsaber flashing, cutting each one down with one stroke WHILE managing to block every incoming shot automatically by just having your lightsaber equipped. This game is exceptional at teaching you just how pointless the guns are, which makes it surprising that you still have to choose your weapons at the beginning of each mission.Once the Dark Jedi start appearing, the game gets good, after a very dull first few missions. I was initially amazed at their ability to cut me down so quickly, and I got frustrated, thinking that the combat was just about swinging the lightsaber wildly and getting lucky. While the sabers don't connect in clear offensive/defensive poses very often, there still is a strategy. For one thing, a few defensive force powers are critical to surviving the tougher Dark Jedi, and once you figure out to map them to keyboard keys, the fighting gets a lot easier. (Of course, the game doesn't teach you this.) For another, circle strafing becomes the best tactic, since most of your attacks get blocked when you swing head-on. The resultant visuals look like a sort of randomized dance, lacking choreography but still well executed. And when you get the kill, the camera goes into a slow-motion 360 twirl around your custom-made character as he/she lands the finishing blows, and that never gets old.You can loosely compare the Dark Forces games' visual style to the original Star Wars trilogy - grungy, old, rough around the edges, beautiful. Likewise, you can compare the Jedi Knight II sequels to the Prequel Trilogy - flashy, pretty, colorful, smooth.Since the story, environments, music (the John Williams themes are cut up, out of place, and butchered here), dialogue, etc. are all pretty bad (or at the very least outdated), the game relies on its blend of lightsaber combat and force powers to keep you interested. Those two elements are good enough to merit a playthrough, which is why I recommend the game.7/10Graphics note: The max resolution available is pretty awful, but can be modified with a config edit (check the forums) to use your HD monitor's native setting. I got it running at 1440p, which looks remarkably good, but the game loaded with a blank white screen every 20th time or so, forcing a game restart. Annoying but not game-breaking, and worth it for the picture quality :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is based on the mod ""Movie Battles 2"" So i first bought the game after watching Sylvars ""How to lightsaber"" videos. 


YouTube™ Video: How to Lightsaber - Jedi Academy

			Sylvar decides to try his luck with a lightsaber. Went better then expected? Game: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy Mod: Movie Battles 2 - http://moviebattles.org/ Power Battles FA (a mod for mb2.		

 After watching them i fell in love immediatly. I tried the base JKA game but 99% of the time has been spent on MB2. Some people consider this game as a classic and if you feel like you would play it again if it was fresh and new, MB2 is your solution.The mod is multiplayer only with an extremely high skill level. The saber system has been completely reworked to offer a big learning curve and actual skill based dueling. Shooting also has a big skillcap and it cant be compared to your typical arcade shooter like Battlefront. Teamplay actually matters.MB2 has different game modes which include: open, full authentic and duel mode. In open mode you can play as many different classes varying from mandalorian with a flamethrower to a wookie and of course, jedi/sith.Full authentic offers you the ability to play classic scenes from the movies/games with preset characters with unique skills. It also includes fun maps to mess around with unique characters like Batman and even Pikachu.Duel mode is exactly how it sounds. It offers the ability to practice your sabering skills against other players.Last but not least, the game costs like 3€ while its on sale so its definetly a cheap one to pick up and you can enjoy for thousands of hours.If you decide to try MB2 and dont know where to begin with or need help learning the basics, feel free to add me. I would be more than happy to help.Original review was made around 600 hours in and reworked after 1300 hours 27.3.17 so its definetly not a game that gets boring easily.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very personal for me.  I bought this game as a part of a collection called the Star Wars Jedi Knight collection, and my God, was this a wise decision.Years and years ago, back in 2003, this came was released and my Dad quickly bought the game...and one year later, I got my hands on a pirated version of the game (back when my Dad was a huge pirate) and I played the hell out of it.  Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is one of my most played games, and one of the only games that I was willing to finish over and over and over again as a child.  I didn't grow up with an SNES, NES, Atari, Comodore 64, or PS2...I grew up with this damn game.  And as soon as I saw this on sale I had to buy this, because this game was my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed childhood.This is one of my favorite games of all-time for its amazing combat, horrible voice acting and great level design.  As I was playing through this game, as was absolutely astounded by how little it has aged...yeah, the graphics are quite dated, but the gameplay sure as hell isn't.  Swinging your lightsabre around feels so damn good, along with slicing people's arms off and running around with a blaster rifle, and is in my opinion, one of the few Star Wars games that have actually accomplished the feel of wielding a lightsabre, without a damn Kinect to immerse you in the lightsabre.And as I mentioned before, the level design is top-notch, fitting the overall feel of each world that you go through and sets the overall tone for the world that you have selected.  The Rancor world makes you ♥♥♥♥ing scared, while the acid rain level gets this feeling of doom and dispair.  The gameplay is something that I have really missed with modern FPSs, andit's a damn shame we can't get another Star Wars game like this now that Lucas Arts is now a publishing company now that Disney owns Lucasfilm.Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is a wonderful nostalgia trip for me, with great level design, satisfying lightsabre combat, great art design and a great final boss...that's why I recommend this game.

												Jedi Academy is the currently latest installment in the Jedi Knight series, that previously starred Kyle Katarn yet, but now you instead control a customizable hero/heroine. The game features both lightsaber combat and the use of blasters, and perplexingly enough some kind of illegal bugzapper weapon that disintergrates people. Odd choice for a Jedi, and nobody seems to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if you use it. Well, guns are in general pretty awful in this game, and you should stick with the lightsaber. It has a nice feeling to it, it's responsive and the lightsaber battles, as much as it seems to just be flinging the saber around until someone dies, feels cinematic and when you cut someone with it, it's satisfying. Especially against multiple bladed combatants. Unfortunately g_saberrealisticcombat and whatever other command it was to make it so that you could dismember with the lightsaber seems gimped at best, completely removed at worst.It's a shame since that was one of the best parts about Jedi Outcast.The story is somewhat unfocused and kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ you mainly just jump from planet to planet and kill stormtroopers, bountyhunter or the occasional wildlife, much to the dismay of the intergalactic PETA. (I'm joking, I sure as hell hope there's no such thing as People for the ethical treatment of Rancors)A bit later into the game you get to choose whether to have a double bladed, dual, or a single lightsaber. ""Why the hell  would I pick a single lightsaber? That seems lame""Well I agree, dual lighstabers are badass, but on another level i feel that it's a lot more practical with the single one, especially since you can switch between three styles. Aside from lasers and lightsabers, you get to choose to use force powers, and can throughout the game upgrade them at your leisure. You can choose from the dark side powers as well as lightside, and you can balance them both without getting a penalty for it. Some of the powers are useless and some are broken, such as level three force lightning. It can kill a whole room of stormtroopers pretty much instantly, but it's useless before level 3.Aside from fighting there are some minor tedious puzzles such as getting prisoners around a rancor, however you can kill it to make the process less annoying. All in all it's a rather solid game with good lightsaber combat, but I'd suggest picking up Jedi Outcast 2 as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Note: I have many thousand hours in this game, but all on the non-Steam version.)A very good Star Wars game - from 2003, and today, it is still the best multiplayer Star Wars game out there.Don't be afraid by the age of the game, watch the video below if you are concerned about graphics!The main gamemode I played for years is now dead due to the lack of players, probably fueled by no support from the developers. But there is a very good multiplayer modification, which is still active today. It has been out almost as long as the game itself, and since then has been constantly updated, improved, expanded, polished etc.(Who needs game developers for patches when we have better modders! ;))It would take me too long to list all the features of this mod right now, let me just tell you that it's certainly the best, action-packed, multiplayer Star Wars game out there.This is the mod's homepage:  https://www.moviebattles.org/And here is a nice promotional video, made for the first ""final"" release of the mod on April 26, 2010:

												The Game and Mods for it are fun and all but the community is just so atrociously toxic that it can be exhausting playing this online without a group of friends. Players will actively go out of their way to try and ruin your experience. Clans are probably the worst of all because you can get banned from a clan server just for having a mild disagreement with someone.Humanity is garbage, what ya gonna do?Also Movie Battles 2 playerbase is ten times more toxic and cancerous than league of legends and call of duty combined.

												A Star Wars game that is, in fact, a true gem. You wont find a game like this one. I really love everything about Star Wars, but lately the games were a huge letdown....come on, Star Wars Kinect, The Old Republic MMO, Force Unleashed 2, Angry Birds Star Wars????? REALLY???!! Jedi Academy is a classic. The game features the best lightsaber combat system in all Star Wars games. There are hundreds of mods, even for the singeplayer experience. Both multiplayer and singeplayer are great. However, there are no brazilian servers, so its kinda hard to play with 180 MS for the poeple who live in Brazil like me. I think you should definetly buy this game, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. Many references to the movies, comics and expanded universe here. Dont think twice, especially if it's on sale. But its still not my favorite Star Wars game becouse of Battlefront 2, but BF 2 would be 10/10 and this one 9.5? I dont know, go for it! Its old but its gold.			",127,39,2,14,13,2,13

												Best Star Wars game ever?  It's a decent argument with KOTOR but I feel like this game can stand next to anything in the SW franchise and go toe to toe.  The story line is engaging and you really have the freedom to build your character the way you would like.  While it might seem choppy to kids today I remember being amazed by the lightsaber work in this game and despite your feelings on the smoothness you can have a good time with these mechanics.  Pulling off combos with the force powers/lightsaber is really fun and rewarding.  Bought this on console recently and it's almost as fun which is a testimate to the quality of this game.

												Ah, the nostalgia...I must have spent hours in the multiplayer and the single player over and over simply because of the fun you could have; and no game since has been able to capture the dynamic of running around with a lightsaber and scoring walls and other bits and pieces with energy based swords of horrific destruction.  Seriously.  Force Unleashed had some lovely effects, but ultimately it had nothing on this.Albeit that this game is dated the game play, graphics, replayability and decisions on powers / light vs. dark side is quintessential to the ethos.The multiplayer is its own dynamic and for that I am glad: plenty of hidden moves and cool finishers can make what is an entertaining team vs. team a lot of fun and the deathmatch quite unpredicatble: one of the many reasons why I can go back to this game while more modern engines have left me wanting a lot more than they a prepared to deliver.Oh, the good old days...

10/10, Darth Jar Jar recommends this game.If the two KOTORs are praised as one of the best, if not the best games in the Star Wars universe thanks to their well-written and entertaining story, Jedi Academy deserves the same recognition for its perfectly designed combat mechanics. The JKA singleplayer offers  an  intriguing lightsaber combat featuring 5 different techniques, including a staff and dual sabers, and accompanied by both light and dark side force powers. As such, the game will test your combat abilities and put you against stormtroopers, proper Dark Jedies, and other enemies, letting you enjoy all the perks of being a Jedi. Trust me, there is no better feeling than force gripping a defenceless stormtrooper, choking him while he levitates above a botomless abyss, only to release him the second before he dies to watch his body fall into the darkness and oblivion (dark side forces are always so entertaining!).When finally bored with the singleplayer (replayability confirmed, only the story is a bit dull), I recommend installing Movie Battles II, a multiplayer mode for JKA that features a complete lightsaber combat overhaul, focusing on blocking mechanics and different fighting styles from the SW universe. With this mod, the game changes into an incredibly challenging beast, able both to entertain you for hundreds of hours before you finally master it's combat system, and drive you completely nuts by being defeated and humiliated again and again by duelists better than you. What is more, besides waving with a pointy lightstick, you can take on the role of other professions from the Star Wars universe and play in an open mod with objectives as a stormtrooper, bounty hunter, wookie or various types of droids, all with their own special abilities.Playing MBII is sometimes like being in an abusive relationship. It beats the sh*t out of you in such a manner that you feel like having been an*ly r*ped by a particularly large exemplar of a rancor, but somewhere deep inside you know that you want more. And that you seem to enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about Jedi Academy? It gets everything from the previous games right, and continues to add atmosphere and story to this ever growing universe. Good points -1. Fighting, the fighting is just down right fun, you can just bounce all around your enemies and dodge everyone of their moves and feel like a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥while doing so.2. Exploration, outside of just getting through the objectives, there are puzzles that while some might not find hard, I did get stuck on for a few minutes and they made me look around at the map and see how expansive they make these worlds, while you may not even explore them all. The secret areas from the previous games return, but unless you really need an extra health pack, and or ammo refill, you don't have much motivation for finding these areas.Bad points -1. Story, if you didn't already know, this game has you playing as a student at the Jedi Academy, while you and your friends, fight this sith cult. There really isnt much to say, you fight the baddies. There is nothing new about this story, we have all seen it in other forms before. Overall - I really enjoyed this game, it is action packed and filled with some variety in what you do, but as I said before the story is a bit lacking, other than that, this is a game that has hours of fun packed in it. I know I didn't talk about the Multiplayer, because to speak the truth, I couldn't find anyone who had the game, and since the only other option are bots, I played like one game, and there wasn't much to say about it, you were fighting enemies like in the game, and it was fun and all, but I didn't think I needed to say much about it.

												Feel unsatisfied with the current SW games out there and it's combat? Well you're in for a steal. I bought this game because heck, i wouldn't call my self obsessed with SW, but i'm obsessed with SW. So this had to become an addition to my collection of games. All i can say that will fit in a brief summary is this: -The game features the best combat in any star wars game i've ever played. It's silky smooth, satisfyingly gorgeous to look as you swing in the wall and a thick line of molten stone and steel remains, i feel in control and engaged. it's just extremely well executed. -The story is extremely fun and engaging, not to the point where you feel absorbed by it, but you'll feel compelled to know what happens next after every mission. Just very well executed as well.-If you're able to find a multiplayer server, or a friend to play with, you'll have some of the most memorable light saber fights you'll ever experience. You'll be laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off as your dream of becoming a sith-lord comes true. UNLIMITED POOOOOWAAA.Amazing game. Truly what i would consider i cult classic in the SW franchise of games.

												This game was a swift sequel of one of my all times favourites (Jedi Outcast) and of course it couldn't match its predecesor.  But as it failed in some areas, it excelled in others. The worst thing about the game are first two mission sets. Playing it in 2015 I was wondering why I completed so many playthroughs, if it doesn't have the soul of Jedi Outcast and feels as old, aged slasher. I was reminded of this the second I had to fight a guy wielding two lightsabers. And then came the lightstaffs. And I loved this game again. Graphisc is old, and there's no helping that, but light effects are still quite nice. The storry is poor and cut in replacable pieces, but has two endings. Maybe the problem is that choosing the Dark Side made me feel like a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ and made some combat unberably tough (jedi masters with staffs are overhyped). And even if you like it the storry beggs for a sequel. But the best assest of the game - lightsaber combat - was perfected in this one. Every calssic style was enriched with some moves, and two new were added (dual saber, and lighstaff). What's not to love?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well for me, yes. Because this is the best and latest of the Star Wars Jedi Knight series so far with the best improvements. You may not be able to play as Kyle, but he will be your mentoring the protagonist, as you will be played as Custom Model student. Also the best part is you can choose what Lightsaber Hilt and Colour Blade you desire for both Single Player and Multiplayer. And try out on Jedi Academy Plus Client mod, it will enhance your game.http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=557 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had the boxed game when it first came out and played it to death (along with all the others in the JK series).The game improves on JO in almost every respect and focuses more on lightsaber combat than its predecessor with great result. It's simply a brilliant game (even by today's standards). Great memorable levels, great combat and just great fun. I wish we got Star Wars games like this these days. It beats Force Unleashed at every single thing it does.Jimbo Rating: 9/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

												I used to play this game on my xbox when I was a kid, I was too broke for xbox live so I just played bot matches for hours on end and that was still entertaining to me. Recently I saw that this game was on steam so I decided to give it a try and the online community of this game and the aspect of having lightsaber duels with other people to see who is better is addicting. You can hop onto a server and either sit there and chat with people, you can run around swinging your lightsaber like a madman, or you can have duels with people and polish up on your skills. I reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of star wars or to anyone that enjoyed GUNZ: the duel, it's only $9.99 you can spare that for a game that you will most likely fall in love with like I did.

												Probably the best online gaming experience I ever had. I remember even training with a friend to get better at it. In our server we would call them our masters and you would have to show respect.The mechanics are incredible, there are infinite combinations and techniques to outmatch your opponent. Single player doesn't really matter. It's all about the multiplayer and committing yourself to get better and better at being a jedi. It's like a rpg but you don't get upgrades or increase level, you evolve and learn by yourself, an ""academy"" in it's truest sense. I even participated in the ESL jka league.Simply amazing even to this day, it's old I know, but the fact that many servers still manage to survive justifies my review. I will not delve into details but I have to say that the main menu song and the tatooine map one will forever be engraved in my heart.If a new jedi academy game emerged, I would make it my job and go to pro leagues or wtv.

												Absolutely reccomend this game to anyone who likes anything to do with Star Wars! This might only show that I have a short time recorded on it but if you were to check my xfire profile 'truean1hal4ti0n' you will see that I have over 850 hours on this fine game. Why is it great you might ask?In a certain sense, freedom of choice. Don't let that statement mislead you, it isn't an open world game. However, you will experience the most personally controlled combat system you can ever find in this game. You attack differently based on which way you are moving, what stance you're holding, and then there are combos and force attacks, and mixed saber/force attacks. It's hard really to explain exactly what I'm talking about, except that you will find this to have a very entertaining combat system, with a huge learning curve.What else is great about it? The community. Not all of it, but a select few clans namely the Angels of Fire Jedi Order. There are some others, like this fine clan, which reach out to the community to establish a fun and friendly yet serious gaming environment where you will always feel like family, and will never be made to feel like less than another.The single player has a decent story, but not quite as good in comparison to other Jedi Knight titles. This game really shines in the multiplayer, where you can meet some great people and learn how to play a great game.If you do decide to pick up this game, head on over to the AoF clan server labeled AoF recruiting and be introduced properly into the game!

												This is a very fun Star Wars game, probably one of the best out there. Its got good combat, Fun gameplay, and an Interesting story. One thing I always remember was the customization for your Jedi. Its not like Saints Row or Skate 3, but for the time it was cool to not only pick your character but actually customizing your race, clothes, skin color, and even your own lightsaber. Yes, you heard me correctly, you get to customize your own lightsaber! You can give it different hilts and saber color except for red which made me sad for a second but I guess you are a Jedi so it wouldn't make much sense and you can have a red saber in multiplayer, around half-way through the story you lose your lightsaber and get a choice between dual wielded lightsabers, and the famous double-sided lightsaber from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The combat is pretty much the same from Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast which means good for those who have never played a Jedi Knight game. You get a variety of different weapons in the game like the Wookie Bowcaster to the famous E-11 stormtrooper blaster, but the problem is that you get your lightsaber from the very beginning of the game so theres almost no reason to use the guns in the game except for a few missions where you lose your lightsaber and all the rest of your weapons but you can still use the force.The enemies are pretty varied, you fight Stormtroopers, Mercenaries, Sith, and Creatures such as the Rancor. Sometimes they get stronger weapons which can be a bit of a challange. Finally I'm going to talk about the story, Like I mentioned, you play as a new jedi named Jaden Korr who goes to learn at Luke Skywalker's Academy, but the temple was attacked by a cult known as the Deciples of Ragnos, Who are trying to resurrect a Sith Lord who died 5000 years ago. So its up to Jaden Korr and his master Kyle Katarn to stop Ragnos from rising from the dead and to bring peace to the galaxy. Its not as good as Jedi Knight II but its a neat addition. Overall this is a good game from the Star Wars franchise, The game can be fun but its got its flaws, I give it eight Lightsabers out of ten. If you like Star Wars and/or slicing Stormtrooper arms or just want to play a fun game then this game is for you			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Star Wars game ever made, perhaps tied with the KOTOR series for story. This brings the most amazing saber mechanics to date, and once you get tired of the amazing single player, it is unimaginably moddable, and many mods such as Evolution of Combat, or Movie Battles II, bring even more of its potential out. I greatly recommend this game, and hope that some EA representative comes across this game, and utilizes the mechanics in future star wars games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, the third in the Jedi Knight series following Jedi Outcast. In this game you play as Jaden Korr, a jedi in the times after the Empire's defeat on Endor. You will progress along a choice of planets to advance yourself in power. (Whether that be Light or Dark) This game heavily advances past the previous installment with improved saber combat (including acrobatic moves to add to your arsenal, and new saber types as well.) You will also find tons of new Force powers to aid you in your journey.The multiplayer is considered dead at the moment with only a few servers up (for vanilla game only). But if you truly want a Star Wars multiplayer experience that will blow you away; check out the Movie Battles 2 mod! It is a 1 life elimination, objective based experience, with different classes. Very similar to Counter Strike. And the best part is, the community is growing stronger with about 400 players on at a single time. Which is impressive regarding a game that has been out since 2003.10/10 Mod will consume your life http://www.moviebattles.org/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I've always been in love with Jedi Knight; Jedi Outcast 2, I have my issues with it's sequel, Jedi Academy. Do I think the game is good, however? Well, it does say ""Recommended"", right? However, as I usually do, I will keep the bad stuff of the game ahead.First and foremost, while the game doesn't have as many as the previous game, it still has a few graphical errors with modern games. Mainly resolutions being 4:3, but those are fixed quite easily.What is probably the biggest problem, however, ain't the graphics but the direction the game takes. Remember the enthralling storyline the previous game had? Not here. In here instead, Kyle becomes a secondary character, and instead you create your own character, which sounds great on paper... But falls flat, as you're only given the choice of your combat style, being male or female, your outfit and race, and later on the game, what ending you want. You can also choose what missions to do, but that's kinda pointless as you have to clear at least 4 of the 5 given missions to advance the game.And that's another thing, the missions themselves are... Well, dissapointing compared to the previous game. Jedi Academy goes more for an ""arcade"" style, with items arround it and quantity of enemies over quality. Not until later in the game you're given a proper challenge, and even then half the enemies will be easy to kill by pushing them down a cliff and similar stuff. It also doesn't help at all that the game is WAY more short than the previous.It's third problem, is a character itself. Rosh. At the first minute of your playthrough you meet this guy, and even since then you will most likely hate him already. He's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ a worthless meatbag, and a bad character overall. And the hilarious part is that the writers of the game probably knew it, and  give you the option to kill him near the end, unlocking the Sith ending.The last issue this game has, is that weapons are irrelevant. From the start of the game you'll have your light-saber, and you'll BARELY use anything else, which is a shame, as the game still has it's great FPS action there from the previous game. It does force you to use them in one of the missions, and there is a new cool weapon, but that's it.All that aside, however, what do we have left? An enjoyable game were you get to feel like a motherf#cking Badass Jedi. Likely because of the incompetent enemies, but a Badass never the less. Light-saber combat is not only great, but it beats the previous game. Not only there are a few new moves, but there are also 2 new styles of combat: using two light-sabers at the same time, or using a dual-blade saber. There are also some sort of special attacks that can be used when hitting Mouse 1 and Mouse 2 at the same time, which consumes half your Force bar, but deal insane damage. About force powers, they're still there. Some have changed whoever, some have been erased, and some others have been added. The game does f#ck it when it gives you the choice of getting them at the order you desire, as they can make the game EXTREMELY EASY early on (such as the Lightning force power at LVL3, which nearly instantly kills most enemies of the early game, and deals high damage to enemy jedis, even pushing them back). Later in the game you'll have to get used to them to advance, and they can also be used to find cool secret areas, although there are not nearly as many as in the previous game.The multiplayer is also back in action, having more content and active players than the previous game, mainly because it has nearly all the crap it had before, but with some new aditions. Tons of models to choose for yourself (also having the option of making a custom one for yourself, like in the singleplayer game), and tons of maps and gamemodes as well.The game is also easily modabble, for the people out there who want to add crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥to the game, but that's up to you. It does help, however, to add better animations, textures and such.Is the game good? Yes. You'll have fun. However, if you're looking for a singleplayer experience, go play Jedi Knight; Jedi Outcast 2, as it delivers WAAAAAAAAAAY better than Jedi Academy. If you're looking for multiplayer action or mods, then this one's for you, and it's a solid purchase on a sale.And for the love of f#ck, kill Rosh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Add about 200 hours playtime to my steam playtime, I played the crap out of a retail DRM-free version.I loved this game when I was a small teenage boy. Now, I'm a big teenage boy and - dayum, this is (still!) some good stuff.If you're looking for an engaging single player story, better play ""Jedi Outcast"". ""Jedi Outcast"" has a terrible level design, in my opinion (playable and enjoyable, non the less), but the story is so much, much, MUCH better (Katarn > Jaden).""Jedi Academy"" lives from its Multiplayer.

												As one of the first PC games I played online, Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy holds a nostalgic value for me.The game was pushed out  before it was fully finished, so a few things were left out that were being developed. Luckily it had a large modding community and there was (and still is) plenty to add to it. Although the singleplayer is lacking, the multiplayer has always been particularly fun & there are a great bunch of people keeping this game alive and keeping it challenging for newcomers.For such a cheap price I couldn't recommend it more.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was my childhood. Now, it is my adulthood.10/10Seriously, this is the definitive Jedi experience. After creating your own padawan from a number of races, skin tones and costumes (with more choices through mods), you undergo training with Kyle Katarn as your master and complete missions all over the galaxy in any order, gaining new jedi abilities and lightsaber fighting styles along the way. The main plot of the game unfolds and changes depending on decisions you make toward the end of the game.In addition, the multiplayer is still alive and challenging. Learning the different saber combos and styles to kill other players is still as rediculously hard and fun as it was back when this game came out.If you're on the fence about this game, just buy it. This was definitely one of Raven Software's and LucasArts' best games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS:+ decent story+ fun gameplay+ satisfying lightsaber combat+ cool missions+ creating your own character+ being a Jedi (or Sith)+ two endings+ great modsCONS:- graphic & resolution options are outdated- story is less driven and lacks a bit of focus- much less need of shooting compared to previous Jedi Knight games- level design could be betterComment:The Jedi Knight series moves onto this part where you no longer play as Kyle Katarn but get to create your own character. The game is much more lightsaber oriented as is shown by giving you one right at the beginning. And that is what the game excels at - lightsaber combat. Oh, and how much fun it is! With the dismemberment option on it feels like really having a powerful weapon you can cut every opponent with. On top of that you of course get Force powers. The story is not bad but lacks focus because you play as an unknown character without any background. Instead of looking over some plot events it instead rotates around your decisions to either become a Jedi or a Sith. This also effects the level design a bit. However it remains fun and enjoyable. Noteworthy are also two other things - multiplayer and mods. The community of players who play online is still strong and even some mods have a big following of players. The mods especially use most of the potential. like when some mods are letting you play ALL Star Wars lightsaber duels (movie ones and also others). This is definitely a game for anyone who likes Star Wars and lightsaber combat. Recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game off of a Humble Bundle deal with pretty much every other Star Wars game. All for only $12. Anyways, in my opinion, the multiplayer makes this game. That and the content you can download for the game off of the Jedi Knight filefront website. It is similar to Garry's Mod in the ways of anyone able to make stuff for the game and people can download it. Anyways, if anyone plans on getting this game and wants to have someone to play with, just message me or so and I will help you get what is necessary to get into my friend's server.This game gets a +. Lots a things to do when you have friends to play with and downloadable content to get off of filefront.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars fan or otherwise, the Jedi Knight series (JKII:Outcast and JK:JAcademy) has one of (if not decisively) the best swordfighting mechanics to date, on par with the likes of Rune and Severance. For this alone, they are worth playing. Single player acts as a fun introduction to gameplay and provides all the tools needed (at a good pace) for moving on to the engaging multiplayer, which is truly where the game shines.If you get bored with the default game (unlikely), then it's most popular modification, 'Movie Battles II' kicks it up a notch in a class based siege style gameplay true to the movies. Different features, equally competitive and satisfying.If you want more acrobatic swordplay and are tired of the alternative's (Chivalry:Medieval Warfare / War of the Vikings) equally solid but slower pace, this is the one to try.

												A very fun Star Wars game.Pros:The story is good. Its not as amazing as the movie story but it is pretty good.The combat is just amazing. You can jump around, do cool attacks with your light saber and you can use weapons and force. Personally I didn't find the weapons as cool as force or light sabers (I only used the missile launcher). Fun multiplayer.Lots of cool force powers (only the dark ones are awesome, the others are just cool).Cons:No waypoints.There is only one place in the game where you can choose between the light and the dark side.Not a lot of missions.You can't take any moral choices.Bad vehicles.Summary:A short, fun Star Wars game with a good multiplayer. But lacks in moral choices and waypoints.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 26, 2015
												Jedi Academy is the latest and greatest (2003) of the Kyle Katarn/Dark Forces Star Wars series and the only one that I was able to play recently, due to the older games’ incompatibility with more modern Windows versions. I was unfortunately unable to get the game to run at higher resolutions than the default 800 x 600, but since I’ve played the game before, I was able to go through pretty fast and just ignore the poor graphics. The game is more than a decade old after all.The game’s story follows a new Jedi recruit named Jaden as he tries to work his way up to Jedi knight status. He has to hit the ground running though, since his very first day arriving at the academy there’s an attack by a mysterious Sith cult called the Disciples of Ragnos. This cult of dark force users is led by Tavion, one of the minor villains from a previous Jedi Knight game, who has now acquired some ancient Sith tech and is able to power up herself and her followers with it. With some help from your master Kyle Katarn, you have to stop Tavion and her followers from their grand plan of resurrecting a long dead Sith lord. Like the preceding Dark Forces Jedi Knight games, Jedi Academy is a first person shooter except when you pop out your lightsabre, then it switches to a third person perspective. Honestly though, you should probably have your lightsabre out all the time, so really it’s a third person sword game where you can use guns if you want. Right from the start you have a few force powers to choose from, such as push, pull, speed, and sight. These powers improve naturally as you go through the game and you can also choose between light/dark powers such as heal, lightning, protect, etc. I’ve played through the game about half a dozen times and I almost always get the same powers (heal, lightning, dark rage). They’re just too good to skip. You won’t be able to max all of the available skills, but you do have some room to experiment.The guns in the game, while good, just can’t match the effectiveness of a lightsabre. The lightsabre not only kills most enemies in one hit, it also deflects enemy lasers. As you progress, your ability to deflect/reflect enemy shots improves, and by the end you probably won’t be taking much damage from stormtroopers. The true obstacles in your path will be the cultist warriors who use lightsabres and force powers of their own. Lightsabre combat is a huge part of the game and if you suck at it, you’ll be stomped many times over. Fortunately (or not) there seems to be a tremendous element of luck when it comes to sword fighting, and if you swing wildly, there’s a good chance you’ll chop down the weaker enemies easily. Just remember that the game doesn’t autosave very often, so if you don’t manually save before sword fights, you might end up replaying large sections of the game. Remember how I said there was a lot of luck involved? Yeah, a weak enemy can slice you down in one shot very easily.Pros:+Right from the start you have force powers and a lightsabre, unlike the previous Dark Forces games I played. The sword fighting can make you feel like a badass with the slow-mo kills and katas (flashy sword moves) that you can use.+The story is intriguing and you get to try out a bunch of Star Wars weaponry. Most of them suck, but the concussion rifle is pretty cool. Watch out for the splash damage though, it’s huge. Remember though, that guns do not work on enemy force users. They either reflect the shot at you or just dodge it like Neo.Cons:-The game is very old, and with that comes poor graphics and incompatibility with Windows 7 & 8. You can get the game to run, but the screen resolution thing is very annoying. I tried everything from using compatibility mode to manually setting custom resolutions and restarting, but it just never changed.-It is possible to just run through most of the game not fighting anyone, especially in the last few levels. The vast majority of enemies will stop chasing you if you get more than one room away. This includes the more powerful cultist sword masters as well (the real threats). Also, if you’re looking for an overpowered force ability, the force lightning can get you through most of the game, clearing out entire rooms of baddies in one shot.Overall, the game is fun to play, and if you have it from the recent Star Wars bundle, this is probably the oldest game on there that I would still replay. The other Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games have aged poorly and may not be worth it, despite how good they were back in the day. ",655,205,34,57,43,12,103

												Jedi Academy is a decent entry in the Star Wars saga.  The gameplay is fun and iconic, the voice acting is actually pretty impressive despite it's dated script, and the amount of weapons make for a good amount of gameplay variety.  However, the controls and moves are very tough to master, and any newcomer would get murdered in the multiplayer.  It's kind of tough to use the force powers because you keep forgetting whitch hotkeys you set them too, and some puzzles can be very cryptic.  And a word to the wise, SAVE OFTEN!!! This is a very challenging game that is very tough to master, but is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With the mod MovieBattlesII, it is now essentially the best Battlefront-esque game you can play with a small and fairly active group of veterans and casuals to test your mettle against.The mod overhauls the vanilla saber combat into a really deep and intuitive new system which is unforgiving to newbies but very satisfying to learn the secrets and techniques. The extended duels always make me feel like I'm in an actual lightsaber battle, even when I lose my head (literally!).Each side also has 6(!!!) other classes with guns, including jetpack-equipped Mandolorians and Droidekas. But sabers is why I still play.Give it a go, it hasn't disappointed in 13 years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best in the jedi knight series. Jedi academy let's you play as a custom character, Do missions in what order you want,  lightsaber customizations, different fighting styles, and two endings. This game has so many lightsabers tricks and moves you will get annihilated in multiplayer, but overpowered in singleplayer. You can customize your own lightsaber hilt, select from a basic lightsaber, to two lightsabers or a lightstaff. This game is very replayable as there are multiple endings depending on an action you do mid game. and you can always try different moves and fghting styles on your second playtroughs.  The story is interesting and has you going trough a lot of different locations such as: Hoth, Tatooine, Yavin, Corelia, Dosuun, yalara, and more! The voice acting is really good. The multiplayer is still alive and great. i totally recommend this game to any star wars fan and gamer. ( 9/10)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fairly outdated when compared to The Force Unleashed, Jedi Academy is still a decent game.  It may be hard to look past the ancient physics engine when you first start the game, but once you get into it, it grows on you.  The story is someone stilted and lacks sense at times, and the cutscenes don't add to it.  If you're look for a good jedi game though, this is probably the best LucasArts has to offer.

												Star war's jedi knight jedi academy is a sort of 3rd person dueling combat type game,If you play singleplayer it basicly goes like this.Make your char play a couple of mission's.Level up either lightside or darkside force powers that does affect luke and kyle talk to you about.If you max out a darkside force power they will say your future is clouded and be carefull!If you pick lightside they say You have a bright future you get a idea of what it is it take's a star wars game with very go here and never go anywhere else because this isn't a open world game type game,You have to go the same path over and over and over depending on if you play the game over again.The combat is good for a 2003 game it hold's up with many other game's that were at the time considered the best games of the year of course it doesn't have the AWESOME PS4/XBOX ONE/Awesome beast pc graphic's but for that time they were good.The Multiplayer part of the game is well done with a bunch of mode's to choose from such as duel,team ffa,FFaCapture the flag,Siege and more.But the best part about this game is the mods you can put into your game to add extra content or just silly stuff like let's say you install,A new model for your game you can play as that model and etc.Now i reccomend the Conversion mod MB2 which improves the combat alot.The base game is still a blast to play and you can have hours of fun playing this game.So i give Star war's jedi knight jedi academy a 7/10 it would be higher if you put mod's on it but that overall game is great on it's own and is repeatable without getting boring you can spend hours on end playing this game.

												This game is.. Ok. It has goods, and it has bads. The graphics and animations are not good, but that is to be expected from a game as old as it, so I will not say any more on the subject. The ability to use force powers and lightsabers are awesome, and executed really well, making it feel quite realistic. However, the story of the game is lacking, almost feeling a bit tacked on, and the play time is only about 10 hours per play. It has good replay value though, not the best, but I have played it over many times, just because the combat is so fun to use. This game is good, and I do reccomend it, if you enjoy shooting people with lightning and cutting people in half. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... I played this gem. Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is probably, by far, my most favorite Star Wars game. PS: Despite my gametime is only 3 odd hours or so, I've actually beaten this game multiple times in the past.. with my now abandoned Windows XP machine. Ha.This game offers two modes, single player where you progress through the storyline as Jaden or Multiplayer where you play against other players in Royal Rumble FFA or Capture the Flag (my favorite mode). This review emphasizes on SP side.In single player, you'll have to beat three chapters consisting five episodes each to the total of fifteen. And later you have to beat 'boss levels' after each chapter, so make it eighteen. Gametime as a whole for SP mode isn't that long, ten odd hours or less. But still, entertaining. Each episode has its own unique objective, ranging from rescue mission to dismantling bombs. The variety of environment design and levels also make it enjoyable to progress through this single player missions.Everytime you enter an episode, except boss levels, you'll have a chance to assign one Force Power to pick one among eight options, four Light Core and four Dark Cores. This makes things a bit more personal and customizable to suit your liking. You want to be the real Protector Jedi? Pick Light Cores. Or you want to be the real dark side? Get Rage and Lightning Force for all chaos you want! Do note that picking Cores doesn't affect the ending, despite Luke's review after each Act finished. The ending (good side or dark side) will be affected much later in the game by making a choice. I won't spoil that, though, here.Customization extends a bit more, where you can select from pre-made character designs and your lightsaber hilts / color. Much later in the game, you'll be allowed to construct more advanced lightsaber like Duals and Staff. And yeah, unlike in previous title Outcast, you'll have this lightsaber right off the bat in your arsenal. Only the Advanced Lightsabers that won't be available straight from the start.Control mappings admittedly are very nice. You'll have no issue assigning keyboard buttons to specific action e.g Jumping or Crouching. The  menu also can detect modern Keyboards/Mice weird buttons so you can assign the commands to those as well.Game mechanic is terrific and personally for me it's this game's strongest point. With Lightsaber available in many styles, you can have fun fighting your opponents - slashing right and left and launching Lightning attacks at them. All done in real time! There are few combos you can learn from in-game manuals so that you can have easier fights especially when playing on higher difficulty levels. I rarely trigger my guns, except when forced in one level - in that level your Lightsaber is confiscated so yeah....Graphic wise, the game's not aged well. In order to 'play' the game properly, you have to get some settings right. First, the tame has to be manually set up if you want to play on widescreens - pretty much modern LCDs. Lower textures are seen from the get-go everywhere - by today's standard, anyway.  There's a workaround for that, though. Mods for textures are also available to make it more bearable if you can't stand the original. Game also refuses to be minimized, making it silly if you love to alt-tab while playing like me. As it stands, there are game breaking bugs. I've personally encountered bugs where a door essential to progress refused to open (dismantling the bombs mission in a reactor). I restarted that mission from the scratch and hoped to progress, luckily I was able to after restart. Don't expect a patch for this.However, being an old game, you can expect your weak rig that can't run Evolve or some other high demanding games NOW launches this game with ease, with all graphic settings maxed. Game also is compatible with modern OS, much to my surprise. I am running this game well on Windows 7 x64 and 8.1 x64 without issues - other than issues from the game itself (game breaking bug I wrote above). I can't say about MAC version as I don't have MAC, or Linux if you want to WINE this.All in all, a very recommended game even for just Single Player if you can't stand Multiplayer.Old school score: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												really a game ahead of its time, I'm really impressed with this title and it still holds up in 2014. Gameplay is everything that I want in a Star Wars title. At some times you may feel slightly OP using the lightsaber, but the occasional duel against sith is challenging, exciting, and extremely satisfying. I love the lightsaber mechanics and how the saber burns everything it touches, making each kill different in a really cool way. The only downside I can think of is character customization. I'd love if some more races and character skins were available.If you're looking for some really satisfying and creative Jedi combat, I highly suggest purchasing this game. If my steam library was somehow wiped clean and I needed to start my collection from scratch, this would be one of the first games I would re-buy.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my review of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.It is an excellent old game and has aged very well. Released in 2003 but the modding community is still very active. Even though the single player game is short, it is very enjoyable to play with it's fun combat and different level designs. It gets harder into the game as you fight lightsaber users. Once you have complete the single player (or you do not have to), download MovieBattles 2. It is what the game now is all about as the vanilla multiplayer is dead. MovieBattles 2 is loads better with better modded maps throughout the StarWars saga. Now with the enhanced combat system is even more enjoyable to play for both shooting and lightsaber combats. More characters to play as from clone troopers, Darth Maul, wookies and even more in multiplayer deathmatch games. Do you like fighting others with lightsabers? Join in a duel server and challenge other jedis or siths in a lightsaber duel and beat each other over countless of hours!Overall this game is fantastic to play only with MovieBattles 2 as the vanilla game has aged and is dead. I really recommend this game to either StarWars fan or a non fan after a huge disappointment over the release of Battlefront game. Jedi Academy is the real and the best StarWars game out there.

												I recommend Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Acadamy. The combat is usually fun and being a psycho lunatic laser sword butcher is fun. It's always fun enough to keep playing, but there are some things holding the game back. I have some big reservations about this game. The voice acting was really terrible. It's the kind you'd expect from a cheap cartoon for ten year olds. The same goes for the plot.  At one point it is revealed the recruit who was obviously going to turn on the jedi from the moment he was introduced at the beginning of the game has in fact turned on the jedi. In his defense, though, the dark side did have two hot dark jedi chicks that liked to party. The Jedi Academy run by Luke just had some old coots nagging you to keep a good attitude while you're doing their work. Being a Star Wars title there's plenty of jibber jabber about sides of the force. I don't really see how the jedi can claim to be so morally superior when they kill everyone that stands in the way of their goals. It's just because they're not♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off or scared when they're doing it that keeps them from turning to the dark side of the force? There are a good solid 18 levels or so and took around 12 hours to finish game. While they do a reasonably good job of mixing of the objectives and scenery of the varied locations. It all really boils down to fighting most enemies with guns or dark jedi with a light saber and doing a lot of often crazy platform jumping. Towards the end of the game I was getting so tired of fighting light saber duels. I just stopped fighting them whenever possible  and kept running ahead until they stopped chasing me. It was a largely successful strategy for speeding up the game. The light saber fighting is maybe about as good as one can realistically expect. There are a couple of types of slashes and the light saber can be thrown like a boomerang. The fights seemed like they just came down to spamming the button until enough hits connect. When winning a duel the game will go into slow motion and you can see a cool shot of the fatal blow and bodies do get sliced up.  The worst part about them is that it's expected to use force powers during duels and it can be hard trying to move my characater and hitting the function keys at the same time. The best part, hands down, is using the force push to throw enemies off of cliffs. Hilarious every time.  As the game progresses the main character is completing his jedi training and he becomes more powerful as the game procedes. By the time the game is ending your character can jump five stories high and the light saber is almost heat-seaking.  You can also choose optional force powers to upgrade at the end of each level. So there are some very minor RPG elements to the game.The music in the game is just classic Star Wars soundtrack and it still sounds fantastic. The boss fights are really tough and time consuming. They deliver big damage quickly and so most of the time I'd spending running around avoiding them while I recharge my health and then engage them again for a minor skirmish before I run away again to heal up. The game isn't overly difficult. I did save a lot, though. Jedi Acadamy is fun, it just lacks that certain something should have taken it to the next level.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the best games ever about one of the best film franchises ever. It completely captures the feeling of the original Star Wars trilogy that first blessed us in 1977.  It's got the magic, the cheesiness, the charm, the story, the characters, and the world of Star Wars. This game is incredibly underrated and a lot of people would play Knights Of The Old Republic if they were looking for a great Star Wars game. I love that game as much as the next guy, but i will say that this game has a much better combat system. Due to these examples. the game is near perfect. Now as good as this game is, it does have it's flaws. The voice acting is not very good, the graphics are incredibly outdated, and some of the animations are very stiff. However, since it came out in 2003, I'm willing to shrug it off. Overall, this game is definitely worth playing for any Star Wars fan, so I would give it a 9.2/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After years of playing this game when I was younger, I could not find a game that itched that Star Wars scratch as good as this game. Honestly, I've played many good games, many so-called ""Game[s] of the Year,"" but no game has really given me the satisfaction like this one does. Simply put - it is a masterpiece. That is why, after all these years, I was drawn back into it. More specifically, I was drawn back into the MBII modification for the game. It is superb, with an active and friendly community. A lot of people still play this and I've noticed that there has been some newcomers as well. This community deserves to grow. The game + MBII mod are too good to go unnoticed. Honestly, this game has aged well. The graphics are still good. And the availability of content, of FREE content is vast. This game deserves more publicity because honesty it puts all other games to shame. Buy it. Play it. Download MBII. Play MBII. Prosper.Welcome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But any Star Wars fan (such as myself) will tell you that these Jedi Knight games developed by Raven are, by far, the best Star Wars games out there. The lightsaber combat is engaging and you can run around with a single lightsaber with your choice of fighting style, use dual-wield lightsabers, or channel your inner Darth Maul and use a staff. There's a plethora of force powers to use, even the movie ones such as Jedi Mind Trick and Force Choke. While the multiplayer side is most likely dead, the singleplayer experience is fine on its own.But the best part is the modding community. Adding mods is almost as easy as downloading files from the Steam Workshop, and Star Wars fans are probably the most creative people out there. You can play as Darth Vader for your Sith needs, or give the game a comedic effect and saber people as Homer Simpson, Duffman, or even Bender. There is a singleplayer mod that allows you to romp around as Jack Sparrow. If you wish the game had more up-to-date graphics, somebody has created an HD texture overhaul, and there is also a Widescreen mod to make the game fit a 1920x1080 monitor properly.Overall, I give this game a 9/10. It's definitely a unique experience with or without mods and even if you aren't a fan of Star Wars, you can still have a great time with this game. If you love Star Wars, you'll love this. Oh, and grab the source code. What is in there is hilarious.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To this date, this game is still the the most fun I've had wielding a lightsaber and swinging it around! The story is alright, but well managed and fun. The real king here is the gameplay value and even without all the mods you can find online (Yes, there are mods!) this game is still great on its own. In Jedi Academy you essentially make your own character and go through the story as that character. There are very few choices to make which determine whether you're becoming good or falling to the darkside. With the several amounts of mods you can do much more than just the story! For example my video above shows the mod - Movie Duels II where you can play through different scenes from some of the movies! :DI full on recommend this game for fans!

												This is one of the games that got me into PC gaming way back when. Jedi Knight II, Jedi Academy, and Aliens vs Predator 2 to be exact. My brother came home one night with this, bought it at a game store at our local shopping mall. He started playing it and I would watch him play, it was incredible. I'll never forget when I first played it I was hooked. This game delivers intense action that is just all around a good time. The fighting mechanics are simple enough where you don't need to be an expert to have fun, but at the same time it will take you a long time to master certain features and fighting styles. This is how a melee based game should be. Now we all just need to hope that they make a new one after the new Battlefront releases.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10. Should have been titled ""Star Wars Jedi Knight 3: Jedi Academy."" The Jedi Knight games have a continuing story line with Jedi Knight 2: Outcast preceeding this one. Approximately, twenty hours of game play. Very well thought out story line and missions. Considering the date it was released, very good production. I would have given it a 9/10 if it wasn't for memory allocation bugs resulting in crashes that existed at its release to today. Also, experienced bug'd trigger events, two, requiring exiting and starting the game to correct. Overall the game was well worth the sale price of $5 (versus $10) and an enjoyable twenty hours.

												The best Star Wars games with Multiplayer. The story is good the fighting is pretty good for its time. Sure TFU is a bit more epic in the way you use your force powers but I think this game has better light saber combat in many ways because you can choose to use a Saber Staff, Dual Sabers, or Single Saber. I really enjoy that aspect. I doubt it but maybe they'll come out with another game in a similar style that allows you to use some of the guns and such while still having GREAT Saber Combat.

There is no game that comes close to the perfection of light saber/ground combat, both in single and multiplayer games.  Force powers are balanced and fun to use, gun play is satisfying, lightsaber combat comes complete with special moves that make lightsaber battles as much fun to play as they are to watch.  Any gamer worth their salt should play this game, at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is literally the best sword fighting multiplayer game out there, especially if you consider trying out mods. Besides lightsabers, it also has a bunch of guns from the Star Wars universe as well, if you're more into shooting.The singleplayer storyline may seem a bit weak in comparison to the predecessor Jedi Knight games, though that's just general opinion. I personally enjoy going through the singleplayer quite a lot. In any case, an improved lightsaber combat, high moddability and great multiplayer action more than makes up for the flaws.Graphics-wise, Jedi Academy isn't exactly up to par with the modern games, however with the release of Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy's source codes, we can expect the graphics to be improved by the modding community. The folks at JKHub[jkhub.org], for instance, are working on implementing rend2 (the renderer of the newer ioquake3 game engine).Regarding mods, I seriously suggest Movie Battles II[moviebattles.com]. Been playing it for years, and to tell the truth, I hardly touched the base Jedi Academy's multiplayer after starting this mod up.If you're into sword combat, like to freely control your character's movements or just looking for an action Star Wars game, do yourself a favor and try Jedi Academy out.

												There have been many Star Wars games that have come out after the dawn of the xbox and even beforehand that have been great hits like Knights of the Old Republic, Rogue, and the predecessors of this game known as Outcast. This game has aged, and it may not have the best story but the most loveable aspect of this classic is that it is ADDICTING to play. It is probably the best made free movement jedi lightsaber duelling title out there still to this day. I been playing this game since it came out over a decade ago and I am still very much loving it,If you love Star Wars, and you like reading up on the expanded universe or know it already, play this game and the Outcast series. Id give this game two thumbs up but its not enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After years of playing this game when I was younger, I could not find a game that itched that Star Wars scratch as good as this game. Honestly, I've played many good games, many so-called ""Game[s] of the Year,"" but no game has really given me the satisfaction like this one does. Simply put - it is a masterpiece. That is why, after all these years, I was drawn back into it. More specifically, I was drawn back into the MBII modification for the game. It is superb, with an active and friendly community. A lot of people still play this and I've noticed that there has been some newcomers as well. This community deserves to grow. The game + MBII mod are too good to go unnoticed. Honestly, this game has aged well. The graphics are still good. And the availability of content, of FREE content is vast. This game deserves more publicity because honesty it puts all other games to shame. Buy it. Play it. Download MBII. Play MBII. Prosper.Welcome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll start with the biggest strength: There is no better series/game for a free flowing lightsaber/force power action game, past or present. Battlefront and Force Unleashed were the closest in the Star Wars universe and others have tried in other universes with similar concepts but none of them touch the feel of this game in my opinion. I have played them all extensively and I still come back to this one when I really want to swing a saber and throw some fools off a ledge with Grip or Lightning. The movement and Force Powers all feel just right and the varied move sets based on saber stances/styles are endlessly adaptable to make for a unique fight every time - or you can find one trick you love and use it till your fingers grow arthritic.That brings me to the second strongest aspects: It was one of the first games to successfully implement environment running once you level up a bit (aka Jedi parkour). You can hop around, wall run, and just generally be a badass both in and out of fights. The missions are all in unique locations that capture the feel of the universe and provide unique experiences. The graphics and physics have held up well all things considered - at the time they were incredible. That isn't to say there aren't flaws, but nothing game breaking that I have found and generally lots of fun.The biggest weakness: The story line is a bit predictable but I honestly don't care one tiny bit. The general idea and delivery is good enough for me. If you are expecting something that will cause you to do some serious soul searching, this is probably not going to be the place to find it, but there are two endings for a bit of variety.Overall I would strongly recommend this game because it delivers on what it tries to deliver on - great gameplay in a fast paced lightsaber/force using environment with a million different ways to approach any fight.

												Jedi Academy is a game I look upon with reverence very frequently. It's the first game I ever clocked more then 300 hours into and was largely the reason I became a PC gamer in the first place.The singleplayer is unfortunately the weakest part about the game, and is the weakest in the series thus far. Instead of playing as series protagonist Kyle Katarn, you're dopey a student of his. In general it's a fairly weak story with not so great characters. On the flipside though it has great map design, and it has an extremely satisfying Dark Side ending that even features a different final boss.Where this game shines the most is in it's multiplayer. They expanded the multiplayer of Jedi Outcast to the point of utter perfection. The Quake 3 engine was almost pushed to it's limits with this game. It was elegant, masterful, and truly one of my favorite games of all time. However that was then, this is now. And unfortunately the multiplayer community now is a shadow of it's former self. It's a tragic story that extends to the rest of the series, since it never continued past this game.I would still recommend this game though as the first one to try out. Since it is the easiest game to get into as a newcomer to the franchise. It lets you jump straight into the lightsaber combat (as opposed to Dark Forces 2 and Jedi Outcast where you don't unlock the lightsaber until a few levels in) and features the most refined lightsaber combat in the entire series.

												I can safely say that this is one of the best Star Wars games I have ever played... and I've played a lot of them.But what makes this game truly great is the mod MovieBattles 2. It turns this game into the most advanced lightsaber system you'll ever find in a game. It also makes the game more enjoyable than I could ever imagine. Don't believe me? See for yourself...

												It is one of the best game I have ever played. I was playing this game when I was a child, it was about 6-7 years ago. As I can remember, I enjoyed it very much! When I was playing it this time, I enjoyed it not less, except that I had a feeling of nostalgia somehow. To tell the truth, I can assure that Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is THE BEST game in Star Wars series. Here you can wave your lightsaber. Here you can use the Force. The other “lightsaber fights” games are rewritten from this one. As we can see, Jedi Academy is truly a “standard”. =)And no one cares that this game is more than 10 years old! Everything old is new again, after all.By the way, if you beat company and still didn’t become a true Jedi, this game has a fascinating multiplayer. It consists from nice and cosy fights with other members of Star Wars community, just like you. Actually, there are no more than 2,000 active players, because not everyone still remember how to deal with lightsaber. Nevertheless, you’ll not be bored, I promise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sits beside KOTOR as one of the absolute BEST Star Wars games. Most of my review is based on the physical disc version and recent GOG (DRM-free) release of SWJK: JA, so my Steam stats don't tell the whole tale.PROS:+Good amount of character customization. Species, sex, outfit, even Light Saber are all customizable.+Non-linear missions. From choosing what missions to tackle to how to go about them, in semi-open worlds, it ALMOST feels like a Star Wars GTA.+Non-linear upgrades. Force Powers can be chosen and upgraded based on personal preference.+Multiplayer battle arenas against both human and AI opponents.CONS:-Old 6th gen (PS2 era) graphics.-Linear story.-No choosing between Light or Dark paths; you're a Boy/Girl Scout; no being a Sith.

												I've wanted this game ever since I was a kid years ago.  The awesome combat system and being able to create your own Jedi was really appealing.  I've finally been able to buy it and I can say that it was everything little ol me could have hoped for. The lightsaber fights are pretty cool, they could obviously use some work but considering this is a 2003 game it's ok to let that slide. The story was fun to play through and a lot longer than I anticipated. I enjoyed using the skill tree and having the ability to use both light and dark side powers (the latter of which I used a lot >:)). Later in the story, you're given a choice to choose to either follow the light side or the dark side. I ended up choosing the light path but I plan on replaying it some day and going to the dark side.I'd definitely recommend this game, especially for any Star Wars fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely fantastic, this is what a star wars game should be (Well, this or battlefront) The lightsaber combat is executed brilliantly, and the multiple endings along with the different ways of playing add a large amount of replayability to this classic.

												This was one of my favorite games growing up as a child. I have owned a disk copy of the game since I was 9 years old and have logged several hundred hours in both campaign and multiplayer. The game has a nice story, playing as an unknown jedi wannabe with a lightsaber as you train to become a jedi master one day. The online gameplay is great, with the game usually having a great fanbase who after 12 years are still playing this game religiously. For those who don't want to fight with only lightsabers, there is a nice selection of other weapons as well (I reccomend the disruper rifle. That's my personal favorite). Because this game is 12 years old, it can run well on almost any computer you install it on, but the graphics are still really good for how old it is. The lightsabers are beautiful with nice lighting, sound, and motion. Overall, I give this game an 11/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												JK:JA is a fantastic fps game with some fantastic optional mods. The gameplay is excellent with many creative approaches. If you like Star Wars and enjoy being a Jedi or Sith, this is definitely a game that you will love. Though its drawback is that it has little replayability due to a linear storyline, Jedi Academy has exactly what the Battlefront games are missing which is a focus on the lightsaber and force wielding characters.

												This is the best Star Wars game I've played, other than KOTOR. (Although honestly I haven't played KOTOR II or any of the other Jedi Knight games.) •The combat system is the best I've seen in a Star Wars game. •The missions are fun and challenging, even on the regular difficulty. •The main game is long enough without being too long(unless you're as bad as I am). •There is a nice amount of character customization, but the species choices are a bit lacking. •The graphics still hold up well for a game that was made over a decade ago. •And there is still online multiplayer that is pretty fun.Now, for the bad stuff (which isn't a lot)•First off, the vehicle controls are really broken and wonky. Fortunately, you only use a vehicle twice in the game, and it's optional one of those times.•As I mentioned earlier, the character customization felt a little restricted. For some odd reason, the genders are tied onto the species, which means you can't have a male Zabrak(Darth Maul's species) or a female Keldor(Plo Koon's species).•The lip-sync is pretty bad, and so is Luke's voice actor, but these were only minor annoyances.I highly recommend this game, and I guarantee you'll love it. That is unless you hate Star Wars...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game on the wintersale 2015 for 2 bucks.I never thought  that i would say it, but this is by far one of the best games i have ever played.The mechanics are simply amazing. Do you like Star Wars? Then you must play this game.Small guide to play properly:Download Gameranger in order to find servers.Once you start playing you'll notice the graphics are quite bad.You can fix that by getting the console up using SHIFT + ~.Then type the following commands:r_customwidth 1920r_customheight 1080r_mode -1vid_restartNow you have alot better graphics.Hosting  a server through Gameranger might be a little tricky.It might happen that whenever you want to host on high graphics, your game crashes whenever you change maps or modes.The only way for me to fix that is, by manually changing the graphics to 800x600, then change whatever you want to change and use the commands again to tune up the graphics.

The Choice is yours to make and yours alone. But Remember, Both Light & Dark Sides of the Force are not ment for Good or Evil, it's how you use them.

												There are two reasons I love this game. First I'll talk about the base game itself. The base game is very intriguing, with great saber combat, accompanied by optional,  yet good, blaster combat in either 1st or 3rd person. There are multiple upgradable force powers that are actually very useful and fun to use. The story is great, following Episode 6 of Star Wars. There are even a couple of moral choices you get to make. Overall the base game is great, and is well worth the 10 bucks.But now for the real reason I've racked up over 100 hours. (more technically)Moviebattles 2...What is moviebattles, you may ask? Well I'll be happy to answer that question for you. Moviebattles is a mod for Jedi Academy, that completely overhault the entire multiplayer experience. It makes lightsaber combat incredibly realistic, and makes blasters an actually pheasable weapon in multiplayer. Moviebattles has a few different modes. I'll talk about 3 of them to keep this short. The first is the most popular... Open. Open is a two team class battle. There are 6 or so classes for the republic/rebellion, and for the empire/cis. Things like Jedi, Sith, Wookies, Mandalorians, Bounty Hunters, etc. The list goes on. It's an elimination/objective game mode. The two teams fight it out until one team has no players left alive, or the attacking team successfully achieves the objective/the defending team successfully defends the objective. The second game mode, is called Duel. It's by far my favorite. The teams in this don't matter. It's a free-for-all match in which Jedi and Sith alike use only their saber skills, and force powers to defeat each other. You can respawn in this gamemode. The only thing about it, is that it's a ""Duel"". Not a ""massacre"". Meaning you can't go around fighting people while they're fighting other people.Overall, this mod has completely rebuilt Jedi Academy, in a way I've really enjoyed. I have at least 300 hours in this game. (seeing as they changed to their own launcher during one update, so I stopped using steam to launch the game) Jedi Academy: 9/10Moviebattles 2: 11/10Both highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite being relatively old, it's still my favourite Star Wars game. I've played many Star Wars games and none of them felt quite as right as this one. SW KOTOR was too RPG, SW TOR is too expensive, and the rest of the SW games feel either too arcade or standart FPS, but this one is the perfect fast-paced action adventure style SW. Lightsaber duels, character/force/lightsaber customisation, tons of mods and skins, classic MP modes {yes, people still play it}, rich campaign and more. The game features both FPS and TPS perspectives, you can adapt the game to your own play style, can use several lightsabers or weapons or both if you must, and every lightsaber technique has unique moves and combos. If you're looking for some fun enjoyable action game, go for the SW Jedi Academy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's when you can grab enemies and move them through the air. It becomes a trivial matter to grab every non-boss person you meet, quickly move them over a cliffside, and drop them. There's no way for them to recover or avoid getting grabbed and cliffs are common on most levels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best Star Wars game that involves a lightsaber dueling platform in the LucasArts Industries. This mother lovin game will turn you into a man. If you like Star Wars, and you like kickin the booty with lightsabers, this is the game for you!Visuals: 7/10For a game as old as this, the visuals are decent and its incredibly easy to run on pretty much any peice of crap computer out thereGameplay: 10/10The combat is really realistic and in depth, it is insanely fun to play and duelCompatibility: 10/10Mod friendly and can run on the bottom teir of computersOverall: 9/10Its too old to be perfect, sadly			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always loved Star Wars but I never really played any games other than the LEGO ones. This is easily one of the best Star Wars games and not even Disney or EA can take away from that. My favourite part is the customisaion of the lightsabers and the diferent force powers you can have. The story while somewhat short is still ineteresting and the different endings both have a charm to it. Would play endlessly if I had the time.11/10 Don't let these games die.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 3, 2015
												There are two reasons I love this game. First I'll talk about the base game itself. The base game is very intriguing, with great saber combat, accompanied by optional,  yet good, blaster combat in either 1st or 3rd person. There are multiple upgradable force powers that are actually very useful and fun to use. The story is great, following Episode 6 of Star Wars. There are even a couple of moral choices you get to make. Overall the base game is great, and is well worth the 10 bucks.But now for the real reason I've racked up over 100 hours. (more technically)Moviebattles 2...What is moviebattles, you may ask? Well I'll be happy to answer that question for you. Moviebattles is a mod for Jedi Academy, that completely overhault the entire multiplayer experience. It makes lightsaber combat incredibly realistic, and makes blasters an actually pheasable weapon in multiplayer. Moviebattles has a few different modes. I'll talk about 3 of them to keep this short. The first is the most popular... Open. Open is a two team class battle. There are 6 or so classes for the republic/rebellion, and for the empire/cis. Things like Jedi, Sith, Wookies, Mandalorians, Bounty Hunters, etc. The list goes on. It's an elimination/objective game mode. The two teams fight it out until one team has no players left alive, or the attacking team successfully achieves the objective/the defending team successfully defends the objective. The second game mode, is called Duel. It's by far my favorite. The teams in this don't matter. It's a free-for-all match in which Jedi and Sith alike use only their saber skills, and force powers to defeat each other. You can respawn in this gamemode. The only thing about it, is that it's a ""Duel"". Not a ""massacre"". Meaning you can't go around fighting people while they're fighting other people.Overall, this mod has completely rebuilt Jedi Academy, in a way I've really enjoyed. I have at least 300 hours in this game. (seeing as they changed to their own launcher during one update, so I stopped using steam to launch the game) Jedi Academy: 9/10Moviebattles 2: 11/10Both highly recommended.			",112,17,0,24,11,0,4

												The multiplayer of this game is the most challenging and entertaining pc-game experience of my life.You have the full control over your character and the lightsaber. The System is simple, if the lightsaber touches your character model, you loose hp. Due to this fact, the skill ceiling is unbelievably high.			",59,7,1,6,2,1,7

												This game is one of the best Star Wars game out. I got this game because I wanted to play the multiplayer with my friend and after playing the game with him I instantly fell in love with it. One day i was bored and had nothing to play and decided to play the singleplayer and after the first few levels I couldnt stop playing but if you want to enjoy the singleplayer more you should create a file that enables the dismemberment in the game which is infinitely more fun to mess around with. I recomend this game to all who like great lightsaber combat. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a masterpiece. It may be a little bit old but it gives you the best experience and feeling in the game.Tho it has a problem with my screen's resolution (it doesnt go fullscreen) but its one of the best star wars game i've ever played. PROS +I haven't played a lot of the story but it seems really good. I liked the concept that you are getting trained as a jedi, cause we havent seen it anywhere else,+I liked the gameplay. You can choose your weapons like (sabers,blasters,grenades) and use a lot of abilities like (pull,push,sense,run fust, super jump etc)+Character customization. You can choose your character (no it doesnt have to be a human) dress him, choose your sabers color, and more.+Multiplayer fun! CONS -My only problem is the resolution problem. You cant enjoy 100% the game.I recommend it cause its amazing and you should all play it! 8/10  ",105,15,1,5,5,0,4

												Jedi Knight Academy is one of my favorite Star Wars games. Want to use a blaster the entire time?  Go ahead! Want to use a lightsaber the entire time? Sure thing!  You can play it pretty much how you want.  While the lightsaber combat isn't the best, you can't expect too much given this games age.  Speaking of game age, it'd be unfair for me to try and criticize this game for its graphics, combat, voice, etc.I thoroughy enjoyed playing this game, and will continue to play it.  It's just very satisfying to kill everything and anything with your lightsaber, just like it's fun to force choke or grip your enemies.  It was actually very satisfying to force choke people. (I'm a Jedi who loves force choke...sue me!)Jedi Academy is definitely one of those games you have to play if you're a Star Wars fan. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best Star Wars game I've played, other than KOTOR. (Although honestly I haven't played KOTOR II or any of the other Jedi Knight games.) •The combat system is the best I've seen in a Star Wars game. •The missions are fun and challenging, even on the regular difficulty. •The main game is long enough without being too long(unless you're as bad as I am). •There is a nice amount of character customization, but the species choices are a bit lacking. •The graphics still hold up well for a game that was made over a decade ago. •And there is still online multiplayer that is pretty fun.Now, for the bad stuff (which isn't a lot)•First off, the vehicle controls are really broken and wonky. Fortunately, you only use a vehicle twice in the game, and it's optional one of those times.•As I mentioned earlier, the character customization felt a little restricted. For some odd reason, the genders are tied onto the species, which means you can't have a male Zabrak(Darth Maul's species) or a female Keldor(Plo Koon's species).•The lip-sync is pretty bad, and so is Luke's voice actor, but these were only minor annoyances.I highly recommend this game, and I guarantee you'll love it. That is unless you hate Star Wars...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic game from my childhood. Naturally, I cannot but recommend it.If you need a lightsaber action fix, this is the place for you!Note: The game really gets too easy if you upgrade the Force Choke ability. That's when you can grab enemies and move them through the air. It becomes a trivial matter to grab every non-boss person you meet, quickly move them over a cliffside, and drop them. There's no way for them to recover or avoid getting grabbed and cliffs are common on most levels.			",368,121,4,38,24,4,56

												First off I bought Jedi Knight Jedi Academy at wal mart a looong time ago and put hours and hours into this Awesome title so dont let the steam hours fool you..Out of all the Star Wars games that had Lightsaber fighting Jedi Knight Jedi Academy Is hands down the best. Such great lightsaber mechanics set the bar for me and to this day not one game I have played has come close to this. The freedom of movement while striking is unparalleled as of  dec 2015! Wall running flipping cartwheel flips dashing super jumps all while slashing that epic (custom) lightsaber. Choose from the regular one handed Saber Dual wield or use a staff style saber. All with Custom hilts n Colors! NICE!  Sure its graphics are dated but older graphics or not this game is fun from start to finish many times over. The way the saves work you can go back to your favorite jedi/sith fight and replay them over and over with so many different outcomes. Such a blast! Two mods that are worth getting are Jedi plus and moviebattles. Even more fun! Its cheap might as well pick it up and enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite being relatively old, it's still my favourite Star Wars game. I've played many Star Wars games and none of them felt quite as right as this one. SW KOTOR was too RPG, SW TOR is too expensive, and the rest of the SW games feel either too arcade or standart FPS, but this one is the perfect fast-paced action adventure style SW. Lightsaber duels, character/force/lightsaber customisation, tons of mods and skins, classic MP modes {yes, people still play it}, rich campaign and more. The game features both FPS and TPS perspectives, you can adapt the game to your own play style, can use several lightsabers or weapons or both if you must, and every lightsaber technique has unique moves and combos. If you're looking for some fun enjoyable action game, go for the SW Jedi Academy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even when you do finsih the amazing story there are recreations of battles or arcs from the movies and the EU which is lots of fun aswell as combat upgrades more saber customization adn lets not forget well developed fun servers which can be realy cool with a group of friend. for example me and 3 friend all became sand people would wait on 1 part of the map and jump out and kill anyone walking by so much fun proably my favourite or second star wars game			",62,9,2,7,14,1,5

												Used to be my favorite in the Jedi Knight series. Had loads of fun playing multiplayer with friends in the early 00's. 13 years later the gameplay is still solid, and offers much satisfaction with all the crazy high jumps, chokes and dismemberments. You really feel powerful wielding a lightsaber (or two), I barely even touched other weapons throughout my run.Everything else has aged horribly, especially the character animations during cutscenes, voice acting and cheesy badly acted story with minimum branching. Jedis are depicted as impotent idiots, whiny broken records with their parrot preaching ""Jaden, you are straying to the dark side..."" Yeah, yeah, I get it. Shut up already, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think I got this in a Star Wars bundle for 1€, but 9,99€ they are charging for it full price is waaaaay too high.			",261,127,8,41,24,4,46

												I've wanted this game ever since I was a kid years ago.  The awesome combat system and being able to create your own Jedi was really appealing.  I've finally been able to buy it and I can say that it was everything little ol me could have hoped for. The lightsaber fights are pretty cool, they could obviously use some work but considering this is a 2003 game it's ok to let that slide. The story was fun to play through and a lot longer than I anticipated. I enjoyed using the skill tree and having the ability to use both light and dark side powers (the latter of which I used a lot >:)). Later in the story, you're given a choice to choose to either follow the light side or the dark side. I ended up choosing the light path but I plan on replaying it some day and going to the dark side.I'd definitely recommend this game, especially for any Star Wars fan.			",62,5,0,5,2,0,0

												Jedi Knight Academy is one of my favorite Star Wars games. Want to use a blaster the entire time?  Go ahead! Want to use a lightsaber the entire time? Sure thing!  You can play it pretty much how you want.  While the lightsaber combat isn't the best, you can't expect too much given this games age.  Speaking of game age, it'd be unfair for me to try and criticize this game for its graphics, combat, voice, etc.I thoroughy enjoyed playing this game, and will continue to play it.  It's just very satisfying to kill everything and anything with your lightsaber, just like it's fun to force choke or grip your enemies.  It was actually very satisfying to force choke people. (I'm a Jedi who loves force choke...sue me!)Jedi Academy is definitely one of those games you have to play if you're a Star Wars fan. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS +I haven't played a lot of the story but it seems really good. I liked the concept that you are getting trained as a jedi, cause we havent seen it anywhere else,+I liked the gameplay. You can choose your weapons like (sabers,blasters,grenades) and use a lot of abilities like (pull,push,sense,run fust, super jump etc)+Character customization. You can choose your character (no it doesnt have to be a human) dress him, choose your sabers color, and more.+Multiplayer fun! CONS -My only problem is the resolution problem. You cant enjoy 100% the game.I recommend it cause its amazing and you should all play it! 8/10  ",105,15,1,5,5,0,4

												There was a time when Star Wars games were not actually terrible. The Jedi Knight series has always been great, pushing the boundaries of large maps and open world design. This is the final entry and more or less a standalone expansion to Jedi Outcast. It is the least revolutionary of the series but easiest for beginners and also has the full set of features and an awesome community full of mods and maps to choose from. As for gameplay it has the most complete lightsaber battle experience out there and a feature packed multiplayer. Not just a good Star Wars game, but a great game in general.

												Controls are tight and deliberate and the superpowered protagonist, with customizable and ever-improving powers, must circumvent perilous platforming challenges. The level design encourages and rewards epic gymnastics that are breathtaking to watch and exciting to successfully pull off.You have a choice of fairly predictable weapons with the exception of the lightsaber. Cutting down swarms of enemies effortlessly, or methodically duelling Sith masters, is all deeply satisfying and executes like a ballet of severed limbs and cauterized wounds. This is undoubtably the best lightsaber game I've ever played.The story ain't much but it's enough. Kill the jerks with the magical jerk stick. That's all the motivation you'll need to adore this impeccably designed shooter/platformer.It's one of my favourite games, I replay it every year or two, and it warrants my very highest recommendation.

												Jedi Academy is probably one of the best, if not the best star wars game you will find on here. The single player is a tad iffy but still quite fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with the dev console and go on a cheating spree. The multiplayer is where the true fun is, what with having multiple modes to unleash your inner d'bag against either bots or other people and a massive ammount of mods to change your models to having new maps to having new hilts for your saber.also i got to kill Hitler as Dark Helmet from Spaceballs 11/10i highly recommend this to any Star Wars fan!

												Very addicting lightsaber/force combat-oriented hack-n-slash style gameplay, that's also an FPS. Pretty good story mode and very addicting gameplay. You can play against up to 16 other bots in multiplayer too and it's quite chaotic with every one of them wailing lightsabers around lol. This game will definitely tickle your Jedi/Sith fancy. 10/10.			",60,2,0,9,3,1,10

												Okay - so I have had the game for two days and have put 9 hours into it, so it's not like I have the amount of experience with the game that other reviewers do. With that being said, I have a pretty firm opinion of the game: it is amazing! Not often do I think to myself ""wow, this game is great!"" and have difficulty putting it down and doing something else. This game made my think just that, and I have barely been able to pry myself from the computer the last two days. So, long story short, I love this game. It's lightsaber combat is wonderful, containing flurishes, kicks, and other super cool moves. I really enjoy the story as well. Not to mention that the game still has a very active online multiplayer. I would give this a solid 9.5/10 (and the reason that it gets a .5 deduction from a perfect score is one annoying mission that I could not get past, ergh!).As a kid I played Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast on my gamecube and it was one of my favorite games. Jedi Academy is a wonderful game that brought me back to when I was 6 years old, having to ask my step-dad to help me beat Jedi Outcast. And for only $10, this game is most certianly worth the buy.

												Best Jedi simulator ever. You start out as a weak little padawan. You jump a little higher than normal, push one guy down, and three guys with blasters spread out across a room can stop you. By the end you are a jedi master! You can leap around building, throw whole squadrons of stormtroopers around the room, and run around without blasters being able to touch you. The progression is very noticeable is what I'm saying. Also, you basically act like a normal, non-Skywalker jedi would. You take on jobs from investigating rumors and guarding the ship to hunting down sith. Not feeling the lightsaber? (even though its the best weapon) You can use an arsenal of weapons that make all of the CoD guns feel the same. The levels do have some good variety for the time it was made. Like there is one where you get to race through a valley on a speeder bike while taking out enemies. Would love to see a modern sequel.			",12,0,0,3,5,0,12

												Jedi Academy is the last game in the dark forces series, you play as Jaden, a student training at luke's jedi academy and go on many missions from fighting stormtroopers to cultists.Pros:- Extremely believable lightsaber physics with dismemberment and sparks that fly off your victims limbs- Satisfying combat and a range of weapons, you can go with an assortment or blasters and customize your lightsaber to duel wield, double-bladed, etc.- Solid graphics for the time that still look pretty decent today- fun multiplayer, there are mods and services like gameranger where you can host or join a serverCons:-The story is weak and disjointed basically you play random missions that are loosely connected to a dark jedi cult- the voice acting is also on the weak side and comes off as extremely cheesyVerdictJedi Academy is one of the most fun and enjoyable star wars games ever. You get your ightsaber from the start and have a decent amount of customization. The story is weak and is just there so you have a reason for doing what your doing, if you want a good story play jedi outcast. This is highly recommended. ",205,20,1,11,9,0,9

												Okay obviously the game is very old however; THIS IS THE BEST STAR WARS GAME YOU WILL EVER BUY!Despite the games age which shows in the horrible voice acting, textures and character design the gameplay is fenominal. You feel like you're a Jedi. From the moment you start you have a lightsaber to wield and use. The saber fights in this game are the closest I've seen of that of the movies its awesome. Wall climbing, saber locks, wall bouncing, flips and force powers. Not only that later on in the game you can choose to have dual sabers, a staff or stick to the single saber.

												There was a time when Star Wars games were not actually terrible. The Jedi Knight series has always been great, pushing the boundaries of large maps and open world design. This is the final entry and more or less a standalone expansion to Jedi Outcast. It is the least revolutionary of the series but easiest for beginners and also has the full set of features and an awesome community full of mods and maps to choose from. As for gameplay it has the most complete lightsaber battle experience out there and a feature packed multiplayer. Not just a good Star Wars game, but a great game in general. Looks a little dated on quake3 engine but you'll forgive it based on fun factor.			",209,7,12,14,14,1,32

												Controls are tight and deliberate and the superpowered protagonist, with customizable and ever-improving powers, must circumvent perilous platforming challenges. The level design encourages and rewards epic gymnastics that are breathtaking to watch and exciting to successfully pull off.You have a choice of fairly predictable weapons with the exception of the lightsaber. Cutting down swarms of enemies effortlessly, or methodically duelling Sith masters, is all deeply satisfying and executes like a ballet of severed limbs and cauterized wounds. This is undoubtably the best lightsaber game I've ever played.The story ain't much but it's enough. Kill the jerks with the magical jerk stick. That's all the motivation you'll need to adore this impeccably designed shooter/platformer.It's one of my favourite games, I replay it every year or two, and it warrants my very highest recommendation.

I will tell you right now that this game in my opinion is better than force unleashed the combat actually has DIFFERENT MELEE ATTACKS unlike the force unleashed you can weild two sabers or a double-sided darth maul style saber The story is....regular star wars choose your path kind of story but the gameplay is AWESOME you can even use blasters! And there is an online mode that is INCREDEDBLY fun. This Star Wars game even has MODS. so to sum it all up THIS GAME IS WORTH IT!			",169,12,1,10,7,2,7

												Great game! I love it! Out of all of the Star Wars games that I've played, (e.g. Star Wars KOTOR I & II, Dark Forces, The Old Republic e.t.c) it's the ONLY one that gets the Lightsaber fighting right! It does it SO WELL! I wish this game had a remastered version!However, there are 2 things I have a problem with: -The Resolution: because it's an old game, the game sits in a small square, so there's a big slab of black on either side of the video. And when you try to raise the resolution, the game still has those slabs of black on the sides, but the game goes outside the square and makes it impossible to play.And-The Repetition: It gets so tedious to play after a while, for most of the game, (from what I've played; I haven't finished it) you're just doing boring missions, although every once in a while, there's a cool mission or a story mission, it just gets repetitive.If someone made a Remake/Remastered Version of this game, I would play it in a heartbeat (just don't change the Lightsaber fighting :D ).

												This was a game in many respects ahead of it's time.  I spent hours wishing the graphics could be updated and the content expanded, with more missions and other extras.  The mini game on the speeder fir example was a lot of fun.  Sometimes I just parked the speeder on a corner by a cliff and let the enemies zoom around the coner and fly off the cliff and explode.  Dunno it never got old.   I also enjoyed figuring out different combination attacks and ways to dash through levels & probably learned every map by heart ten times over.  A true great & I hope the developers realise they are sitting on another gem in the crown of the star wars epic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great Star Wars adventure! I originally got this game way back in 2011 but never bothered to finish it due to some silly mission I was stuck in - I'm glad that Steam saved my game files so I could finally get back around to it. And oh man, what have I been missing - this game is just amazingly fun.On your travels as jedi academy student Jaden Korr you'll be under the tutelage of Kyle Katarn (the protagonist of the Jedi Knight series) and Luke Skywalker himself facing enemies such as the Imperial Remnants and the Disciples of Ragnos (evil Jedi with force powers). The storyline is pretty simplistic, but it has its moments including fighting a top a moving tram and escaping from a mutated Rancor while it breaks the entire level apart.  The game has a system where you can play the levels in any order which really helps with the pacing - apart from the few ridiculous ""the ground is lava"" and ""defuse all the bombs hidden in the level"" missions, they're all very enjoyable and have great level design. The villain is pretty generic and dull, but since the nature of the game is varied missions directed from the Jedi Academy it doesn't really need a strong plotline with interesting characters. Only little complaint was that the later levels have a lot of annoying Force Jump puzzles (even a conveyor platforming puzzle level, come on now). The lightsaber combat makes the game - the actual first person shooter mechanics are okay at best, but the sheer fun factor of the game comes from slicing and dicing your enemies with your lightsaber, flipping around the map with awesome Force powers. You can force choke, shoot lightning out of your hands and flip across walls. You can customize your character and even change the color of your lightsabers. Around the halfway point of the game (as you ascend to the position of a Jedi Knight) you can choose a single lightsaber, dual lightsabers or a double lightsaber. I played through the game with dual lightsabers and it was really fantastic how each of the lightsaber styles have their own movesets and mechanics to use.The multiplayer of the original is long dead but the modding community still has a few servers up - I recommend the ""Movie Battles 2"" mod for a great Star Wars experience that showcases the battles of the universe, and for people that like the original trilogy, you can duel Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader in the ""Movie Duels 2"" mod.The game hasn't aged as much as I thought it had. There's a little labyrinthe level design in the missions, but otherwise it's a quality Star Wars adventure that won't leave you cold - interesting combat, timeless setting and just plain fun gameplay. Go get it!			",666,173,22,81,53,8,79

												OVERVIEW: 8/10 I will warn you, this is a fairly long review :)I originally owned this game on the first Xbox, where it was one of my most played games. While being backwards compatible with the Xbox 360 the game does not natively support a 360 controller, however, third party software such as Xpadder may be used to get around this, although there seems to be an issue with the game's use of the x-axis.The story itself takes place after the Jedi Outcast games (which unfortunately I never played) with the player taking the role of an upcoming student under the tutilage of Kyle Katarn (protagonist of previous Jedi Knight games) at Luke Skywalker's academy on Yavin 4. While the voice acting is sub-par, the game quickly gives you the ability to complete missions in the order of your chosing as well as allowing you to utilise different means to dispatch enemies. This means that despite being a Jedi padawan, the game still gives you the option of engaging with your enemies using weapons such as a blaster pistol or a bowcaster, as well as thermal detonators and trip mines. Combining these tools with force powers such as Grip, Pull and Push allow you to be 'creative' in your manner of killing.All of this 'freedom' however is within a linear sandbox. The missions themselves dont all feel sequential and thus disconnected from the others, almost as if they are merely fillers between the main story missions. You could alternatively state that this is done in order to create an 'authentic' experience; under the guise of allowing you to choose the order of the missions given to you, the missions act as a means of learning how to effectively utilise the skills you have in order to be successful in the main missions which drive forward the narrative. As the story does progress, players have to option to level up force powers from both the Light and Dark sides respectively, which depending on which abilities you mostly use in a mission, earns a comment from either Luke or Kyle about how your objective was met. What I percieved to be the pinnacle of the game was when you accquired max level in all of your neutral force powers; at this time you were given the option to use a single, dual or a double bladed lightsaber - giving you access to amazingly stylised combinations of attack.Multiplayer on this game is a confusing one for me. While it does support local bot play, there are some issues with connecting to servers. These range from not actually being able to find any, to the game freezing while you try to connect to one. Some of these issues may be due to either the server or the client your using having mods which conflict installed - this brings me to another point; mod support.An outdated game such as this may turn people off solely due to the graphics. Well, for those that find this an issue, there are retexture packs out there for you to use install which do boost up the games appearance. There are also numerous mods for the game aswell; Movie Battles II and Knights of the Force are two I highly recommend you check out, as these increase the customisation of the lightsabers as well as giving you access to both locations and characters from the films.Overall, I give this game an 8 out of 10. It's not the best Star Wars game I've played (that title belongs to KotOR) but it was the first Star Wars game I played which felt like I had a variety of ways to complete my objectives. For its time the combat was brilliant and provides an authentic Jedi experience.WARNING: Towards the later stages of the game, players are faced with a choice (don't worry I wont spoil what it is). This choice however, appeared on screen in small text and for a short period of time. This may not be the case for the PC port, but I'd thought I'd give you a heads up in advance.

												Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy is a great game. Star Wars is great on its own. But I'm here today to talk about the final game in the Jedi Knight Saga. Jedi Academy. Jedi Academy starts off with you creating your character. There are a few lightsaber colours and hilts to choose from, but nothing much. You can customise your character and change them to one of six races, three being Male and three being Female. After you have created your character, lightsaber and everything, you find yourself on a shuttle. That shuttle gets shot down and you crash. And guess what - the person you just met came out with you. Makes sense, doesn't it?So, you make your way to the Jedi Temple, and here is where the game really begins. After a training session with Kyle Katarn, your Jedi instructor and protagonist of the prequel, you are given a set of six missions. There are three sets of these missions throughout the game. The first ones are easy, the second ones are harder, and the last one is just too hard. But I don't mind, seeing as I have finished the game 11 or 12 times. ;DThe final level *SPOILER* is you venturing through the catacombs trying to find Tavion (main villain of the game). In the previous level, you can choose whether to go with the Dark Side or stay on the Good Side. If you choose Dark Side, it durastically increases the difficulty of the level. EVERYONE is against you. Not one life form on that level is with you. And then in the boss fight, you fight Tavion and kill her, and then Katarn. (Tavion is trying to revive Ractos (I think it's Ractos)) If you choose the Good Side, then the Jedi are on your side and help you fight the Sith. The final boss is Tavion then Ractos's spirit going inside her...O_O And then you defeat her(him...hehehe) and then blah blah blah you win the game thanks for playing credits. *SUMMARY*Jedi Academy in my opinion is the greatest Star Wars game. EVER. I give it a 10/10. It's a game from my childhood, what can I say? So learn the force, craft a saber, go out there and stop Tavion!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												     This game is the best RPG in the future EU of Star Wars. The Characters, Character Customization, and Story are bad. The Gameplay and Power Customization are good. The Character Customization is very small, and there is ""five"" combat styles and four powers for each side (dark and light), plus neutral powers. The gameplay is solid, and there is enough customization for each side, but the story is mediocre, and it somehow has more customization in multiplayer (which is very fun) and there is no replay value. The levels are very linear, except for keyhunts, and the enemies are squishy and easy to blow, except for force and lightsaber users.     You can get more styles, like medium, fast and strong. Later you ***** your **** with ***** and then your ***** becomes evil, you can get two lightsaber and or a double sided one, Darth Maul Style, and colors, except red. In multiplayer you can choose red lightsaber and changing characters (or use standart models) and you can choose you force powers in a way superior than the campaign. You start with a finite points, and used them in different powers.     The campaign has five side missions, you do at least four and you unlock the main mission. Each mission allows you to choose one point to the your increasily force arsenal, and choose weapons to use. The story is bland, but the gameplay is very fun, and powering up  your arsenal is fun. There is one mission that your fellow classmates attack with you, and I hoped that there were more missions like that.     I didn't play any other dark forces games, but I wished there were more downloadable missions, multiplayer maps, and customization. I liked it and recomend it and I played the campaign in 20 hours, and playing six on multiplayer. I thought it could be remade with modern technology, and more features, and maybe co-op.     Summary: Good Gameplay, Bad Story. Good Game, needs more Content, 20~hours and I like it, so you should too.			",134,3,0,7,7,0,4

												     This game is the best RPG in the future EU of Star Wars. The Characters, Character Customization, and Story are bad. The Gameplay and Power Customization are good. The Character Customization is very small, and there is ""five"" combat styles and four powers for each side (dark and light), plus neutral powers. The gameplay is solid, and there is enough customization for each side, but the story is mediocre, and it somehow has more customization in multiplayer (which is very fun) and there is no replay value. The levels are very linear, except for keyhunts, and the enemies are squishy and easy to blow, except for force and lightsaber users.     You can get more styles, like medium, fast and strong. Later you ***** your **** with ***** and then your ***** becomes evil, you can get two lightsaber and or a double sided one, Darth Maul Style, and colors, except red. In multiplayer you can choose red lightsaber and changing characters (or use standart models) and you can choose you force powers in a way superior than the campaign. You start with a finite points, and used them in different powers.     The campaign has five side missions, you do at least four and you unlock the main mission. Each mission allows you to choose one point to the your increasily force arsenal, and choose weapons to use. The story is bland, but the gameplay is very fun, and powering up  your arsenal is fun. There is one mission that your fellow classmates attack with you, and I hoped that there were more missions like that.     I didn't play any other dark forces games, but I wished there were more downloadable missions, multiplayer maps, and customization. I liked it and recomend it and I played the campaign in 20 hours, and playing six on multiplayer. I thought it could be remade with modern technology, and more features, and maybe co-op.     Summary: Good Gameplay, Bad Story. Good Game, needs more Content, 20~hours and I like it, so you should too.			",134,3,0,7,7,0,4

												Jedi Academy is, simply put, one of the best Star Wars games I've ever played. The story is ... okay, I guess? It's not bad but it's no BioWare KOTOR epic story. Whatever. It's got some interesting (no longer canon, thanks Disney) stuff about ancient Sith Lords that's cool if you're into (no-longer-canon) lore. The graphics are pretty good, especially for a 2003 game they've held up pretty well. But the game is really significant for one very important reason. No Star Wars game before or since has ever captured the feeling of wielding a lightsaber as well as this one. You know, that thing all of us who have ever seen a Star Wars movie have always dreamed of? This is the game that does it best. Other Star Wars games at best make you feel like you're wielding a regular sword that's been given a Star Wars mod. In Jedi Academy, I felt like I was truly wielding a deadly beam of light. I'm a traditional one-saber kind of gal myself, but I also love how the game put real thought into developing fighting styles for wielding 2 lightsabers or a double-bladed Darth Maul style saber as well. I also really like the ability to choose between a variety of missions instead of being forced along a totally strict linear path. It's not anywhere near total sandbox freedom, but being able to quit out of a frustrating mission and try a different one instead is nice.tl;dr: THE BEST LIGHTSABER COMBAT IN ANY STAR WARS GAME EVER			",86,29,0,8,7,0,26

												Go to Movie Battle 2 Website[community.moviebattles.org]. Download the launcher... put launcher into GameData folder... run launcher. Make sure to launch game form the launcher, not Steam. Get on the 3 to 5 active servers that always have people on them. Grab a lightsaber or blaster and blow sh*t up!! 10/10 I would pick being a droideka again.Anyways, Singleplayer is great. Enjoy an epic storyline from one end of the Star Wars universe to the other. This game combines using the Force, lightsaber, and the good old blaster to absolutley destroy everthing. Remember when games made you think about what your doing..... yah, welcome back to the good old days. 8/10 Would choose darkside again.			",48,7,0,10,16,0,46

												Star Wars Jedi Academy is an awesome game. The storyline is pretty bad, and one of the protagonists is so poorly done it kinda hurts. Luckily though, you do not play this for the storyline, you play this for the awesome gameplay. The lightsaber combat has a lot of depth and the slow-mo kills are fun to watch, this game has had the greatest success in any star wars game with using force abilities, and while the guns are fun to use, they are less useful compared to the lightsaber. So, to recap, this game is tons of fun IF you do not pay attention to the storyline.			",122,13,0,8,2,0,2

One of the best Star Wars game I ever played.Not so good graphics. Terrible voice acting. Short story (6 hours into it and you're done). But great gameplay (well not THAT great, but it has the best lightsaber combat system you'll ever seen). As I said before, one of the best Star Wars game I had the chance to play (and trust me, I played many of them).It's not that expensive, so give a try while it's on sale.12/10 would get rekt by jawas and tuskens again.

The character movment is good and the AI is well balanced and leads to some outstanding lightsaber fights.It is just a shame that disney in their usually heavy handed fashion demanded that Lucas Arts was closed, as Lucas Arts was one of the leading software distributers of quality software and Raven software house just became better with each of their releases.This was the last really good Star Wars Jedi game of real quality in my opion, since then is just been a money grab on the Star Wars Franchise and some really crap games that followed.

												Star Wars Jedi Knight Academy: Tactical Saber Action+ Extremely fun but sometimes clunky gameplay.+ Simple and linear level design, with a few levels falling short.+ Engaging and simple story.+ Good voice acting for the time.+ Good framerate, works on modern systems, seldom crashes.+ A very comfy game+ Fun multiplayer- Extremely dated cutscenes and animations, even for a 2004 game.- Some levels in particular can be a dread to play, the level design can be pretty awkward.- Stupidly sparse checkpoints, you'll want to quicksave a LOT to avoid redoing everything.- Gameplay can be so weird and clunky, the slices can be too hard to control.- No 1920x1080 support, you have to change the game's files in order to get it.- The game can feel like a pretty low budget early 2000s PC game at times.7/10. It's still a fun game, just extremely flawed. I'd recommend it just for the multiplayer alone, especially for Star Wars fans.			",149,5,0,2,5,0,1

												This game changed my life.The most realistic Jedi FPS MMORPG Card game I have ever had the pleasure of playing.Based on the events of World War III, in a post apocalyptic distant past. This game has a story so convincing and wonderful it could melt your mind. Plot twist the likes of which could never be seen, and a script clearly written by Shakespeare. The soundtrack of this game is an outrageous call from lucas arts, who'd have thought that Star Wars could have worked so well to dubstep.To have played at least an hour of this game is as to have died and gone to heaven.Not playing this game should be considered heresy.

And why? Becasue it`s STAR WARS that`s why. Because you can have... bit personalized character (dwonload mod knights of the force and you`ll have more presets! even play as anakin...

In fact, consider this a recommendation for the entire series.

												Really a must buy for any Star Wars fan. It is just a really fun game with a good Star Wars story. Combat is amazing, it just feels so good. It's fluid and stays challenging. Starting out you feel cool rolling and stabbing enemies but you really feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥when you and your opponet are jumping and flipping off of walls trying to land a good hit. Not to mention the use of force powers in combat which is also meshes really well with the combat.			",46,3,0,8,4,0,3

												Single player: horrible gameplay and not really a good storyline and its old.Miltiplayer: a little better, but mostly either bots, or people who are insanely good at the game just hanging out and not really fighting.  In fact, I'm suprised that there are still people playing this game.The reason I reccomend this game is because of the Moviebattles 2 multiplayer mod.  It is one of the best games I have played and is still amazing with an active community, and hours of fun.  It is still one of my favorite games out there.			",27,3,0,1,9,0,7

												Mostly its a fun game but then there is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in it of course♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t: Enemies have unlimited force while player has a meter that drains fast as ♥♥♥♥ with any power making fights with some of the stronger enemies just ridiculous and drawn out to incredible long timeMaster difficulty: player has half the hp, instead of making the game challenging they just add in artifical difficulty people need to not do this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, same thing with Bethesda's rpg games they do this. Hey you know whats a great idea give enemies millions of hp and the player only 1 so the player dies in 1 hit but enemies take hundreds. Yeah thats real fun when games do that Impossible to fight final boss on jedi knight or master dificulty without force heal, unless you spend a good few hours ducking behind pillars to get a few drops of hp from drain every 5 secondsAi reflects every and all projectiles or dodges them no matter whatinconsistant force abilities with the player in cut scenes as during them the player is able to do much more than in the actual gameEverything else is alright, the over all gameplay is great and fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are lazy to read the full review scroll down for short version.Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy, oh boy, where do I start? I started playing this game at such a young age, probably 4-5, but the only reason I knew this game is because I played the one that came before this, Jedi Outcast, which is actually the first video game I ever played. Anyways, enough with my backstory and nostalgia, let's get to the actual review. The game was released in 2003 and the graphics are pretty good for it's time, but if you're a modern gamer who only cares about graphics, there are tons of mods. Continueing on, the game is very fun and has an interesting story. You are a person who wants to become a Jedi so they go to the Jedi academy to learn the ways of the force. As you progress through the game your force abilites get stronger and so does your lightsaber skills. There are also certian force abilites that you can choose to unlock and upgrade yourself, theese include force abilites from the light and dark side. The multiplayer is a hell of fun, the lightsaber combat is good/okay, but maybe a few problems here and there. This game also has one of the least toxic communities ever. But if this game doesn't offer you too much, it has lots of mods, the best one being Movie Battles II. The mod revamps the whole game, even better lightsaber combat, new weapons and force abilites, tons of maps, etc, etc. It includes maps from every battle scene from all 7 episodes, where you can play as the characters from the movies, it ranges from whether you are a clonetrooper fighting on Geonosis to dueling Darth Vader as Luke Skywalker. The mod also includes so many more characters, maps and weapons from the expanded universe. The expanded universe is basically everything that isn't included in the movies, so it's basically made up from books, comics, video games, tv shows, etc. The mod also includes some secret fun maps like a map located in a kid's bedroom, where you play as lego characters, or maps from other movies, such as Aliens or 300. In the end, the game is damn worth the money, and it's very addictive, I may not have a lot of play time on this account but I have played the game far too much. Star Wars fan or not, buy this game.Short Version: The game is made in 2003 and it's pretty good for it's time. Has a good story and good engine. It has a ton  of community mods such as Movie Battles II which let's you play as charactes from the 7 Star Wars movies with new weapons, force abilites and maps. The game is worth the price, go ahead and buy it if you want something addictive to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: August 6, 2016
												Mit ""Jedi Academy"" fand die altehrwürdige Jedi-Knight Reihe (leider) einen - hoffentlich nur vorläufigen - Abschluss. Dabei ist das Spiel kein offizieller dritter Teil sondern nur ein Ableger der Reihe. Was mit Dark Forces als eine Art ""Star Wars Doom"" begann, ging mit ""Jedi Knight"" und der Erweiterung ""Mysteries of the Sith"" weiter bis hin zu dem ebenfalls grandiosen ""jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast"", welches 2002 zum Kinostart von Episode 2 erschien. Letzteres wurde von der Kritik hochgelobt, neben der tollen Grafik und Action war das Spiel auch atmosphärisch ausgezeichnet gelungen. Auch die original Synchronstimmen von Luke Skywalker und Lando Calrissian trugen das Ihre dazu bei. Ein Jahr später legten die Raven Studios dann mit Jedi Academy nach. Storytechnisch und grafisch macht das Spiel im Vergleich zum Vorgänger leider keine großen Fortschritte. Allerdings muss man bedenken, dass es nach wie vor auf der Quake III-Arena Engine von 1999 basiert. Die war eben auch 2002 schon veraltet, leiste abseits der etwas altbackenen Optik aber nach wie vor ausgezeichnete Arbeit. Die Schusswechsel und hohen Jedi-Sprünge gehen absolut intuitiv von der Hand. Da fühlt man sich tatsächlich etwas an Quake III erinnert. Was das Spiel aber von seinem großen Uhrahn abhebt, und gerade auch als Star Wars Spiel einzigartig macht, sind die grandiosen Lichschwertkämpfe. Diese laufen im Gegensatz zu den Schusswechseln standartmäßig in der Third-Person Ansicht ab und wirken - obwohl Teil des aktiven Gameplays - absolut perfekt szeneastisch Inszeniert. In modernen Actionspielen wäre das, was man hier ""live"" zu sehen bekommt, allenfalls als stupide Quick-Time-Events ins Spiel eingebunden - siehe The Force Unleashed. Lediglich in Spielen von Platinum Games wie Bayonetta oder Vanquish und mit Abstrichen vielleicht in DMC kann man heute noch derart intensive Nahkampf-Aktion aktiv erleben. Und die Lichtschwert Duelle sowie die Machtkräfte sind es, die sich im Vergleich zu ""Jedi Outcast"" wirklich verbessert haben. So wirkt der Machtblitz jetzt irgendwie wuchtiger, und ist auch grafisch weit schöner anzuschauen. Auch sind neue Kräfte hinzugekommen, wie der Machtentzug und die Rage. Mir scheinen irgendwie auch die Lichtschwertkämpfe noch intuitiver und flüssiger zu laufen - obwohl die in ""Jedi Outcast"" auch schon die absoluten Höhepunkte bildeten. Die Kämpfe enden in äußerst sehenswerten Finishing Moves, bei denen die Sith auch schon mal das ein oder andere Körperteil verlieren. Seine USK 16-Werung hat das Spiel somit verdient. Außerdem ist es jetzt möglich, sich im Laufe des Spiels ein Doppelschwert anzufertigen oder zwei Lichtschwerter auf einmal zu führen. Dies verändert die Lichtschwertkämpfe spürbar, und erhöht zusammen mit den verscheidenen Spezies, die als Hauptcharaktere zur Wahl stehen, den Wiederspielwert enorm. Außerdem kann man sich im Laufe des Spiels entscheiden, zur dunklen Seite zu wechseln, was aber nur die Story etwas abändert und wenig Auswirkungen auf das Gameplay hat. Die Story sehe ich tatsächlich als den größten Schwachpunkt des Spiels. Sie ist irgendwie sehr Standartmäßig gestrickt: Neuer Sithkult bedroht die neue Republik, neuer Jedi muss sich dem in den Weg stellen. Auch deshalb, weil die Missionen in verschiedenen Reihenfolgen gespielt werden können - was eigentlich eine super Idee ist - kommt kein richtiger Erzählfluss auf. Diese Mängel werden für mich aber durch das absolut geniale Gameplay, tolle Star-Wars Atmosphäre und das tolle Leveldesign mehr als Wettgemacht. Storymäßig macht es natürlich Sinn, mit Dark Forces anzufangen. Leider ist dies im deutschen Steam Store nicht mehr erhältlich, weil es in Deutschland lächerlicherweise auf dem Index ist, und sich keiner die Mühe macht, es von dort zu entfernen. Ein Schicksal, welches sein älterer Bruder Doom lange mit ihm teilte. Daher empfehle ich, mit dem ersten Jedi Knight einzusteigen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mostly its a fun game but then there is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in it of course♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t: Enemies have unlimited force while player has a meter that drains fast as ♥♥♥♥ with any power making fights with some of the stronger enemies just ridiculous and drawn out to incredible long timeMaster difficulty: player has half the hp, instead of making the game challenging they just add in artifical difficulty people need to not do this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, same thing with Bethesda's rpg games they do this. Hey you know whats a great idea give enemies millions of hp and the player only 1 so the player dies in 1 hit but enemies take hundreds. Yeah thats real fun when games do that Impossible to fight final boss on jedi knight or master dificulty without force heal, unless you spend a good few hours ducking behind pillars to get a few drops of hp from drain every 5 secondsAi reflects every and all projectiles or dodges them no matter whatinconsistant force abilities with the player in cut scenes as during them the player is able to do much more than in the actual gameEverything else is alright, the over all gameplay is great and fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I REALLY enjoy this game. Its a lot like halo 4 , but it is a star wars based version. If you really enjoy gory games , well here is the best choice. The reason Really enjoy this game is because it is the only game I have Found that is like halo. If you like halo or American soldier than this is the game for you. I would give it a 10/10 because it is really enjoyable and  the story line is really good. The only down side to it is if you want to play online there aren't any servers to join because not a lot of people play online. If you have a friend that plays it though, you can play online with them still.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion this is the greatest gem among the Star Wars Jedi first person games (Dark Forces, Jedi Outcast, etc.).I just discovered it in a bundle, but it is well worth the normal full price anytime. You will definitely get an awesome experience for your money.The only negative point (if any), is that widescreen resolutions aren't supported so you will either get ugly black bars or distorted images. It's not too bad on my Full HD screen though and the max resolution itself can go even higher than that.EDIT: Because it was so very helpful, I decided to paste the comment I received to this review:Marto 12 Feb @ 6:32pmYou can have widescreen if you edit jaconfig.cfg file, located usually in ...\Steam\steamapps\common\Jedi Academy\GameData\base folderadd following:seta r_customheight ""1200""seta r_customwidth ""1920""seta r_mode ""-1""or whatever resolution you want and you wil have widescreen perspective.

												If you like men dancing around in tights waving flashlights, this the best starwars title out there. STormtroopers ftw!The pros:The combat is just awesome and visually fun to watch even for these days. The story is tolerably enticing. You're able to use a wide selection of iconic starwars weapons like blaster rifles and thermal detonaters. You are also able to use a single saber, dual sabers, and a saber staff (double bladed hilt) and each has pros and cons, making you able to be just as effective with each. You are also able to customize your force powers  giving it slight RPG feel, and you can have access potentially to all the good stuff. Lighting and force grip and force push OH MY!The cons: When fighting multiple sith, you're liable to get stabbed in the back when you're in a saber lock with the other.Mass genocide of storm troopers. Truly sad to watch.9/10 Would force choke a trandoshian again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Works on windows 7 and 10, the game is awesome, I highly recomend this game to anyone who has a bad PC but wants to play a big full story game. The only thing I don't like is the mods don't work for me atleast, but thats not the developers fault so thats why I do recomend this game. But you should look into why mods don't work if you plan on using mods because for all I know the mods don't work on the steam version although everyone say it does.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I say this game is reccomened but only to a true Star Wars fan. For the most part the game is fun but there are moments where I wanted to rage quit.Firstly, the enemies. Basic gun enemies (strom troopers etc.) quickly become easy to kill and pose no challenge after a few missions. Enemies with lightsabres are another story, they can use every power you can making them pretty much your equal, what isn't equal is when you have to fight multiple at once. At several points in the game, the game expected me to take on 5 enemy jedi at once (so I ran past them), but the most frustrating thing is when you kill them. Every time you kill an enemy jedi with your lightsabre, the game decides to do a full 360 spin of your player. It looks cool at first but it wears off quickly and if you kill one enemy jedi when another one is about to attack you, you have to dodge by mmoving, but since the camera is doing a 360 spin, moving in the right direction is hard to do.Secondly, the force powers. You get given powers like force push, pull, jump etc. given to you at the start of the game and they level up those skills as you progress through the story. Then there are other force powers that you can choose to level up before each misson (cure, lightning, shield etc.). Each force power has 3 levels, some powers are very overpowered and others are totally useless (just be sure to experiment with every force power). The other problem is that your force is limited by a constantly recharging metre. But this metre charges very slowly and when using some powers, it doesn't charge at all, a lot of my time in the game was hitting an enemy with force lightning, running round until my metre recharged and repeating, I would have prefered the metre recharge quicker to make combat flow better.There's also a lot of little things like enemies insulting you because you ran away to recharge your force or to avoid combat (and it's made even worse since the enemies can shout at you from a really far distance)That said, there are still some fun and fair challenges during the middle part of the game and there are cool tricks you can do    like throwing your lightsabre and juming up walls (a lot of these special abilities take a while to master).People who love Star Wars will like this game more than other people, just be ready for rage (and don't be ashamed to use a walkthrough)Overall an good game 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Following on from Jedi Knights Outcast, comes a game I enjoyed a little more.  I played this game a long time ago, so knew what to expect, but after recently playing Outcast, I prefer this game a little more.The story follows on the story in Outcast, where someone you've fought was left alive, and now she's back.  This time however, you play as a young Jedi in training, working along side, Kyle Katarn.You can choose your species and gender before starting, and as the game progresses, can choose your lightsaber, fighting style and force powers, whereas in Outcast, you were on a set path.  The game also has light and dark endings, which gives it a little more replay value.  The missions are not linear in a sence of following a strict timeline, so you can even mix it up that way.Combat wise, its basically the same as Outcast.  Gun play is fine, although you learn why everyone is such a terrible shot.  Not as many Stormtroopers as Outcast, so see a variety of different species, which makes things different.Lightsaber duels are a little better I found than Outcast.  But that's maybe just down to a different move set you can have over the standard Katarn one; I'm not sure.  Like Outcast, and because I'm terrible, playing on Easy Mode was a mix bag for me.  100 health, and can fight for ages and never deal damage, then die with one swing from the AI.  Othertimes, one swing and a jump from me and they go down.  Not much feedback on dealing damage I found.Levels are SO much simpler to work out than Outcast.  I had a terrible time figuring out where to go, and what to do, with some backtracking required.  Academy though is a lot more condensed, and a lot more linear, which for this type of single player story, is a lot easier to work with.Overall, a good enough game.  Recommend it, and I'm sure you can pick it up with Outcast in a Star Wars bundle. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game for Star Wars based combat and has a very interesting storyline. Whether you want to kill enemies with force powers, a blaster or just a light saber it feels very fun and exciting during the heat of the moment. When the game was released the game's graphics were considered decent, but in 2015 they're simply awful. Despite the horrible graphics this game does look okay, and runs smoothly.In conclusion I think the combat and storyline is perfect, the game runs well but the graphics are out dated.I recommend this game to any Star Wars fan.

												To me this is without a doubt the best Star Wars game to date, even more so than Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast.I played this game all the time back when I was a kid, and it's as fun now as it was back then. The combat feels so great, never before have you ever had such awesome lightsaber combat.Whether Singleplayer or Multiplayer, the combat is great. Really, the only thing that might hold some people off are the out-dated graphics. But since I've grown up with games such as Doom, Star Wars: Dark Forces - the graphics do not bother me the slightest.I haven't played this a whole lot via Steam, but I'm confident that I have totalled well above 600 hours.If you do indeed get this game, I would highly recommend that you get the Knights of the Force mod, it adds so much content your very brain will explode.Have you ever wanted to roam around in multiplayer as Jabba the Hutt wielding a double-bladed lightsaber? Well, with this mod - you can. And it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Without a doubt the best mod available for SW: Jedi Academy.Pros:+ Absolutely mesmerizing lightsaber combat (Similar to Mount & Blade in some ways+ Ranged combat is pretty satisfying as well+ Lots of different moves and combos+ Plenty of Light Force and Dark Force abilities+ You can use force push to repel projectiels back enemies! Infinitely satisfying!+ You can use force pull to pull an enemy towards you and then stab them!+ Different Lightsaber stances; Fast, Medium and Strong (The latter arguably a bit overpowered in MP)+ Single Lightsaber, Dual-Wielded Lightsabers or Double-Bladed Lightsabers - the choice is yours!+ Mounted combat! Speedbike + Lightsaber = Awesome+ Hours of fun to be had using the Dev Console to spawn and freeze tons of NPCs to create huge battles!+ Pretty lightsaber trail effects and pew pew sounds+ Character customization, from race and gender to lightsaber hilt and colour. Plenty of options!+ Plenty of clever puzzles using force abilities+ Some major story decisions throughout the game+ Dozens of great mods!Cons:- Some will probably find the story to be lame. Personally, I enjoyed it.- You're a Jedi, it's not like you'll have a hard time killing enemies.- Multiplayer is probably dead, last I played, Knights of the Force mod was still alive and well.- A bit iffy to get widescreen support working- Suffers from typical issues as all older games does			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The highlight of Academy lies in its multiplayer. With more ways to interact with other players and the addition of some special moves turns the multiplayer into a unique experience from the rest of the series. While Its campaign is great and worth a playthrough, Jedi Outcast will spoil you in the singleplayer aspect.All the Jedi Knight games including this one are awesome and are fun to replay for the combat alone.The large amount of community made mods are also expand the replay value of this game.

The only thing I don't like is the mods don't work for me atleast, but thats not the developers fault so thats why I do recomend this game. But you should look into why mods don't work if you plan on using mods because for all I know the mods don't work on the steam version although everyone say it does.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Following on from Jedi Knights Outcast, comes a game I enjoyed a little more.  I played this game a long time ago, so knew what to expect, but after recently playing Outcast, I prefer this game a little more.The story follows on the story in Outcast, where someone you've fought was left alive, and now she's back.  This time however, you play as a young Jedi in training, working along side, Kyle Katarn.You can choose your species and gender before starting, and as the game progresses, can choose your lightsaber, fighting style and force powers, whereas in Outcast, you were on a set path.  The game also has light and dark endings, which gives it a little more replay value.  The missions are not linear in a sence of following a strict timeline, so you can even mix it up that way.Combat wise, its basically the same as Outcast.  Gun play is fine, although you learn why everyone is such a terrible shot.  Not as many Stormtroopers as Outcast, so see a variety of different species, which makes things different.Lightsaber duels are a little better I found than Outcast.  But that's maybe just down to a different move set you can have over the standard Katarn one; I'm not sure.  Like Outcast, and because I'm terrible, playing on Easy Mode was a mix bag for me.  100 health, and can fight for ages and never deal damage, then die with one swing from the AI.  Othertimes, one swing and a jump from me and they go down.  Not much feedback on dealing damage I found.Levels are SO much simpler to work out than Outcast.  I had a terrible time figuring out where to go, and what to do, with some backtracking required.  Academy though is a lot more condensed, and a lot more linear, which for this type of single player story, is a lot easier to work with.Overall, a good enough game.  Recommend it, and I'm sure you can pick it up with Outcast in a Star Wars bundle. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is truly amazing!Pros:1. Rich in story.2. Guns and lightsabers.3. You can still get sith moves like force choke in the game as a jedi.4. Lightsaber duels with the sith!5. Stormtroopers with big armor that stand a chance. (Finally!!)6. You can have double bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers as you progress!7. With double bladed you can make it one blade and then two darth maul style!8. Character customization where you cant pick a different name which is good cuz they call you something other than nothing...9. Hardcore parkour!10. You can get whatever skills you want so you can play the way you wanna play!Cons:1. The marks on the A.I. dont look that good...2. Could use some more save points.3. Kinda hard to see where to go...Thank you for taking the time to read this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You think of a lot of Star Wars games and you're probably thinking of Republic Commando, Battlefront, Knights of The Old Republic and so on. This is the game that I think everyone, even if you're not a fan of Star Wars, should play it. As mentioned in PCGamer, it makes the lightsabers feel like sabers rather than a neon stick with high damage. These lightsabers are rods of superheated plasma, and my god does it let you know that. Stand close enough to a wall, and where your saber would clip through the wall, it cuts it, leaving a burning trail through the wall. If it rains, the water hisses and makes steam. These babies are also one or two hit kills too - you can chop off your enemies limbs with finesse if you're fast enough. There is absolutely nothing stopping you from never using a gun (apart from one mission where you are captured), and the sabers themselves also have a vareity of unique moves depending on which saber you can choose. Yes, you can customise your saber. Colour, hilt and type. Want Darth Maul's red saber staff? You can choose red as your colour in MP (or if you want, pick an aggressive shade of orange. The purple is also known for striking fear into the hearts of your enemies). You can also customise your character. In fact, the only solid thing is your name, the helpfully ambigous Jaden Korr. Your race, gender and clothing is up to you. Also the female player is voiced buy Jennifer Hale, otherwise known as female Shepard.The multiplayer community is also somewhat active, but remember, if you're a beginner to the saber (even if you've finished the game) there is always that one guy who is just better than you. It can be aggravating, but get some friends, and it's amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm actually quite pleased with this game and am amazed that I never heard of this. (2015) I've been browsing for a while now for a new game to play, and I'm limited on options as my laptop is quite old. This game looks a lot better than some other games I play in terms of graphics, yet functions smootly, even on my crap laptop. The multiplayer gameplay, even with bots, is bloody awesome. I can play this for hours and not get bored. This game is a must for any Star Wars fan, or even just an action game junkie. 5 Stars. (And I usually don't write write reviews.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever wanted to summon a hundred sith and 20 Luke Skywalkers to see how they fare against each other? You can do it in this game! (with cheats though). Also, this game has a rather interesting single player story mode I played through multiple times and sank approximately 40 hours into. Click here for an Under 5 Min Review of this game!Pros:1. You can be a Jedi! Also, it has Kyle Katarn and Luke Skywalker in it!2. A plethora of mods!3. Although the story is linear, the levels offer a variety of experiences (crashlanding on a planet and repairing your ship, while trying to escape a sand worm; fighting Boba Fett; disarming a bomb-rigged train; speeder chase, and many other routine adventures a Jedi Padawan/Knight goes through)4. Awesome acrobatics, swordsplay and Force powers, which feel way more fluid and natural to the game than the guns.5. Great sandboxing potential of both SP and MP. You think this plain on Tatooine would make a great battlefield? Spawn in Boba Fett and 3 Kyle Katarns and see who wins, then spawn in 20 Boba Fetts and 60 Kyles. (spoiler: Boba Fett wins every time, since he's immortal). Would you make this roof to roof jump on the moving train if you had a speeder with you? Spawn in a speeder and try it out!6. There is an active multiplayer community and the sandbox is real on the servers (there are banks, quests and other different RPG-ish kinds of stuff). There are some classic FFA, TDM or CTF servers too. While the sandbox is something very interesting and unique to this game, I can't really say it was that big of a deal for me.Cons:1. Dated graphics and cinematics.2. Very predictable and linear story.3. Gunplay is pretty subpar, compared to lightsaber combat and Force powers.4. Possible compatibility problems with Windows 7/8. Also, some tinkering is required before you can set it to 16:9.This is one of the games, that aged really well, considering it's over 10 years old. If older graphics are a problem for you, there are mods partially fixing them, as well as adding a bunch of new things to the game. The most fun I've had with this game was either by spawning in enemies and allies and organising battles royale, or trying to get speeder jumps in original places (for example a roof to roof jump on the moving train level). I return to this game every now and then for the great lightsaberplay and to have some fun cheating in enemies and vehicles.You might encounter compatibility problems, so purchase at your own risk!Verdict: 9/10 - Would get choked by Kyle Katarn again (no homo).

												Not only is this one of the best multiplayers games of all time, it's so timeless that it's still active to this day. It's one of those games with combat that you'll pick up really quickly, but so layered and well made its depth will surprise you. There's something in this game for everyone, and it's highly moddable. This is a must have not only for Star Wars fans, but for anyone who appreciates skill based melee combat with Quake-like FPS drizzled on top. Now if you're a fan of escaping from how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ life is, a lot of RP servers are up. Wanna be a Jedi, Sith, Bounty Hunter or a Smuggler? Hop into a server with a dozen of your fellow virgins and create your own stories. I recommend ::JEDI:: for its remarkable lack of mary sue anime characters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is truly amazing!Pros:1. Rich in story.2. Guns and lightsabers.3. You can still get sith moves like force choke in the game as a jedi.4. Lightsaber duels with the sith!5. Stormtroopers with big armor that stand a chance. (Finally!!)6. You can have double bladed lightsaber or dual lightsabers as you progress!7. With double bladed you can make it one blade and then two darth maul style!8. Character customization where you cant pick a different name which is good cuz they call you something other than nothing...9. Hardcore parkour!10. You can get whatever skills you want so you can play the way you wanna play!Cons:1. The marks on the A.I. dont look that good...2. Could use some more save points.3. Kinda hard to see where to go...Thank you for taking the time to read this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is the best star wars game i never really liked the RTS star wars games but this is my kind of star wars games it feels like you are having a real lightsaber fight and i think its better than jedi outcast cause you get a lightsaber right away true you dont fight lightsaber enemys right away only one in the start level but its still fun to fight stormtroopers blocking blasts and batting them back and cutting down guys and the mods are easy to install and there are some great mods out there			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You think of a lot of Star Wars games and you're probably thinking of Republic Commando, Battlefront, Knights of The Old Republic and so on. This is the game that I think everyone, even if you're not a fan of Star Wars, should play it. As mentioned in PCGamer, it makes the lightsabers feel like sabers rather than a neon stick with high damage. These lightsabers are rods of superheated plasma, and my god does it let you know that. Stand close enough to a wall, and where your saber would clip through the wall, it cuts it, leaving a burning trail through the wall. If it rains, the water hisses and makes steam. These babies are also one or two hit kills too - you can chop off your enemies limbs with finesse if you're fast enough. There is absolutely nothing stopping you from never using a gun (apart from one mission where you are captured), and the sabers themselves also have a vareity of unique moves depending on which saber you can choose. Yes, you can customise your saber. Colour, hilt and type. Want Darth Maul's red saber staff? You can choose red as your colour in MP (or if you want, pick an aggressive shade of orange. The purple is also known for striking fear into the hearts of your enemies). You can also customise your character. In fact, the only solid thing is your name, the helpfully ambigous Jaden Korr. Your race, gender and clothing is up to you. Also the female player is voiced buy Jennifer Hale, otherwise known as female Shepard.The multiplayer community is also somewhat active, but remember, if you're a beginner to the saber (even if you've finished the game) there is always that one guy who is just better than you. It can be aggravating, but get some friends, and it's amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I voted this for the ""test of time"" award. Why? Because I can run this 12-13 years after its release, load it up chock full of mods and still have a blast. If more games had modding, they would age better. This is why all the new EA games will be left in the dust and people will still play games like KotOR or Jedi Academy or Pandemic's Battlefront games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely dated graphics is the biggest turnoff. The storyline is probably a 6/10. The combat is the selling point of this game. 10/10 on Star Wars combat. No other Star Wars series has ever come close to touching the Jedi Knight series combat. The game is a blast to play just because the combat is so enjoyable. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love the game. It had a good storyline and it was nice to see Star Wars in the future. We have seen so much rom the past and it's so cool to see Star Wars take place in the future.  On the other hand some things i didnt like is that you can't really choose to follow the light or dark side as much as i'd like. You can only choose to go light or dark at the end. Another thing is the controlls. The controlls can be quiet annoying and sometimes agrovating. 7/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I easily see why so many people like this game, including myself. The saber combat is much more engaging than something like the force unleashed. However, you kill sooooo many people in this game, I feel more like a sith lord than a Jedi.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HumbleBundle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!10 hours to finish the game and then you get to do it all again, well picking different saber styles and force moves. Not that much to customize about each character look wise. You can easily get lost, because there is no map. The game is just a bunch of levels, so you cant go back or really do much other then what they give you.  Found out that if you pick a boy or a girl, your still jaden korr. If you really wanted to you could run past almost every single fight in the game. The amount of force you get is so small and I ran out well jumping all the time. You get one big jump vs a double jump, so you will fall of the edge at least once. Checkpoints are not set up right, so save all the time.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a technical mess, a narrative disaster, that also still manages to be kinda fun. Weird, right?The game barely works. It's as if every mechanic in the game was loosely coded and then given 0 polish. You character moves with little precision, and the lightsaber is almost complete blind hack n' slash. The gunplay is... ok I guess. The blasters all feel like blasters and have neat dual firing modes. The enemies are consistently inconsistent, often times being completely ineffective, glitchy, and then switching on the fly to Dead-eye♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and killing you very quickly. I was fortunate to not have any hardware issues, and had a good FPS.The story is pretty terrible. What's there is mostly just mountains of OT references, and what isn't is usually painfully awkward dialogue, or just dumb writing. Is this what people think Star Wars is?That said, it's hard to find another game that lets you bounce around, zippin' and slashin' like a Jedi and sh*t. If that's all you wanted, I recommend this game. If you were looking for some depth or something.... more? Then I do no recommend this game. I'm still gonna play it once and a while whenever the ol' internet's down... so there's that I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a huge fan of the Star Wars Universe I could say ;Scenario is not passing in the usual Star Wars movies.Do not expect Darth Vader, there is even no Darth Sidious  exist.Time is 2000 year earlier than him.Although we are seeing Luke Skywalker that I didnt explain how.But again I am not saying the scenario is bad.Think about the Marvel movies they are just a little part of their universe, most of their part are in the comic-books, you just can watch the main characters,situations in the movies.Jedi Academy's scenario is just like that If you want to be a Jedi in this game you can perfectly be unless you dont care about the name of the Jedi			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is simply one of those classic Star Wars games that defines a generation... I can personally say that this game features one of the most diverse and enjoyable leveling experience that I have ever had the privilege to enjoy. Not only does it feature complex puzzle and mechanics, but it has incredible combat as it is powered by the Quake 3 engine. Not only does this make for a boredom-free leveling experience, but it is also allows for some of the most challenging and entertaining PvP. While the combat is superior to it's predecessor due to brand new combos, force abilities, and the addition of Jar'Kai duel wielding and double-bladed saber staffs, the story is very much lacking as it is cluttered with plot holes and meaningless absurd plot devices. Fortunately, the positives of this game easily out-weigh the awful story. As a whole this game is an incredible feat, let alone for something made over a decade ago and is certainly worth the minimal fee of $10. In addition to this game I'd like to recommend a few other classic Star Wars titles including: Knights of the Old Republic, KotOR: the Sith Lords, Battlefront 2, and the rest of the Dark Forces series if you are into older games. I also recommend a mod called ""Jedi Outcast - Academy mod"" Which can be found on moddb.com and allows you to play the full Jedi Outcast campaign on the updated Jedi Academy engine. With that I leave you, and remember the Dark Side has cookies and force lightning is over-powered. >:D ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I feel conflicted about this game.Pros--Character custamization. (Oh, its really cool, from your face to your clothes to your lightsaber! Might not be as indepth as our modern standerd but still cool.)-First person shooter and Hack'n'slash. (Neat combo.)-Quite a few missions.-Star Wars!!!And oddly enough thats where it ends. Cons--The lightsaber duels feel like they're *click click* and hope you hit your target. (edit) to me, combat feels rather simplistic, but, they do have some skill involved according to review comments.-The difficulty get artifically inflated as you play, with more enemies carrying sabers and using force powers, so you eventually have to save after each fight just so you don't get stuck playing the samething over and over again. -Saber duels are more based on luck rather then any skill, maybe you hit them, maybe you don't, maybe thay hit you and kill you. -Force powers are a drag, offensive ones don't work most of the time, but you can't defend yourself from them like your enemy can. You have to spend a force power upgrade point every mission, so once you get the once you want and need, you don't want the others and they just get in the way when selecting powers. Force powers are seperated into light and dark side powers and by your choices you can warrent at most comment on your choice. I hate this because it's said early in the game that ""Force powers themselves aren't good or evil, but it's the user."" So why the #*%4 can't I use force lightning without being judged.-Blasters become useless in the later game as force users and Boba Fett(why?) just side step your shots, litteraly.-Missions don't really flow with the story, which isn't one of the better ones at that.Personal thoughs-This game feels more like a ""what could have been"" tittle. It makes you want a good Star Wars RPG like Knights of the Old Republic mixed with some of the combat stylings of this game. It's a game that starts out good, then it leaves an after taste, and finally you just end up feeling bad. Sort of like cheap booze.Do I regret buying the game, no, but it is a game that could be done better. the worst part about it is that you end up wanting something better, and you look at the game wanting to improve it.Side note-""only siths deal in absolutes."" Steams rating system is ""yes"" or ""no"". Think about that for a second.My review is based on personal feelings and experiance. I would rate this game 7/10, though to me this game doesn't feel as good as others make it out to be. Again, thats my oppinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not regret playing this game, I simply believe there are other games that may be more worthy of paying 10+ hours of your life to experience.Depth: 5/10Story: 7/10Replayability: 6/10Controls: 4/10Value: 9/10 (Paid $2.50 for it, got over 10 hours out of it)Momentum: 5/10Memorability: 3/10 Time Debt: 3.5/10Overall: 5/10*By ""Momentum"" I mean, the extent to which I wanted to keep playing the game at any instance during gameplay. For example: ""Quake"" for the xbox 360 was one of the most painful games I've ever played, and I only continued the game because I was an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥.  It would get a 1/10.*By ""Memorability"" I mean the extent to which my life was made richer by experiencing this game, i.e., was this a game that I'll be thinking about and talking about with friends years down the road?*By ""Time Debt"" I mean the extent to which I believe this game was worth the time it took to beat the game, i.e., in hindsight would I agree that there were no other things I would've rather spent my 10+ hours on? Notable Mentions:-Occasionally there are areas/levels which have repetative audio segments, which can get really annoying. (Looking at you Blenjeel merchant rescue!!!)-There seems to be an instant jump in difficulty midway through the game.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just different from the usual.-Force Lightning.  Always a good decision, regardless of star wars game. Hah-I went through the game using mostly a lightsaber.  On normal difficulty, lightsaber combat was really just kind of hack & slash with little thought needed.  On normal, it's very much so a scratch-ur-balls-while-playing kind of game.All these ratings are based on 2016 expectations.  For its time I believe this game could've easily been an 8/10 or higher.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The fighting mechanics were very unpolished and dueling with the AI became a chore. I'm sure the multiplayer mods are fun, but for the single player the gameplay is a far cry from where the series came from. I'd reccommend Dark Forces I or II if you're looking for a good PC Star Wars action title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What I expected alot of nostalgia and good memories from this Star Wars I used to play back then turned to be a big disapponitment. Reason for that is that this game just suffers from a bland enviorment that's just dull to explore around. Another is just dull missions that consist of nothing but a fetch and go mission that doesn't have any impact on me or the game. Lastly, is the stiff characters that just sound like robots which is painful to hear them speak. So it's best recommended to get a different Star Wars game than this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a classic, one of the best Star Wars games ever made.You play as Jaden Korr starting off as a Jedi Padawan and as you play through the game you become a Jedi Knight or Master, the game is based along the same storyline as the Dark Forces games and like the Dark Forces games it's based after the Galactic Civil War between the Rebelion and the Galactic (Sith) Empire of course if you've seen the movies you'll know the Rebels win and they form The New Republic, because of how few Jedi are left and there are even less Jedi Masters some students were asigned more than one master, Jaden and another Jedi Padawan Rosh Penin under the jedi master Kyle Katarn.The story says you are a Human Male but you can chose to be a Kel Dor male, a Rodian Male, a Female Human, Twi'lek and Zabrak changing your race doesn't change how you sound, you will always have one of two voices, aswell as that you can customize your lightsaber, this game has the second best or the best lightsaber customization to Star Wars Galaxies, again the story says Jaden has a purple lightsaber but you can change the colour if you want, but in singleplayer he can't have a red lightsaber, you can also choose from a few handles for each saber, one is the saber Anikan uses and another is the one Obi Wan uses, aswell as a single saber you can use duel sabers and a saber stalf saber stalfs have their own unique handles too, chosing duel sabers or a saber stalf over a single saber does seem cool but the single sabers are more flexible with three attack modes, light medium and heavy each with their strengths and weaknesses.The story of the Dark Forces games is probably one giant ""What If"" scenario, what if Anakin didn't wipe out all the Jedi in the temple what if he missed a few and they escaped? even though irionically his son Luke, (with the help of his badass buddy Kyle Katarn) trains these people to (most likely) become amazing jedi. Like most to all jedi-themed classic Star Wars games you can chose to be good or bad, i will not explain in this review for spoiler reasons how to chose your side and how it will end.Multiplayer is very much like Quake 3 only with three types of grenades, the ability to use the force and customize your lightsaber and of course you can chose a red blade.Like Quake 3 you can chose from a large nomber of characters from the Dark Forces games even people you don't see in Jedi Academy aswell as your own characters, the character creation is exactly the same as in singleplayer.You can chose to be focused arround dark side powers or light side powers not both, each side has their own unique team power in the team-based games, some powers act differently to how they do in singleplayer and you can have power ""loadouts"" making it easier to change power builds.There are six game modes, Deathmatch, TDM, Duel, Power Duel, Capture the Flag and a class based Siege gamemode.Deathmatch and TDM are basically the same as always, your cloths and saber is coloured based on what team you are on and in TDM you can chose to have it light powers vs dark powers, the first team to hit the score limit or the team with the most score when the time runs out wins.Duel is also very self explanatory, a good old 1-on-1 battle Power Duel is 2-on-1 but the person by himself gets a few advantiges to even things out, you can chose to have weapons or go lightsaber only, lightsaber only is probably the best choice for duels since there aren't any weapons or powerups inside the arena, the person who hits the win limit or has the most wins... well wins.Capture the flag is what it always has been, if you've played Quake 2, 3, any Untral Torunament or Metal Techs 4 through to 7 (the Tribes games) you'll know what it is, like all team gmaes in Jedi Academy and most team-based games/gamemodes there are two teams.In Siege there is an attacking team and a defending team. The attackers have to make their way through the base and the defenders have to stop this, i havn't played much of siege persenally but i know that it has vehicles and it's class based with no AI, vehicles and mounted guns.Also you don't have to have a lightsaber in Multiplayer for those who want a little bit of an extra chalange, and play agenst players since the AI aren't that smart even on the Jedi Master difficulty.If your Star Wars dream was to become a Jedi i hightly reccomend this game aswell as that it's an awesome game in general, there aren't many Star Wars gems like this anymore since EA owns the rights to the Star Wars games so we must enjoy the few we have left.

												Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy Jedi Academy as much as I did. Like with Jedi Outcast, I simply don't think it lives up to the quality of Dark Forces 1 or 2.This is not to say the game is bad. Jedi Academy is definitely an improvement compared to (Dark Forces 3) Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast for Raven Software, but I can't help but wonder if the game is simply too shallow for me to enjoy.The multiplayer, however, I can see as being enjoyable if I had friends to enjoy that content, so if you want the best Jedi Knight multiplayer community and mod-support, then this is definitely your game.The Star Wars Fan-Fiction SimulatorI say this with all good intentions. Ironically, as I found Outcast's reliance on the lore my main gripe, the reliance on the lore is what makes Jedi Academy entertaining.You choose a template of characters, outfits and lightsabers--for some reason each alien species is set for one gender--and revist locations of the movies. You'll fight alongside heroes like Chewbacca, Kyle Katarn, Luke Skywalker. You'll fight against the snow Yeti's from Hoth, Boba Fett and the Sith Apprentice from Outcast. While I hate how the series has become more fan-service than creating original characters and stories, I can't deny there is something to enjoy in buddying up with your favorite hero. To make up for the lack in creativity, the level design (and variety) are what makes this change bearable.Not only will you have a more colorful variety of locals, but the mission-structures have changed, some for the better and some for the worse. Missions that have you exploring for a secret base while lost in the tundra winds of Hoth or scavenging for pieces of tech while avoding the sands of a worm-infested desert are a nice change of pace.What doesn't work are the racerbike mission, the Rancor ""Stealth"" mission, and the other side-operations where the gameplay doesn't feel like it was polished enough to be fun. Relying on the allies' AI to act properly is a terrible idea because there's no command system to tell them what to do (like running away while I distract a Rancor), and I think some gameplay changes (the rancerbike jousting mission) have broken controls. Thankfully, the game doesn't require you to play every single level, and you can always back out to choose something else. So instead of a completely polished, excellent campaign we get probably 3/4ths of good ideas, and the rest that are meh at best, which helps to mitigate the tediousness of the lightsaber combat.Supposedly the Best Lightsaber Combat Ever?Maybe I don't understand the lightsaber mechanics, but I fail to see what makes JA's mechanics the best. It's exactly the same basic mechanics from Jedi Knight 1 & 2: Hold LMB to attack, RMB to do a special/light-saber throw. However, they added in combo-based moves to the fighting system that feel as demanding as a fighting game. The best I can say about this new system is that there is a great sense of fluidity in the animations. Jumping off of walls, doing cartwheel attacks, power-strikes or crouch attacks, and evading a down-ward stab by rolling away go to make the combat feel the most lively. Weapon styles and attack strategies are also added to give you more options in combat.All of this, I agree, makes the combat feel so great.The drawback to this combo system is that you have to rely memorizing the moves, and when you are trying to use them it can feel too rigid to get down properly. But maybe that's just a skill-barrier I haven't mastered yet; it's not the reason why I find this combat system shallow.The reason why I'm not engaged in Jedi battles is that I cannot read my enemies' moves or know, for certain, whether I'll land a blow or not. I've had better luck winning battles if I flail around and hold the attack button then try to land precise strikes, either with one-handed light-sabers or with two of them.Maybe the combat is balanced for multiplayer only. Towards the end of the campaign where the game litters you with Dark Jedi, I never felt the combat system was refined enough to make me feel like I earned each victory. I preferred cleaving through the hordes of Stormtroppers, Droids or Smugglers because my Force abilities and my arsenal would be more useful. (Seriously, Jedi can reflect rockets?)Why Is Jedi Academy OK but Not Great, and Why Is Jedi Knight 2: Outcast Bad?For one, the level design and the lightsaber mechanics are much more refined than Outcast ever hoped to be. Another reason, as mentioned before, the game will vary up your playstyle either by fighting new enemies or making new mission  types that change up your arsenal to not make you grow bored of the lightsaber combat.That last part is what Outcast failed to remember when it made lightsabers the most efficent weapon to use to protect yourself and to mow down your enemies. When fighting the giant Dark Stromtroppers with rockets/concusion rifles, it's best to attack them with heavy weaponry from afar than charge in with Protect enabled.Also, by giving you the lightsaber from the get-go, you now have the Force abilities from the start to make up for relying on the light-saber so much in Outcast. The only thing I don't think Raven Software got right is making a better story. It's so obvious what happens from the first few cutscenes that the ""suspsense"" is laughable. The canon characters were the only bits that felt as interesting as Outcast.Unfortunately, the story is not the only disappointing feature of Jedi Academy. For whatever reason, you won't unlock a second saber style until the first round of missions are done, and then you won't unlock a new lightsaber type until you get to the final 4/5 missions. There is no New Game Plus mode to make replaying the game entertaining, not unless you enable cheats which can break the game if Force points aren't allocated properly.This is such a majorly missed opportunity where the game could've focused more on how the three combat styles (one-handed, two one-handed, two-sided) relied on different tactics when fighting enemies throughout the campaign. (I've heard some argue it was for balance reasons but I don't see why that couldn't be an option.)Even then, I still don't think the quality of Jedi Academy, even at its greatest and ignoring its worse aspects, ever reaches the peak of Dark Forces 1/2. (Something I've gone into great detail in my Jedi Knight 2 Steam review.)The only reason I'm complaining about the assocation of the games is because I have expectations from the previous games that haven't been reached.A Bitter End for a Promising New BeginningDespite everything I've gone through with Outcast and the worst parts of Jedi Academy, I would still like this series to be given another chance.I'd love for Raven Software, or another company, to try the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight format (or even make a Jedi Academy sequel forgoing everything) one more time because I think what they achieved here is a step in the right direction. Something along the lines of Witcher 1's weapon styles, added into Dark Souls/Risen 1/Spectacle-Fighter gameplay, and given the Star Wars treatment would be a beautiful game to play. And because of the longevity of this title by its fans is still strong I think there is more than enough of an audience who would be willing for another game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Short Review: Pros:- Not too bad Graphics- Amazing Storyline- Force Combat!- Backflips- Awesome community- No DLCS!Cons:- Poor Hit Detection- You need to install a multiplayer mod- Jedi Academy Multiplayer is dead- Lightsaber combat can be found difficult- Lack of Servers- Poor Map Design- Some Unbalanced LightSabers (Dual, Double-Sided,Standard)Full Review:STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy™ . Take on the role of a new student eager to learn the ways of the Force from Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Interact with famous Star Wars characters in many classic Star Wars locations as you face the ultimate choice: fight for good and freedom on the light side or follow the path of power and evil to the dark side. This is a singleplayer or multiplayer based game. The multiplayer is most popular due to the lack of people bothering with the story line. I mostly use Multiplayer so my review will take place in the Multiplayer.  Combat against other players and AI. The Combat system on the most popular mod, MBII ( Movie Battles 2) is amazing. It has everything to offer as well as playing with a real person instead of a coded character. If you are a Padawan and not ready to be a jedi nor a jedi master, I suggest you play on Multiplayer and make a private match, NOT USING MBII but instead Evolution of Combat 3. All the download links to the mod will be at the end of the review. In EOC3, You can launch a .bat file from the downloaded folder in your Steamapps (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Jedi Academy\GameData\GameData\Evolution_of_Combat_III>)and you can choose which one.  Evolution of Combat III:  In this mod, You can spawn any NPC, change maps, change saber and change your class to jedi master as well as playing god. You can spawn in Chewbacca and make him fight Darth Vader. Or you could spawn in Luke Skywalker and make him fight against a sith lord. It's all up to you how you play god. MovieBattles 2 FACT: Did you know that on the majority on servers, they have Fin and Kylo Ren? Including Kylo Ren's Lightsaber! About The Review: I will mark this review as positive and will return in the near future to the mod page to see what other mods they have made. Last time i heard, there will be a Rogue One Mod with EVERYTHING in it at the end of the year. Maybe i might add more to this review. Thank You:

												I like this game. I really do. Jedi Knight's problem is the confusing as ♥♥♥♥ maps. I have NO idea where to go at ANY given time.The mission where beams are holding our ships in place? It told me I needed to disable the box, so I spent 30 minutes wandering (trying to get into the box tower), then I noticed crates laid out to let me jump up there. I get up, and the door leading to the box room is...decorative.No, see, what they expected me to do was walk near a random door far away from the tower to trigger the space pirates to come out and attack me, then I had to go through THAT building to get to the tower (the LONG way around which wasn't even available to me at the time)The prison escape? I was looking for something to do since I'd been everywhere and pressed every button and killed every baddie. I had no idea what it expected me to do, especially since my only objective was ""escape"". What I WAS APPARENTLY SUPPOSED TO DO WAS go to the shooting range and blast a hole in the wall with the floor-mounted heavy turret.THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE WALL WAS EVEN FRAGILE! I HAD *NO* REASON TO GIVE THAT ROOM A SECOND THOUGHT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game just went a little bit too silly. The voice acting is atrocious, and the story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.But more importantly, the introduction of staff and duel saber styles kind of threw tradional saber combat out the window. Playing through the game, I really could see no upside to just sticking with a single saber.The mission structure also made me feel pretty disconnected compared to Jedi Knight 2, which felt like a more cogent and well-designed game overall.

However Jedi Academy by Aspyr...Not in a billion years, I can firmly say I wasted money on this company. With the online well and truely out on the Mac version, half the game is missing and Aspyr have so far given out duff advice for solving any issue regarding online play, it your looking for great online play play this only on Windows or you are wasting your money on half a game from the early 2000's.

												(English/Русский ниже)One of my favorite games. However...Don't buy it. Why, you ask?Well, it looks like latest patches completely broke several scripts (trust me on that, I know each corner of this game), which made singleplayer completely unplayable.Just some examples:-on vjun2 you got unskippable glitched scinematics with Kyle (after cable and pumping the water). This bug was brought from XBox, by the way-on rift, vjun3 and several other maps some level parts are destroyed from the begining of the level instead of being at one piece until corresponding script taking action. Giant Rancor level is absolutely flat, with no objects.Well, you may want to buy it for multiplayer, but that's it.P.S. ""Thank you"", Disney.Скажу сразу - сама игра великолепна и до сих пор остается одной из самых любимых и интересных.Почему отрицательный отзыв ? Почему не покупать?Что ж, ответ один - кривой патч.Если Вы уже играли в эту игру ранее и проходили ее, то увидите, что многие скрипты сломаны (поверьте, сам я знаю эту игру пости наизусть)Например:-Миссия Vjun 2б обязательная сюжетная - после включения насосов в комнате с кабелем  включается ролик:Кайл пытается запрыгнуть в дыру в потолке и... ничего. Ролик повисает, пропустить нельзя, перезагрузкой не лечится. Пришлось шаманить с читами. Кстати, баг этот в ПК-версии изначально отсутствовал и был принесен из XBox-версии.-на миссиях rift,vjun3 и некоторых других объекты, которые должны ломаться только по скрипту, сломаны изначально. Например, на rift - это длиннейший мост, дыру в котором невозможно перепрыгнуть - уровень непроходим без noclip. Уровеньс Гигантским Ранкором так вообще плоский, без единого ящика (кто играл, поймет).Тот случай, когда посоветую все-таки спиратить хорошую игру. Тем более, что Lucas Arts канули в лету.Можно купить разве что для мультиплеераP.S. ""Спасибо"" Диснею.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent. For a Star Wars game, this was probably the best at the time. Fun to whip a lightsaber around but it's lackluster in terms of plot, graphics, and even gameplay. Level design is mosly uninspired.Completing all the missions and the primary campaign will take about 10 hours. That's probably all the time you'll want to play this game. Worth picking up if only to see how the lightsaber combat works.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:+ For using a very dated engine, it looks pretty good+ Interesting Story+ Uses the original movie soundtrack+ Decent amount of character customization+ Missions vary in length, so they don't feel like you're doing the same mission again and againCons:- Being able to choose your missions is great on paper, but because only one of the 5 missions you get every section actually affects the story, they feel like a massive waste of time- Ridiculously dumb enemy AI- Force powers seem disappointingly weak- Usage of original movie soundtrack is iffy at best, some times it fits perfectly, other times, not so much- Shooter gameplay is rather bland- While the lightsaber customization is good, most of the bosses can be beaten by either swinging your saber around like a mad man or simply shooting them with the concussion rifle, which can render many of the special moves pointless- Being forced to upgrade powers in order to enter a mission is annoyingTL;DR: Despite getting some things right, it's decent at best. If you've got money to burn, then buy it. Otherwise, your not missing out on much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS:- Great Saber Combat.-Makes you look and feel like a badass. -Great saber creation.CONS:-No resolution for my monitor (widescreen).-Few options for character creation.-More options for saber creation than character creation.-Cringey cutscenes and characters.-Checkpoints are broken. -Multiplayer is DEAD.-Gun play is bad.-Animations are badly done.-Repetitive missions.PREFERENCE:-You can draw with the lightsaber.-Graphics are EXTREMELY outdated (I know it's a 2003 title but still ""outdated"".)FINAL VERDICT:3/10This game is great, if you're looking for nostalgia. Saber combat is great, I LOVED it - IF you were against another Jedi or Sith. Otherwise it's almost all the time 1 hit kill. Graphics gave me nightmares but I was able to get over that. The real nail in the coffin was how repetitive the missions were. Don't buy this game if you're not a HUGE HUGE Star Wars fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is alright. Not bad, but still not good. For starters, the lightsaber is, for all intents and purposes, the only viable weapon. The guns have a hard time hitting anything, and do very little damage when they do. The lighsaber, on the other hand, will kill most humanoid enemies in a single, well-executed swing and can even be thrown to instakill from a distance. It also does a good job of deflecting bullets, which guns leave you completely vulnerable to. While this may not seem so bad, it gets worse. The lightsaber, while still much better than any of the gun, has its own issues. Instead of simply swinging, your Jedi will try to do all sorts of visually impressive lightsaber maneuvers. This equates to flailing around awkwardly and sometimes even completely missing enemies that are right in front of you.Now, for the icing on the cake. The vehicles. Vehicles are terrible in most games. Raven Software apparently took this as a personal challenge. While on a vehicle, you can move forward and backward and turn with the mouse. The problem is that moving your mouse left or right will only move the camera a little bit. In other words, you'll have to drag the mouse several times in the same direction to turn. And of course, like any game with bad vehicles, Jedi Academy has levels where operating them is required. Overall, this game is, like I said, really not THAT bad. Using the lightsaber does provide a decent amount of enjoyment, and it's pretty satisfying to kill people. But I wouldn't pay full price for it, and I'm happy I didn't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At the moment this game is about as fun as throwing rocks at my bosses home window.

												I was raised on Dark Forces, Dark Forces II (Jedi Knight) and Jedi Outcast. This switch to third person view and the more generic ""I am a nameless random Jedi"" character you play instead of Kyle Katarn makes the game not very compelling to me. I played about 4-5 hours of it (pre-Steam) back in the old days, got bored with it, and forgot about it.The upside is that it is, of course, much prettier than the older games. 3rd person view means lightsaber dancing looks cooler.But overall, for me it was the most forgetable of all Star Wars games, namely due to my lack of interest in who I was playing (who can be customized up the wazoo, at least for a 90's era game). But Asypr/Lucasart's wish to make the game like an RPG, without the RPG elements, were its downfall. You play and watch Star Wars for the story and for the characters, not (just) the gameplay and the graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The driving question of all Steam reviews is quite simple, honestly: Do you recommend this game? My answer isn't as simple.The combat is, more often than not, very responsive and fun. It gets very muddled once Force powers are added, to the point that I lost interest in it.Level design is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ with terrible checkpoints. It also has a vechicle level, with little to no explination as to why it was needed. along with some terrible platforming.Graphics are okay for their time, but haven't aged very well.The multiplayer is the high point of the game, if you can find matches. Very fast paced, with plenty of skins and variety in weapons.Now that I've said something about most of the interesting bits, I'll return to the question at hand. Would I recommend it?No.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game but unless your a really big star wars fan (like me) you probably won't like this game much.The graphics are 'ok' but more character customisation options would be recommended by me.Also the multiplayer mode was so fiddily and confusing and... well, BAD!I was kind of dissapointed by the multiplayer and graphics, oh I almost forgot!The single player story is Awsome!But apart from the story and combat abilitys this game felt a bit like a swing and a giant 'rancor' sized miss!

												I didn't get the hang of the lightsaber fighting mechanics outside of aim at the opponent and hit the attack button, and instead found it more fun to use jedi spells and conventional weapons instead. However, the game punishes you pretty hard for this toward the end of the game when you have to fight through several Jedi. And if you’re like me and skipped out on your ""how to fight with lightsaber class"", the lightsaber fights seem to randomly decide whether or not you win or die. It got so bad that I didn't even finish the game because the fights stopped being fun to me.The levels are also not that well made. While the game does try to vary it's gameplay by having a different type of objective on each map. The maps themselves are not that memorable had have pretty poor sense of conveyance about them despite, that most of the levels are linearly designed and have one way to reach the goal. Multiple times I got lost because every section looked to similar to each other. Additionally the invisible walls of this game tends to take out some of the platforming fun that could be had as a Jedi.At the end of the day I don't think I will be returning to this game. The fun and memorable experiences I had with it, do not outweigh the frustration I've had with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, this review isn't of the full game.now i found the gameplay good, the graphics alright, and the lightsaber weilding awesome, unfortunately, I have to say no on this game cause well.ENDING SPOILERSSo here he have another gamre of ""choices"" of good and evil right? WRONG.you get one fight where you choose to kill or spare your so called ""Friend"" who is a backstabbing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who you can rightfully kill, or spare his life cause you're better then him.i believe this fight determines being good or evil.being good makes the game easier, and determines the second final boss of the two.being evil just means not only do you fight the dark jedi, but you fight the light jedi as well.and this time after you make the choice of good or evil? two whole whopping levels. the same levels, with the same enemies.only difference is wether you fight with or against the jedi as well.It claimed to be another game of choices but was less so then fable.oh and maybe im asking too much but there was a very very very small selection of races.

												Good storyline, but halfway through the game you're just fighting one jedi after the next.  It's tedious, and you use the same techniques on all of them.  I had this feeling of always being a second rate jedi the entire time.  You learn cool force powers, like force choke, but you can't use them on any enemy who matters.  I'd love this game if the player could control their defence, differenct techniques worked better on different enemies, and force powers could actually be used on bosses.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this. The graphics may seem old enough to work on any computer but when I played this the graphics were glitchy, they were jumpy and it made any movement a challenge to do. Objective wise you're told nothing of what to do and expected to do everything. You can get killed from the most everything easily, which is an annoyance in itself. Basically, this game is a piece of c**p that is only matched by The Force Unleashed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like the pimple on the face of Star Wars games. I enjoyed it at first but, then this quickly dissolved into a smouldering pool of hatred and frustration. The story is okay, but in terms of Star Wars it's nothing to write home about.  They set it up in the beginning to have some kind of potential but they don't really deliver on it. I know there's a few potential ways for the story to go but after one playthrough I don't really care to explore them. I wouldn't buy this for ten bucks, not even six. This is a purchase I most definitely regret. The gameplay at times is fun and smooth but then it can be clunky, awkward and blood-boiling-break-your-keyboard-in-half annoying.  The variety of force powers is cool and it is the only aspect of the combat that I found enjoyable. However, everything else was just painfully awkward and I tried to avoid the guns and other weapons like the plague during comabt. Overall, I would say you could skip this one. There are plenty of other Star Wars games out there that are much more enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game as part of the Star Wars bundle and I have to admit I never even heard of it before. The entire bundle is great I got more than I even thought I did after trying all of the games. This one is a real treasure! A must have for any star wars fan. If you love the Knights of the old Republic (KOTOR1) following the stories of Revan and the exile Meetra Surik in (KOTOR2) series this will be one of your new favorites. You will meet Jedi Master Luke Skywalker as you embark on a journey to become a Jedi knight. Luke will assign Kyle Katarn (a huge character in the expanded universe) to be your Jedi teacher. This is the last in a series starting with Star Wars Dark Forces where you play as Kyle Katarn before he became a Jedi. Continue through Star Wars Jedi knight Dark Forces 2, Star Wars Jedi knight Mysteries of the Sith, Star Wars Jedi knight 2 Jedi outcast and finally ending with Star wars Jedi knight Jedi academy or play in any order you want. You will not regret buying Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. I will gladly admit that the Whole Star was bundle is awesome but if you want one of the best star wars games available this one is in my top 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6/10Pros-Fluid fighting system-John williams soundtrack-Good Ai that increases in fighting skill as the game goes on-Awesome Nerdy duels in multiplayer-Lolsy cluster♥♥♥♥s in multiplayerCons-Graphics are somewhat dated-Models are low poly and badly animated-Cutscenes are a cringey pile of skip fodder-Story is dull and uninspiring-Voice acting is cringey-Dialogue is cheesy-Everyone including the enemies lack personality apart from Kyle Katarn who is meagre-The force powers have no imagination behind them to conjure, all you do is push a button, it would have been nice if there was a game aspect where you have to channel your energies and emotions that are subject to the story in order to wield a power more strongly-Linear storyline ,in my opinion this game doesnt qualify as anything but linear, just cos it has a few split hairs right at the very end, doesnt make it non linear, The game just doesnt plant the seeds of evil or good deeply enough in the story to make you believe in your actions, i chose the evil path literally just to see what happens, not because everything that happened previously turned me more hateful. The turns to evil are far too quick and sharp, and so lack any momentum-The jedi training lacks nerdy lore and deep philosophical♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why cant i have a one on one sesh with one of the masters where my mind and body are pushed beyond thier limits and my real ego is laid bare you know ? The one on one training should have been 3/4 of this game, instead of the 0/4 that it was. Get pitched with difficult scenarios, spiritual teachings, field trips to places of magic power, where luke gives us a mystical lecture of how in the end nothing matters and all will perish but our actions live on or some bullcrap like that, Kotor had mountains of that♥♥♥♥♥♥ actually even kotor could have done with more, I literally just want to be turned into a jedi through a video game, thatd be ♥♥♥♥ing epic and its what i expected from a game called ""The Jedi academy"".Alas it seems i must continue waiting for a deep and dark philosophical journey into the history of the jedi and their spiritual purpose ,at the end of the day it seems this game was made for younger audiences. Nevertheless the fighting is enjoyable and adds much replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+Non linear campaign+Has Kyle Katarn in it+Still has all the great parts of Jedi Knight 2, and takes out all the negatives.+Improves even more on things that weren't problems in Jedi Knight 2.If you haven't played Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast, then either go watch someone play it or go buy it before playing Jedi Academy. They're similar, but to fully appreciate the story and gameplay of this game you should play Jedi Knight 2 first (If you don't want to buy it, both Jedi Knight 2 and Jedi Academy have been open sourced, and you can go find public copies of them now!)If you have played Jedi Knight 2, then basically, this game is very similar to Jedi Knight 2. The general system is the same - you slowly improve your force powers by doing missions and advancing the game. However, you don't have to do the missions in a specific order - you have tiers of missions, and completing a mission allows you to spend one point on a new force power. If you want to be a Dark-side only user, then go ahead! You can do that. There are some ""core"" force powers (jump, push, pull, etc.) that you cannot spend points on, as these progress with the story.Also, the mods for this game are amazing, and they will only get better since the games have been open sourced.

												I would recommend this game on the basis of the fun lightsaber battles, and the good story in the single player.I almost wish there was a more modern version of this game made, perhaps even better graphics (Not needed of course). With advanced fighting styles perhaps, better hit boxes and such. I think a game like this re-made in these times would work well IF done right.But for this game, I'd recommend it solely on the basis of the lightsaber fights you can have with friends on multiplayer, and the not-so-bad story.

												A must have for any Star Wars fan. Great storyline with the light/dark side split of any good SW game. Story mode is excellent with high replayability and the multiplayer is definitely worth clocking in a few hours on. With plenty of both light and dark side powers, a good diversity of levels from saving prisoners to defeated giant mutated rancor, lightsaber colors and hilts and player customization, although minor, adds that little extra that makes Jedi Academy such a great game.

The story is interesting and the gameplay is incredibly easy to pick up quickly. The game fails a little on the voice acting and certain levels are very short, but certainly not to an annoying extent.Definitely worth the purchase, despite its age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an all time favorite game of mine. Even though it is old, the community is still strong and there are plenty of mods out there. The combat is extremely fun, but can take some time to learn and even further to master. I don't see this game going anywhere in the future. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a Star Wars fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely fun game for the PC and another title I grew up playing. The story is okay, the fights are buggy, and the game in general is mediocre. However, it has lightsabers in it.... which is reason for anyone to buy a game. Honestly the best thing to do is to sit in a wide open space and hit shift + ~ and spawn NPC's to fight. Nothing like spawning 10-20 Reborns and seeing how many you can kill without dying. :D 8 out of 10 for a classic Star Wars game with relatively decent playability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is everything for a star wars fan that loves playing as a jedi. The best thing about it is that you can play this game as a fisrt person shooting game or thrid person with a lightsaber. The amount of force powers is amazing and you can choose which powers to upgrade. The story is very inertesting and could have been to sequel to episode six if it wanted to and you get attached to the characters. Do yourself a favor and play this game now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The controls for this game are extremely akward and frustrating at times, but that being said, if you like star wars, being a jedi/sith and fps, then this is your game! Graphics are I suppose outdated, but but not without its charm - immerserive enough to not be put off by them. Good level design, relatively big, though you can't revisit levels so limiting to a degree. Very Formulaeic game style in which you start in a window with missions to select (select a mission), then you go on the mission and fight enemies - including very fun lightsaber battles - and then you get a well done and repeat with a concluding mission at the end of each chapter. The game has an RPG element to it where you can increase an ability by 1 per mission. It doesn't really add anything to the game, but it does stop you from completing it in a day! (kind of). The best things about this game compared to Outcast is that you can adapt you lightsaber which effects your battle style - you can also have a dual lightsabre - The other thing is the lightsaber fighting mechanics, which if you like realism, and control, mixes the 2 concepts very well. The fighting is fluid and fun. You can jump off walls (in more than one way) kick your enemy Qui-gon style, and also back stab like Obi-wan. You also get into locked lightsabres where you can push you're enemy, and many things it's just all good fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most mature Jedi Knight series with successful game play and action system design.You can actually feel the control of your saber does affect the result of Jedi fight.The saber moves fluently and sequentially according to your current pose which make the battle smooth and full of tactics.This is the best epic game of LucasArt that is FAR BETTER than any modern boring stupid MUSOU-like button-punching games.The only drawback is the character and story developing is not interesting enough. Please turn your attention to previous Jedi Knight game if you want a better cinematic story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To this day Jedi Academy is the Jedi-knight-simulator to me alongside Jedi Outcast. It's not like the power-fantasy that the Force Unleashed provides, because it comes from a time when Jedi were more like those in the old trilogy than the prequels. The Force is a powerful... force in this game however, giving you a vast arsenal of both light and dark side powers. You won't be punting ewoks for a thousand yards; the most powerful thing you can do is force-push a missile back at the firer (which is as badass as it sounds). Complementing the Force is an arsenal of guns and your personal lightsaber (single-blade only at the start, with staff and dual being unlocked later). The combat is very fun and often light-saber fights are ended in one or two swings for either side, making them rather intense on higher difficulties. Story-wise you aren't Kyle Katarn, which is a damn shame. You're Jaden, either a man with a feminine name or a woman with a somewhat manly name. Your character is a bit of a blank slate and a dolt, not really a personality to speak of. It's disappointing considering Jedi Outcast has a fairly fun story with a good protagonist. However, the story knows to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and let the gameplay take over, and besides Rosh being as a git, it's not offensively dull or annoying. It's a classic Star Wars story that shoves Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca in while not really finding its own identity. However, the missions are varied and the general gameplay is such a blast that I find the meh story to be nothing but a nickpick. The mods are godly here, and should be definitely investigated. There's a simple ini mod that allows your lightsaber to cut anyone apart. I'm talking cut them in half, decapitate them, delimb them, force post their lower half into a rancor's mouth kind of cutting. It makes the game probably the best Star Wars game for lightsabers and the death animations actually work well with the mod. Force-throwing your lightsaber and having it decapitate a stormtrooper on it's way back coupled with him falling limply to the ground like that dude in 300 is ♥♥♥♥ing euphoric to me. I still haven't found a better lightsaber simulator.It should be noted that the game has an active vanilla and modded multiplayer community. This mode is horrifically unbalanced in vanilla though. If there's a server with maximum force-powers enable and pits, don't play it. I'll be the unarmed guy force-choking you into pits like a deranged garbageman- abusing the game's targetting to prevent you from doing anything to stop me. Lightsaber free-for-all servers are usually just a gathering of people using power-stance with the force-jump attack or other attacks with wide, extremely damaging hit boxes. There are dual servers that exist alongside free-for-alls, and those are legit fun. Guns are obviously usually useless. The particle-disruptor though is every jedi-killers wet-dream, allowing you to instant kill anyone whose back is turned to you. I'm banned from a few servers because of it.For $10.00 ($20.00 total for Outcast and Academy) I say the Jedi series is a must-have for Star-Wars fans. For anyone else, it's a extremely fun game with varied combat, and is a few hours of fun with a somewhat nonlinear campaign and an active multiplayer community.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the PC game that I used to play while in High School...I couldn't wait until Friday night to just go to town with this classic game.  You see I played the orignal Dark Forces 2 and Jedi Outcast to death  and what I found with Jedi Academy is that they fixed all of the games mechanics from previous games and tweaked the graphics, movement, sound etc..  It still however retained the same classic feel as the other games by utilizing the unreal engine.  Now lets be honest...the single player is crap!  And it will always be crap ever since Dark Forces 2 but where this game really shines is the mutliplayer.  Yes it is very dated compared to some really revolutionary games this year but what makes this game is the breathing community.  It has gone through many transformations ever since its release in 2003 with a sudden over-take of German servers a couple years ago but there are still dedicated clans and players!!  From time to time you may come across some admin abuse but usually they are nice to you if you are nice to them if you respect their rules/regulations. The only real mp modes that are alive now are Free For All and Siege Mode.  Power Duel, Capture the Flag etc.. are pretty much dead town!!  But man this game's multiplayer is what made me a PC gamer in the first place...if you are a Star Wars fan you owe it to yourself to buy this amazing classic game!!  It's so cheap!!  So many memories...gosh I'm even crying a little bit...sniff sniff.  By the way some of community created levels such as Sith Council are some of the reasons this game will continue to be played by countless star wars fans!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A must play for Star Wars fans. Picture Force Unleashed but with a less powerful main character (who you can customize), more realistic lightsaber duels, FPS elements, and amazing multiplayer. This game has a good story, good gameplay, and really makes you feel like you are a Force-sensitive learning the ways of the Force and becoming a Jedi (or Sith if you dare). If you love amazing action and a good story then this will probably feel like a slightly dumbed down version of Force Unleased. But while the story and action isn't as big as TFU the gameplay and RPG elements make up for it. 9/10 any day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Star Wars game ever- 10/10. Excellent Gameplay, Fast and nice graphics, ~15 different Force powers, Dark Side and Light Side, differrent endings, Humor, Character AND lightsaber creation, 15 different weapons. Great story. Fun mutiplayer (especially with bots), and, most importantly, dying is fun. Game is challenging, but I never was angry after dying. P.S. Replaying game with cheat codes is really fun. Just type in helpusobi1 and then a cheat code.My fauvorite is iknowkungfu.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is dead set one of my favourite star wars game of all time.The story sets you down initially as a jedi apprentice who is (unsurprisingly) ""gifted with the force"". You get given a set of missions you can complete in any order until you move on to the next set, where each time, you become more and more in tune with your powers. SWJK:JA has some of the best action lightsabre mechanics known to date as everytime you and your opponent attack, your lightsabres will clash until either one of you presents an opening (so expect to do a lot of fun jedi flippy♥♥♥♥♥♥!).Your character customisation is limited although your lightsabre customisation is satisfying as you are allowed to choose your casing, crystal and later on whether you want to weild dual, double or master the single blade. You'll probably find yourself playing through this game more than once for each ending as well (Light side, dark side and ""♥♥♥♥ BOTH SIDES I AM THE GREATEST!! SO FEAR ME!!!"").Multiplayer is fun if not dead and empty. That said, jedi duals with friends is totally a thing as well as dropping a bunch of bots to indulge the the addictive gameplay.So if the jedi duals in Battlefront II just don't do it for you, and you want something faster paced and a significantly larger amount of backflips than avaliable in KOTOR then this is the game for you!11/$10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pure classis! one of the better Star Wars games ever made. The lightsaber combat is a ton of fun, especially when you're dueling another lightsaber wielder. The graphics are of course very dated as the game is over ten years old, but the gameplay still feels as solid as ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just a little help to my fellow gamers, there are several programs that allow you to play a game like this with a controller even though it is not implemented into the game. I use joystick mapper for my mac and it is in the appstore. It allows me to configure a controller to the mouse movements, key strokes and mouse clicks that the game has as its functions and substitutes the controller for it instead. so if anyone wants to accomplish this understand it does work and it has played well for me.

The game lets you create your own character, and chose you own lightsaber and color. It has a great story, and I have played it 10 times already. Its great fun and I highly recomend this game to all you sword and star wars fans out there!.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best Star Wars game I've ever played. In fact, this game has the best combat out of any game I've ever played. Despite this game's age, if you enable it with the mods called OpenJK (Maintenance of the base game by the community) and JA++ (Enables advanced server controls, some fixes, new animations and moves), the game plays amazingly well and even looks decent. Add in some new maps and you'll have some eyecandy and have a ball.A huge plus is right now, due to the steam sale that just passed, there's been a huge injection of new players who are enjoying the game. This effect along with OpenJK may actually keep multiplayer populated for a long time to come.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With a still-active community, including an entire website consistantly updated with mods, add-ons, Reboots, maps and more (jediknight3.filefront.com, OR  jk3files.com), this game will continue to be a great go-to when I just want a childhood classic. now if only we could get steam workshop tied into this....

There is a big mod community, with tons of maps, skins and other addons which make this game even more awesome. After all those years, multiplayer is still active. Heck, you can even find yourself a nice clan! It's truly amazing experience and this game is worth every price.[/i]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sequel to Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast, this game still has the fantastic combat system with three 'saber styles' and force-augmented acrobatics. Singleplayer is a 'meh', because you basically complete three filler missions before going on with the main storyline, taking a step back on the story aspect. Multiplayer is fun with friends, but don't you dare to join a multiplayer server because all the elite players will kill you before you can say 'Midi-chlorians'. Still fun to play multiplayer with friends/people on the same skill level though.7/10 I miss being Kyle and I'm still too afraid to play multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6/10Pros-Fluid fighting system-John williams soundtrack-Good Ai that increases in fighting skill as the game goes on-Awesome Nerdy duels in multiplayer-Lolsy cluster♥♥♥♥s in multiplayerCons-Graphics are somewhat dated-Models are low poly and badly animated-Cutscenes are a cringey pile of skip fodder-Story is dull and uninspiring-Voice acting is cringey-Dialogue is cheesy-Everyone including the enemies lack personality apart from Kyle Katarn who is meagre-The force powers have no imagination behind them to conjure, all you do is push a button, it would have been nice if there was a game aspect where you have to channel your energies and emotions that are subject to the story in order to wield a power more strongly-Linear storyline ,in my opinion this game doesnt qualify as anything but linear, just cos it has a few split hairs right at the very end, doesnt make it non linear, The game just doesnt plant the seeds of evil or good deeply enough in the story to make you believe in your actions, i chose the evil path literally just to see what happens, not because everything that happened previously turned me more hateful. The turns to evil are far too quick and sharp, and so lack any momentum-The jedi training lacks nerdy lore and deep philosophical♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why cant i have a one on one sesh with one of the masters where my mind and body are pushed beyond thier limits and my real ego is laid bare you know ? The one on one training should have been 3/4 of this game, instead of the 0/4 that it was. Get pitched with difficult scenarios, spiritual teachings, field trips to places of magic power, where luke gives us a mystical lecture of how in the end nothing matters and all will perish but our actions live on or some bullcrap like that, Kotor had mountains of that♥♥♥♥♥♥ actually even kotor could have done with more, I literally just want to be turned into a jedi through a video game, thatd be ♥♥♥♥ing epic and its what i expected from a game called ""The Jedi academy"".Alas it seems i must continue waiting for a deep and dark philosophical journey into the history of the jedi and their spiritual purpose ,at the end of the day it seems this game was made for younger audiences. Nevertheless the fighting is enjoyable and adds much replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game as part of the Star Wars bundle and I have to admit I never even heard of it before. The entire bundle is great I got more than I even thought I did after trying all of the games. This one is a real treasure! A must have for any star wars fan. If you love the Knights of the old Republic (KOTOR1) following the stories of Revan and the exile Meetra Surik in (KOTOR2) series this will be one of your new favorites. You will meet Jedi Master Luke Skywalker as you embark on a journey to become a Jedi knight. Luke will assign Kyle Katarn (a huge character in the expanded universe) to be your Jedi teacher. This is the last in a series starting with Star Wars Dark Forces where you play as Kyle Katarn before he became a Jedi. Continue through Star Wars Jedi knight Dark Forces 2, Star Wars Jedi knight Mysteries of the Sith, Star Wars Jedi knight 2 Jedi outcast and finally ending with Star wars Jedi knight Jedi academy or play in any order you want. You will not regret buying Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. I will gladly admit that the Whole Star was bundle is awesome but if you want one of the best star wars games available this one is in my top 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a true sequel, you don't play as Kyle Katarn, but rather as some gender-neutral named character. It is fun, but the game's story is very disjointed. Overall, it feels more like an expansion pack (DLC for anyone after 2005) than a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well Well.. Jedi Academy.. First at all, I would say that this is very old game, released in 2003. If any of you asking yourself whether you should buy it or not, know this: 1.) competitive community in this game is very small, check http://www.esl.eu/eu/jkja/ in 1o1 BO3 saber ladder are  only 30 people, it doesn't give any sense to even mention 2o2 ladder. People in ""base""  community, which is the basic game without any mods (ja+, lugormod, makermod, Roleplay mod - created by one clan with 1-3 servers), they all know each others because of many years they played together, that's why this game is kinda hard and pretty uncomfortable for potentional novice. 2.) it is a melee game of course, it has strict third person view if u play with lightsaber and changeable view with weapons (on most of the servers you won't meet the guns, forces, only lightsabers - dual akimbo - basically two sabers, staff - darth maul, single saber). 3.) It's hard to say wthether the game is balanced or not, during the years many people argued on this topic, most of them had opinion that staff is too overpowered, very fast with high damage, staffers complained about single blocks etc.. truth is this game had poor development, big potencial, but devs didn't care about this game after release. It is masterpiece and one of the best melee games and most people don't even know about this game, but like any melee game it has its own ""bugs"", for example: ground butterfly(if u jump back and do a butterfly its grounded with highest dmg), wiggle/poke/spin (if you have some experience with chivalry: medieval warfare, this could be considered as ""dragging"" but in JK3 it is not deccelerating or accelerating, with poke you are trying to hold your saber in opponent's body with mouse movements as long as you can for highest dmg possible, with wiggle you constantly shake your mouse from left to right also making highest dmg, with spin you just turn your mouse like maniac doing 360's. All this ""bugs"" were considered noobish or lame in extreme cases even cheating haha, people made their opinion pretty similar to chivalry dragging/delaying, it was in golden era. After many years those ""bugs"" were transformed in people minds into ""techniques"", again like in chivalry .. ""advanced techniques"". 4.) Shame about this game is how people played it during years, how the way of playing this game constantly changed into something disgusting in my opinion. People in years like 2003-2006 or even 2007 relied more on timing and footwork and proper clean killing, nowadays its block festival, those few people who still playing this artifact are just crouching and blockwiggling everything, it looks noobish and disgusting because of thousands ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sparks everywhere, and mainly because block system in this game is highly random. I mean, it is possible to learn how to block, I will explain, opponent is attacking you, you have to aim the way of his saber with your saber and in milisecond when his and your saber make a contact you have to attack. It is very hard to perform and in most cases it is very random, sometimes you do it properly and it won't block.Well to cut a long story short, it might look like this game has more negatives but I would still recommend it, personally I played it since end of 2004  til end of 2013 and ocassionaly play it once for a while because this game is part of my childhood. Yes I would totally recommend this game BUT only for people who seeks for hardcore melee game not looking about graphics, age, activity but strictly only to game mechanics. Be careful, it could be very addictive  ;)P.S.: here are some fragmovies for you, so you can have a better picture how this game was or is played in base community and competitive way and how many possibilities in timing and footwork and way of killing your opponent you can learn

												When I was 6 years old, my sister's boyfriend (now brother-in-law) would bring his xbox over to our house and play games on my sister's TV. I watched him and occasionally played with him. Knowing now how difficult it is to play games with a 6-year-old (I play with his son occasionally), I am surprised he even let me. But I am thankful he did, because playing with him was how I first gained exposure to some of my favorite games of all time. Halo, Elder Scrolls, Fable, and Jedi Academy. I had a lot of fun playing Academy with my brother-in-law, even despite the fact that I was just getting my♥♥♥♥♥beat over and over again. So when I saw it on sale on steam, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to experience it again.This game is everything I remember and more. As a 6-year-old, and again as an 8-year-old when I rented it from the video store, I couldn't really grasp the more complicated aspects of the game, and the story and was confusing. This made it all the more mysterious and intriguing for me. That subtle curiosity that left me both amazed and intimidated by the game has not been lost on me, 10 years later. The aesthetic and atmosphere of this game alone are enough to leave me in awe, but it's the gameplay that really hits home. The lightsaber combat is tight and intuitive. and surprisingly intricate once you delve into its more advanced aspects. The gunplay is similar to that of Quake II, which is understandable, seeing as it's built on the same engine. In today's world of COD and Battlefield and Titanfall and Halo and all that, it's quite refreshing to play a game with straight up skill based arena combat. The mobility is fantastic, with elements of ""free-running"" that blend flawlessly with the combat. Wallrun, force jump, backflip, and cartwheel your way to victory. Force powers can be taken advantage of as well, with abilities like force heal and force speed coming in handy quite often. All in all, the perfectly balanced amalgamation of melee and ranged combat, fast paced mobility, and usful force abilities makes for a great experience on keyboard and mouse.The multiplayer in Jedi Academy is incredibly addicting. This late in its lifespan, you'd expect a games playerbase to have decayed into a small group of bored kids with cracked clients and a few veteran players on a nostalgia trip. But surprisingly enough, Academy has withstood the test of time, with a solid playerbase of loyal players. The first public server I joined was called the TNA server, which I soon discovered acted as a ""home base"" of sorts for the long-running TNA Clan. It's a sabers-only server, and players seeking heated battle with competitive yet friendly players, or even just conversation are sure to find a great time on the TNA server. I certainly have. But with capabilities for custom maps, custom gametypes, and even more, the fun doesn't stop at vanilla lightsaber combat. I've come across some fairly interesting things when browsing the server list. A few interesting roleplay servers. a game full of bots that insult eachother with slurs and expletives, even parkour maps. You won't be without something to do when playing Academy multiplayer.I haven't played much of the single-player campaign yet, but what I have played is enjoyable. The story seems enagaging, the voice acting is great (JENNIFER HALE!), and the missions provide a decent challenge, at least on the higher difficulty levels. I would absolutely recommend checking out the singleplayer, but for me, the multiplayer is really where I have the most fun.The visuals of the game are great for their time, and they still hold up well enough as not to distract the player or break immersion. Texture quality is decent, lighting effects are good looking, and even the character models are pretty great for a game from 2003. The game really shines when you incorporate a widescreen fix that allows you to play in full 1080p.So, that's about it for my review of Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. I loved this game when I was 6, and I love it even more now. I'm sure you will too.10/10, would stumble upon 10 years later and play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really good game. If you love sword fighting games then this is for you, and if you like star wars then that is a bouns. The game lets you create your own character, and chose you own lightsaber and color. It has a great story, and I have played it 10 times already. Its great fun and I highly recomend this game to all you sword and star wars fans out there!.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best Star Wars game I've ever played. In fact, this game has the best combat out of any game I've ever played. Despite this game's age, if you enable it with the mods called OpenJK (Maintenance of the base game by the community) and JA++ (Enables advanced server controls, some fixes, new animations and moves), the game plays amazingly well and even looks decent. Add in some new maps and you'll have some eyecandy and have a ball.A huge plus is right now, due to the steam sale that just passed, there's been a huge injection of new players who are enjoying the game. This effect along with OpenJK may actually keep multiplayer populated for a long time to come.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This series (Dark Forces/Jedi Knight) is FULL of great games from my childhood; this one is by far my fovorite. With a still-active community, including an entire website consistantly updated with mods, add-ons, Reboots, maps and more (jediknight3.filefront.com, OR  jk3files.com), this game will continue to be a great go-to when I just want a childhood classic. now if only we could get steam workshop tied into this....

												The best Star Wars game with greatest fights ever. I did played it much longer than it's recorded on steam and I had really fun fighting in FFA, Duels and Siege mode. There is a big mod community, with tons of maps, skins and other addons which make this game even more awesome. After all those years, multiplayer is still active. Heck, you can even find yourself a nice clan! It's truly amazing experience and this game is worth every price.[/i]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the very first PC games I've ever played, and it still has the same excitement as when I first started playing it 4 years ago. The game has a choose-your-own-adventure esque storyline with smooth combat. The mods are fantastic and very easy to install. I highly reccomend installing Moviebattles 2 after beating the storyline. Whatss better then have a nostalgic breakdown while chopping up mindless stormtroopers? Nothing. That's what. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
