												If judged solely on the product this is an OK shooter, but judged against what the series once was it is a miserable abomination. The enemy AI is a complete joke, often times shouting at you to get your attention (and not actually firing at you). Your friendly AI teammates are dumb as dirt and will walk right in front of you while you are firing, get stuck on objects in various maps and otherwise prove useless in resolving a particular situation. There is also a game killing bug in mission eight “Distillery” where the screen goes black after a ladder is climbed early in the mission, preventing any further progress.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although my hours here on steam are short, I've owned this game years ago and played a whole lot of it growing up. Of course all of us Rainbow Six fans prefer the original titles with the planning phase and all, but despite the bad reviews I still believe Lockdown is a good game in itself. A decent shooter with an OK storyline, chasing down a terrorist cell with a bio agent threatening the world. (the usual Tom Clancy storyline, y'know.) The guns have a good amount of recoil and actually feel like they have a punch, unlike a lot of other shooters. The AI are a bit bad though. Especially your teamates. You're better off playing alone or cooperatively over LAN. The map designs are pretty clever and challenging for a first timer as well. And the graphics aren't that bad for a 2006 made game. All in all I'd give it a 7/10WARNING- MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK ANY LONGER. ONLY LAN.SummaryPROS:GraphicsGood mapsSoundsGunplayDecently long missionsCONS:Bad AIMeh storyLittle re-playability after finishingMy rate: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Generally bland and linear, with hilariously bad AI. The worst ""Rainbow Six game"" I've ever played.But seriously, if you want a good laugh, get this on sale and play through the entire thing. You will not be dissapoint.One time, my allies randomly went in front of me for no reason while I was throwing a grenade, so it bounced off one of them and killed us all. Another time, everyone but me blindly walked into the same tiny room and died by the same adrenaline filled shotgun wielding thug.Many laughs and ragequits were had.Also the game has quick-saves, so if your team does something ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or a stray bullet hits your pinky toe and kills you, you can always quick-load and wipe those mistakes away.

												There's no middle-facing thumb, so I'll just say this.Remember around the original Xbox's last years when there was generic fps after generic fps being released, and they all had generic enemies and generic gameplay that could be set to generic nu metal?Rainbow Six Lockdown is that personified.  It's also annoying to play because you can't control your teammates, and it's linear with no way to recover health--true, you couldn't recover health in Rainbow Six 3 either, but the point with that was that you didn't have to openly walk into enemy territory with very little cover.5.5/10 would heavily reconsider getting shot by a guy in jeans again.

												Rainbow Six Lockdown is the 4th entry in Rainbow Six franchise. It actually was made for consoles first, in 2005 by Red Storm. It would then be ported to PC in 2006, apparently reworked somewhat. But not enough, thus you still control only one squad and there is no planning stage. But hey, look at those helmets on rainbow six characters! Apparently, that was number one complaint from fans about console version. Quite a priority.It also was released on Xbox, Gamecube and PS2. Yea, they are different enough from PC, at least levels aren't all that same.Also, I think that this is v1.0 version, while there exist a v1.1 patch. But it only seems to fix multiplayer things.Multiplayer community here is quite dead. Actually, online multiplayer servers are dead. Ubisoft shut them down. Some say that they could login with UPlay account, didn't work for me last time I tried. But oh well, still can use some programs, you know them.And well, what can I say. The game got literally ""consolized"", as much as I hate this term. No planning. Only one squad. You can play only as main hero. Everybody has huge health now, unless headshot. Infinite pistol ammo, even though it makes sense gameplay-wise. Game became nothing more but a generic lame action realistical shooter that we had more than enough in 2000s. To be honest, Rainbow Six ports on consoles already had similar thing going for them, but it's the first time developers decided to bring this to PC where it's not really needed.Which wouldn't be so bad had AI had not been so terrible. I am mostly talking about teammates AI. If you take a look at their AI separate from gameplay, then it's quite an improvement, as they learned to take cover and peek around corners, instead of just following you in straight line. But once you actually play it, then oh boy. They have messed up priority, ignoring terrorist with shotgun, they are often incompetent with their shooting and they can be way too happy to rush forward, often getting headshotted by you.Hostages also are quite horrific to deal with. They seem to have same AI as teammates, happy to rush into next room and take cover. Heck, they are annoying like no other tactical game ever had, as policeman hostages would whine ""police, here!"" and ""somebody help me!"" while following you.And you don't have as much tactics anymore. After all, you control only one squad, not even individual members. And with their horrible AI, you are pretty much a lone wolf with few lives walking behind you. The only times that they matter is that they can take orders on how to enter through the door. Shotgun, hammer, breach, grenades. They still screw up grenades, which also aren't as good as used to be either, as flashbang works like grenade that stuns, with small radius. And even then, teammates may die embarresingly during cleaning of room, easily.Since there is little left of tactical part, they could at least make action really good. But nope. Developers decided that PC audience are some crazy hardcore people who hate any story or cutscenes fluff with all their heart and removed it pretty much in this version of a game. We don't even get intel to pick up anymore in these linear levels, so exploration feels empty, as tehre are no pickups at all. Which harms level design that is linear with some pathways.Not to mention that you will easily blast through the game as it now allows quickscamming of save and loading. And motion detecter with regenerative battery, which I abused heavily.Also, yea, it also includes modes like Terrorist Hunt, Terrorist Hunt in reverse map, Lone Wolf. Barely noticed difference. And multiplayer, which is dead, so no commers.Overall, a game on PC that lacks on both tactical and action fun. Just a generic realisticalish lame shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok I'm a HUGE Tom Clancy fan and playing this game is like getting stabbed in the heart because there was a time when Rainbow Six games were the epitome of realistic military tactical shooters. The developers strayed away from an already working formula and experimented a little and ended up with this monstrosity. Kudos for trying to do something new but they done ♥♥♥♥ed up.  Cons:•	Lousy graphics•	Useless AI (both team and enemy)•	Lots of bugs•	Very limited character customization (you can choose between 4 different uniform colors)•	Multiplayer doesn’t workPros:•	Good selection of weapons and attachments (including a grenade launcher which is a first in the R6 series)•	Okay story•	Game isn't that short•	Stays faithful to some of the original characters from the R6 universe•	Gameplay is fun and challenging and it doesn’t get too repetitiveAll in all it’s a below average FPS and if you're not an avid Rainbow Six fan boy then it’s not really worth buying. If you're willing to try something new I say pick it up on a sale if it’s under 5 or 7 bucks. Such a shame to see a franchise sink so low to this. At least they made it up with Vegas and Vegas 2 and those games are great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved Raven Shield and Rainbow six earlier games, so it saddens me to say how much of a let down this game is. The best to explain how this game relates to its predecessors is by calling it a dollar store version, its as if they sucked the budget out of the game. Do not purchase this game and support shoddy game development. This game has some elements earlier games which I like, such as the realism/fragility of life, tactics etc., but spend a dollar to make a decent game, a disgrace to Mr. Clancy. There are a number of reasons to give a game a bad review, but perhaps the worst is to call it unfinished, where its creators mailed it in. Simply put,Rating2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rainbow Six Lockdown is set up to be a squad based tactical shooter, where you and your team breach doors, rescue hostages, and take down the bad guys. You have up to four team members at a time, and you issue fairly straightforward commands to them. They are fairly mindless and sometimes stand stupidly while being fired on. It's not so bad, though - the enemy does the exact same thing. Both of you are dealing with not-so-bright comrades so it all evens out.Really, the thing to remember in single player is that it is all a training mode for multi-player. You always get far better challenges playing against live humans than against computer-driven drones. So consider this your training grounds to get used to the commands. On one hand the game is a bit challenging - you can't survive infinite hits with a gun before you go down. It is much more realistic than many games in that sense. On the other hand, once you get even a basic grasp of how the tactics work, you should be able to rip through many of the missions without any need for cover or caution. The enemy is fairly clueless and you can usually kill them long before they start to take action.Lockdown is worth a look and gives a solid decent amount play time, however people new to the series would be better to start on another Rainbow six game as this is certainly not a highlight of the series.

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Lockdown is a good game, but has its flaws. The game plays like a SWAT simulator, which can be very fun, however, once in a while the bugs in the game will take away from this. The hitboxes in this game vary from time to time, and the AI for both your team and the terrorists are a bit weak. I would only recommend this game if you enjoy a slower paced game and can deal with the bugs and glitches.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a bad game by any means but it's probably the least tactial of the Rainbow Six games. I think a lot of the gameplay can be really fun but the story is basically not even a thing, John Clark explains most missions before you go in and it's so short and fast and you can't choose the crew that comes with you. I never got to play the multiplayer to this game because the servers are down. The missions can be fun but the game is pretty disappointing, it's a lot of run and gun rather than plan and play carefully. I've played Rainbow Six 1, Rainbow Six 3 and it's add-on, Rainbow Six Lockdown, and Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and 2, and this one is the worst. The AI over all is pretty bad, I've killed my teammates by mistake because they run right into my bullets. I do have to say that some of the missions are pretty cool and I did have fun with some parts so this game isn't a bad game, just the worst of the series. I'm not going to say ""do not buy the game"" because it can be fun and I don't hate it I just don't think it's very good, but if you want a good Rainbow Six game go buy either Rainbow Six 3 Raven Shield or Rainbow Six Vegas 2 and not this one.

												If you're looking for a serious tactical shooter, this isn't quite what you're looking for.  While lacking the more linear style levels of the console counterpart, the PC version of Lockdown has larger levels, more open levels (still not as large and open-ended as Rainbow Six 3's, or its predecessors).  The gunplay is very strange, it feels like a mix between Counter Strike and Rainbow Six 3, where your character is swift and nimble, but fire-fights are still extremely deadly and tactics and strategy are still required to overcome enemies.  I'd say that the sound design exceeds Rainbow Six 3's, along with the level design, although the gameplay is much more fast paced.No longer are you carefully planning your movements and decisions before striking your targets, as this is more about cover-based shooting.  Commanding your squad takes a back seat to the action and its relegated more to a standard FPS with the Rainbow Six skin on it, but lacks the elements that truly made it Rainbow Six.  If you're not a purist, you'll be able to find some joy in it, as it's not broken, plays very smoothly, and is made very competently, the only problem is the design behind most of it where it's trying to be a tactical shooter, but lacks the dedication to really commit to the genre.

												Rambow Six Lockdown. You are John Rambo part of an elite strike team sent into deal with hostile situations. J/K well not really if you played RS3 or any RS before this you will see this as the tipping point. a few things are better, like coop is organized and spawns are better. but the action is very geared towards the average gamer not so much towards teh tactical player. you can run and gun with pray and spray for  most situations. I had flash and smoke nades in my load out andI found I never used them. RS is a tactical situation management team they are sent in to deal with a situtaion quickly and silently. in the earlier RS's if you were loud, hostages died. this one has no need for a silencer. It is more user friendly but is the turning point for the franchise. every one since is built on the console model for profit. *tear* Not to say I didnt like it, I loved it, just liked RS3 more. but dont get me started on RSV. 7.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very diferent R6 from the previous games, the lack of planning and customization was a big step back in the tactical aspect since the first, but the combat is now much more realistic (weapons handling) but the terrible AI made this change look worst than it should had been, we can only understand it if we look at next one that is Vegas, it is clear that Lockdown was the start of new cycle, more action oriented and less planning wich doesnt mean its all bad, just diferent.Was a R6 player since Eagle Watch and Rogue Spear, this doesnt have anything to do with them besides the name Tom Clancy´s, but if Lockdown had good AI and more options to aproach each situation instead of linear paths, it surelly didnt dissapointed was R6 game since the tactical aspect was always the strong point.Lockdown it still a decent game, good graphics from its time, various weapons choices and good handling, average story and good voice acting like always, it deliver some entertainement in shooting bad guys and it have good campaing lenght but the Multiplayer doesnt work anymore since its old and are better options.If you are looking for entertainement, i recommend this game since it delivers if you espect 2006 game, if you are looking for R6 experience, better pass on this one and the next ones since they clearly change direction from any previous one, doesnt make them bad, just diferent.
