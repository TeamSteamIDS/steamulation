												You can find faults without too much effort, but I can still say the same thing about this one I said about the first: it's a blast of pure fun, and provides the proper conclusion to a truly enjoyable series of adventures.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in their own new adventure.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they go as far as they go in the comic (and further). If you love the Sam and Max type of humor, you will love this series.If I'm going to mark points off for anything, its that the voices of Sam and Max have changed from the original LucasArts version, but after awhile they really start to own it and become the definitive Sam and Max voices.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
