AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: The Bureau: XCOM Declassified Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Action; Tactical; Third-Person; Strategy; RPG; Sci-Fi; Story Rich My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWThe Bureau: XCOM Declassified is an action-tactical, third-person shooter that incorporates cover systems, tactical pausing, and squad commands to make for riveting combat scenarios.  The story is fairly enthralling and while the characters are definitely cliché, I thought they were diverse and interesting enough, with the exception being the unquestionably boring main character.  It is far from perfect, but I enjoyed it, that much I know.  I think if you like games in this style, then you will probably enjoy it too; but if you’re someone who easily dislikes things that aren’t absolutely perfectly crafted, you may want to reconsider trying this.  This game is not like other X:COM games you may have played; rather it is a different type of game altogether that is simply set in the X:COM universe.  Evidently, this bothered many people; but I find it hard to understand why some people feel the core gameplay is so absolutely terrible.  The style of play is very similar to the Mass Effect series.  You combat in third-person shooter style, with the ability to use tactical pausing and to issue commands (move, target, use ability) to squadmates.  There is an XP and leveling system for both your main character and squadmates, with a handful of different squadmate classes to work with.  It certainly doesn’t have the most refined, expansive, and exemplary combat/gameplay mechanics out there, but I thought it was good enough and enjoyed playing the game.The story is somewhere between mediocre and good.  I liked the atmosphere and setting of an alien invasion in 1960s America.  The narrative and characters are undoubtedly cliché at times, but I felt it was all intriguing enough to hold my interest as I played through the game.  Some of the plot developments do come out of nowhere, but ultimately I thought they actually helped to make the story more interesting.I didn’t experience any jarring bugs or glitches and I thought the graphics and soundscape were pleasant.  Some of the cutscenes had a grainy look to them even after I turned film grain off, but it wasn’t the end of the world— the in-game graphics were still crisp and attractive.  For me, the most egregious negative aspect of the game was the checkpoint autosave system.  I don’t like playing a game on a PC in this day & age and not have the option to quicksave and/or make multiple saves.  (You can, however, also load up the start of any level and continue playing from there, if you missed something).  But, to be honest, the checkpoints were extremely frequent and never really caused any true frustration.The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a decent game that suffered from overzealous people’s unrealistic expectations.  Not every game can be the best game ever or the best game of the year.  If you are someone who only likes to play a few games a year and wants them all to be absolute top-notch games, I can respect that and I will then suggest that you might not want to play this.  The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a moderate-to-good game that will appeal to those who enjoy the style of gameplay it offers and who play enough different games that they understand they can’t all be the best but they can be good enough.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is for me, the surprise of the year. It received a slew of mediocre review scores which painted a pretty bleak picture. However, upon playing it myself, I have found the game to be incredibly enjoyable.You are thrust into the shoes of William Carter --  an agent with a troubled past -- in the midst of an alien invasion. With the military essentially being wiped out and all communications jammed, it falls to the XCOM organisation to deal with the alien threat. As an XCOM agent, you will spend much of your time in the undergound base: delegating mission assignments (where your fellow XCOM agents can gain experience), exploring, completing side missions and talking to the various personalities within the facility. Many comparisons have been made between the XCOM base and the Mass Effect Citadel, which I would say are apt. When you're done with the base activites, you can head out into the field. Most of the time you may choose between minor (side) and major (main) operations. The minor operations are fun little deviations, providing insight into what the people of that region have been through. You may happen upon individuals who have been infected by the aliens (this renders them basically catatonic) or dismembered bodies  scattered thoughout.In terms of gameplay, you lead two squadmates into battle, stopping (well, nearly stopping) time in order to provide them with orders. To me, it feels like Enemy Unknown, except in third person. Along with providing them orders, you level them up, allowing them to use new and varied powers. If you play it as a straight up shooter, neglecting to order your AI squadmates around, you may have a bad time. I believe this is where a lot of the negative attitudes towards the gameplay comes from. The AI needs direction or they will get themselves killed.A typical encounter would see you approach the enemy, getting yourself into cover and your allies. Pausing time, surveying the battlefield then deciding how to proceed. Perhaps you make your sniper cloak, move around to flank the enemy, then hit them with a critical strike? Perhaps you have your engineer throw down a rocket turret, which you then lift above cover to rain hell upon your enemies? Each battle is varied, giving you a lot of strategic options. This is something that I loved about The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.The story goes from somewhat generic to ""Wow, this is batshit insane!"" As I made my way through, I became more and more engaged, to the point where I couldn't put it down.The game does have its problems, but they are minor. If you have any interest in the XCOM universe and tactical shooters, I highly suggest you give this game a shot. It may surprise you.+Outstanding graphics and atmosphere. +The story takes some time to warm up, but once it gets going, it is captivating.+Great tactical battle interface. Ordering your allies around is pleasant and easy.+Good sense of progression. As you advance through the story, you and your allies level up, becoming powerhouses capable of taking on the most menacing of enemies. +The XCOM base and its personnel are well designed. It's nice to walk around talking to each of them and completing their side quests.-Lip syncing at times is woeful.-Voice acting can be hit or miss.-On higher difficulties, grenade spam can be a problem.-The AI are bullet magnets. If you do not tell them what to do (constantly), they will die.			",398,90,13,61,43,10,90

												Rating 7.5/10Overview: Cover Based- Third Person ShooterThe Good:+I really loved the 1960's American setting. Both artistically and technically the developers did a good job making this game feel alive. +The game takes place across a series of locations each one unique in its own way. The game has a lot of good set pieces +Side quests are fleshed out and fun to play + The game allows you to take 2 squad members with you into battle. You can customize your squad any way you like. There are four classes to choose from:  support, sniper, engineer, and commando. Each class has its own set of abilities and weapons to choose from. You pick whatever you want to suit your playstyle. + The game has a wide variety of abilities not only for the main character but your squad as well. The abilities are varied for each class and serve a very practical purpose in battleThe Average:The story starts off strong and is constantly building up to something...problem is, the story starts getting too convoluted for its own good. Eventually it gets so ridiculous it becomes hard to care about the story. By the end of the game I was playing it just to see the next setting. The characters are also one dimensional and a bit stereotypical. The game doesn't do a whole lot to change up the game play formula. Every side quest/main mission plays out the same way, kill lots of enemies, move on to the next area...repeat. The Bad:- Your teammates are completely useless. First they don't manually use there abilities, you have to manually select them for them to use it. Some people may like this, I did not.  The second major problem is that they make very stupid decisions resulting in death. The pop out of cover at the wrong time and get shot at, move to locations where the enemies are, etc.   The third major problem is that they do very little damage, 99% of the kills will come from you. For a game that is supposed to be a ""tactical"" shooter , there is nothing tactical about it. Because of the stupidity of your teammates the game plays out like a solo third person shooter. You only have teammates to choose their abilities. ConclusionFor all the fun I had with this game, it does have some serious faults. I would have liked to see more variety in the gameplay and stronger A.I. I still think its worth playing especially if you like cover based shooters.			",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified was not well received by mainstream reviewers, but I personally enjoyed it a lot. Overall, it feels like a stripped down version of Mass Effect, but the combat stands out above other cover shooters. The game has a lot of flaws, but I encountered no bugs in the core game. The Hangar 6 DLC, however, would freeze briefly every few seconds and rendered the game nearly unplayable. The Bureau's combat puts you in control of William Carter, a rather generic protagonist with a gravelly voice. Conversations in the game are carried out with a radial menu lifted directly from Mass Effect. The dialogue isn't terribly interesting, and some of the characters facial animations appeared to not actually be finished. Their mouths move with odd robotic motions, and their eyes look eerily dead. Carter himself, and some of the other core characters have much better, albeit repetitive animations. The story is forgettable overall, but moves the game on well enough. It doesn't come anywhere close to the likes of Mass Effect though, and the fact that the developers chose to base their game design so heavily on Mass Effect is unfortunate given the weak story. Even still, the combat made the experience worthwhile.Combat in the Bureau is at it's core a cover shooter in the vein of Mass Effect or Gears of War. It also gives you a pair of squadmates and allows you to give direct orders to them. The rookies you start with only have one or two abilities, as well as a command to focus on a specific target, and move to a location. Choosing where to move your squadmates is where the game gets a lot of it's strategic depth. You have to take into account how long they'll be exposed for, how far the nearest ally is if they need a revive, where the enemies are, how much protection the cover offers, and how easily they can use their abilities from their location. Overall it makes for a far more interesting experience than your standard cover shooter. Abilities range from dropping mines, shield domes, artillery strikes, and others.The combat isn't perfect though. Your squadmates seem to move into stupid locations occasionally, either exposing themselves to unnecessary fire, going down somewhere difficult to revive them, or both. It's not quite clear why this happens, but it doesn't happen very often at least. The encounters feel somewhat repetitive, but they ramp up in difficulty at a good rate. The weapons are fairly standard for a cover shooter; human and alien variations of the standard rifle, pistol, sniper and so on. Enemies on the other hand provide a bit more variety, healing their allies, granting them shields, spawning new enemies, or even mind controlling your squadmates.The graphics generally look good, with a variety of scenes ranging from idyllic small towns to metallic alien structures. Some elements though stand out like a sore thumb. An ugly low res skybox in one of the first scenes of the game is jarringly bad to look at in stark contrast to the cutscene that precedes it. Other elements like a destroyed tank with an ugly texture and a low poly model, or the abyss below an alien tower filled with an ugly brown fog that would have been acceptable years ago, but looks disappointing today. The rest of the game, however, especially the weapon reload animations look and sound good.The Bureau's worst offense however, is sure to be a dealbreaker for some fans of the mainstream XCOM games. The only thing The Bureau has in common with XCOM itself is the aliens and the weapon types. Unlocking new weapons is done merely by picking them up off the ground rather than researching them. Dying only puts you back to the latest checkpoint, and while you can lose squadmates permanently if they bleed out in some difficulty settings, I'm fairly sure if you die yourself they'll be back with you at the last checkpoint. By removing research, permadeath, and forcing the player down a linear path, I'm sure some players will deem the game unworthy of the XCOM title. While these issues did grate on me at first, it was the combat that kept me playing and enjoying every minute of it. Even though the story is just average, it isn't particularly time consuming like it is in Mass Effect. While I feel the game could have played more to it's strengths, it was still well worth the time and money while on sale. I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this game to fans of Mass Effect, though fans of the classic XCOM games or Enemy Unknown will not enjoy it unless they also enjoy a good cover shooter.

												I love XCOM (old and new). I like third (and first) person shooters. This should have been right up my alley. The concept is, but the execution falls flat for me.My AI squad mates are imbeciles: running in front of turrets, running INTO the explosion radius of grenades, etc. I guess maybe I'm supposed to micro-manage the crap out of them, but that's not very fun -- especially when I'm struggling with getting my own damn guy to actually go into cover, move around simple objects, etc. 90% of the game boils down to me shooting an alien, cranking off my healing power to keep my idiot squad mates alive, shooting another alien, running to revive a downed♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that walked out of cover, shooting an alien, cranking off my healing power again...lather, rinse, repeat.It's not a terrible game, but it's just not for me. I don't have the patience for this kind of nonsense.			",565,290,10,82,48,8,100

Picked a bad day to quit drinking... 
A Screenshot of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified
By: SABINA




Highly recommended. I absolutely enjoyed every minute of this game, it stands on it's own in the franchise. From the convincing, immersive 1962 atmosphere to the gorgeously rendered and extremely detailed environments, it is immensely engaging and entertaining from start to finish. The tactical combat system is smooth and satisfying without being too easy, just the right balance of simplicity and complexity for me. I found the characters, especially the protagonist, to be realistic, believable people. Agent Carter is the quintessential tragic antihero with a scarred past, bad habits, and post traumatic stress disorder. A cynical misanthropist, but a man of the highest honor, we can't help but hope he finds redemption in saving the world. The expertly written story draws you in and helps greatly to suspend disbelief in an otherwise unbelievable nightmare. I would like to see this subject matter treated more in gaming, I think it is a richly complex, provocative and potentially horrifying, largely untapped genre. The Bureau is by far the best game to address it so far.			",289,131,0,25,14,0,30

												The Bureau is a strange game. It's essentially a Mass Effect game without the plot choices (save for a few near the end). The squad controls like a Mass Effect 3 squad. You order them to cover and use abilities (like warp blast and lift...). There's a main mission hub where you talk to your companions with dialogue wheels. It's Mass Effect-lite.It's pretty well made and the combat is engaging enough. I really enjoy the rare game that tries to capture cold war era America and I think The Bureau succeeds here quite well. Everything about this game is very 1962.If you like the XCOM lore or are just looking for a decent third person squad shooter to spend some time with, you could do much worse. Skip the DLC though.

												After reading some of these comments of people who don't like the game because it is not what they know - they know so little - I decided to create a review where I tell you:Buy this game!My reasons:- The story is good- It is the real beginning of XCOM and told in a way I can believe- It is not like a DLC to XCOM, Enemey Unknown, but instead a game of its own- The graphics are great- I like the sound- The gameplay is fun- The characters are real characters - at least some of them. Not just soldier xy.- soldiers who are not in your team can be on their own missions and level in these missions- all soldiers have ... ""magic"" :)What you have to understand is, that this is not a game where you run around with guns blazing.You have to move from cover to cover, give your two teammates commands and use the special commands (""magic"", whatever) as often as possible.You have to manage your two team mages, THAT is your job.NOT killing as many enemies as possible yourself.If you are one of these idiots who writes in Killing Floor or other Coop games things like ""don't steal my kills"", then you will hate this game because you are an idiot and idiots can't like this game.I do not say, that everyone who hates the game is an idiot, or that all idiots will hate this game, I just wanted to mention the possibility :)If you did not understand the above sentence, don't bother to play the game. It is not for you.A little bit about the game and not about the mindless haters:It is real time when you explore the level or do combat.But all the time you have the option to pause the game and queue commands for yourself and your mates.Because the game is not really paused but instead is running very slow, you still have to act quickly.Sometimes one of your mates will attack the enemy in a mindless way, he will leave his cover and storm toward the enemy.Without any valid reason.YOU have to manage them and bring them back to cover.You have to use your men and their abilities, like decoys, to either just bring the enemy down with force or get your men in superior positions, for example you can flank the enemy. All levels are in a way, that you CAN do it in different ways.And depending on your choice of mates and your own weapons you have totally different ""magic"" abilities and ranges of weapons.Depending on your weapon/ability choice you have to stay away from the enemy or you HAVE to close in.Do you want to use shields and shotguns? Or do you want to use sniper rifles and rocket turrets? Your choice.The game is fun. From the beginning to the end.The end is not drawing on and on and one like in other games. There is a story and they did not kill the story to make the game longer.There ARE moments when you want to eat your keyboard, because you did something wrong.Mostly it is not the game but you, who is doing it wrong.There are shortcuts to move from cover to cover, or to to jump over cover to be able to run towards the enemy or even to jump over the cover to use the cover from the other side which is VERY interesting in boss fights.But if you are under stress, you make errors and use the wrong combination.Then you die and you hate the game.But the game is really good, it is fun and it is not too long.It took me over 20 hours to finish it, that is more than ok.I tried to do every mission and talk to everyone who wanted to talk to me. I checked the maps for schemata for better equipment and did not rush the game.I like the game. It is NOT like XCom-Enemy Unkown, it IS a game of its own and if you can't understand that, then you will not like the game.It has not the replayability like XCOM Enemy Unkown, because there are not so many choices where you would want to try the different approach. If you once decide to sacrifice someone, why would you save him the next time? The cirumstances are the same. I saved him! :) And the weapon choices are only choices for yourself. For you men it is more like, new weapon? Ok, use it.It is not a sandbox game. It is not a openworld game. It is not multiplayer.If you need these to be happy, stay away.If you are a gamer and like good games with stories, get it and have a blast for 3 days. Then back to your long term games :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as games go, I can't think of too many that are more demonized than this one. Most people went into it thinking they were going to get some sort of polished up grid-style xcom team FPS and the reality is that while this game doesn't quite fall into that category, it isn't exactly the worst thing ever either. The game itself has a fairly interesting storyline that fits in “ok” to the XCOM universe despite not making a whole lot of sense until late game. Most levels consist of you running from point A to point B and collecting whatever tidbits of information (if any) and special items/weapons in addition to killing anything in your way. The combat is a bit frustrating at first as your cohorts movement commands are issued in a way relative to their position which makes using their abilities a bit difficult if they happen to be out of range. Also, they seem to be incredibly bad at dodging anything so expect to have to babysit them for the entirety of the game. As far as strategy goes, I managed to find a sweet spot with scout and commando but other class mixes are viable all the way until the last few battles (your experience may vary). Overall, the game came off as a bit tedious and I kind of sloughed through the last few hours of ""level plus multiple respawns"". Additionally the plot revolving around the main character (Carter) is pretty nonsensical and random which made it kind of difficult to get “into” the story. I would only recommend this game for diehard fans of XCOM who want to see another take on the popular franchise.			",217,103,1,22,12,4,23

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified not only fails to grasp its strategy based roots but struggles to smoothly incorporate some of the most basic elements of gameplay.Set in the 1960′s you take the role of William Carter, a CIA agent with the task of delivering a mysterious object, as things don’t turn out as planned Carter finds himself caught within a global alien invasion. After showing the ability to command, Carter is brought into the XCOM project to combat the new alien threat and keep it hidden from public domain.While the story has plenty of potential, filled with plot twists and interesting concepts that promised much however the abysmal animation quality and equally poor dialogue stomps on any attempts for the story to blossom. As your character speaks to others, it won’t take long for you to notice the constant repeat of three animations that just feel artificial, along with poor voice acting that simply changes tone every sentence making it impossible to take anything they say with any care. Plot holes run amok with many of the side quests, and dialogue not connected to the main focus of the storyline.The Bureau tries to blend the turn based strategy of the XCOM series with real time cover based shooting. Promoting teamwork and RPG elements to overcome challenges works well on paper but poor execution through AI simply makes many of the strategy components redundant. Often finding my partners simply refuse to take any useful cover unless directly told to do so, however when they take position the poor AI simply takes over, soon making them move out of cover instantly. The AI will often struggle to perform basic tasks, watching myself go down right next to an ally as they simply stand on my face watching my hp slide down to zero.While enemies are based on those featured in previous XCOM games, within The Bureau they lack the identity and unique traits that made combat diverse, tense and tactical. As you progress through the game, enemies will remain the same except for an additional armor or shield bar with the word elite lazily thrown after their names.Character progression within the game is very limited, offering little combat customization. As you and your squad levels up you are given the choice between two new upgrades, often being the choice between duration and damage. This design has been taken from XCOM: Enemy unknown which worked fine within the game design however playing as a single character through the whole story, and only having two teammates with you at all times means characters simply feel too limited, with a maximum of three skills per class, you’ll soon find your preferred attacks and have no reason to add diversity to your tactics throughout the entire game. Skills are activated by bringing up a battle HUD, giving you access to your own and team skills, during this the game will slow down giving you more time to plan and consider your options. Though slowing down the game reduces the pressure, the game continues to play making many tactical attacks an impossibility. Many times I found myself trying to time my snipers critical strike with turrets and protective abilities however the moment a skill is selected it will begin to play out giving you little time to organize the ambush you planned in your mind, often resulting in a messy and inconsistent first attack.One of the huge holes apparent within the game seems to be a lack of co-op within the game, the structure of combat and the storyline feel setup for two players. Situations where the main character become split up for short periods of time from the team, as well as the dependency on tight coordinated teamwork scream out for two player interaction. Many flaws within the game, specifically the unreliability of the AI would be overcome and none apparent with a second human player. With a second player the game could be incredible enjoyable and the fact developers missed this opportunity is a great disappointment.The Bureau is definitely not one of the worst games available for sale, but simply tries to do so many things, it does none of them well. Barely meeting the line of mediocre in any aspects of gameplay giving it no identity on the market, and as such simply giving no reason to buy it especially at a full AAA title price.edit: Fixed typo.

												I really enjoyed The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.It's a tactical cover-based shooter in a thirdperson view.You're playing one of the agents of XCOM, fighting back an alien invasion on the earth.It has a pretty nice '50s/'60s style which fits the game perfectly and looks pretty neat (sure, no high-end graphic but it has still some nice and atmospheric visuals).It's very linear and you'll always see when a fight is going to happen (you'll spot the covers you can use).I found the gameplay and fights to be quite enjoyable. Though, the A.I. has some flaws (and i just played on a low difficulty, so maybe it might be worse on higher difficulties).It plays like every other cover-based shooter, with the exception that you can give your 2 companions orders (there are maximum 2 you can take on missions with you). Opening up this menu will trigger a super slow-motion, giving you time to activate skills, place your companions on specific points on the map or heal yourself. You also have to be careful/tactical as the characters won't take too much damage, so run&gun isn't the best option here.Between missions you're always going back to the underground base of XCOM, where you can find some people to talk with, read some notes and do some smaller side-missions, which was a nice idea in my opinion.You can also recruit different soldiers which have different classes and therefor different skills they will use, e.g. one can use a shield, another one can place a turret and the next one can make himself invisible.If you're a die-hard fan of the old XCOM games, you might be dissappointed, as it is not the typical turn-based strategy game, but apart from that i found it to be pretty enjoyable.Worth a look if you like SciFi and tactical third-person shooters.

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified isn't bad, it just isn't very good. It's a bit threadbare, feeling like several incomplete ideas that have been rushed out the gate.Realistically, I suspect The Bureau was completed on a small-ish budget after lingering around in development hell for a few years. Something about the game makes it feel like it's ten years or more old, if it wasn't for some of the DirectX 11 effects looking so sparkly it'd be easy to think it was from the early 2000's. Many of the locations are bare and empty places, feeling like they've been built in a rush, and often with several such vacant sets stitched together without any combat or events to distract, assumably to give the impression of covering a lot of ground in a mission. Other areas have clearly had some time and attention spent on them, and the locations and missions waver back-and-forth on this attention / quality scale, leaving the experience feeling quite jarring. You'll wander from a well-realised street, strewn with debris, bodies and signs of previous life... into an area that feels like it's been imported from a PS2 game.The mechanics of the game basically play out like Mass Effect's combat, or Mass Effect 3 more specifically. It's a cover-based shooter where you run around with two squadmates, you have abilities with cooldowns, can issue orders and give movement directions to your squad. Enemies come in multiple varieties, some with shields and some with armour, with a few enemy types creating interesting tactical choices (a unit that supplies shields to all other nearby units, for example, if taken out the shields drop and make the fight easier). Unfortunately, where Mass Effect shines in making you care for your squad, here they are just flat cardboard bodies waiting for you to pull their puppet strings. They also keep respawning in front of you whenever you cross through a 'loading door' (frequent area transitions where the game loads the next section as your character very slowly opens a door and looks left and right before giving you control again), which is a bit distracting.In fact, I felt the game lacked polish in general. I fell through the level geometry and died twice in eight hours of play, once whilst just running down a straight corridor. Audio logs can be found and played, although walking away from them they fade until inaudible (if I have to stand still to listen to them, they may as well be written text!). The controls aren't terrible, but movement feels clunky and stiff, for example; when you run there is absolutely no strafing, not even in a limited fashion, leaving you to clumsily course-correct with your mouse as you charge forward. You also tend to pop in and out of cover randomly at times, especially if strafing in cover, and controlling your squadmates feels awkward (fortunately the game slows down time during this).Much of the story is told over radio as you run between fights, although there are some cutscenes that deal with exposition. The game also uses a dialogue wheel, just like the Mass Effect series, allowing you to choose between being vaguely rude or agreeable, it's a nice enough touch, although it felt a bit redundant with such small scope for actual meaningful choice. Levels are basically linear paths that open into combat arenas, the main missions last 30 to 60 minutes each, with side missions from 15 to 30 minutes roughly (I only did a couple, they felt fairly pointless). The game isn't overly long with six main missions, the story is mildly amusing with some interesting characters (although the main player character really started to grate on me). The plot felt like it tried to raise the stakes too high a number of times implying that Earth has basically been wiped out and already lost by the midway point of the game, then later claiming it's not as bad as implied, which breaks the suspension of disbelief somewhat.Imbetween the missions, the game flirts with the idea of being an XCOM-style strategy game where you pick missions and kit out your squad, but with only six main plot missions and (I believe) seven side-quest 'minor missions', it doesn't feel like there's a lot of variety or choice. The equipment feels limited, with only a handful of weapons to equip and the only other equipment slot being a 'backpack' which acts as a kind of modifier for ammo, health regen, or ability cooldowns.Overall, not a bad game, just not a particularly good one. It feels like it didn't succeed at being the mixture of genres it wanted to be, and it's not particularly good at being any ONE genre either. The plot is so-so, and the clunky and unpolished feel doesn't help. But if you don't mind all this and want a simple squad and cover-based shooter, this might entertain.			",176,102,1,19,7,1,14

												It is games like this that make me wish STEAM had a ""Neutral"" button instead of a strict ""Recommend/Don't Recommend"" button. I have mixed feelings about this game, allow me to break it down like this:The Good:> Interesting story with an intriquing plot twist.> Enjoyable 1950's era environment.> Nice variety of weapons and equipment (""backpacks"") to enable most any playstyle.> Graphics are decent, the game is built on the Unreal engine, its not current big budget graphics but I don't mind them.The Not-So-Good:> They tried too hard to make a tactical squad based third person shooter with cover mechanics that feels very clunky. The cover mechanic requires you to sprint at a wall and basically super-glue yourself to it. This system doesn't seem to want to let you ""leave"" said wall if say, a grenade is thrown at you, which happens A LOT.> The story itself is rather short, you can power through it without any trouble in a couple hours.If you are looking for a tie-in game for XCOM: Enemy Unkown, this is NOT it. This game has little-to-no relation to Enemy Unkown and contains none of the base management mechanics that Enemy Unkown has.So, in short, this game is worth a look if you get it on sale or as part of a Humble Bundle, but I just cannot recommend buying it at full price. I would put it in the $15 game bracket. Its better than bargain bin game quality but should not command a higher price than around $15.			",162,18,4,21,16,1,39

												After all the bad press surrounding slapping the famous XCOM (sic.) brand on a TPS there is a surprising decent game left behind.  You are Agent Carter, a cynical broken man thrust into the limelight after an Alien invasion now tasked as the tip of the spear against this new threat.There are many elements and ideas drawn from the previous games but it is a strictly linear and pre determined experience.  You operate out of XCOM headquarters between the main story missions.  You have free run of the base and are able to go on minor side missions, perform investigations inside the base and sent agents out on missions on their own to gain experience and new equipment.  Sadly even though the base has vast Engineering and Lab sections, they are cosmetic.  You can't perform research on new equipment or ideas or perform autopsies.  The only way to get new equipment is to find it during a mission and the only way to learn about various elements is to click on one of the copious clickables in the world.Carter can bring two additional henchmen with him on a mission from one of the four classes.  They are all pretty standard tropes from other games but do add an interesting element to the game.  Do you go all out attack with commandos and snipers, sit back and dig in with engineers and support specialists or a combination of the four.  You can move henchmen around the battleground, conveniently littered with waist high walls, flank enemies and use the various abilities in conjunction with Carter's unique ones for a multitude of strategies. But...A warning: The friendly henchmen AI is some of the worst you'll ever see.  They'll jump out of cover, run left, run right, turn a full circle, jump over another wall landing right next the nearest enemy before coming back to you.  They need to be babysat at all times or they will be useless.Where the game shines is in the fantastic recreation of cold-war early sixties America and the digital acting.  The influence of Mass Effect is obvious but still welcome and the story?  Well, let's just say it takes quite the left turn near the end!Update for badge!I'll give it 7.5/10 on the AAA scale of 7-10			",2238,887,83,269,310,28,351

												A decent squad based third person shooter. Nothing more. The Bureau brings nothing new to the table but is still mostly enjoyable. The 60's style is done very well, even though the sci-fi elements detract from the experience at times making it feel like a 90's or even 00's game. It doesn't mix the settings properly I guess.The graphics are solid, nothing special, but not bad either. They get the job done, like most games. Same goes for the voice acting. The effects on the other hand are done very well.The gameplay itself is hit and miss. There's no research to be done, so if you pick up an alien's weapon you can fire it right away. It's something I missed, especially after playing last year's Xcom. There are mini missions to be completed and agents can be sent on different missions to level up and gather gear. Those missions can not be played so it basically comes down to selecting which agents you want to go.Each agent has abilities that can be unlocked by leveling up. They're all fun to use and there's plenty of variation to mix things up during battle. The battles play out in real time and with the press of a button time can be slowed down to make more tactical choices. Later on you'll have no choice but to use it as more and tougher enemies will be deployed. Without it you'll have a pretty hard time, let me tell you.Also, If you're agents are down you'll have a certain amount of time to help them up. If you don't help them in time they'll die and you'll lose them forever. So it's important that you work together and manage them in the best way you can to prevent them from dying. Near the end of the game this becomes much less important because your other agents will be around level 4 or 5 already.The Bureau is actually pretty lenghty. I finished it in about 14-15 hours on Veteran so I guess it can be completed in roughly 13 hours or so, if you stay alive the entire time. That's actually pretty decent in an age where most action (adventure) games can be completed within 7-8 hours.If I had to rate The Bureau I'd give it a 7/10. It's frustrating at times, but fun enough to play and finish. The only issue here is the price, because even though there's plenty of content the game itself just isn't fun enough to pay full price.[Rating: 73/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												I seriously wanted to like this game.  I've been a huge XCOM fan since forever.  This game is just so maddeningly mediocre any true XCOM fan should just forget it exists. Pros:-Shooting aliens with M14s I guess-Retro 60s theme is neat-Mutons are terrifyingCons:-Faux RPG elements are minimally important-Map design is brutally linear-The gameplay isn't interesting and sometimes frustrating when cover doesn't work right in a firefight-Squad routinely abandons perfectly good cover to walk into searing barrages of enfilading plasma fire-Squad is less than useless, never had them kill more than 20% of the enemy even when fully upgraded and constantly spamming their abilities-The story gets pretty ridiculous by the end-Blaster launcher is boring as hellBottom line is you're playing a squad based tactics game where the squad is useless, the tactics are simplistic and the maps are so small as to prevent critical thinking.  Then you slog through to an ending that isn't very good.			",60,8,0,13,7,0,27

												Glad to see the reviews shifting positive for this game. I really enjoyed the story and loved Carter as the main character.Its Xcom, but plays like a wonky Mass Effect. This isn't a bad thing, but its not as smooth as ME. If you can make the adjustments to the controls it is well worth it.Personally I loved the 60s backdrop and the sense of overwhelming conspiracy, it plays nicely into Carters role. Decent amount of upgrades and leveling, but nothing astounding.all in all, for a cheap price tag on♥♥♥♥♥♥♥or steam sales it is well worth it for any Xcom/ ME fan.8/10Dem controls doe.

												I wanted to give this game a proper chance, I really did. Even as a serious X-COM nut I know the plotlines have always been 'meh' and after FiraXCOM was announced I was more accepting of this as a spinoff (like Command and Conquer: Renegade, which I liked). It was still a daft move to make the first XCOM game announced for years the one that closest resembles X-COM: Enforcer, the lowest point of the series.This game however is a perfect example of what happens when you force a franchise into somthing unrelated. I like the 1960's and I like the Men in Black angle but by cramming in lacklustre combat and a horribly broken squad command interface into a game that was not designed from the start to be something different has hampered the game horribly.I said 'lacklustre combat' but I suspect that is being generous. 'Broken' is more like it. To squeeze as much as possible from the squad command gimmick the only way to do serious damage is by flanking the enemy. That in itself wouldn't be too bad if a) you weren't being constantly forced down linear pathways with little chance to spread your tactical wings and b) most importantly, the squad AI wasn't atrocious. I even tried getting them to stay in place while I flanked as they kept with the lemming act when I gave them the move command. What did they do? The followed me. There is no 'halt' command, before you ask. Add to all that bugger all ammo capacity and you'll spend the game running for a thousand guns just to take care of a handful of mooks.The graphics are mediocre at best, the base command is even less than what you got from Mass Effect 2 (at least you could choose your research there) but the worst crime in my eyes is the plot. The 1960's was a troublesome time with not just the Cold War but rights movements for women and people of colour. Does any of this get to the game? There's one Soviet agent which is nothing more than 'you can recruit this dude to be a generic squad mate,' only a handful (2 on my admittedly amateurish count) of comments about one of the star agents being a woman and not a single sausage about the amount of black agents and scientists (Again, this is the sixties, that would have been huge and quite interesting). I keep thinking they missed an opportunity by not doing something like Expeditions: Conquistador; imagine if your squaddies had personalities. Likes and hates and all that jazz. Some are progressive and some are more traditional. Do you stick by your guns and rely on women and coloured folk despite the anger you'll recieve or will you bow down to social pressure and prejudice?Between the lack of care for anything happening in the 60's and all the sci fi weaponry there is no reason this couldn't have been set in modern day, the eighties, or even in World War 2. It takes effort to make one of the most interesting decades in the last century that generic.Add to that the most generic hero character ever (seriously, the guy is every bland hero trope imaginable; WW2 veteran, dead family, alcoholic, tortured past, gravelly voice, etc) and a plot that makes Independence Day seem high brow and it's a total loss on story as well as gameplay.The tragic thing is when I look back at the original vids (the ones which sparked the public outcry) it looked really good; the old 'man in black' conspiracies mixed in with the Stepford Wives. That could have lead to some interesting investigative angles and could have created a properly eerie alien plot. If it was allowed to be it's own thing instead of having a brand name forced on it (a brand name not unfamiliar with being abused, admittedly) and not reworked time and time again for stupid reasons we would have had a much better game. For those who whine about the Devil May Cry reboot (which I say was solid), that was at least in the spirit of the originals. The Bureau reeks of the sort of soulless boardroom mandates that I would have expected from EA.Would I recommend it? It's better than the Syndicate Reboot, but then very little isn't. The word 'generic' appears in the above text a lot. That should tell you everything you need to know.Quick edit: Yes I know this is a 2K Games published title and not EA, that was a stab at the people who could turn Syndicate into a FPS far worse than Goldeneye: Rogue Agent (which had the excuse of being unfinished and rushed and was still reasonably fun) and the sort of people who looked at the Divine Comedy, social, theological and political commentary that it was and say to themselves, ""Yes, this is perfect God of War clone material!"" That's right; I am comparing the Bureau to EA's Dante's Inferno.			",679,167,3,112,54,3,108

												I don't think I've ever felt so burned buying a game day one. Do not let the XCOM name fool you. It has nothing to do with the overall story. If anything this game makes a mess of the overall narrative of XCOM. The story is below average with one little unexpected twist but if anything it's more unexpected because up until that point you don't expect much after hearing all the character's dull droning and uninspired dialog. The graphics range from sub-par to bland. Strange phenomenons appear all the time, from the shimmering hair of one of your colleagues that change from blond to brunette, all the way to identical twin guards that also bare a striking resemblance to a scientist you just passed down stairs. The game play is standard cover-based shooting. You move, kill aliens, wave ends, then keep moving; sound like some real white knuckle action? If so, get out more. Sometimes you find an alien weapon and get to use it...that's it. No research, no testing, no means of duplicating the tech. You just have it now and so do your teammates.Speaking of which, your A.I. partners are dumb as suicidal rocks. You give them orders, to which they either ignore so they can do what they want or they follow orders and keep following them regardless of whether or not they are about to die by continuing to obey. They rarely kill an enemy and are more of a liability than a useful asset. When they take too much damage they fall and you have a short amount of time to get to them before they die for good...not that you'd notice. More than a few times I had a teammate warn me I was standing near an alien-thrown grenade. I would jump out of the way while the A.I. teammate that warned me would sit there and get blown up.This game was short. I beat it along with all the achievements on the first time around. The DLC mission ""Codebreakers"" was horrible. Not only is it an obvious mission that was cut out of the original product to make more money and incentivize pre-orders, it is the SHORTEST MISSION IN THE GAME AND ADDS NOTHING TO THE STORY! What do you get to show for it? Another backpack mod thing that you probably won't use.I've played some bad games in my life but this one hurt. I like the XCOM franchise but this one was nothing but a cheap cash-in that used the XCOM name to boast sales. Do yourself a favor and buy XCOM: Enemy Unknown or continue to play it  if you already own it. This game is only XCOM in name, not in game play nor spirit. Learn from my mistake.

												As an XCOM fanboy I had to try this one out. And hooboy, it sounds like a stinker. Third-person shooter somehow related with XCOM and set in the 1960's for some reason? And while the original XCOM was fantastic, the franchise has suffered from corporate rule (although the reboot is alright).  Plus it's apparently been through development hell with switching studios and even switched from FPS to third-person tactical.   But this one really surprised me. The setting, as hokey as it is, is pulled off really well and has an entertaining flavor about it. The gameplay mechanics of controlling 1-3 dudes via pseudo time-stop and the cover system works well enough. The gear upgrades are something you want to work for, so that's like the original. By the end though, it's mostly about dropping all those special abilities, and cover and shooting doesn't matter as much. Eh. The story is, surprisingly, not♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like, wow. What are the odds of that?  Maybe it was my low expectations but this one was a pleasant surprise. Anyway, it's on the humble bundle right now, so I reccommend it.			",63,15,0,7,5,0,6

												XCOM Declassified is a third-person shooter pleasant and able to give great satisfaction to skilled player thanks to the mechanics of managing agents who, in terms of gameplay experience, is able to distinguish the game from the competition and not enough to weigh a certain repetitive background. However, there are some flaws, starting with AI companions sometimes failed to arrive at a technical department not particularly optimized despite the look and feel of the game is not the highest level. But the fundamental point that does not allow the title to achieve a higher rating concerns the general sense of ""approximation"" that seems to affect the whole production. XCOM Declassified not have that little extra that can make it an inevitable game is enjoyable and fun to play but never fails to impress or to excel			",106,6,5,11,6,1,5

Vigilo ConfidoI got this game a while ago and never really played it. I remember being all into the marketing for it and thought it looked like it'd be really cool. Then all the reviews came pouring in and I feared I made a mistake picking it up so after playing the intro I just stopped. I ended up really enjoying it.Gameplay: If you're expecting a turn based strategy game, this is not it. If you enjoyed squad based combat similar to Mass Effect, here it is. I really liked the abilities, squadmate classes  and weapons even if they aren't as in depth as the later ME games. I personally didn't run into any issues running this game.Story: wise it's ok. Standard badass agent rescuing the world. Nothing phenominal although I did enjoy the world and the atmosphere of the game. Summary: The game took me about 10hrs to complete and I wouldn't recommend spending full price on it, but I had fun with it. It's just not a regular XCOM game.			",167,18,1,13,5,1,7

												X-Com for MonkeysThis may be a good game for those who drool over the UFO's, conspiracy theories, alternative histories as well as those who love the 50's and the 60s (even though they weren't even born then). This is not such a great game for everyone else.The game plays like a straight B movie, at best.It pains me that this game used the Unreal 3 engine instead of Mafia's II Ilusion engine, even though 2K Games owns the former. The differences are apparent and Mafia II came out 3 years ago. The game's facial animations are pretty lifeless, the lip sync is nonexistent, the anti-aliasing is somewhat noticeable, there are some texture pop-ins in the background in open levels, the fire/explosion effects are bad as well. It is ridiculous to still be playing with such graphics in Q3 2013, but at least the game allows you to get a 100 FOV which makes you see a enough of your surroundings,.The overall visuals resemble some sort of a grainy pallet, as if you are watching the game through the lens of the late 70's camera.Walking around the Xcom base is one of the best highlights of the game, at least it seems so at first. Once you soak in the fact that most AI models are pretty much lifeless the feeling wears off pretty fast.Unlike in the Enemy Unknown you will have opportunities to sneak up on enemies and be able to set up mini-ambushes, although your element of surprise won't last longer than 2 seconds, the enemy will always know where you are, and why shouldn't they? There is always only one approach to beating the level. The levels are linear although they do provide for some flexibility with cover. And this is the first game that I have seen (since Splinter Cell Conviction) that allows you to switch cover diagonally.The game loads the level as you progress - each time you open a door a new portion of the level loads while your character cautiously looks around, it's pretty clever.The game is moderately easy even on the hardest difficulty wherein your agents DO get permadeath, however you can always reload the checkpoint and start over. That kind of defeats the purpose of the Ironman feature that Enemy Uknown had. But then again, Enemy Uknown did not feature the main protagonist. Or maybe it makes little sense to compare the two games since they have been in a paralleldevelopment for quite some time. If anything, this game's combat is closer to Mass Effect than anything. You can heal your squad in an instant, you can pull enemies out of their cover, zap the enemy's shield, set up turrets, use drones, except somehow you manage to do so in mid-twentieth century America.The squad AI is so-so. Sometimes they are able to kill the enemy by themselves and sometimes they rush out into the battlefield and get knocked down and later bleed out if you don't rush into the hail of bullets yourself in order to try to save them - which kind of defeats the purpose of a smart squad especially when you are on the defensive - major minus. However, it does feel good when you send an enemy to outflank a turret while you get the turret's attention. Moments like that work in the Bureau's favor.Your squad mates are sure to run out of cover into the open when they are being flushed out with the grenades. And keeping them in line by rallying them to yourself does not work in the midst of the battle. However, all of this DOES push you forward to be decisive in your actions. Should you take a little too long to outsmart and outgun the enemy you are likely to lose a squad-made.As for the enemy AI, well, 90% of the time they expose their heads from out of cover - so sniper rifle is essential, even with its 15 bullet ammo capacity. So even on the hardest mode all you need is one head shot to kill a medium strength alien.There are a few things that bothered me. Some of the human tech you have from the beginning is way too advanced. Stealth? Automatic Squad Heal? Smart turrets? What's cool about the X-Com games is that you always faced overwhelming odds with realistic human tech at first - it's the way of the underdog. It's the challenge that counts. And that's what I expected to get from this game.The game did not do a good job of building up the tension. The prologue mission has you killing aliens left and right. Your character is a natural right away. Okay, he fought the Japanese and then some Vietnamese, but still...Sure there is a story: it tries to capture the step by step alien invasion across the US and has you traveling to various hot-spots and points of interest. Recruiting new soldiers doesn't cost a thing. So you may never run out of soldiers. What's nice is the constant dialogue between you and your squadmates - helps with immersion and everything.The game is, by all means, playable.B for effort.			",373,36,1,24,8,2,38

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a story about the struggles A Good Game encounters while it desperately tries to escape the clutches of its evil stepmother, A Bad Game.The Bureau is a tactical third person, cover based shooter that takes place during the 1960s in the United States.  You play as William Carter, an agent with the CIA, and command 2 other soldiers as you fight off an alien invasion.  The main draw of the tactical portion is the ""Battle Focus"" where you slow down time to give orders to your agents, executing movements and plans. There's some light RPG elements that accompany it, where you maintain a small roster of fellow agents and level them up, picking up abilities as they progress through the levels. Let's talk about the evil stepmother!Even when you ignore the XCOM stuff, the story is a mess (XCOM fans, read below, but spoilers beware).  It's very generic sc-fi stuff, but it suffers from some weird pacing and organization issues.  The characters have no personality to them, they're just scarecrows with voiceboxes.  Obviously, the bulk of the game is spent fighting, but even that has its issues.  The squad AI can act pretty wonky, and they require a fair bit of micromanagement.  Multiple times, especially towards the end of the game, I would watch one of my squadmembers try and fire at something below him and achieve nothing more than hammer the window ledge for a minute straight.  Enemy grenades are aplenty, and your squad members do a good job of diving out of the way, but this leads to issues whenever they dive into the corner right next to the grenade or decide to charge through enemy fire to get another piece of cover.  I was pretty active with assigning targets and using abilities, but in the beginning I was still scoring 95% of the kills myself.  As your agents advance through the ranks, they get more abilities which help them carry their own weight, but they don't become much handier with a gun.  The squad management stuff is also frustratingly vague- when you recruit a new agent, you can pick a background for them that gives some sort of passive bonus, but the game doesn't give any hard figures as to what it does.  You get a blurb, so maybe you'll get a vague idea of what the bonus confers, but sometimes you don't even get that.  This is also a problem with equipment.  Your agents get two pieces of equipment, a weapon and a backpack, and the backpack features a description of what it does but never gives hard values, and a lot of them seem to do the same thing.  For example, you'll find mulitple backpacks that reduce incoming damage, but a lot of these offer bonuses on top of reducing damage, but there's one backpack that only reduces damage.  Does it reduce more damage?  Who knows!All this aside, there is a shiny nugget of Good Game underneath it all.  There's a small bright spot in the story that probably lasts for about 20 minutes or so towards the end that was waaaaay more interesting than anything else that had happened so far, but then they decide to throw it away and keep on marching ahead.  The Battle Focus portion has some control issues, but overall I was really impressed with the way plans were executed.  The agent creation system was really interesting, as well, and it was a shame that it didn't offer much more depth or give you much of a reason to use more agents.  I'm convinced that there's good ideas sprinkled about the game like breadcrumbs, and if someone could follow it, there'd be something beautiful at the end.I still had fun with the game, despite a long list of complaints.  At its core, it's a solid, if unremarkable, third person cover shooter.  While I have no desire to ever replay the game, and I'm going to uninstall it after this, I certainly don't feel as it was a waste of my time.  I would never encourage something to buy it, but I'd never discourage someone from buying it, either.What I paid for it: 12.50What I would pay for it: 10.00Everything in the review is based off of playing it on Veteran difficulty.FOR XCOM FANS:As an XCOM title, the game fails miserably, both from a narrative and mechanical sense.  From a narrative sense, my first complaint is that XCOM is an international effort. I get that the game is a tie in, but I don't think I ever heard once the justification of why the organization is called XCOM.  The actual name of the organization is ""Bureau of Operations and Command"", and then they just start calling it XCOM.  There's also the timeline issue.  The game takes place in 1962, and during the course of the game you get all sorts of crazy, alien technology.  In 1999/2015, when the aliens come back, instead of just shipping over the technology/knowledge on how to beat them, I have to watch my Squaddies die brutal deaths all over the globe because the Air Force lost a Laser SMG in warehouse?  The Council only gets the barest of nods- if you have subtitles on, during the ending scene, someone with the name ""Councilman"" speaks.  Which, honestly, could just be a happy accident.Granted, a lot of this can be handwaved away with the word ""Spin-off"", which is fine.  They pretty obviously co-opted Sectoids into this, but if you were to remove them and all instances of the word XCOM, this would be unrecognizable as an XCOM title.  Which takes us to how the game fails XCOM mechanically.XCOM, for the most part, has been a game about overcoming insurmountable odds and crafting your own stories as you play through a game.  Yes, there may have been a Squaddie O'Malley in other people's games, but only your Squaddie O'Malley managed to kill two Chryssalids in a warehouse by himself before meeting his untimely end to panic induced friendly fire during the next mission.The Bureau strips all that out.  Between the fact that soldiers are incredibly hard to lose- once they go down, there's a bleed out period where they die if they're not revived but you have plenty of time to bring them up. Between that, and the game focusing on characters that already exist, you just don't care about your agents. I still know the name of the 6 soldiers who went on my last Temple Ship Assault, but I couldn't even tell you the name of one of my agents from the game.  They were just ""Level 5 Sniper I"" and ""Level 5 Engineer II"".  By removing any tension, and making the player character a tough, disaffected badass who growls more than talks, it just turns into a shootbang gallery where fancy special effects happen sometimes rather than a tense, careful advance against enemies who are far more powerful than you.If you came here for an XCOM title, I'd advise you to keep looking.

-Quick Review-You play this game as ""Agent Carter"", whom is tasked with the responsibility of trying to save the human race from a new global threat. The game takes place in the 1960's making the aesthetics and technology seen in this game very engaging and interesting. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  I don't want to spoil anything about the story, basically you play as ""Agent Carter"", you're a member of a top secret organization that was originally intended to fight against the Soviet Union in the 1960's but a new threat reveals itself and you've been called to save the whole human race.while the story sounds pretty sterio-typical ""save the humans, because you're a freaking super hero!"" there were some very interesting twists and turns in the story, I highly recommend at least one play through on the easiest difficulty to at least see how the story unwinds.Game Play: As has been the theme, I started playing this game the wrong way. This game is more like a ""turn based FPS"", because you go into ""strategy mode"" which puts everyone in slow motion, and you give orders to your agents to do various attacks.This is the first Xcom game I've played, but I've been told the games tend to be very strategy oriented, ergo this is actually a black sheep of the Xcom family. As far as black sheep go... I found myself enjoying the story. I've been trying to finish the hardest difficulty which has opened a whole new world of hurt, but that's not important right now.The game is put in a 3rd person shooter perspective, but you will need to rely on your NPC allies, by giving them orders... flanking, upgrading technology, and various other things to take into consideration. The game is far more challenging than one might initially let on.  Achievements: Basic achievement categories: Beat the game, Do this new thing ___ amount of times, Beat the game on the hardest difficulty, do this thing differently, buy our DLC to get 100% on your achievements.Yes, this game requires you to buy the DLC, which as always, is very disappointing to see. but maybe someday I'll return to this game to get the DLC. But at this point I intend to try the hardest difficulty, if I can't beat it I'll call it good and pack it away and move on to another game, but I digress.Price: The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is $19.99 I've spent 19 hours playing this game (10/11/14), I will probably put in about 5-6 more hours to beat the game again on the hardest difficulty (if I can make it), this game is worth its value, in my opinion. I got the game in a humble bundle, which I would recommend to anyone wanting to buy it, or at least wait for a steam sale of 50% or better. Conclusion: This game seems to be best played by someone who likes a mix of shooter and strategy. I found the game interesting and fun to play, but as I've said, to many who have played other Xcom games this is a black sheep.I recommend this game to someone who is looking to play a different styled shooter game. You could play through the game using your own shooting ability on the easiest difficulty if you wanted, the story itself will take only about 7-12 hours.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update December 30, 2014:Here's the URL to see my review for The Bureau: XCOM Hangar 6 R&D ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												If you haven't heard about this game, let me be the first to tell you that you aren't missing out. Do not buy it until it is on steam sale (which should be relatively soon at this rate). Here are a few reasons why I say this about The Bureau: XCOM Declassified: 1) The game is extremely buggy. I fell off the map into oblivion at least a dozen times for one reason or another. I even have a screenshot of it occurring and me simultaneously dying. Top this off with a few animation glitches, enemies not spawning or allowing you to progress, and you are setting yourself up for repeating some parts or entire battles in a mission. 2) It has an autosave feature only. No option like in XCOM: Enemies Unknown for what kind of save system you want. This is atrocious when mixed with all the bugs in the game aforementioned. 3) The game is disappointingly short. It took my crappy laptop longer to download the game than to actually play through it--and I completed every side/optional mission as well (My achievements are proof of that). 4) Your companions/troops are utterly useless to you. I have screenshots that show just how little they actually contribute to the mission. Hardly any kills, don't know how to use cover effectively, die too often, and literally run into grenades after avoiding them due to a slight time delay in their detonation. It is unbearably annoying, and doesn't improve as they level up. 5) After you get about halfway through the campaign, you just repeat the same tactics nonstop. This gets repetitive and detracts from the overall interest in the game. You defeat the enemies in the same methods over and over, and it doesn't leave you feeling like you accomplished anything truly. 6) Getting anywhere in the base is simply a pain in the ♥♥♥. You cannot sprint inside the giant labyrinth that is XCOM headquarters, so it takes forever to go from person to person to talk to anyone for missions. Also, there is a decontamination room in between the lab and the rest of the base. While this feature is neat to travel through the first couple of times, after about 30 times you start getting really agitated/impatient, really quick. 7) The storyline is not all that immersive for the player sadly enough. A few moral choices here and there, but in the end it is linear, monotonous, and unfulfilling. These are just a FEW of the issues I have had with this game. It was not worth the $45 that i paid for it, but I hope some of the other XCOM games I received with the pre-order bundle prove to be more worthwhile. I give this game a rating of ""an out of this world letdown"". This is mainly for all the hype it received, especially in comparison to its predecessor, and by definitely not meeting any of those expectations. Go play XCOM: Enemy Unknown instead--it has an expansion as well which will be a better investment for your money without a doubt.Edit: Since some people think I was/am ""too harsh"" in my review and believe all reviews or critiques must have positive aspects in them, I now need to make the following statement:If a game has a ridiculously overwhelming amount of negative aspects to it that far outweigh the scarce and miniscule amount of ""positive"" aspects within it, then they are simply not worth mentioning in a review. I played the entirety of this game to ensure readers that I make a THOROUGH review based on my impressions of the gameplay itself experienced firsthand. Most of the time my reviews tend to be positive even...however, this game was so insanely bad that I could not help but try to sway others to not waste their time like I did. Also considering I was one of the few people to pre-order this game based off of the beautiful game known as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I needed to make sure I got my $45 worth out of this atrocity, no matter how terrible it truly is and forever shall be. I hope you all enjoyed my review and I thank you for your time reading it and this comment :) Hopefully, you do not make the same mistake I did in purchasing this game at a high price.TL;DR: The game is incredibly bad. Do not purchase. Ever. Unless on steam sale (75% off or more only applies here). Do not feed them more money for it at full price. Hell, the Steam Store Score (triple alliteration ftw) for this game should give you an alert to how bad it truly is if nothing else...some people like it...but far more do not care for the game in comparison--and for good reason.

Played and enjoyed every minute of it.Long story short: Aliens attack Earth you need to stop them.Good parts:Nice graphics and detailed levels. The tactical combat is smooth and works well.Badass main character Clint Eastwood type.Captivating story with some cool twists.Good voice-acting.Bad parts-Your team-mates are like potatos when you don't give them commands.Overall bad AI.If you like sci-fi, aliens stuff buy it on a sale it's great.

												Oh wow, does this poor game have issues.It doesn't know what it wants to be, and it doesn't know who it's trying to appeal to.At its core, this is effectively Mass Effect, but set in a weird alternate 60s XCOM universe. As a Third Person Shooter, it's too derivative and rough to appeal to TPS fans on its own merit. As an XCOM game, it deviates too much from the XCOM canon and gameplay for it to have much appeal to die-hard XCOM fans either. Where it racks up credit is in its story... however, that isn't plain sailing either. Essentially a story about a secret war against an Alien invasion that took place in 1962, it covers your perspective as Agent William Carter, as he gets sucked in to the conflict and finds himself on the frontlines. While it starts off great, the dev's complete boner for setting the game in the 60s and the general confusion of whether this game is a prequel or an alternate reboot create a number of issues and inconsistencies that the devs didn't have either the time or the skills to iron out. For instance, the game makes a big deal out of the 60s paranoia, in this case about alien infiltration... but when your own character starts manifesting paranormal abilities like levitating opponents and healing critical injuries, no-one bats an eyelid. It's not even brought up. Later on, the game tries to claim XCOM managed to cover up a countrywide alien invasion - complete with kilometre-tall alien citadels and whole fleets of UFOs - with some radio operators, a couple of helicopters and a few good men. Yeah, sure thing.From a technical and gameplay standpoint, it's a bit shaky. Weapon balance and challenge is all over the place, with the game insisting on limiting your ammo and dropping aliens behind you. Level design and graphics aren't bad, but rough edges are everywhere - e.g. lip syncing is weird, with everyone looking like they're speaking through gritted teeth. So the story is a bit sketchy, it can't work out what it is, and plays like a beta version of Mass Effect 1. Why did I give it a thumbs up?Because it does an amazing job of translating the tense, creepy atmosphere of XCOM into a TPS. There are very few games that try to depict an alien invasion as an X-Files style approach, and this actually manages it. Some of the missions actually felt like they'd directly transplanted some of XCOM:Enemy Unknown's levels directly into a TPS. The game feels like it runs a checklist of X-Files-style sci-fi - alien viruses, abductions, gadgets, government agencies, saving the world, paranormal abilities - it's all here, and the devs clearly enjoyed themselves weaving everything together. Despite it's rough edges, the story is surprisingly good - you genuinely don't see some of the twists coming and the finale is pretty spectacular. About the worst I can say is that it deviates so much from the XCOM canon that it might as well be unrelated. Still, if you're generally a fan of sci-fi, it shouldn't be an issue.If you're a fan of Mass Effect, XCOM, and X-Files.... then consider grabbing this in a sale. Just don't expect an XCOM:Enemy Unknown prequel (even though it starts playing the EU theme at end cinematic).			",314,31,6,23,19,0,62

												Like a fair number of other games today XCOM Declassified is a case of the mistaken identity.  Bureau is a great game solid 3D person action with surprisingly deep tactical elements, great visuals, and nice (for the pulp genre) story.  The problem is the game has a lot more in common with Mass Effect than with XCom.  Combat, squad management, agent powers, level design... everything is patterned after Mass Effect.  Even story really - loose team-building part, replace Reapers with Outsiders, replace indoctrination with infection... few more similar changes... put the whole thing on 1960s Earth = Mass Effect Deja Vu.The bottom line, if you are looking for an XCom game - you might as well pass.  If Mass Effect streamlined for combat missions and set in 60s sounds interesting - the game is more than worth the price tag.Note: Keep in mind the game really is tactical, on anything but the easiest difficulty expect to spend more of your time commanding the squad than pulling a trigger.

												After sinking 30 hours into XCOM Declassified and beating the game, I can safely say STAY AWAY. The game is an unimaginitive chest-high wall simulator nothing like the tactics games I have come to know and love from the XCOM series. The main character is one of the most despisable characters I have been forced to play as. Not in a ""he's a♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; sort of way, in an ""I have no reason to like this guy or relate to him"" way. There are virtually no decisions to make, no tech tree to speak of, and your followers range from wildly incompetent to useless in combat. The only good mission is the final one and the game is simply not worth the timesink that you need to wade through in order to get to that point.DO NOT BUY.			",136,27,0,20,24,2,26

												Great game. I recommend playing at least once.PositivesI enjoyed the story, and the options available to you for character customization, build path, etc, are cool. I intend to play it again for the achievements. It reminded me a little of Mass Effect, which is one of it not my favourite game(s).NegativesThe combat is not fluid with the command system for controlling your team, and it seems clunky to me. I think it would have been better if designed as a standard FPS.That being said, it's interesting and if mastered you can do some awesome tactics not capable in other games, and pushes your strategic thinking up a level.ResultsNot the best game, but a good one; buy it on sale.

												The Bureau doesn't quite measure up to the other XCOM games. It's a tactical third person shooter that plays a lot like Mass Effect (although not as good) opposed to the classic XCOM turn-based style games. The story is a bit ridiculous, and it has a lot of graphical glitches and audio bugs while the core gameplay is still fairly fun.For a more indepth review, check out my video:

												MAKE SURE YOU PLAY THIS WITH A GAMEPAD.It's not a great game by any means, but it is definitely worth <$5.  Plays similar to Mass Effect with the wheel that you give orders to your 3-person squad with.Good stuff:- Enough limitation on ammo/cooldowns to not make you feel like a total superhero- Fun abilities for you and your squad to use- Excellent early 1960s environment (feels like Mad Men with sectoids)- Voice acting- Graphics- Cool weaponsBad stuff:- Incoherent storyline- Average level design- Not enough variation with enemies- Minimal customization for squad membersIf it didn't have the Xcom name, this game wouldn't have a bad reputation.  Most importantly, it is fun, even if it does not live up to the challenge you would expect from the series.  Think of it more like a Fallout Tactics than a Fallout 2.			",104,5,0,18,15,2,23

												I truly wanted to like this game.  After having played the excellent XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I had high hopes for this game.  The problem I have with this game is the squad AI.  It is terrible.  They just charge out to attack the aliens and get incapacitated repeatedly.  It is hard enough staying alive yourself without having to go rescue your ignorant squadmates.  It is like babysitting 3 year olds on the battlefield.  I issued them orders to stay in cover but like most 3 year olds, they start to wander into harms way.  The story seems okay, but it never truly engaged me.  There is no research to be done, which makes it feel more shallow than XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  The graphics are average to above average.  But the gameplay in battle was such a chore, I just quit playing.  Life is too short to waste playing a game that is not fun for you.  Just my 2 cents...			",188,30,0,36,11,0,39

												I wanted to give this game a chance. When i saw it being compared to mass effect i was intrigued, but ultimately i was left frustrated by gameplay mechanics that are at odds with each other. The Bureau wants you to use its squad command system so much, yet stacks all the odds against you by forcing you down a linear corridor of cramp combat areas with practically zero room to make any worthwhile tactical decisions. Even when you attempt to move your AI partners to flank an enemy, half the time they just get downed almost instantly by pinpoint accurate enemy fire. Add to that horrible weapons with small ammo capacity yet a LAUGHABLY abundant amount of ammo crates littered across the battlefield. The combat is just not fun in ANY way, shape, or form.It's a real shame because the story seemed to be pretty decent (minus the completely lifeless and uninteresting generic squad mates), but i just could not bring myself to push forward. I could forgive a game with solid and fun gameplay but a weak story, i would still have a fun time albeit with some regrets. This, however, is just a painful and frustrating experience.

												An atmospheric, fairly challenging, Third Person Shooter with Squad Elements.The 1960's art style & quite fun gameplay is worth a playthrough. Using the DiectX 11 mode, I was very impressed with the graphical quality.There are elements of making decisions and speaking to charactors with a very Bioware-Inspired (Mass Effect) choice system,During the game, you will always have 2 charactors following you in the field which you can command/send orders to at any time.Its quite an interesting spin on the Xcom formula.But sadly not worth the full price of $19.99, rather get it during a sale.To score it...Gamplay  - 7/10 Fun, but abit repetitive. Linear. Very little replayability.Story       - 5/10 so-and-so, a means to an end essentially. Audio       - 7/10 Good, no problems. Fits the 1960's Aesthetic.Graphics  - 8/10 You can see alot of work went into this, Really grabs you in.I only had one problem with the game, my Saves got corrupted halfway through the game.No matter what I did, I could not get it into a workable condition.Using a save that someone else made was my only resort.Just in case, I did a backup of my save each.and.every.time.

												I loved this game. No idea why it's getting such a low average rating.The gameplay is sorta like Mass Effect, just with less progression steps for leveling up the classes. The difficulty is a very nice challenge on max, with most checkpoints quite adequately placed to not annoy you if you have to retry segments.Story wise it is fantastic, with a great twist I will not spoil. It is not letting you affect the story too much, so that may at some point turn people off a bit, but if you get over your desire to control it, the story is awesome regardless.Play-through length is good, for completionist and max-difficulty runs it goes long enough to feel it is worth its price, while still giving you the option to skip some parts or lower difficulty so you can speedrun the others on replay runs if you feel like it. Replayability is not huge but still it gives you good reason to go at it a couple more times and still enjoy it. But again, I think it's worth it even for a single play-through.The DLC alternative campaign is a good addition as well.			",284,49,10,56,45,1,60

												As a long time XCOM fan, I was uncertain about the direction of The Bureau.  Here was a series that I loved with strong tactical strategy roots that had influenced the genre for nearly two decades... and it's newest release was going to be a third-person shooter.  I assumed that the game was a way to use the XCOM name to cash in on yet another Call of Duty clone.  Fast forward a couple of years and I realized that I was wrong.The XCOM 2 announcement got me hyped up on the series once again and I decided that instead of playing through another war in XCOM: Enemy Within (which would've been a blast, even if it were my billionth war) I would try something new and actually give The Bureau a go.  It was a good decision.The story in the game is enjoyable, though it gets a little weird and unexpectedly complicated toward the end.  Base building doesn't make an appearance in this game, however, there is an XCOM base where you spend your time in between missions and it is quite well done.  Different scenes play out as you wander through the base depending on events that you've experienced and choices that you've made.  For example, after defeating each new enemy type that you run across you can often see them being studied (in one way ot another) in your laboratory.Combat, the meat and potatoes of this game, is significantly more fun than I had been assuming.  You issue commands to your squad mates (who come in Recon, Engineer, Support, and Soldier varieties) which include utilizing the abilities that they possess.  These squaddies level up and gain new abilities on a skill tree exclusive to each class that is reminiscent of XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  Two agents of the same class could use their abilities in different ways.The feel of the combat itself reminds me of Mass Effect 2.  The cover system, the use of alien abilities (some which are very similar to biotics), and even the large variety of weapons to choose from in the game and their varying strengths and weaknesses.  However, it can not be overstated that the AI in this game is less than amazing.  You'll find yourself micromanaging your agents often as they can't seem to utilize themselves to be anywhere near as efficient as when you hold them by the hand and tell them what to do.  On a few occassions, I watched in horror as one of my agents moved away from an enemy grenade, only to realize that the best cover was were that grenade was and return to it to his imminent death.All in all, this is a good game with plenty to offer that I recommend to XCOM fans and shooter/RPG fans alike.  As long as you can get past the AI it is a solid game with around a couple of dozen hours of content if you're playing on a difficulty level that challenges you.			",622,155,2,165,79,3,130

												One of the most underrated game ever due to X-Com fans hating change. This is basically the Command and Conquer Renegade version of X-Com series.If you are into Agency/FBI like games you got to get this game. It is one of a kind. Not much games out there that is set like this one. Sure there is no stealth like Hitman series but, it is war.  You can say the same for Condemned series, but that is horror. I've seen far worst Agency like games than this, if anything it comes out on top of the list.Sure, there are a couple of issues with this game though. Here are some cons, but, they are very small.- Hold shift for running and cover at the same time can get you trap from running away from the wall(cannot be changed).- You need to press shift again to vault over.- Scanning is pointless in this game as there is no encyclopedia, even for DLCs to look back at for info. Other than that it is for a steam achievement for main game.- Hangar 6 DLC AK47 and Micro Wave Gun is not updated or cannot be accessed for Main storyline, they do not exists in the main story.There are some stuff you should know when you buy this game.a. There are no secrets to unlock, so don't bother scrolling around unless you want to read all the letters.b. ""Hangar 6"" DLC is a prequel to the game and should be played first before Main story.c. Code Breakers is an optional ""Operation"" that should be bought when discounted. It is just an extra mission for Main game(was a Pre-order DLC). Very Short.d. You cannot scan documents or letters.e. Do not buy Light Plasma Pistol DLC. I do believe one of the DLC's come with it. I don't remember how I got it. But I could access it in main game. I don't even have the Light Plasma Pistol DLC.f. You do not unlock anything at all for playing highest difficulty other than one steam achievement. As for DLC go ahead play Rookie mode and enjoy the story.There are also 4 endings for the Main Story line. So you can replay it 4 times or load back save checkpoint.			",150,13,10,23,18,2,41

												Personally I love the noir feeling of the game and how it takes place in the past rather than nowadays, or in the future. It isn't like the other XCOM games, which is a welcome change. I like the leveling up system, and that you can customize Carter and your squadmates, though more customization options would have been nice.The combat feels like Mass Effect, and has its own charm to it. I like the action mixed with having to use tactics. Battle focus is a neat thing as well if you want to know more about your enemies. Though sometimes the AI behavior can make combat a bit frustrating. It's pretty silly when I want to flank an enemy and I see my squadmate running towards me through the middle of the battlefield.The characters and missions are, to my mind, interesting. The information you get through the dialogues and documents adds lore to the XCOM universe. And I actually really enjoyed the main story. It had a neat twist. I liked the occasional choices you could make, even though they were quite insignificant, it did make some difference in a few aspects.I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of XCOM and doesn't mind the different approach!

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a vapid tactical TPP shooter.Unless you are a die hard XCOM fan, keep out.And even if you are, it'll most likely leave you dissatisfied.PROS:+ the setting+ little details(squaddies going on a smoke break if standing idle for a while, the protagonist's hat falling off his head when suffering major damage)+ the story has some cool twistsCONS:- the gameplay- imbalanced difficulty(once you get the hold of alien weaponry- the odds skyrocket in your favour)- very limited soldier customization- zero mission diversityI've completed the game for the sole reason of feeding my inner XCOM fanboy while waiting for the release of XCOM 2.The game starts slow and makes a horrible first impression.I couldn't resist the feeling that Declassified is suffering from a disturbing case of schizophrenia;not knowing whether it wants to be an action TPP title or a tactical cover-based shooter.It fails at both.Gotta admit- after pushing myself through the first 2 or 3 missions it started growing on me, mainly because of the awesome setting.However, it isn't enough to make The Bureau a good game.So much locked potential remaining.Would love to play a solid TPP XCOM shooter one day.""Never half♥♥♥♥♥two things. Whole♥♥♥♥♥one thing."" - Ron Swanson			",217,38,0,13,5,0,15

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is an interesting hybrid between a traditional third-person shooter and a strategic game, with elements of role-playing game; but the impression is a game crippled by a troubled production.It offers a glimpse in the history of XCOM through a tactical third person shooter, without becoming a simple mindless shooter. The Bureau requires a good amount of tactical thinking, which really makes it feel like a true XCOM game. Lack of strategy, however, might make the game less appealing to some XCOM fans, but the majority of players will revel in the tactical gameplay.The Bureau builds up adequately on a lot of ideas taken from XCOM. As a result it is entertaining and generally true to the XCOM canon but its potential is, more often than not, half-expressed. I like the fact that it forces teamwork, has a great atmosphere and solid graphics. The aliens tend to attack with various and difficult to kill forces from the beginning - that's good as well. Unfortunately later on the magic kind of disappears - the story becomes silly, fights get easier and the interface irritates more and more. But taking all things into consideration, The Bureau is a solid, well made game.Considering the game’s fraught development history and arguably ill-conceived premise, The Bureau is practically a best-case scenario.

												What a fantastic game.It's been a long time since I enjoyed a game more than this one. It's a great hybrid game where the ""action"" meets ""rts"" and it does a great great great job at it. There are quite some similarities with Mass Effect and Brothers in Arms playstyles.This game has everything you need:+Good graphics+Great voice acting+Amazing atmoshpere and world design+Ambient sound is top notch+Great story (I really really liked it. Liked how it unfolded, liked how it was told. Even when you start to think that you are at the very end - the game still continues with another twist in your face)+Game lenght. It's a decent ~12-15h long campaign (if you like to explore the world (even tho it's quite linear), do some side missions and so on).+Progression. In nearly every mission you will find some new gear to play with. That way everything stays fresh and the combat is always fun.+Enemy design. If you have played the other XCOM games, you will know what to expect, but it's very well done.+Difficulty. This game is not a cakewalk, especially at the very beginning. Prepare to get your whole squad killed at one point or another ^^ The only cons for me are:-A bit slow-paced at the very start. Especially, if you like to talk with every npc, read every note and so on - the early game might go on for ~2-4 hours. The very start of the game is probably the least fun (looking from the combat perspective, because you don't have many skills and perks and the guns doesn't do a lot of damage).-80% of the fights consist of: encounter several waves of smaller dudes, and then a big dude comes in to a play.This game is definitely underrated and I don't know why people give so many negative reviews about it. Just don't listen to them! This game is a gem if you enjoy 3rd person shooters or good games overall. Oh, and I didn't encounter a single bug throughout the whole playthrough.

												Extremely underrated squad based cover shooter. This was my sleeper hit of 2013. The story is a prequel to X-com Enemy Unknown and ties in directly to that game. Gameplay reminds me of Gears of War but with squad commands. I think this game got alot of hate because it was an Xcom shooter and many people wanted to hate it. There are also some lite rpg elements with leveling, squad choice and mini quests inbetween missions at the Xcom base.     Game isn't perfect, missions are very linear and disguised corridors, base stuff could have been better, story was alittle weak in the middle. The climax was amazing though both from a story perpective and gameplay.			",136,43,0,44,5,0,4

												Whoever says this game is bad is just angry it's not a strictly TPS game. The OG XCOM games were not FPS they were turned base. Is this turn based? No, it's just a different take on the games. You play as a man and run around shooting aliens. It's fun. What you do with your teammates is what you do in all the old XCOM games, you tell them where to go and who to shoot. I don't see why people are complaining so much about the game. I find it really really cool what they tried and did here. I would say it's worth it, go look at the humble bundle right now and get it or look for free keys in the discussions or a game key website.

												The Bureau is a rough diamond. It has many flaws but the thing it does right, it really does right. The weapons feel great, the tactics are deep and the story pulls you in with twists and turns. My only problem with the game is the friendly agents, they are very mediocre in combat and needs constant babysitting to function well. And most of the time the only two agents you will ever need is the soldier for his amazing taunt ability and the support for his support skills. If the game is on sale then i really recommend that you pick it up. Because it's not worth it at full price as it is a little on the short side, unless you're going for all achievements.

												The game's industry sure loves to have its titles go through development hell sometimes. Aliens: Colonial Marines suffered this fate when Gearbox decided to use resources for Aliens on Borderlands 2 after seeing how successful the first one was. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a similar story. This is a game which has exchanged hands within many internal 2K teams for half a decade while being put off to instead focus on Bioshock 2 after 2K saw how well the original Bioshock sold. However, unlike Sega’s sci-fi catastrophe, 2K’s sci-fi title is actually not horrible trash. In fact, it is very much playable. That being said, sometimes it is better to be trash quickly forgotten. It pains me to say that, after getting into the story and very much enjoying my time with the game, I cannot deny that The Bureau is still the very definition of mediocrity and deserves its 60% mixed Steam rating which I see as a “6/10”. For each moment I was enjoying this game, I was noticing a ton of wasted opportunity.  The story is pretty straight forward. Aliens from XCOM: Enemy Unknown have invaded in the 1960s instead of in present day. It is up to the player to lead a small squad of soldiers with unique abilities into heavily outnumbered situations and save humanity. The game’s cast is diverse enough to be interesting though they do very easily fall into overdone archetypes such as “hot-headed partner that shoots before he thinks”, and “commander that treats the mission with utmost importance”. Voice acting is good. The story of this game actually expands upon the lives and troubles of everyday people more than the other XCOM games do. The player will actively find notes and dialogue from people during various stages of the invasion and see how the aliens have ruined the lives of actual distinct people with their own small backstories which the player can choose to investigate, rather than generic NPC’s with no voice in the main strategy turn based games of the franchise that just get shot at the same way every time.However, those moments end up being merely window dressing or side show attractions for the otherwise extremely linear and generic (destroyed town, stereotypical high tech alien buildings, etc) levels in this 3rd person shooter. There really isn’t any interaction at all with everyday people you meet despite you seeing into their lives and one of the big themes of the game being about keeping the alien invasion a secret so that everyone on Earth doesn’t panic. In all the trailers and even the game’s cut scenes, the game emphasizes keeping the whole alien invasion under wraps while tricking the populace that it is in fact the communists which are attacking. Neat idea, horribly executed. Aside from people in the XCOM base mentioning efforts of spreading propaganda which you never see, and a few notes referencing it while on a mission, the idea is never expanded upon. So when the player sees whole towns destroyed by what are obviously extraterrestrials, the whole idea that XCOM is keeping everyone from finding out is ludicrous to say the least.Also speaking of protecting the entire Earth, aside from one potential Soviet (which doesn’t even end up mattering), literally every other character and member of your squad is American. One of the coolest parts of XCOM for me is the forming and growing of this elite global task force comprised of men and women from every country in the world. It made the conflict truly feel like I was fighting for the survival of the whole world and helped me differentiate between my various soldiers who all eventually became important characters in their own right in my XCOM Enemy Unknown/XCOM 2 playthroughs despite really just being randomly generated characters. For me heroes like specialist “Vapor” with her bandana and ranger “Athena” with her baseball cap from my XCOM2 playthrough will always be remembered.In this game on the other hand, everyone is a generic American. After going through the entire game with mostly the same soldiers, I can’t remember a single one’s name or even what they look like.  The original gameplay demo showed off in 2010 of this game showed off a first person shooter with investigation elements. The player was shown taking pictures and analyzing scenes of alien attacks. Sadly, there is no such gameplay element in this version of The Bureau. All you do is walk from point A to B killing all aliens in your path while the lab back in home base magically finds out how to use alien tech without any input from you at all. This kills off a lot of the progression in the other XCOM games which made the acquisition of new gear so rewarding. In this game you just find it on the field lying there for you to pick up without any prior knowledge or training on how to use the weapon.Now gunplay is just like your generic 3rd person shooter. The weaponry on offer honestly starts off very weak with just basic American guns of the 60s at your disposal. They don’t feel satisfying to shoot and don’t do that much damage. 50% of Steam players failed to beat the first level. That should be telling of how boring the gunplay is at first. However, if you stick at it, eventually you will gain access to alien weaponry, and those guns do feel much more powerful and rewarding to use (Even if they are just “alieny” laser versions of Earth weapons). The main meat of the gameplay is instead in the tactical mode where you can issue various commands to your squad mates such as moving to a specific location or using an ability at a target location such as putting a shield dome or a turret down. Some people find this to be gimmicky but I found that for the most part it works alright. For some reason the command marker moved like a regular unit so would be blocked by walls and stuff but that’s a minor annoyance. It was actually fun to micromanage all my units during heated battles, especially the later ones where a few mistakes can easily wipe your whole squad out.Now onto the main complaint of most people and why this game deserved to be “mixed” on Steam. Squad AI is not good. When playing on lower difficulties where you and your squad mates can still die very very easily, but will be ready to fight again after a simple co-op game style “push e for a few seconds to revive”, the bad AI isn’t too much of an annoyance. But on harder difficulties where a revive only stabilizes squad mates I honestly think the game is borderline impossible. With the AI constantly making your squad mates being open to enemy fire and there not being any option to let your squad mates auto their abilities, aka you must babysit them all the time, while enemies charge you in real time I don’t see anyone having fun playing the higher difficulties. In fact, I salute the 1.5% of players who were able to stomach the cancer such an experience would entail and beat the whole game. So then what is wrong with playing it on a lower difficulty? Simply that it ceases to be an XCOM game at that point and becomes more of a very very poor man’s Mass Effect. In fact, that is basically what I am trying to get at. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is an above average generic 3rd person shooter about aliens invading America, not all of Earth, in the 1960s. It is not a true XCOM game. I recommend it only during a sale for anyone looking for a fun 3rd person shooter that isn’t expecting too much. Die hard XCOM fans will probably enjoy the added lore (which doesn’t really make sense since wouldn’t the modern XCOM know of aliens if they invaded in the 60s) and hate everything else this game represents. Now that I look back at it. Yes, I did have fun. But I also recognize this game is just 2K milking the XCOM franchise.Also it runs fine on my R9 390x maxed out. But DirectX11 mode causes graphical flickering issues.			",642,168,18,57,56,10,122

												Suffering from a heavy case of casual and consolitis, the Bureau is the result of a lengthy development hell. A mediocre shooter for the masses that bears the X-COM name without including any of the things that makes X-COM, X-COM. Mainly that missing element is depth.Features have been either overly simplified or cut entirely to fit the forced mold of a 3rd person cover based shooter. So you have no base building, researching or resource management. Capturing aliens is now a plot point, alien weapons can be used as soon as they're found, soldiers have a generic pre-assigned personality stopping you from making up your own backgrounds for them, and so on. Squad size is now also limited to 3 and the main character can't die. The level progression is also screwed up which means the game gets easier as you progress. There's no tactic to anything, just spam everything you've got.So one wonders what was the point in making this game and calling it X-COM. You could argue that it's easier to move the game with brand recognition but I bet you the audience of this game doesn't even know or care what X-COM is. The Bureau was made by 2K Marin whose previous outing was Bioshock 2, a game set in the same time period, making alot of the assets feel reused aswell. The writing is mediocre and boring so I ended up skipping most of the dialoque as a result.The Bureau is the bad of Mass Effect and Bioshock rolled into one.			",211,12,2,11,4,0,10

The game does well with illustrating a mutual story with the protagonist  vs the antagonist i.e. the bad guys can be seen from a positive perspective instead of them just being savages. Overall the story has mystery and a few choices that make the game interesting enough to want to finish.gameplay: the game has a blend of strategy and cover to cover combat. Once you get used to it this happens to be a fun way to fight instead of just point and shoot. cool weapons and nice perks.elements: by elements i mean voice acting, AI, hud, and other somewhat significant aspects of the game I feel can make the game fun or awful. The Ai is pretty decent but your teammates can be ♥♥♥♥tards sometimes. voice acting is good at times and bad at times, nothing enough to make the game annoying. the HUD blends very well with the game and is easy to understand; it also fades so you can enjoy the graphics more.I enjoyed the game because the gameplay is interesting and fun, the campaign is good not great, snd it looks beautiful.

												The idea is great, the execution not so much :( I was quite hyped for this game, it looked the part but unfortunately it isn't. Having been poorly optimised to the point where I have quit playing until a patch surfaces (If it ever does, been 4 weeks without even a hint at an optimisation patch), this game is a shame. On my rig (i7 2600k, 8GB ram, GTX 670 OC) it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥running DX11 and PhysX along with another feature called Screen Space Reflections. Running in DX9 with SSR off and the game is much smoother but not quite there.Other then that it's not so bad, could be much better but until they fix the serious FPS issues then I can not recommend that you buy this.

												Is XCOM version of the Mass Effect good?Yes it is but could be even better. Graphic is really nice not best though,but doesn't feel like old game. Level design and envrioimental story-telling is simply amazing,there are story bits laying around the map so you can learn more about the game lore and each map is unique and fun to explore even though they are very linear. There is so many little details that wandering through your base after every mission always feels fresh.  Be it a simple npc chat or new props laying around, simply game feels more alive. Sounds and music are top tier, reloading is so satysfying with that ""bing"" if you know what i mean. Music is also very nice to hear. Animations in this game fluid and smooth. Its the first thing I always look at in the game, its animations of the characters. You can feel how your characters moves under the certain conditions, you can feel that *weight*. Story? Is not bad, it kept me entertrained through the entire gameplay, each character was memorable and interesing to talk to. And ending? Despite its missing a boss battle it was more satysfying with the multiple choices at the end. Not to mention that little secret which was really interesting and I didn't see that coming.Tactical gameplay? Yes there is and its not bad at all. AI respondds properly to your orders, use cover efficiently and is not stupid. There is a little too much of micromanaging later in game but it pays off if you are a good tactician. You have 5 classes, which 4 are only locked for your teammates and you can customize your 3man squad ( inlucding you and your own perk set ), there is definitely a lot of room for strategies. In my game I went with commando (aka tank) and engineer and I was suprised I was able to combine abillities several abillities together.For example Engineer was placing a turret, but enemy was behind the cover. I lifted the turret up ( thanks to your psy abillities ) and it could fire while floating in the air. I could also order a commando to *shield* the turret with his abillities to make my turret stay alive for a little bit longer.There is also a blind-shoot , where you can shoot blindly from behind the cover, and this is what XCOM EW could use. Blind shooting and combining several solider abillities together. Not to mention that when you issue orders , character talks and people respond to you. Its a small thing but I appreciate this kind of stuff. Games feels a little bit more alive.Now some minuses: This game would be even better if you could manage your base, yeah you are leader of the strike team not the base so it makes sense. But maybe in the next game . . .? AI companions are getting stuck sometimes.  Not many enemy variety, I was hoping to see some bugs  Some items felt useless, especialy backpacks. There is way too many of them and I endep up using only the first one from the beginning through my entire game. console-port feel, a slight but still clunky sometimes. But play fine with the mouse+keyb  A bit short for XCOM game? 15 hours? Its not bad but game could use more side-mission and improvent system for side-ops for your soldiers. FPS problems in certain areas and slow downs , and also phyX never worked for me because it was crashing my game always. Had to disable it entirely to play smoothly.Maybe this game was not worth at the premiere release but now? For few bucks? Definitely worth it, you can even replay it on the higher difficulties and try different setups/builds. Just don't buy DLC because they are useless.I would rate this game 7.5/10	 ",117,15,1,17,13,0,33

												Let me start by saying that I am *not* a ""purist"" when it comes to the XCOM franchise.  I didn't play the originals and only started playing XCOM when I played the initial reboot from 2013 (which is an amazing game).I looked at a number of the reviews of this game and saw a lot of anger about it that seem to sound off more about what it isn't rather than was it is.What it is not:-It's not the classic XCOM style of play.  Know this first.  Go in knowing that, and you're off to a good start.-It's not turn-basedWhat it is:-About the closest I can come to describing it is that it plays a lot like ""Mass Effect"" using the XCOM universe's storyline-It's a prequel to the classic XCOM games that occurs in the 1960's.-It's like ""Mad Men"" but with guns-It's third-person real time squad based combat.-It's a definite challengeThis game isn't as engaging as the 2013 XCOM reboot, but it's still a boatload of fun.  I haven't fully completed it at the time of writing this review, but I'm truly enjoying ""nibbling"" on it a couple of times a week.  I play a mission or two at a time, then come back to it later.I am using Xbox One controller with my PC configuration and this game makes excellent use of full controller capability.If you're a fan of Mass Effect style games and like the XCOM storyline, this game is a real gem to own.  Again...judge it for what it is, not what it isn't.-Hitman			",23,12,0,1,3,0,3

												Metacritic score (~67) is not that far off. Not impressed so far, although I'll update my recommendation if my opinion changes. It's not that the game is terrible, but it gives lots of hints about the game that it wishes it could be, but fails to be. And I think I would like THAT game more than I like this cover-based third-person real-time-strategy shooter hybrid that can't make up its mind on what it wants to be and ends up second rate at either.The things that the devs put a lot of effort and care into look/work great. Unfortunately, those things don't seem to encompass quite enough, and not in the most key areas. Examples: When you go into the AI-teammate command mode, time doesn't stop, it only slows down to something like 25% speed. The writing is... um, not the worst, but I'm bored of these people already and I only just met them. AI's kind of dumb early on, although supposedly later on in the game it stops feeling like escort missions and they actually hold their own.It's not without its good elements. I like the setting itself; care definitely went into that, if not necessarily the dialogue. Where it's not a dark corner with fog and darkness covering up the extremely flat and featureless textures in unimportant corners and other corner-cutting measures, the world looks decent. The promise of what it could be/could have been is still a significant part, however.It'd probably be a fun multiplayer co-op game, to be honest. Ditch the AI and just choose different classes and run through a campaign with 2-3 of your friends.			",269,56,18,26,30,2,48

												I was offered this game by a friend and didnt played it for like 2 months, but when i actually decided to play it, i was surprised at the quality of the game and the story around it. I like the team aspect of XCOM Declassified, you giving commands to your team and the fact that you actually need them to survive when things get ""hairy"".The story was pretty good and the dialogues and backstory on a lot of characters were refreshing to see, you can tell that they worked on it, instead of just relying on the action aspect of the game.The DLCs were kinda pointless, if you ask me, so i wouldnt recommend buying them at full price. Hangar 6 R&D is okay but the others are useless and dont really add a lot to your game experience.8/10. Buy the game and play it, you will enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Team 2K Marine has made a unique X-com series.They has tried to make new type x-com which contain 2 parts : action and strategy.But, What I can say is that's failed. The Bureau : XCOM Declassified has too focused for the one-way action.That means, This title of xcom franchise couldn't own something their best competitiveness.You can't find any fine kinds of charm what you has found from XCOM titles like managing ur forces, thinking for efficient battle etc.And one another very important thing is, even if this game wanted to focus action contents, it's not good enough if I or maybe you try to compare between this game and other action games.That's why 2K Marine has been dismissed by 2K,and why I don't want to recommand this game to you.

												The Bureau is third person tactical sci-fi shooter game, it is mix between '60s and bit of mass effect, although graphics and visuals are decent, gameplay wise it's badly exectuted which is shame. Story is way to short for this kinda of genre also DLC's can't even compensate the lenght of the game. Team management on battlefield is pain in d, the AI is way to stupid they can't handle them selves, just as soon they pop their heads out they get badly injured and yelling ""WE ARE SITTING DUCKS HERE!"", player constantly has to give orders in order to let them survive which is bulllshit, using abilities is what that devs didn't rethink before they actually implemented in game, i wonder if there were any beta testers but this idea is worst of them all so anyway enter battle mode by pressing (in my case it was ""SHIFT"") and pick something that you have to deploy for example towards the alliens, so picked ability should be easily to deploy right, just use mouse but NO! intead game thinks that it's person or character who is walking around thus you can't just simply deploy ability through objects and walls, you must avoid every object and every cover in order to deploy your damn ability which was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustration, what were they thinking.Overall, is The Bureau: XCOM Declassifed good enough to pick it up? Depends if you like tactical shooters and even if you do, wait for sale, story wise, it's good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-- Foreword - 3D VISION --First of all I have to clarify that I played The Bureau completely with NVidia's 3D vision and used a fix by the community to enhance the quality of it. If you do not know 3D vision check out NVidia's forum: https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/49/. What's the point of 3D vision? It changes the immersion you feel in a game. Characters are a bit outside of the screen and hallways in the game have a realistic deepth; that means it goes deep into your wall. It is like watching through your screen. It is something you have to check out yourself  as it is difficult to be explained. Do not make the mistake and compare it to 3D movies. The deepth and convergence is very different. It is more the kind of 3D you will see with the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive.-- Substance of the game --First of all, I have to admit that I needed quite some time to get into the mechanics. So I stopped playing the game after 4 hours when I first started it one and half years ago, knowing at this time however that I want to retry it again someday in the future.This weekend it was this day and I got hooked this time and played through it in three days.-- What are the pros and cons? --Pros: - Great atmospheric setting, great story, great characters, great voice-acting- Decent graphics with very good science fiction design- A great variety of coloufull lights- It's the 50s! Everyone in the game looks very classy- Rewarding and satisfying combat system - First playthrough around 20 hours- Replayability because of the combat system and different difficulties - Decent skill system- A lot short well-written readings within the game that give you some background information of the storyCons:- AI of your squad:-->Let me explain: it might not be a big issue if you play on easy but it is going to be very frustrating on the harder difficulties; actually it was also the AI of my fellow combattants that stopped me from playing the game the first time. If you have the feeling a combat is too demanding change the difficult settings. It is possible during every fight.-->What's the issue? The AI sometimes is just not holding cover correctly. The combat system is missing commands about what the AI should do at a specific place you move one of your two characters. Sometimes it would just be better for your squad members to stay in cover and let you do all the hard work. But they always decide to get out of the cover and shoot the enemies, but not going back to cover in time so they brutally injured.- Level-UP system finishes for your main character at level 10 and for your squad members at level 5 - I could imagine a Game+ with more levels and maybe even more variety in skills- Dispatch missions are good to level up but not really fun because there is no interaction whatsoever- Story in the beginning a bit confusing***==> Conclusion: very atmospheric real-time strategy shooter with issues in the AI. Combat system is easy to learn and difficult to master with some very frustrating moments. Unique game in design and story.==> Rating: 8/10 (without 3D vision 6.5/10)			",1026,208,30,60,71,3,60

												7 / 10. In short words: If you like XCOM:Enemy Unknown and it's former, ancient games, you won't like this.If not, you might like it.Beautiful graphics, but gameplay gets repetitive really quick, and the story stops getting interesting in the middle of the game. And the endings are letdowns. If it wasn't for a single good story part, I'd consider this 'wasted time'.There's no research or reverse engineering - which is what XCOM has been about since always. All you have to do is pick up enemy weapons and that's it. Nerd note: Remember that in XCOM, alien weapons are rigged to self-destruct if the owner dies, only rarely they fail to self-destruct. Also, they have DNA scanners, so the weapons cannot be immediatelly used by a race different than the one it's programmed for.Gameplay and dialog seems to have beem mimicked from Mass Effect, which would be a good thing if it didn't feel WAY too similar. XCOM base - which should be the most interactive and fun part of the game IMO - is just an interactive menu with sidequests, and nothing affects the game's ending. Even saving a fellow agent (which you can fail to do so) makes no impact in the game at all.The mix of FPS, squad management in the field and tactical combat is very fun, however. Unfortunately, it gets repetitive quickly. And your squadmates are, like the plot, expendable.For XCOM fans: while it IS fun to explore and see the XCOM universe in first person, you will feel tired and uninterested if you expect the same experience from other XCOM games.It is also very weird how quickly things go south for humanity and how everything seems to fall apart in days, in comparison to other XCOM games. You have to let that go to get any fun from it.			",149,23,1,25,35,1,25

Posted: July 11, 2014
												I've had a few friends in my time. Shocking, I know. And therefore, I'm well-acquainted with a certain type of friend. Let me paint a picture here. He's always had your back, always been there when you needed him, but he has a couple of really, really painfully annoying quirks. For instance, remember that time a fly entered your flat? He just wouldn't shut up about it. It's always something small, something minor, but he ensures you pay the closest attention to it, regardless of how meaningless it actually is.Well, today I made such a friend in The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Agent Carter is the kind of guy who's the first to let you know he won five bucks in the lottery, there's a strange car going by, or a slightly interesting sesame seed happens to be on his burger bun. How do I know this, you ask? Because that's the Bureau experience! Pass the 100th enemy craft in the past five minutes? Carter's right there, with an, erm, clever ""WHAT IS THIS THING?"" He always brings along two of his best friends who are personified in exactly the same way, fear not.""Biggles,"" I hear you cry. ""We get it. He's lame. But a character does not a game make! How can you possibly justify this negative review on one thing?""What a rude line of questioning! I found Carter unlikable from moment one, making, as I play through, it very hard for me to find him sympathetic enough to NOT walk him into enemy fire if only so he'll stop talking for one bloody second. But, okay. You want more complaints? Oh, I was picking out the mildest one and hoping this review could turn out somewhat nice.I suppose I do have one nice thing to say: the plot has a few mildly compelling elements.Erm, that's about it.Really? I have to do this? Fiiiine.Let's start with the most glaring sticking point: optimization. This game supposedly runs on Unreal Engine 3, which is a downright shame. I've never encountered an instance before where UE3 results in optimization this bad. It maxed out my reasonably high-end system despite looking like a 4-year-old console title. Even worse, despite this, it lags comparably to me on an early morning. I had to turn settings down considerably on a GTX 770 and hyperthreaded quad-core CPU to get the blasted game to stop stuttering. I could understand this if the title presented an interesting aesthetic or impressive visual fidelity, but it just... doesn't. It's going for 50s sci-fi, but missing the mark. A grain filter and some art deco font doesn't sell me on the concept, and that's all we have going here.The gameplay sadly doesn't make up for any of this. It's the most very boring and generic of shooters, masked by a faux-squad-strategy ""mode"". Sounds cool enough, sure, but it just doesn't work in practice. The game doesn't actually pause, rather slow down upon entering its ""command mode or whatever"", which means you're often left directing the game's AI to do tasks while you sit behind cover simply to avoid getting hit. Your own squadmates fail to take cover on their own, leading to a lot of stop-start gameplay, with no real payoff. Even worse, the enemy AI is as clever as your team. Nothing here provides a glimmer of interesting challenge.I simply can't recommend this game. I'll finish it, I'm stubborn like that, and this is very much a first impression, but I can't see this game lifting itself out of the rut it's so totally committed to burrowing. Whatever elements it introduces from this point, it will remain a buggy, poorly-optimized, generic shooter-with-a-gimmick. And to make matters wor-""WOAH, SOMEONE DIDN'T LIKE SOME GAME.""""WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?""""WHAT WENT WRONG?""OH SHUT IT, CARTERUPDATE 7/17:I did finish it. No, it didn't ever really get better.I enjoyed mildly the game's late plot twist. Though it was predictable, it was presented well.In the interest of not typing another 4 paragraphs of vitrol AS I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO DO, let's leave it at ""I didn't enjoy anything else, and the gameplay managed to get even worse.""

												This game doesn't appeal to classic XCOM fans and I can understand why; it's a 3rd person shooter with very limited mechanics and simplified gameplay. It has it's moments of ups and downs, I heavily recommend to avoid the hardest difficulty as it's not fun to blast alien faces off 15 times in a row without doing any kind of damage with a plasma launcher.

												Initially the gameplay of Bureau has almost nothing in common with the more popular XCOM games, but eventually as your character/squad levels and gains abilities it at least has a passing resemblance to the tactical combat part of XCOM.   Unfortunately, the base building and research focus strategy elements are completely gone.  Overall though I'd say this is a fun game, with the exception of the last couple of missions which are not only less polished than the rest of the game, but the story and character motivations start veering around wildly like a drunk playing Pokemon Go while driving.But if you're looking for a good third person shooter with an enjoyably cheesy story and acting and a dash of XCOM added in, then it's worth a buy, especially on sale.

												I so wanted this game to be good, I preordered and everything, but when it came out I was not greeted with a fun story or interesting one with solid gameplay. I was met with a boring story that felt cliched but not fun cliche,, you're working with 1950-1960s you can have so much fun with a story like this, but non is to be had.  4/10. for gameplay, what can I say it's ripped off ghost recon with less strategy and more overpowered abilities. once you get the team you like, you're never going back to anyone else. It plays like a third-person shooter with an ability to stop time and issue commands. it works just feels very bland. their is nothing new about the gameplay nothing extremely fun, the research is boring you find items in the field and you can now use them.. tada? the leveling system and skill trees are okay it's where you get the more enjoyable game mechanics, but after that it's a lot of boredom.  6/10. the graphics are alright? I really found nothing out standing or incredibly bad. 5/10the music is half bad, some is just bland and fades into the background with no significence while other parts are pretty good, we're not talking Doctor Who finale of a series good but pretty darn good.  6/10Replayability? what replayability? 2/10why haven't you mentioned X-com yet? ah well you see this is not Xcom, say it's Xcom but they removed too many core mecahnics of an Xcom game to feel like it is one. It takes place in the same universe but not the same dimension. overall I give this game a 4.5 it works, it exist you can play it but I don't know why you would want to.			",192,25,3,29,26,2,45

												A vapid, soulless ripoff of Mass Effect done extremely poorly, with the XCOM name slapped on it as if that's going to make it any better.The plot is completely ridiculous and is set up as some sort of prequel to the Firaxis XCOM games. Problem with that being that there are only token references to anything XCOM, with it becoming more and more obvious that it's a cynical cash-in the further into the game you get. Even if you remove the notion of it being an XCOM game entirely, the plot is absurd and extremely poorly-written, from the humans just ""somehow"" being able to hotwire alien doors down to the headdesk-inducing stupidity of the major plot twist. The main character is effectively ""Gruff Growly McGrowlson"" without any personality or noteworthy traits other than ""he's a grizzled veteran."" None of the other characters are interesting in any fashion, instead all being cardboard cutouts that exist purely to have NPC's around to move the plot forward.The AI, both friendly and enemy, is incredibly stupid. It's not at all uncommon for your guys to run directly into enemy fire, expose themselves entirely to said enemy fire even when sitting ""in cover,"" get stuck on things, and so on. You're constantly having to give them orders and engage healing just so they won't get themselves killed. Enemies aren't any better, though at least they throw grenades on occasion to try to flush you out.The shooting mechanics are functional at least, but they're nothing more than that. The weapons themselves aren't satisfying to use, and the shooting itself is just your normal cover-based shooting that you've seen in Gears of War or Mass Effect... just completely unrefined and unpolished.The game's riddled with glitches and other technical problems, some of which are hilariously nonsensical. For example: it's an NVIDIA-optimized game, yet turning on NVIDIA's PhysX functionality causes the game to crash every single time you try to play it, until you disable the feature. Tons of animations glitches, sound bugs, and so on pop up all the time. Sometimes entire lines of dialogue are missing entirely, as if they just couldn't be bothered to implement them due to time constraints or something.It should be noted that this game started life as an FPS. More specifically, it started off as something that looked like a really crappy version of BioShock, yet was eventually retooled into what we have now, which is a garbage Mass Effect ripoff. There's no creative drive here. No soul. It's just a game that was cobbled together to complete a contract and be a cynical cash-in on the series' popularity. Except, nobody wanted it. Fans of XCOM want more XCOM. They don't want this crap.Needless to say, the game is awful. Don't buy it. Don't even look at it. Just let it be forgotten, as it should've been in the first place. If this weren't branded as if it's an XCOM game, it would've been completely swept under the rug as ""just another crappy ripoff."" Let that be so.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												I tried to give it a chanceI honestly did. I went into it expecting a decent game that just used X-com names, and after all, it can't be worse than X-com Enforcer, now could it?Well, it can. Enforcer had its over the top, fast paced shooting with loads of weapons to amuse you. The Bureau has chest high walls to protect their chest high walls that you can sit behind.I only got about 3 hours in until I just plain could not play any more. With poor controls(Very obviously a console port that they didn't care enough about to make it work for PC), and absolutely awful AI. Several times have I seen the AI just run right into the open without any cover without any prompting whatsoever, and several more times did I wonder if the AI actually follows your commands or knows what end of their gun to point at the enemy. After some experimenting I found the answers to these questions.No, they do not know what end of their gun goes to the enemy, and they do not understand 'go sit in cover here so I can flank them' either. And speaking of flanking, you will need to do it. For the first few minutes I wondered why the aliens had titanium skulls, but then I realised a headshot and a torso shot are about the same. You get a flat damage bonus if you flank your opponent though. Good concept - but it just doesn't work with the braindead AI and clumsy controls. It isn't actually explained anywhere either, so unless you're quick to figure things out you'll blow all your ammo on an alien who is 'in cover' but still sticking most of his head and torso out for you to shoot(And deal nearly no damage because of this 'cover'), get frustrated, and quit.The story seemed interesting enough and I did want to see what was next, but I just can't justify spending more time on it than I already have. The story just can't carry the rest of the game and I can't really care enough to play further.Oh, and the glass physics were pretty good. It was nice to see parts of the glass shatter under fire without the whole window immediately collapsing. If only that attention to detail could have been spend on the rest of the game as well it may have been good			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												Note: To see this review in its true form (screenshots,formatting and such) go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/04/game-bureau-x-com-declassified.htmlThe Bureau: X-Com Declassified is a third person shooter/rpg that tries to mix Mass Effect and X-com in one package, the problem is it doesn't really do ether very good. in the game they try to have choices and real outcomes, but in the end they really don't do much. also the enemies are your standard ""invader"" kind of stuff, you know little green men, commanders that give shield upgrades, heaver troopers, big brutes, mechs, and really low HP suicide... blobs. where are the Thin men, the Chrysailids, or the cyber discs? or how about the alien cyborgs like in enemy unknown? my real big problem with the game is the fact that a lot of the weapons, buildings, and aircraft don't seem to be from the same universe as the Aliens in X-com: Enemy within and X-com: Enemy unknown. The player's character is annoying to say the least, his voice is the most generic ""im a bad♥♥♥♥♥gruff"" ever. they lines he says are cheesy and ridiculous. i seriously expected him to say something along the lines of ""I'm here to kick♥♥♥♥♥and chew bubble gum... and i'm all out of bubble gum"". and his back story? ""oh his wife and kid burned alive in a fire, and because of that he gets drunk, so yeah"".the Story its self is once again generic and pretty mild. ""go here, do this!"" oh and aliens! another thing it suffers from is the fact that a lot of it doesn't make sense. so the 1950 X-com didn't tell the 2013 X-com ""oh yeah, aliens? they exist. also they hate us."" why does the 2013 X-com know  nothing about what happened in 1950? why didn't the 1950 X-com give the 2013 X-com all the info they got in the field? also what the heck is with the zombies?!  there are no chrysalids to be found, so where did they come from? later on you learn that they are ""sleepers"", a zombie like human the aliens can control but then we are still left with the question, why? we see that with this they can put sleeper agents in the governments of the world, but why do it to random civilians that just become unaware of whats going on around them? what do they have to gain by doing that?  during the game your squad members will ""hot wire"" alien doors. how do they know how to do that? have they already fought aliens and know how to hot wire their doors? why is none of this explained? even if they burned everything related to the 1950 X-com how would they hide all of the destroyed towns? the huge craters? the sudden end of hundreds of family lines? in the beginning mission the top of a mountain is torn into chucks and floats above it surrounded in blue light, how could anybody NOT see that?game play itself is pretty annoying, almost all of it is hallway shooter kind of stuff, why not give us a more open-world? The fact that you can go into slow-mo and order your troops to do things gives it a little classic X-com feel, but in the end its like they didn't focus on the shooting game play, or the world. and that brings us to another problem, the World in this game. the world feels.... wasted. you know how Bioshock Infinite really made you feel like you where in a 1930s/40s world? with the Music and the surroundings? well this game has none of that. most the world is copy and paste, and the bits that aren't are covered in the stupid alien walls and buildings. and those things are 100% copy and paste. so in the end it makes a lot of the world feel like it was used over and over. to top it off there are invisible walls EVERYWHERE! ""oh you can't jump over the crack in road sir! its too damn high!"" one more thing, the weapons in this game sound and feel like pea-shooters none of them have that ""bang"" or ""high pitched crack"" to them. most people might not care about that but after coming from games like Battlefield 3,4 and Payday 2, it really is annoying.in a some-what hilarious outcome the game suffers from two of the annoying problems that Mass Effect had,  Your Choices in end they lead to a ""good"" or ""bad"" ending, thats its really, do this and you get a epic ending where lots of people live and everyone is happy, do the other and everyone dies... other choices don't feel like they changed much, and  guns magically appear in your hand during cutscenes, in the ME series we had the magic Avenger, in The Bureau: X-com Declassified we have the mighty M1-grand.in the end did any of us really expect a game that was killed and revived three times to be any good? didn't we learn from nuke-dukem? i feel like the game would be super epic if it was another turn-based game but set in the 50s. that would a great game. because this game is like taking Age of empires and turning it into a RPG/Third person game. and even if it was good the fans don't want a RPG or a third person game they want a X-com game! they want punishing turn-based gameplay. not this shooter crap.

												tl;drSo, I 100%'d this game for Achievements.  It would probably take me about 10 less hours, but idling in menus added a bit.  If you're going for achievs, this is an easy game to get them all in... The only other time I would suggest this game is if you're a HUGE fan of XCOM and you NEED the lore.  5/10Long ReviewAlright, this game is rough.  It's like the developers of Mass Effect wiped their♥♥♥♥♥with the extra funding they had from the ME series, and churned out a♥♥♥♥♥♥show of a game called The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.This.  Is.  Rough.  The worst part is, you can often times see the potential this game has.  It's a game that WANTS to be good, WANTS to be a fan service... But it falls flat so, so early.  The main character is a boring, rude, monotone agent who constantly bounces between ""caring"", and ""shut up, we have a job to do"".  His ""personality"" actually adds to the overall failure of this game, I feel.  The cover system is atrocious.  You are either super glued to your cover, or you can't get into cover, on a game solely based around Third-Person Cover Shooting.  Like I said, Mass Effect with a pennies worth of funding.  That gets really infuriating when you're on the highest difficulty and some of the enemies advance to flank you, and you're bashing the multitude of buttons to get off cover and nothing is happening.  The abilities are boring and unimagitive...  Once again, comparing to Mass Effect, they pretty much ripped off the abilities.  Lift, Pulse Wave, Weaken...  Jeeeeeeeeeeeez.  The guns are all boring, with little personality in each one.  I could beat the game using the M1911 pistol, to be honest, since it seems to deliver one hell of a headshot.  In fact, most of the guns feel like they do NOTHING.  You're tickling a Sectoid with your Scatter Laser.  wat.  Running around the HQ QUICKLY becomes tedious.  You have to run back and forth, back and forth, etc. etc.  Pros:XCOM LoreA nice ""old school"" feeling... They did somewhat decent on thatInteresting view into some of the aliensKilling an alien every now and then results in some funny physicsDecent graphics and audioCons:Terrible controlsBoring abilities and gunsTedious legwork in the HQSticky or repelling coverRepetitive gameplay to the maaaaaaaax.  Trying out new guns, new squaddies, or new ability combos don't add at to the experience at all.Go play XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, or any of the older XCOM's.  They'll probably offer the same lore in a different style, and they will actually be good.			",532,115,9,91,47,6,88

												Although the premise of the story is better than the execution, this game is no dud, but suffers from mixed reviews from those who would rather have had a ""proper"" X-Com title. It has a similar play style and abilities to Mass Effect, though with more emphasis on tactics. ",214,79,2,23,35,2,19

												Short version: I quite enjoyed this game despite its mixed reviews; I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the XCOM franchise and third-person shooter games.Short, short version: Is good game.  You buy.Longer version: When I bought this game I went into it noting the 'Mixed' status and numerous less-than-enthusiastic reviews, thinking it to be one of those games I could ignore for a while and then install and play when I was bored enough.  In fact I played through a number of other games before getting to it.I was surprised to find it both engaging and enjoyable.  A few people have said it has certain... similarities, shall we say, to the Mass Effect series and I'd have to agree.  It's a cover-based 3PS which involves a lot of hitting Space and going into slo-mo, issuing orders and flanking enemies.  It also has a radial conversation menu and various forms of pseudo-magical technology (most pertinently telekinesis and mind control).  Not only that but one of the squadmates' voices is done by Brandon Keener, who voiced Mass Effect's inestimable Garrus Vakarian (and he's not the only one; Courtenay Taylor, who voiced Angela Weaver in this game, also voiced Jack in the ME series - and there are plenty of others).  So that was nice.From a story perspective it has plenty of depth for what it is: a 60s themed alien invasion game.  This isn't Shakespeare and there's no point expecting it to be.  The whole story is based around giving you excuses to go out and shoot aliens and really, isn't that what you bought the game for?What the story doesn't have is complexity.  Don't bother looking for interpersonal nuances in this one because the conversation choices at most boil down to 'be nice' and 'be an a-hole,' with no difference in the outcome.You can't choose your character - or, at least, you can't at first.  You play through most of the game as Agent William Carter, a generic gravelly-voiced white dude with a tragic backstory who at least lacks stubble.  Later in the game you get to make a choice between playing for a little as one of three other characters but there's no character creation (or, for that matter, character development) in this one.The landscape is pleasing to me.  Sometimes you're in town, at other times you're in the middle of alien bases.  Sometimes it's both.  Wherever you are, though, the art style remains recognisably XCOM.  Running through alien architecture at eye level where normally you'd be directing a squad from above is definitely a novel approach.The UI is a little cumbersome at times but, having said that, I'm not entirely sure how I'd recommend the developers could have done it differently.  It works, it gets you through the game and it's not enough to drag you out of the game so hey, I could handle it.Mechanics are very simplfied in some ways - there is no research or XCOM base inventory, for example.  You pick up a weapon, you collect it for use by anyone in your squad who's trained to use that item type (anyone skilled in pistol use can wield a plasma pistol, for example, even if you've only ever picked up one of them).  There's no armour (though you can wear 'backpacks' and some of them do indeed reduce enemy damage).And this is the point: The Bureau is not like other games in the XCOM series and some people find that jarring.  If you want turn-based squad mechanics with research, base inventories and other stuff like that, go to a different XCOM game (or wait for XCOM2).  This is not what you're looking for.  This is something different.If, however, you're happy to play a 3PS game set in the same universe (if much earlier) with a story that doesn't require you to make notes on what choices you've made, this is a good one.

												I still believe that it is possible to make a good FPS themed X-COM game... and maybe someday, someone will actually do that.  This, on the other hand, is the poster-child for ""Cheap Console Port"" and the very definition of a ""Cash Grab.""It's pretty obvious that someone was working on a random cover-shooter game when someone from marketing came in said ""Hey, we just bought the rights to use the X-COM name!  So go and redo whatever you're working on to have some X-COM references in it, ok?""  In their frustration, the programmers then spent the last couple of months of development time spackling a thin veneer of X-COM over their product, rather than just finishing what they started and making sure it worked right.The end result was a this embarassing mess: Like the unfortunate cat from the Pepe Le Pew cartoons, this is very obviously a completely different game that got a quick stripe of X-COM painted over it's back and now the marketing skunks are trying to convince us that it's the real deal.Also, even a cursory look through the YouTube archieves shows a completely different game was originally planned - one that seemed far more interesting.  A game based on investigation, mystery, and uncovering secret plots.  Apparently that game got shelved, sadly, and instead they just pulled this game off the shelf and deceptively put it in the same box.Like I said, I'm not some ""tactical purist"" who thinks that an FPS X-COM is some kind of heresey.  I think it can be done.  I think it should be done.  Most of all, I believe that it can and should be done right.  Sadly, this game doesn't even come close to making the mark.  Maybe someday, someone will get it right.			",62,5,1,22,28,0,26

												I feel the critics have been overly harsh with this game. I just finished it, having put in about 9 hours into it, I think I did the majority of the side missions too. It's definitely not Enemy Unknown, but I enjoyed it non the less.The story was compelling, if a bit rushed in parts, and I wish they had incorporated some of the research and building aspects of Unknown but in the end I was completely happy with my purchase. The end of the game feels very rushed, and I would have liked a bit more diversity among my squad as I tended to use the same two every mission.Definitely worth a buy though, as long as your expectations are right.

												After the first couple of levels, I found the controls clunky and the default difficulty too high to be enjoyable. However, after dropping the difficulty and pushing on, I found this ultimately to be a very enjoyable game. Its definately worth a punt in the sale or a bundle, just don't be put off by the poor introduction and learning curve. There is a good game here and at least 16 hour of play in a single play through.			",331,73,14,30,15,4,42

												I've  had quite a story with the game. My first encounter with the series was with XCOM Enemy Unknown. I loved the game and universe. I never bought The Bureau game on the release since it got bad critical reviews and had known stability issues. Screenshots and trailers also didn't make it easy to understand how the game plays.I decided to give it a try since I really enjoyed my first experience with XCOM Enemy Unknown and I love the era they chosen for The Bureau.I was really disappointed because the game wouldn't run. At the time I didn't want to figure out why the game was closing just over the minute after the launch of campaign and made a refund.The last sale I decided to give the game another chance but only because I figured that most issues were ironed out. I was wrong. The game didn't want to play longer than 1 minute. This time I really wanted to play the game and decided to solve this issue.Hopefully people found a few solutions in forums I could try to make the game run. Basically what others discovered PhysX caused crashing in most cases but my game wasn't really crashing. It was closing after a minute. I didn't know why but I had a hunch. I remembered another game had similar issue. The problem was in anti-piracy software it used which was outdated and had conflicts with OS. I though I would give this idea a try and use unconventional way to playI ran the game and played for a few hours. It never closed on me. I can't say I was surprised. Seems like I figured it out right and the anti-piracy software was causing troubles. I must say that beside steam there is another layer of protection which is most likely caused the issue.Downside is that I couldn't track my play time and achievements with Steam which is really unfortunate since I paid for the game. But at least I could play it this time.The game itselft surpassed my expectations and I enjoyed it very much. I love the combat system in XCOM Enemy Unknown but with The Bureau you have a chance to play it almost real time and from first person and the story was good too! If you didn't rush and had all possible conversations, read notes and listed to various records the game really gives you an in-depth look into what happened in there.The graphics are very good and stylish for the era too. I especially loved forest and space missions. It was cool to see where XCOM took it roots from.The ending was very satisfying too. You even have a few choices how you want it to end. I tried a few just for fun to see the outcomes and wasn't disappointed.This is very good XCOM game from 1st person perspective with great elements of strategy and skill. I played it on maximum difficulty level and was challenged enough to make my victories satisfying. Never lost a soldier. Had quite a few desperate situations but now I have something to remember fondly.I would very much recommend the game. It's unfortunate that it still has technical issues but don't make it stop you from enjoying it. If you have any issues with the game just search or ask around the forums. There is definitely a solution.Have fun!			",282,142,1,33,7,0,24

												As of writing I'm only about 6 hours in but I feel compelled to write this review now while some impressions are fresh in my mind.Being a long time fan of the XCOM franchise I approached this game with a fair amount of skeptisism. It turns out that skeptisism was somewhat unwarranted. While I'm still not entirely sure if the game belongs in the franchise but it's more than capable of standing on it's own.Let's get deal with it's weaknesses first; of which it's biggest by far are the clunky controls. They make movement particularly during combat a bit of a gamble. Sometimes you can't get into cover, sometimes you can't get out, sometimes you just find yourself popping out of cover and not going anywhere. I can't help but feel this comes as a result of it's console affiliation. The sprint button is the same button used to take and leave cover. Moving around corners while in cover is not performed automatically like in most games, it requires it's own keypress. Another weakness appears to be the friendly AI; they're just not terribly bright. While they seem to know when a grenade is thrown and move away, at least first, they often just rush straight back to where they were _before_ the grenade has gone off! They require constant babysitting. Sometimes they'll stay where they're instructed to, other times they'll just go wherever they please. The enemy AI aren't Einsteins either - they have a tendancy to run back and forth between two cover positions - but they appear to be more capable than the friendlies. They actually move from grenades for a start, and are capable of flanking when possible.Now for what makes this game genuinely good. Firstly the outstanding visuals. The models, textures, lighting are brilliant. The levels are highly detailed making it feel like ones really in old 1960s America. The immersion is deepened by small touches like photos, audio reels, documents and notes, my favourite being ones that instruct folks to ask specific questions - like what sound does a dog make or where someone was when President Johnson was assassinated - to aid in identifying disguised aliens - because they aren't able to reproduce a ""woof"" sound and they have trouble with distinguishing Human names so won't know that President Johnson wasn't assasinated. It's the sort of thing one could imagine actually happening in such a scenario. Great little touch! The story itself while not all that original is told really well through discussions with NPCs and the documents and audio reels all over the place. You get fed the story in small chunks and the underlying mystery is slowly revealed. The sound is top notch and the voice acting isn't half bad either.The gameplay, now this is a bit a mixed bag. A key mechanic is the use of a ""Battle Focus"" mode which slows time to a crawl and allows you to issue orders to your squad. This is actually done extremely well. Moving a squadmate into cover shows the level of cover provided by that position - partial or full. Orders can be queued up for execution. They system works really well. Having said that I have a few qualms about it; I don't like the fact it just slows time down instead of pausing it altogether for example. At least it should be an option to do so. To use the main characters abilities you're required to execute them through the ""Battle Focus"" mode as well, you can't just push a button to do so. This is particuarly annoying when you want to heal your squad quickly, you have to open ""Battle Focus"", hover over the characters skill bar, click the skill or push the number associated with that skill. I would rather just be able to push the button. Back at base the player is given the choice of missions to run; the choice varies between storyline missions which must be completed at some point and side missions. Side missions are a great way to increase the XP of the player and his squad. And that brings me to another hit-and-miss part of the game; the RPG element. The player and his squad obtain XP through kills, XP translates into leveling up, leveling up translates into new skills and stats; the usual affair. That all works just fine. One can even customise their squads names and looks - a nice touch. What stands out though are the classes of squadies. Different classes afford different abilites on the battlefield. This works especially well and adds a fantastic dynamic to the game. Of course it's possible to specify the loadout of your squad but this is where I had a small issue; you get a selection of weapons which is all good and well, but nowhere are you told what damage the weapon does or what enemies it's affective against or anything. There is a shooting range provided at the base which I suppose one could aruge should be used for this but I'm not sure how accurate an assessment that would be. I would like to be told what range of damage I can expect and what distance it's effective over and if it's good for taking down shields or mechanical targets, that sort of thing.Overall, it's perfectly competent 3rd person tactical shooter set in a masterfully constructed world and set to an intriguing albeit unoriginal story. I would certainly recommend it.			",253,79,10,31,46,0,64

												Sneaking up and punching a Sectoid in the back of the head - 5/5 - would melee again.Wow - I overlooked this one on release, due to the bad press it received. So far, I'm impressed and the earlier reviews don't do it any justice.In a way I'm glad I did overlook it before because now I get the whole package for under £7!Had to retune the colours on my monitor for this one.It's not quite an XCOM/UFO game, but it is definitely part of the series - the atmosphere is good, with sense of time and place established throughout, although the dialogue and story are ""DC comic-level"". This is less than I was expecting. However - the story and dialogue improve a lot as the game progresses - it actually becomes pretty good and I am enjoying discovering the twists and turns of the plot as it unfolds.The gameplay has become easier (on veteran) and the missions ""shorter"". The only time I had to reload (2x) was for a ""mid-mission"" where the team were about level 3. That was the only frustrating challenge in the whole game. All the others have been legit ""hard"" battles and I've felt accomplished at scraping through, or that, ""ok I deserved to lose that one"" or whatever.The game feels as if Mafia II, Bioshock and XCOM were put into a gene splicer and shaken up a bit. Garnished with Alpha Protocol (although the ""dialogue decisions"" all lead to the same place).That's a good thing, IMO.It is one of the few games I've played lately where the cutscenes are of a lower quality than the game itself. They're not bad, but they're not good - the dialogue parts... I think they could've been a lot better. There doesn't appear to be any reason to give me a choice in many of the exchanges other than to hold my attention in an otherwise motionless and flat conversation - it means I get to push a button - and this distracts me from the disappearing-reappearing pistol and the fact my guy's arm is clipping through his body and the shotgun he's waving around looks glued onto the back of his hand...I can glitch some parts - through walls, escape the area, fall off things, have the ""troops"" appear in random places / teleport, and I keep wanting to cover against things in places I can't. It's possible to exploit a few things in order to gain an unfair advantage over the game. For some reason, my character occasionally is using weapons or waving a shotgun around like its a pistol - but that's only the cutscenes, as I've mentioned. The weapons themselves fell very ""cartoony"" and that's cool. This isn't Red Orchestra. I don't feel that I am doing anything other than playing a fun game with tense moments - it's not an immersive world like Portal 2, Dark Mod, RO, Long Dark or Deus Ex, etc... It's more along the lines of LA Noire or GTA kind of immersion. Easily broken and fallen back into, between chores or whatever.The voice acting - well... it's that one guy again. The guy from every Bethesda game among others... He must be the most worked-voice actor in the industry and I'm sick of his voice!!! He even voices two characters in a conversation in this game. Kinda sucks, but is forgivable. You'll recognise the voice when you hear it, I'm sure. He really annoys me now, because he's become a gaming cliché.Sound is otherwise excellent. Music is very good for the moment.I've found the pace to be pretty good. It matches the linear progression / corridor play of the game.During ""combat"" I've barely had to make any kills myself, and the ""planning"" phases generally have been 3-4x as long as the ""action"" phases.I've felt like a real badass when quickly devising a simple plan, having the team execute it exactly as I intended and the whole fight being over before I've even had a chance to aim my own weapon. That's a good team-tactics game, right there. There have been a few moments where I've just decided to speed things up by walking down the range with a shotgun, and that's also been very satisfying and much fun.I'm playing on Veteran, and I've only had to reload once, due to a control malfunction (wat is buttons i is noob?).Thinking of controls - the vibration in this game does not feel tied to what is going on at all. It's a little disconnected and I'm feeling that I want to turn it off as it separates me from the gameplay.The game follows the simple FFF tactics of games such as Brothers-in-Arms and Rainbow 6, etc... and the firefights feel like they have impact in the same way that Bioshock did. Much of the level and area design is a series of inter-woven corridors that zig-zag between areas with easy to reach flanks. The enemy is aggressive, reactive and are unrelenting in an ""army of two"" / ""gears of war"" way. That is, if they are alive long enough...I was wondering how the ""tactical"" side of the 3rd person shooter would manifest and I think they've done a great job with this ""focus"" system - it is easy to use and there's little room for error.Items are liberally scattered throughout - there's no need to conserve bullets or grenades so far, but exploration is very limited - there are not many things to investigate, but what there is... it's in-line with events and the characters have good banter.I'm finding it very enjoyable after the first few chapters and playing this game is making me want to quit my Deus Ex replay in order to play some of the old UFO/XCOM games again (esp. the new version of Enemy Unknown). I'll probably be playing this the whole weekend, might even get to finish it.Not sure about replayability, as it's like Mafia II in this way - not many different ways to tackle situations - however I think that I will replay this at least once or twice, as there are challenges and achievements to complete - plus some DLC missions to get into.There's definitely scope to ""meta-game"" - the liberal ammo and weapons everywhere mean that I forget to use grenades and I'm considering a run whereby I change weapons every time I see a new one. I'm at the end of the game now, and the last 50% has been the easiest part - I've veyr much enjoyed the ""progress"" through levels. Not lost a single agent, had to ""retry"" a mission on 2x when I got stuck without ammo in a particularly tough farmyard battle on a side-mission.Regardless - The Bureau is much better than I thought it was at release, going from the reviews and criticism it received - I'm enjoying it very much and it cost less than a gram of weed - definitely better than buying drugs.I like the fact that - when I take a smoke break - my character does too :)30 hours for an initial playthru is fairly decent. I think I've done and explored everything. The DLC I expect to add another hour or so. Plus a replay - that leads to anything up to 50 hours solid entertainment for less than £10, which is 50 pence per hour - that's very good value for money on any game, I think.Totally under-rated game.This one will definitely be keeping me up way past my bedtime this weekend.

												Welcome to my review of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified!In A Nutshell: Pros: -Fairly Interesting Plot: Very Film Noir meets Retro Sci-Fi Convention-Decent Graphics and Audio-Good Eye for Detail with the Retro Elements (Like dated phones and propaganda posters)-Micromanagement with Teammates (Could be a Con?)Cons:-Wonky Controls (No Crouch button? Really?)-Team Management is Mandatory (Mine died if left to their own devices all the time. Whoops.)-Too Many Gimmicks (Is this a Shooter? Sci-Fi RPG? Tactical Combat Film Noir? What?)Full Review:   The Bureau: XCOM Declassified feels like a video game that has tried to be too many things at once. Part Strategy title, part Shooter, with RPG elements, team management, Noir vs. Sci-Fi themes, tactical combat, and more. It’s all over the place, but unfortunately it doesn’t do any of these things exceptionally well – or even moderately well, at times. It’s a game I was extremely excited to try, but ultimately was left feeling disappointed; the team management system isn’t my forte, but I struggled more with the clunky controls than anything else. I couldn’t toggle a key binding for a crouch, so if I approached a barricade the wrong way I’d just stand there getting shot in the face – that’s poor tactics, man. The very definition! The storyline is fairly interesting, and it’s an odd mix of old Hollywood Noir with the Sci-Fi aspect so many modern games utilize. I really enjoyed the blend, and the subtle details in the landscape; not to mention the cinematic events, which tied in the story nicely, even if their frequency felt a bit tedious at times. All in all, I think other games blend Strategy, management, RPG elements, and the shooter genre better, but if you can nab this one on sale – at least if you love the idea of using wonky controls to yell at AI characters to get shot at – it might be worth adding to your library. Because of my neutral stance I'm going with a YES recommendation here, but with reservations.In Conclusion: 5/10 This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												Well the story is very short along with the game once you completed all the side missions and main quest there is not much todo no random events. the game makes me think its trying to be mass effect set in the 60s.			",360,191,5,64,54,4,58

												I'm surprised this game has so many negative reviews, since I enjoyed the game from start to finish.A lot of people stated that their squads are dimwits and always get killed, while they struggle with their own character to get to safety. This wasn't the case in my playthrough - I completed everything without a single agent killed. I suppose once you tailor your squad to YOUR playstyle, it will become much more managable. Sure, you have to micromanage your squad like all hell before the battle, but if you do things correctly, even the toughest battles are a breeze.....maybe I'm the 20% of people who actually enjoy the combat. Maybe.I suppose the negative criticism is also because some people are upset that this game isn't like Enemy Unknown. Sure, the game story/choices thing mirrors Mass Effect (there's even an ""I should go"" option), but the story itself, in my opinion, is enjoyable, even though it started to fizzle out in the end. Hell, even the combat system itself mirrors Mass Effect (crew placement-wise, pausable combat phase, etc).The sidequests are fun (though I can understant that it's sort of the same thing over and over again), and 60s atmosphere is great. The achievements aren't very hard to complete, though there are qute a number of missable ones. I recommend consulting a guide to single them out.			",62,9,0,12,3,2,5

												The idea of a 1962 XCOM is attractive, with Cold War technology and mindset to go with it.But unfortunately the gameplay is just too repetitive to stay interested beyond the first real mission. Although a lot of hard work went into many details, in its core it is a very simple and ultimately boring game. Move to the next cover fight, move to next cover fight, etc. but without the tactics and strategy that makes the XCOM series a success. I was left with the feeling that beyond the styling - which is pretty good - this is just a poor version of Brothers in Arms.In end even at the current discount I'd recommend to skip it.This is a sub USD 10,- gameActually you can miss it altogether...And I'm sorry to say so because there are so many nice late 50-ies early 60-ies details in this game, it must have been a labour of love for many involved, but it got lost in a  simple and boring game. Even the story cannot save it			",301,23,57,39,66,1,76

												This is a great game it is most similiar to Mass Effect in terms of play.  If you loved Mass effect gameplay then you will like this. A lot of the agent abilities are the same also. although you build that relationship with your squadmates like in mass Effect. The story was pretty solid and had a neat twist at the end. I enjoyed the idea of 1950s secret branch of government whos whole goal is to keep people unaware of the existance of aliens. I would have liked to have more opertives in the field or better customization of field agents like XCOM enemy unknown. The only thing similar to XCOM was the aliens and the way you use cover/abilites. Everthing else is different. Overall graphics were great.

												Story: 9/10Great start, Great twist, Great choice in endings. Not going to go too much into this because it would require spoilers. Let's just say the beginning is REALLY important to remember throughout the entire game. It's where the great twist towards the end started planting itself. Gameplay: 8/10A better experience than mass effect. Uses the same sort of control ( keyboard mouse/gamepad ) set up as Mass Effect franchise but it's more responsive and more action packed. Running is actually useful and you can do tight turns while running without the clunky stop and move turning mass effect had/s. Cover is useful here and needed. If you're not in cover you're dead, this isn't a run and gun. You NEED to tell your squad what to do. Management of your squad is your duty. This isn't made easy for you by having overpowered teammates. Flanking enemy entrenchments and positions is key to winning. Falling back and moving is the only way to survive being pinned down. If you've played XCOM: Enemy Unknown you'll be familiar with the systems in play here. I will say it is dumbed down at the beginning but the Infiltrator boss fight is when the game shows it's real design. Enemies do NOT run at you like idiots they take cover and try to get you to reveal yourself by dropping grenades and setting up flanking maneuvers. As you progress enemies get more aggressive, the shielded enemies have a tendancy of flanking your team and trying to strike from vantage points. Enemies with higher health are more likely to push and attack aggressively, while enemies with lower health pools tend to hang back in cover while pressuring flanks. Glitches: Not really a problem. I've seen a bunch of posts about this game being glitchy and in truth, I saw almost no glitches. I had 3 things happen that didn't really break the game. To fix them I just simply picked the ""reload checkpoint"" option in the pause menu. 1. There was a sound glitch where sounds were sort of cut off as they were fading out. making it sound like there was a stutter in dialog or just simply dialog, music, or battle sounds being cut prematurely. reload checkpoint fixed this. 2. Squad member got stuck inside of something while reviving. During a mission a squad member was stuck in a bookcase when he went to try to revive a squaddie and even though I was down a team member it didn't make a difference I still finished the fight and he immediately became ""unstuck"" and teleported out of the glitch on his own. 3. This one didn't cause me trouble but I did have to ""load a save"" that was a couple of minutes behind my progress. I just lost about 3 minutes of progress and it wasn't even in a firefight but right before a boss fight. These gates are supposed to close and the way into the fight arena is supposed to be closed off. Well I spawned in a checkpointed save INSIDE the rubble. There's AMPLE checkpoints in the game and I never found myself ""redo'ing"" an entire fight. Sound(track): 8/10There's not really much to say about it, everything fits, from the 1960's music in the quiet streets of an overrun town to the creepy alien noises and loud bangs everything fits. The guns later in the game sound really good. Crisp reloading sounds let you know what gun you're using. Every gun's reload sound is different, some pop, some crackle, some wind up. You'll know when a squad mate is pinned down and can't attack, they're constantly telling you about their situation ( I'm pinned down! Need healing! I'm about to go down commander! We're being flanked! ) or asking for orders. They'll also yell out what they're using so you always know what's on cooldown ( Turret out! Cloaking! ) Length: 5/10Unfortunately, this is where I am a bit disappointed. The game isn't that long to be honest. My first playthrough trying to do everything possible without outside help of any sort ( walkthrough, videos, wiki ) clocked in at 17 hours of gameplay. I didn't get ALL the base investigations but I'm pretty sure I got most of them, if anything I probably missed out on 1 or 2 at most adding something in the 15 to 20 minute range. This is the only thing that's disappointing about this game. Although all missions felt handcrafted and well made some weren't longer than 10 minutes ( side missions ) some more would have been nice.Closing this out, Yes I recommend it. The campaign was a blast with really awesome moments. Everything felt handcrafted not just another generic ""this is where you fight, this is where you walk"" sort of campaign. It was refreshing to play a game with such a different look at the genre. This game felt... Special. It's the only way I can describe it. The addition of the squad management was really a nice touch. Giving out the commands on what to attack and what skills to use made me feel useful in the game and didn't make me feel like I was along for the ride. All engagements were engaging and I had to participate in the positioning of my squad which made me think more about my next step instead of mindlessly shooting at enemies that were running at me.

												You are Gruff Mc Gruffington, the gruffiest agent to ever gruff in the sixties and lose his family in some freak fire accident.It's a squad based over-the-shoulder third person shooter in which you and 2 other agents of your choice with varying abilities and weaponry beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of hostile alien scum. With bullets. (AND LAZER BEAMS!)So you gruff around the environment from point to point, and so on, sometimes viewing various notes, documents, photos, and audio logs between fights.You can choose between a bunch of backpacks you find throughout the game which give you passive bonuses and make you look like a ghostbuster.The game looks pretty decent and doesn't seem to have many glitches, the main ones I found, besides hilarious physics, is sounds glitch out sometimes, and then theres the permanent nanomachines distortion anomaly at the bottom of my screen, I think the same thing happened inAlpha Protocol. Ha ha, oh Unreal Engine and your shenanigans.Your agent allies' AI is sometimes about as reliable as the Left 4 Dead 2 Survivor AI, so you will be cringing incredibly hard when you die for the 3rd time in a row waiting for your twitchy agent to revive you while Steroids Mc LaserTwat is busy murdering your other agent.You also gruff around in dialogue trees every now and then, where you got your several optional dialogue options, and then the ""Let's get the f*** on with this game"" option to the left.And that's about it. Gruff.And no, I haven't played any of the older XCOM games, however I imagine the dissapointment in long time fans is similar to how old fans of the Resident Evil series (myself included) were dissapointed when it started to derp somewhere around 4 and onwards (even know 4 is great and all, but them roots.)Definitely not a bad game, just damn annoying at times.So I guess give this a shot when it's on a good sale, if you're a fan of cover/squad based third person shooters/aliens/whatever.6.8/10			",472,122,7,72,33,5,42

												I was afraid to start this game because of the multifarious reviews and comments but after completing XCOM: Enemy Within a few times I decided to give it a try because it was in my library for ages. Don't expect a game similar to the turn-based tactical shooter XCOM games, it's a completely different game and to be honest it's in my opinion a weird decision to relate the game to the XCOM Universe. STILL, after playing a couple of hours I'm actually enjoying this game. It's challenging, different (in a good way) and once again your team mates can die in combat permanently. The story has a cool twist, interesting characters (the main character also looks and sounds alot like Charlie Sheen, which is actually a bonus for me!) and the combat system is very unique compared to other games in the same genre. I'm playing with a controller so I can't really comment on the consoleport issues altho i'm encountering some framerate issues from time to time but nothing that would disrupt the gameplay in a hard way. If you're in doubt check some gameplay videos, it's definitely not a game for everyone but surely a nice pickup for a couple of bucks.			",229,90,6,38,31,3,52

												Optimization issues aside, The Bureau is a great game with a great atmosphere. I enjoy snap-to-cover games and this is very much one of those. If you are looking for the same XCOM experience we know and love, look somewhere else though. This game is more like a total conversion of Gears of War than it is an XCOM game. Overall, fun to play but definitely wait for sale.			",199,30,6,37,17,1,45

I like that there is more action as opposed to the other games in the series. Don't get me wrong I love the XCOM games but something feels right when you make a hood shot not based on RNG and chance.

												I did not expect to enjoy this game. My first reaction to hearing about it was to scream, in Spoony's words, BETRAYAL! But to my surprise, I ended up really liking it.There's no doubt that this game could be so much more. It should be bigger, and more complex. Some of its ideas deserve fleshing out far more. Sometimes the plot skips ahead in ways it shouldn't. And yet... I was engrossed. I liked the characters, the style, the atmosphere; I liked the writing, too. In a way it felt much more human and engaging than XCOM: Enemy Unknown. (At least the German scientist made sense!)And the combat? What can I say, I thought it was a lot of fun. I could actually imagine playing a proper X-Com game in this style. To be perfectly honest, I think I enjoyed it more than its successful strategic sibling, but that's probably because I couldn't quite get into XCOM:EU's weird mix of detail and streamlining, which I know other people loved. (My personal favourite is X-Com: Apocalypse, so maybe I'm just weird.)It's almost certainly not a game for everyone, but it's not a disaster, either. If you're in the right mood, it's a very solid experience. I don't regret playing it.			",157,62,2,32,10,3,17

												Coming into The Bureau, I was expecting a mediocre experience at best. In my 10 hours spent with it I've learned I was wrong. So far the combat has been incredibly satisfying. Lifting a Sectoid into the air and ordering a Sniper to use a critical strike to blow its head clean off its shoulders feels incredibly fantastic. I don't know how they did it, but it feels (to me at least) like an XCOM game. Graphically, the game looks good. Not great, just good. I must admit, I had no idea that there was PhysX suport and I haven't used it yet. The story so far has been alright. Nothing truly spectacular, although it does keep me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who you can trust. Squad customization is not nearly as deep as it is in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but it's there. So in short, I'm enjoying my time with the game a great deal. If you enjoy XCOM and are looking for a diversion, then I highly recommend this game. If you've never played XCOM before, then I suggest starting with Enemy Unknown, not The Bureau, because c'mon, Enemy Unknown was awesome.			",263,61,17,25,22,2,42

												A third person Mass Effect interpretation of XCOM.  It uses a lot of the mechanics and lore from the Enemy Unknown relaunch.  Still not as good as the original.  No base building, research, or anything that you associate with XCOM games.  The missions are very linear.  There's not much variation you can really employ.  Lot of small touches to add to immersive experience if you want to explore them.  Some good visual effects, decent use of the Unreal engine.I reccomend it.  It's a fun game.  People obviously spent some time adding the details.			",94,30,0,29,29,0,28

It's the AI partners that ruin it, they're so damn helpless that the game is functionally a big escort mission...and we all know and love escort missions, don't we?I guess if you really love Mass Effect's cover-shooting gameplay, maybe you'll like this.

												I picked up this game on a steam sale, amid the lackluster reviews.  While the general concept of the game was good, the story and the replayability is seriously lacking. I was hoping for a first person take on the popular X-COM games of late. This game was too linear, and too short. Side missions were pointless. Tons of backpack upgrades, but for what? With a team of only 3, you're left with very few choices. If you're an X-COM fan and this is cheap, pick it up. If you're on the fence, wait until the next X-COM game or pick up the OTHER X-COM titles.			",135,7,0,10,7,0,11

												Was very excited for this game, but sadly, it flopped.  Hard.Overview :The Bureau is a TP squad based shooter and is 2K Marins verson for XCOM.  Originally in 2010 being a FPS with really nothing to do with the original games.  The Bureau now combines TPS and strategy elements together and tries to be somewhat similar to the X:COM people know and love.  The game is real time, but if you want to assign an order to a squad mate, it slows time down to a crawl, which is Marins way of giving some love to classic X;COM fans.  Similar to waht Bethesda did with FO:3 with VATS.Pros : -Pretty fun squad based third-person combat (when it works).  -Upgrade trees, while not amazing, are kind of fun to go through the first time.  -It does take some thinking when faced with many enemies in a high difficulty. -It has enemies from from classic X:COM such as Sectoids, Mutons, and Outisders, etc, while also adding new enemies to the mix, though not many. Cons : -Has annoying bugs, for example, when I play, if someone is talking and I look away from them, I can't hear their voice at all.  Even if I don't move away from them, but just look away.   -Now I don't know if this is a bug, or a result of being unfinished, but if you tell a squad mate to go somewhere, many times they will move away from where you told them to be.  Many times, this has ruined strategies I had planned out because they got killed or something and I couldn't do what I planned.  -it has weak♥♥♥♥♥graphics,  -character models look awkward -voice acting isn't complete trash, but isn't good by any means, - it has weak story telling.    Some other things to point out are the boss battles (in my opinion) were really lazy, the way you gain more weapons is just dumb, all you have to do is pick up an alien weapon, and then you have it for the game.  I liked X:COM EU's way of doing it where you actually had to research it and build it, THEN you get the weapon.Last words :I really wish they made this more like X:COM EU but with the TPS setting, but sadly, we got this.  This could have been amazing, but it really isn't worth $50 at all.  If you are okay with dealing with bugs and annoying design choices and you love TPS's, then maybe pick it up if you see it for like 30 bucks, MAYBEOverall, it's a weak, one time playthrough game with very little heart put into it.  Sad as 2K Marin made Bioshock 2 which I thought was a phenomenal game.  The DLC also sucks as well IMO, but I won't write another review just for that.I rate it a 4/10			",254,30,4,19,14,3,45

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified isn't everything it could have been, but it's not as bad as many have made it out to be. Taking the events in the game as standalone rather than a precursor to any of the other games helps. Where the game does shine is the freedom of choice you get compared to many other storyline/campaign rail shooters. It is however only towards the end of the game where gameplay choices start to open up. To get to that stage you have to deal with some repetitive gunplay and some mediocre controls. For example, the sprint/cover key is the same key, and cover seems to ""stick"" so you can't simply walk away from it. What ends up happening is when you intend to sprint past an obstacle you instead slam right into cover behind it, and then spend several seconds trying to get away from it. Many other games have done this a lot better.Your squadmates also have some serious dependency issues. They stick to your tail like glue, so when you try to flank an enemy while your squad has their attention, they instead give up their cover positions to chase you around. If you don't give them any direct orders for a few moments they tend to complain about it by saying ""We need orders!"". They do at least return fire without being told to.There is no research, new weapons are simply given to you as you progress. Given that at the start you're told that alien weapons self-destruct when their owner dies I was expecting a situation where you had to incapacitate an enemy and ""capture"" their weapon in order to get access to it and research it. This may have been the plan at some stage but it's been shelved. Now new weapons are strategically placed in certain spots in missions, and afterwards normal enemies drop them as well. The hardest choice you'll have to make is what weapons you want to start a mission with but there are so many around in a stage that you can easily switch to something else if you find ammo is short for the type you're carrying.There are two-ish skill trees for each of four classes. It's not really a tree as such but really just two lanes you can switch between whenever you want. Agents under your command tend to be rather generic so you never really form any kind of attachment to them.Overall I'm going to give it a thumbs up. Not worth full price but definitely worth a look on sale or if you were able to get it from the recent Humble 2k bundle.Happy gaming.AC			",217,49,11,27,25,3,63

												The Bureau is no good. Play it only if you love Satan and relish human suffering.Here is what I did not like:The story is incoherent: The idea is that you will appropriate alien technology and use it against them sounds cool, but how can you and your squadmates already use unexplainable powers against them from the tutorial mission? Why do the player's dialogue choices do absolutely nothing?Controls: Sluggish. In Gears of War and Mass Effect, having the 'dash' button being the same as the 'use cover' button was nice because the game understood what you were doing and wouldn't unnecessarily stick you to walls you weren't interested in. Not so in The Bureau.Poor Performance/optimization: My gtx 735, while not the most powerful card, should be able to handle this mediocre looking game without having to go to the lowest settings.AI: The pits.The squad AI is helpless beyond measure. They stand in the open unless told to find cover. They continue to get shot while in cover because they don't know when to shoot and when to stay down. While issuing orders, the game is not paused- only in slow motion. Your enemies are still shooting and moving while you do this. Most of your combat playtime will be in 'tactical mode.'This game was the preorder that made me decide to never do preorders again. ",173,26,4,26,18,2,39

												Full disclosure, I love the XCOM series.  I played the original UFO Enemy unknown for many hundreds of hours.  I also tend to find enjoyment in every game I play so pretty much all my reviews are positive ones.  This game was a great prequel to the series.  Really liked the 50's feel of it all.  The combat mechanics (being able to basically pause the action and give orders whenever) were a good mix of the old strategy with a FPS thrown in.  Every time I thought I could just run in guns blazing with no real thought to cover and playing to strengths vs. weaknesses I died.  I also enjoyed the readable stories thrown into the levels.  Made it feel a bit more fleshed out than just the spoken dialog provided.Some of the voices didn't really match up with the faces in some areas and some times things didn't have sound at all but overall I really enjoyed this one.

												I picked this game up on at around 4 buck sale for a 2k games weekend deal.  I can honestly say I am not disappointed one bit.  I can't believe the negative reviews this game is getting.  I love the time period that it represents; I always liked period pieces.  I have only played for 3 hours or more and can say the game mechanics are awesome.  I think people are expecting a turn based strategy game like most X-com titles, but this one is different.  It has some of those elements, but it has this combat system that you can give orders in slow motion to your team mates.  It's also from a third person perspective.  As some of the reviews have said it reminds you of Mass Effect.  It has a pretty good narrative going throughout the game, you make choices as to what you want to say just like Mass Effect.  I think what was most disappointing for the other X-com fans was it not being turn based.  If you can get away from the traditional X-com game idea you might enjoy this title.  I have not played enough of the game as of yet to determine if the story is any good.  The main character that you play is an WWII vet that joined the CIA and suffers a major loss in his life.  One of the things I would have liked to have seen is just like Mass effect, to be able to customize the main character.  You can by the way, customize your team, change their names and what they wear just like X-com.  All in all it's a great bargain title, I probably wouldn't have spent full price on it when it first came out.  8/10			",74,3,1,5,19,0,48

												When this game was announced, i was really excited. I love XCOM a bunch. I was a bit disheartened when the game got lukewarm reviews at first, and only recently picked it up from the summer sale.The game wants to be two things at once, but doesn't do either very well. it tries to be a cover based shooter, but the controls are sticky and a bit awkward. It tries to be a strategy game, but your teammates die too quickly for the to make much of a difference. Not to mention that the last level is basically XCOM horde mode if you were on wave 100, 7 times.  ",181,37,1,12,7,0,12

												Generally a nice game, but having played all the other XCom games this one's story had tons of holes. If you take it for a shooter, all nice and good. Duck/run key combination sucks a lot, but you learn to cope with it.But do not question the why's in the story:Why do the ""legacy"" agents start with cooler gear than their predecesors many years later?Why are there so many hints/memo/audi recordings to find that change nothing?Why does Xcom forget about all the weapons they got here?

												I'm a huge fan of the X-COM franchise since the beginning and was very satisfied with the remake 2K published in 2012.When The Bureau was announced as part of this franchise and the first pics were shown, I couldn't wait to see its release. But several things (mainly the third-person-perspective and the combat mechanism) kept me from buying it then.But thanks to the latest summer sale I decided to buy it and all of its DLC.Easy part first: the DLCs aren't worth it. One gives you an extra alien weapon, one gives you a short extra mission and the Hangar 6 R&D gives you a bit of a pre-story to the main game and some new - only (!) in that DLC available - weapons to fight through some simple 'survival' levels.A bit complicated is the main game. While in many other cases I have problems with the third-person-perspective, it worked well in this game. Also the combat system is working good and most time satisfying, but way to simple to fullfill the tactical needs of an old X-COM veteran.The graphic, the sounds and the characters really helps to create the right atmosphere for the game and also the different settings for the missions making it fun to play, even with a too much repetitive gameplay. And that gameplay is also the biggest issue of the game. You walk trhough the 'tunnel' maps knowing nothing will happen, until you come to a 'battlefield' (easily identified thanks to the huge amount of cover for your men and the aliens), where you fight some waves of enemies and then continue to the next 'battlefield'.The only thing that keeps me playing was the story, which had some weird twist and gets very unsatisfying in the end. But for me, the game was worth money and I didn't regret it any minute to have bought it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												XCOM : enemy unknown turns into a real time third person shooter strategy game. This game puts seemingly difficult RTS commands and simplifies them just enough to make the game play as smooth as possible.XCOM is known for it's suspenseful cinematics and storyline incorporating an unknown attacking alien species. The story unfolds with special agent Carter who rendez-vous with other members of the ""Bureau"" aka people who deal with alien affairs. He attempts to deliver a package to a general then suddenly the general is shot by another agent. Shocked, Carter quickly turns to the other agent ready to take action when she quickly points out the change in eyes and behavior of the general who was under alien mind control. XCOM fans will be familiar to the play area as it will give friendly reminders that you've sort of been here before. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling going from an RTS view to first person. The grid system sort of is there, but the command system is absolutely on point. By holding B (on a 360 controller), a command menu opens up and slow down times slightly as you make a selection of what to do. Player can choose from numerous actions such as move, pin down, and shoot while certain characters have specialized abilities (that can be unlocked by gaining experience). One character, for example has the ability to set up an auto turret while another can scope enemies with his sniper. The game is nothing short of exciting when it comes to game play as there can be a lot going on. Some players will like this as you will need to quickly command your troops where to go while ensuring you're doing your part to keep the enemy suppressed. Nonetheless, the command system is quick and efficient in it's means. Players won't have a problem designating commands. The shooting itself is alright with nothing exceptionally special and there is an option to scatter/throw a grenade. Any game that has that as an addition is greatly welcomed. There is also a melee feature players can use which is basic at best. It would have been nice to see them incorporate ways to capture aliens and maybe somehow incorporate what they did with Enemy Unknown, that way maybe you could upgrade or change your melee weapon. Basic movements are all there as you can take cover, roll, jump, and sprint. Although a little stiff, it's nice they put it in. When finishing a mission players will find themselves in the XCOM base where they can sort of roam freely talking to NPC's or managing their staff. The player may recruit new soldiers and send them off to missions or take those soldiers with them on a mission. Graphics make me feel like I'm PC gaming back in 2008 but don't interfere with game play. Pause menus are nice and user friendly. People actually move their mouths while they speak in game which I found a neat feature. Sounds are appropriate but aren't varied. I'd like to hear more ping sounds come off when I fire at the enemies cover.Overall a good game and would highly recommend it for those who seek a FPS / RTS sort of hybrid. I support it for this reason but cannot guarantee everyone will be satisfied with it's shooting/action styles.RATING : 7.35/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots :  About to issue a command  Options I have within the command menu I'm in the back with my other two partners in which one of them set up a turret. I'm currently in the move command screen which is extremely flexible in telling your units where to go His mouth freakin' moves  ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												All things considered, The Bureau is a neat little strategy/shooter hybrid. It may not be XCOM or Mass Effect, but it does find its way somewhere in the middle and offers up a ridiculous story, interesting characters, and some really cool set pieces. Sure, it lacks a bit of polish here and there, but it is a ton of fun. 8.1/10.			",141,51,5,18,17,1,17

												Looking at the overall 'Mixed' rating of this game, you'd be forgiven for not buying it, but then again, you might also be making the wrong choice.  I'll explain.  The Bureau's play style is different from XCOM: Enemy Unknown, XCOM: Enemy Within and XCOM 2.  It's very similar to Mass Effect games in that you command where your squad members go and what they do.  It's a ""third person tactical shooter experience with strategy video game elements"" -Wikipedia.  One has to wonder if the developers were playing Mass Effect during its creation considering development began in 2006 and finally released in 2013.  To complete missions, you recruit agents from a list of different available classes, each with their own background training, and then take any two agents from your roster into the field with you.  As they gain field experience, agents unlock their special abilities known as perks.  At certain perk levels, you decide between specialisations.  Being a huge Mass Effect fan, this game brought a smile to my face.   It was a lot of fun and I couldn't stop playing it.  I finished the campaign in a week.  Questions you should ask yourself if you are considering buying this game are: Do you like alien technology?  Do you like special augmented abilities?  Do you like plasma, laser and lightning weaponry?  How about combo kills that are announced when successful?   Did you enjoy the Mass Effect series?  Do you like the genre of science-fiction?  Then you should play this game. I decided to buy The Bureau on a steam sale because I received my copy of XCOM 2 in the mail upon release from...an online store...and I like to play games in chronological story order.  I also bought XCOM: EW and EU from Steam as well and I'm looking forward to playing them next.  All of this, of course, is building up to play XCOM 2.    Additional thoughts and criticisms:  Graphics wise, the game is par for the course for a game released in 2013, which is to say they're good even by today's standards.  The XCOM base of operations is highly detailed, roomy and there are plenty of NPCs to converse with between missions.  Scattered throughout, are also files to read, pictures to view and audio tapes to listen too; all of which adds depth to the story.  The voice acting is good, but I found the voice of Agent Carter, the main character you play as, reminding me a little too much of Batman's voice.  It made me laugh at times and took me out of the story momentarily.  Of course, it could be due to the fact that agents seem to be smoking non-stop throughout the game. The other criticism I have is that there isn’t much of any ‘new game plus’ upon completion of the campaign, save for playing it over with different classes of agents.  Also, and unlike in Mass Effect, there aren’t choices you make that have consequences in the story line other than if you play on the hardest difficulty and one of your field agents die, they are dead permanently and you have to rely on your other agents to fill in and begin leveling up a new agent.  Final thoughts:I finished the game wanting more missions to play.  I think that’s a good thing.  It was fun to play and I recommend it, especially on a Steam sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An outstanding game with great visuals that really set the atmosphere for this ""Mars Attacks"" genre stryline. Game pley is along the lines of Mass Effect, use your squad mates to draw fire or cover you while you achieve the next objective. Played this once till the end with the xpansion pack and am going to do it all again as now I have a DX 11 enabled card to set all the visuals on MAX!! If you enjoy the Mass Effect type gameplay you will love this also, the realtime tactical side isn't turn based so if one plan isn't working you can try to recover and rethink your method, not a stratergy game like the original Xcom was if I'm not mistaken.Meta Critic Score is unfair IMO			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a true tragedy.At first the genius world building and the atmosphere capture you with a force field, especially if you are into the whole XCOM setting. Although they do quite a few things differently, you recognize all the parts effortlessly.Unfortunately, you soon are bound to realize, that the gaming parts are quite the letdown. The missions, although well set up, are just a much tighter Mass Effect shooting gallery.The shooting itself is very very unsatisfying. Has no impact, no class and no flow.Customiziation is nice enough, but very shallow.For a couple of bucks this is a nice enough romp for a few hours, nothing more. If you like the setting, go take the plunge, if not wait for a sale maybe.I had my fun, hence I recommend it, but they squandered the great opportunity they had with the genuine world they´ve build here...

The AI team mates are a waste of space that need too much handholding to be of use and even then will stand in the open and die for no good reason.

												This game gets a 5/10 at most and thats a generous score.  This game got a lot of flack with its release for not being similar to the other XCOM games and then was praised for its attempt at a different gameplay style so the reviews for this game seem to swing between ""this game is awful"" and ""this game is a hidden gem.""So let's take a look at both sides shall we?Declassified is a third person squad based combat game where you issue orders to your squad members who have specific classes and skills.  Unfortunately no matter what class your squadmates belong to they all share a similar characteristic between all of them, poo-brain.  Yes your squadmates have the worst case of poo-brain I have ever seen, its almost as if the brains from Futurama are invading Earth the same time the aliens are.Not only are your squadmates inheritly useless, the combat is very cut and dry and flanking seems to be non-existant when they drop boss mobs on you who will down any squadmate who decides he should run around for no reason, which is the biggest cause of stress in the game.  Your squadmates WILL NOT STAY IN COVER and need to be constantly ♥♥♥♥ing told to stay put or they will run around aimlessly getting downed. So as for gameplay the game is terrible as its a terrible version of Band of Brothers.Voice acting is okay however the lip sync looks awkward as hell.Graphics are fine if thats why you buy video games.The story is as good as good as it gets for XCOM games.THIS GAME IS ONLY FOR THOSE OF THE DIE HARD FANS OF THE XCOM FRANCHISE AND ARE WILLING TO PLAY THROUGH A CHORE IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE XCOM UNIVERSE.

												Do you like to babysit your teammates because all they do is get out of cover and position themselves IN FRONT OF THE ENEMY yelling ""I'm taking shot, what do I do?"" Then this game is for you, because this is all you'll do in the game. And to worsen things, those stupid ♥♥♥♥ers are mandatory.So, here's my experience with the game: I try to shoot stuff but can't, because I have to babysit my teammates. So, I babysit those♥♥♥♥♥♥♥instead of actually shooting stuff until I got bored of it - because your temammates are unable to take cover unless you tell them to do so. And when you place them in cover, they left it to run straight into the enemy and get massacred. Then *YOU* have to run straight into the enemy to save them. Boring.So I tried to left them behind (by ordering them to move to a very very very distant point out of the shooting) and play things solo. Worked well untill they decided to run back to me and ruin my fun. Really boringThen I went ""oh, ♥♥♥♥ it, I wanna shoot stuff"". So I decide to let them die because those fully grown up men need help even to clean their asses - and I don't take enjoyment on cleaning people's asses. It wasn't long till I had only 2 guys left besides me. And it wasn't even longer when one of them decided to commit suicide. ""Great"", I thought to meself, ""when the last guy decide to suicide I'll finally be able to play in peace!"" NOPE. As soon as there's only one guy and me, game prompts a message ""You have only one person on your squad, if he dies it's game over"" or something along those linesWait, what!? Now I'm the guy's mommy? And here I thought having kids were a choice...OK, then...so kids are not a choice and now I have one...*sigh*. Then I go into a mission  with only 50 bullets in my gun (plus 10 bullets on my sniper and a couple of grenades) against a giant robot-like thing shooting lasers everywhere...and my kid, of course. So I split my time between trying to kill the thing and keep my baby boy alive. And I was doind pretty well (guess I'm a fine mom), aliens were dying, baby was alive etc etc when BAMM! That ♥♥♥♥♥♥sonofa♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ihopeyousufferinhell idiot gets out of the cover I have nicely put him and RUN STRAIGHT INTO THE BIG ROBOT ENEMY WITH THE BIG DEADLY GUN!!! Game over.

												Feels like a disappointment, especially when compared to X-Com: Enemy Unknown. The controls are clunky. The maps are incredibly linear. The weapons and squadmates seem to have zero balance. The graphics feel really dated yet my comp is more overheated than when playing Crysis 3. The game just feels unpolished.*update*I just finished this and if this is an X-Com reboot, it is a horrible one. Its basically a 3rd person shooter with almost zero elements of RPG that the original X-Com was known for. As stated before the maps are incredibly linear, the other weapon options dont' show up until the end of the game, the story is slapped together with almost no believeability with multiple major and minor inconsistencies. The X-Com series is about capturing live aliens, researching their tech and building your own before their tech superiority overwhelms you but this game just seems to completely drop those aspects. It would have helped to plug the plotholes. The end is just complete stupid non-sensical garbage. It always makes me rage when writers get lazy and dumb down the main characters just for the sake of furthering the plot.			",85,8,0,12,2,0,15

												It pains me to say it but I find myself unable to recommend this game. If I had to sum it up in a single sentence, I would say this: ""So much potential with so little delivery."" The game's advertising campaign played it off as an ominous 60s' men in black (not the movies) style adventure, filled with espionage and intrigue. I expected to be redacting documents and cleaning up alien hot zones to conceal the truth from eyes not yet ready to know. Instead, what I got was a disassembled and badly reconstructed 'Mass Effect' (the first one) shoot-em-up with a thin 60s' veneer thrown on for good measure.I play games for the story more than anything else. The adventure. The experience. And while The Bureau has an intriguing overarching plot, what you experience quickly becomes a tangled mess of two dimensional characters, deus ex machinas and plot holes. In terms of whether or not you want to include it in the canon of Xcom itself, I would say: don't. It raises too many questions and leaves to many open boxes unchecked.Mechanically and in terms of gameplay, I was not overly disappointed. Though reminiscent many other similar squad based games, the Xcom influence and interesting take on a tactical overview was certainly a plus. Though my poor PC found the game stressful at the best of times, I was still able to get a relatively enjoyable experience out of it.All in all, it is a game with no personality but alright gameplay. As previously stated, so much potential. So little delivery. I would rate The Bureau a generous six out of ten.			",304,119,2,58,36,4,46

												This game is a little bit of a mixed bagOne one side you've got a very one dimensional gameplay feel a lot of the time where you end up doing the same thing over and over but the deeper you look the better the game actually gets. You can find little side missions by just looking around the main base which adds a very slight amount of things to do and the little notes and reports dotted around add to the story.The missions themselves are also mixed, the gameplay is actually pretty intense sometimes where you actually have to plan out what you want to do next and how you want to approach a level. This is good and the squad is a good idea, I get a similar attachment to my soldiers in the actual X-COM games. The friendly AI can be beyond stupid sometimes however and just move randomly without orders into enemy fire and create loads of problems.Going back to squads this is an element of the game I enjoy, being able to customise them (although limited) gives the soliders individuality and it's a small touch but changing their weapons and backpacks adds a little bit more strategy to an otherwise normal shooter.Overall the game's a bit generic in its gameplay but the styling is good and it certainly has its moments, I recommend this on sale to anyone who likes shooters and also the idea of the X-COM series. Maybe for someone who likes the look of X-COM but is intimidated by the strategy of that game.			",134,23,23,13,28,0,42

												I wish i could shove this game back up the publisher's♥♥♥♥♥♥ Or get my monies back. The gameplay lacks variety and combat therefor becomes very repetitive very fast. Don't let the trailers with flying sentry fool you, this is basically the only♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do.. either that or you hover the enemies out of their cover and shoot them.Also there is not much you can do with your characters. You have the backpack-tech thingie and take 2 weapons in field. On every encounter you waste all your bullets(who play games on normal anyway), but you rearm before your next battle and so on. Oh yeah btw friendly AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The design of american towns is neat and overall it looks really nice. But wait until you see the freaking insides of an alien ship and the diamond (freaking sectopod) shaped robot. The alien races look smooth and their technology looks like it was cut out of wood with an axe. This just does not work!Couldn't play through the game. Got bored.This game just sucks.. and they charge 40€ for this or something. Bought it on sale for 10€, but the game isn't worth 5€. Unlike XCOM. Which is sexy.			",203,15,7,30,19,3,35

												Firstly, The Bureau is similar to Mass Effect in terms of gameplay. I don't call it a ripoff because the storyline is different. I completed the game three times and still find it interesting.This is the game which explained the origin of XCOM. How they first encountered alien attackers and how XCOM was formed eventually. During the early years, technology was backward, hardly able to counter any alien threats; but with more captured aliens and re-engineering of the aliens' equipment, the tide was turned.If you love XCOM and Mass Effect's gameplay, you may want to try out this game. It's really not so bad, in my humble opinion.It's a 112% satisfaction, for me! Death to all alien threats!			",48,3,0,17,10,0,11

												Inept AI, consolitis, contrived level designed ruined what could have been a fun casual shooter.Positives:- Looks pretty nice.- Voice work very well done overall.- Decent/interesting story.Negatives:- Suffers greatly from consolitis: sprint, take/leave cover, jump obstacle and more toggled by a single button. This means you might just enter cover instead of sprinting, getting you killed.- AI which drives you up the wall, constantly running into fire and never hitting anything.- Limited command radius amplifies the above issue 10x.- Poor level design significantly limits options during fights.

												The Bureau – XCom Declassified was announced before XCom – Enemy Unknown and so – as many other all-time fans of the XCom/UFO-series - I was quite disappointed that 2K is going to make the sequel of one of the milestones of turn-based strategy games a shooter. With XCom – Enemy Unknown released and being a worthy successor to the series my initial rage faded away. So now that I don't have to treat The Bureau as a sequel but rather a spin-off, curiosity made me buy this title. And to my surprise I was quite pleased with the approach 2K took on the theme – at first.The XCom setting is transferred into the late 1950ies with the USA suffering from anti-communist paranoia. The first abductions, alien attacks and UFO sightings are misinterpreted as a soviet invasion by authorities. If you played any XCom titles you will get familiar with your enemies, weapons and abilities quickly. Also in the XCom-HQ, which you can roam and explore between field missions, you will find all the well-known departments like Engineering, R&D, Hangars and Infirmary. Merging the 1950ies with the XCom theme breathes new life into the franchise and works quite well. I liked to see my sniper wearing a vest and tie while aiming for a hostile commander or my Tech/Engineer wearing some ordinary janitor jumpsuit while blasting Sectoids into smithereens.During missions you control your own character and via the command interface, which significantly slows down the time and allows to scan the surroundings, you can issue orders to two additional agents. Even though it's a 3rd person view you will use well-known tactics you would use in the strategy games as hide and cover, flank the enemies and focus fire. Success heavily relies on the use of those tactics as well as yours and your agents special abilities like mind-control, critical strike and deploying additional equipment as turrets, mines and drones. So The Bureau actually is a tactical shooter and run and gun will get you killed.Unfortunately the game constantly prevents you from using these tactics. The missions are (as the whole game) heavily scripted and linear. Approaching a hostile encounter is always announced by a checkpoint save and a cliff, high boxes or another obstacle you have to jump off down into the battlearena. In the first half of the game these battlearenas are so small and the provided possibilities for cover so few, that you don't have much choice where to deploy agents and what tactics to use. In fact it feels like a longwinded tutorial.In the second half of the game the battlearenas get much larger and you have a lot of possibilities to flank enemies and can diversify your tactics. Unfortunately your character has a very restricted area of command. So I have my heavy gear guy flank the enemy on the right side while sending my sniper to a vantage point. But as soon as I move my character and any of my agents aren't covered by the area of command anymore, they start closing in to me ignoring any enemies or any order given beforehand.The poor technical optimization is the second major annoyance. Even though I have a decent gaming rig, I wasn't able to play with DX11 but had to turn down to DX9 and even then I had <30fps until I turned off the PhysX features. This game devours system resources without giving much back.But even more annoying than the above-mentioned are all the inconsistencies of the plot. You will find dialogues missing, making some answers given by NPCs meaningless. And despite the story has a nice twist in the later part of the game, you will feel there are parts missing and obviously the world and the plot were meant to be more fleshed out in the first place. At least the german voice acting is quite good.First playthrough ~20hrs.			",49,40,2,23,40,0,21

												It has a nice aesthetic. The Space Age is primed for this type of alien invasion story, flying saucers and all. It's also a functional third-person cover shooter.Too bad it was made by people who apparently don't know how games work. Outside of the poor optimization of the PC version, the game offers repetitive gameplay, generic mechanics and an ambitious ""commander"" system. In said system, the player can give orders on the battlefield to his two squad-mates, which range from basic ""kill that"" to some nifty tricks and alien tech. Unfortunately, in order to use this system efficiently, you need someone to design good maps and whoever designed this game's maps was high on that day.Bad enemy placements, terrible cover positions and an idiotic AI. For the most part, one can ignore the many faults if they choose to just immerse themselves in the 1960s setting; but then, the final mission comes. The final mission, which involves a large map, where cover is useless, where the stronger enemies can cover distance you can't via super-jumps and in which both shooting and planning are thrown out the window. It's a mayhem that throws the player off, a sensory overload that makes the experience anything from tedious, to absolutely, physically painful. There is hard and then there is unbalanced; this is what this game is. It's painfully clear that, in order to increase difficulty, the designers thought they'd just throw everything in, including the kitchen sink. It's telling that the stage plays practically the same regardless of Difficulty Level. Doesn't matter if you play on Easy or Hard; what hinders your progress is that you need to employ stiff controls to be constantly on the move while everything's shooting at you. It's a cover-based shooter that suddenly decides to undo its core mechanic. It's like playing Super Mario Bros and the devs suddenly deciding that you need to sneak up on Bowser and snuff his life out with a dagger, because it's a stealth game now. No planning, no strategizing, just sheer laziness.I guess you can still get the game on a sale; it's the type of title that's good enough for 2-5 bucks. I still wouldn't recommend it, though. It'sa game which, after the experience is over, you feel like you have wasted way too much time for little-to-no reward. No.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One thing you have to realize before buying. It's not Xcom.Yup that's right, the only thing Xcom about this are the aleins. It's not much as a strategy as Enemy Unkown, if anything it's a third person console shooter. CONSOLE shooter, you're not thinking only shooting. This game was MEANT for console, and that's what pisses me off. There are no pros to playing on PC as compared to console other than sales, I wouldn't say that the game is too overpriced though ($22 isn't bad, but it could be better). The controls are super awkward and not fun to play with (if you have a remote USE IT).All cons aside, this game is pretty good! It's fun, and lengthly (not as long as Xcom EU, but hey) it comes down to is the game fun? Hell yeah it's fun! I think the real reason why this has mixed reviews is that 2K slapped the word ""Xcom"" on the title, and that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥fans off. Just remember it's not Xcom, but it's not bad.I give it an 8/10			",48,2,0,3,1,0,3

												I've always liked the XCOM games but not to the point of obsession or lionization. That's why the initial negative hype before this came out never really phased me. In finally diggging into the meat of the game, I found something else - third-person tactical action in the vein of Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon, but with an environment that's personally a lot more appealing (especially as personal politics shifts to the point of not being able to enjoy Tom Clancy games for the subtext, but I digress).There's some excellent design choices here too, with the UI, the period sets, the characters (even though your starting mission characters look like three older John Cenas), and the Sectoids and Outsiders and related technology. Some Mass Effect aesthetic in the dialogue wheels and some of the specificities of the tactical layout is welcome as well. Overall, it's worth checking out, especially if you liked the Clancy tac-action games, Hidden & Dangerous, or SWAT 4 and want something similar that's just divorced enough from military tropes.

												The game is fun at first but after a while the gameplay becomes repetitive. The boss battles basically sum up to shoot, shoot, shoot, find another gun, shoot, shoot, shoot, dead. The customization of your squad is a nice touch but the ""skill sets"" you chose for each class are confusing and some of them overlap. The worst part is that the suspense of an ongoing alien attack performed by a highly advanced race decades ahead of you is killed when every level your killing whole platoons of aliens. On a positive note, a good time can be had playing this game, if you play in short bursts; the idea of this game is great but, this series wasn't the right game to impliment it with. It tries to stay true to XCOM while at the same time adding new game mechanics, the controls conflict with each other. Would I recommend this game? Yes. Would I buy it at full price? No.			",52,4,0,5,1,0,10

												So, let's ignore that this isn't an XCOM Game.  Let's ignore that there is no strategic overview, no internal economy, no research trees, manufacturing, UFO combat, or any continuity in the new XCOM EU universe.This game is, at its core, a bland cover shooter.  There are three hallways in this game that you fight in: Main Street USA, Rural USA, and Generic Gray-Blue Spaceship corridor.   Fighting in deep space, on an alien planet, or on an Earthbound Alien base?  Gray-Blue Corridor.  Travel 600 light years to an alien satellite?  Gray Blue Corridor.  Head into earth orbit on a spaceship that should really be called the Firestorm?  Gray-Blue Corridors.   That's all this game is - walk down a hallway, crouch behind cover, and shoot aliens while trying to keep your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI team mates alive.While it seems there is the potential for some deep tactical action in your engagements, the extremely short leashes that your teammates are kept on interferes with their ability to flank the enemy.  You can try to set up a recon agent to shoot from an elevated position, but if you move forward to get in range of your shotgun, the short leash that your teammates are on simply means they will move up to the front lines with you.When you boil it all down, the game is just dreadfully boring.  The combat gets old dreadfully fast when you have to spend most of your time just keeping your AI alive on the higher difficulties and outside of picking one of three ending narrations you get, no other choice you make throughout the game has ANY impact.

												It's quite a fun game and yeah, it totally nails the cool B-movie 50's aesthetic - it looks really pretty, too. I actually enjoy the story, and you get to even wander around the base and talk to people and meet some crazy scientists and help them with stuff. Really, if it hadn't had the XCOM name attached to it The Bureau would've been (aside from the preconceived 3rd person shooter notions that are wrong) pretty decently received. Because it's actually a nice game.Let me explain.The thing about The Bureau is that in order to enjoy any sort of victory, you'll HAVE to constantly be controlling your team mates. You can think of it in terms of babysitting (as some have who didn't like it) or you can treat the game as turn-based that happens to play out in near real-time (with pause).What I mean by that is that in a turn-based game you have to control each of your characters, telling them where to go and what to do each ""move"" instead of letting them do the Mass Effect thing of allowing them their own agency while occasionally ordering them to do a specific action. Also, this is not a game where you can hunker down behind a wall and peek out to snipe at enemies - anyone who tries that will get killed quick, you or your teammates (or the enemies). Always be moving.Because of the real-time(with pause) gameplay mixing with the third person shooter aesthetic it can be initially confusing to try and mesh the strategy of one with the mechanics of the other, but so far it's been pretty darn cool. And hard. Mutons are no joke; tactical withdrawls while trying to flank a giant armored, angry alien is kinda crazy - especially when other aliens are all up in my place, too. I won't even start with the sectopods.The battlefields are pretty nice, as well. They are large enough to allow you to actually flank or otherwise move around in order to get the drop on enemies (or the other way around, enemies occasionally try and get around you, too). Enemy AI is nothing to ooh and ahh over, but you generally have options in battle, which is nice, and it's usually a challenge.Just to reiterate, people want to play it like ME3 or Gears of War or some other third person shooter with some partner AI, while it should instead be played more like a legitimate strategic/tactical game where you're not a main character, but directly controlling all three on your team. If you rely on the partner AI to do anything for you strategically you're going to watch them fail and you're going to repeatedly lose - and then hate the game. You need to be treating it as a realtime w/ pause game of action chess or something to get anywhere with it. The gameplay might not be for you, and that's okay, but if you understand that it's not an ordinary third-person-shooter and you're okay with that, you're going to have a good time.

												Oh well,if you consider this game was doomed since its birth, for being a x-com FPS style it turned out actually...decent.i am very harsh on x-com since its my favorite game of all time and i played every little copycat, original and dumb game was made on it.So lets start : first, this isnt a x-com game, this is a game that would be a xcom and 2k took some crazy measures to save it.Its a mass effect like shooter with cool combats , sectoids, some mutons and else.If you take all aliens out and put idk...bananas in their place, would be the same game, but not an x-com.The plot is kinda cool, well done with little flaws....at mid-game you actually get the feeling of being part of xcom(just for a little, the game seems to do everything possible to destroy this feeling)Its kinda creepy and cool to see how x-com ""was born"" but like i said, its was a measure 2k took to justify this game.With a good plot, a so so ending, a good mechanic, good music(time music) but with a poor and mixed character development and squad play i would give this game a 9 IF instead of sectoids and mutons the game were called ""Aliens"" and space bananas invaded.But when you carry the x-com brand you must do a pretty amazing job, when you dont you get a mediocre 6.5 and thanks god this will be the only son of this line.but if you want play, considering the game...its cool and enjoyable.but not a xcom game.

												Positives: Wonderful setting, competent shooting mechanics, cool concept, beautiful art, functional music.Negatives: Frustrating AI, inconsistent characterisation, apparently baffling story (although I personally didn't get that far), an unlikable protagonist, other tiny problems with combat (described below).If you go into this expecting a game like Mass Effect rather than X-COM, you won't feel particularly cheated, but the gameplay just isn't as solid as a Mass Effect game.I wanted so badly to love this game - I loved the setting, I loved the concept, and I thought it was really wonderful that the developers were trying a bunch of new things. However, while this game isn't broken and it isn't terrible, there are just so many flaws that drag it into mediocre territory. After about 3 hours, I lost interest, and I simply wasn't having fun.The biggest thing that frustrated me was the inconsistent characterisation on display, especially from the protagonist. He's painted as a noir-like loose cannon that gets the job done, but this is just frustrating - he  bafflingly switches from treating characters with respect to ignoring orders just because, and seems seriously shaken up by the loss of a character he's just met despite being grumbly and disaffected about everything. It's as if the writers couldn't decide who they wanted him to be.I also have a few issues with the combat which were individually not deal-breakers but were frustrating when added together:- Control is often taken away from the player for unplayable cut-scenes which add absolutely nothing to the game- Weapons lack impact, many enemies take a frustrating amount of damage to put down- Combat scenes feel like they drag on too long consistently, additional spawning enemies feel frustrating- Because there is no crosshair outside of aiming, bringing up the sniper scope doesn't necessarily point it at the enemy you were looking at. Add this to the insane amounts of time between shots and for reloading the sniper rifle, and one of the most satisfying weapons becomes one of the most frustrating- Cover mechanics more complicated than they need to be when it comes to rounding corners or leaving cover- Team mate AI is often bad. Engineers stand in front of their own turrets taking damage without moving. Your squadmates mindlessly hang around detonating mines. And they never seem to do any damage - they seem to fulfill more of a babysitting role. I understand that this is to make the player feel empowered but I'd at least like my team of crack professionals to be competent!The tone of the game switches frequently - an audio log found in a university plays a professor reproaching his assistant for 'not following his intuition and relying on evidence'. Because that's what being a scientist is like....? And I seriously have to question why an institution that's meant to be the best of the best is so full of 'loose cannons who don't play by the rules'. If this is meant to tie in to any sort of X-Com canon, I've never considered my squaddies in other games to be dismissed alcoholics or police with a criminal history. It's a pity that this little thought was put into the setting and characterisation because the artwork is convincing and consistently impressive.I would have loved for this game to be so much more. I'd pick it up on sale if the above issues don't bother you much. ",124,75,1,17,12,1,21

												This game is... problematic, to say the least.First off, it is NOT a terrible game; Gameplay functions as it should, bugs are rare, sound and music are solid as are the graphics for the most part.But the problems are that the story, aside from the few twists towards the end, is a generic alien invasion story that we have seen over and over. While other games with alien invasion stories try to put their own kind of spin or add flavor into execution that makes them worthwhile, this one follows a formula without any real intention of adding anything of its own.Characters are also a downside, they are just not interesting. Except one alien invader character who is, in the end, just not used in any interesting way. The final boss has a pretty cool voice, but that's about it.But my biggest axe to grind with this title, is in fact the title; why does it need to carry the X-Com franchise name? Considering it has zero elements from the source material; No base management, no real global defence, no strategy elements and the permanent death system is easily exploited and nullified because of its checkpoint save system.It could just as easily be its own game and not be measured and compared against its counterpart(s). Especially since before this one was released we got a genuine strategy X-com game, so this one is just... redundant. Yes, it was in production hell and we knew it would be released one day, but with all the delays and push backs, it is just disappointing that THIS is all they could come up with.It just has no real reason to exist.Shooting aliens in this game is fun, i will not deny that and in the beginning it does set up a very bleak, desperate setting to fight back an overwhelming invasion.Yet as the base becomes operational, that premise just does not live up to the pace that was set up at the beginning.The base itself too feels like its just there for window dressing.All in all, on basic mechanics and gameplay it does its job but on everything else it just falls flat.As an X-com fan, i would not recommend it.As a gamer, if you can get it cheap or as a rental, i would say check it out, who knows? you might find more things to like about it than i do.

												This game isnt the greatest of shooters and DO NOT bother with the DLC but its still on sale a fun game.Your AI team mates are pretty dumb, they'll get into cover themselves but have a habit of breaking cover, even when told to take cover in a certain spot, to run across open ground, forcing yourself to go and revive them when they go down.So the first few missions can be rather annyoing because of this, as you'll find yourself thinking, you might as well be alone hero.....but as the team level up and unlock skills, such as mines, turrets and sniping etc. They become alot more useful, esp later in game where you just get swapped by baddies and your issue special commands everytime the cooldown ends.The story so quite interesting, if abit predicatable and if you play just the major missions, is really short but is padded out by the minor missions, but actually by the end, I was ready for it to end. So I guess its just about the right left.On the whole, like I said, its not the best shooter out there, it does have its flaws, framerate being one of them, but esp on a sale price, its still a fun game and worth a go, esp if you like the XCOM universe, this one being set in the 60s rather than the present day that most of the other XCOM games are set.

A really amazing strategic sci-fi shooterFirst of all, I had this game in my library for a while now. I tried to play it atleast twice, but somehow it just never stuck me to the chair. And not so long ago, I gave it a longer try than the previous two, and after that, I couldn't put it down. Strategic shooter seems weird at first, was for me - maybe because its not that usual? - but you have to keep trying, and you will fall in love with it.As I browsed the store not so long ago, I noticed that this game have mixed ratings. The most usual negative reviewers say that the game crashes a lot, and the game is either hard or hard (clumsy) to control. Hell, I even saw a reviewer saying that this game have bad graphics. Don't listen to them, crashes were probably a thing back when this game got released, work perfectly now. Problems with the controls? Get used to it, problem fixed. Game's graphics is neat, just check the pictures linked to the store.About the game, the story is interesting. Stars with something impossible, then alien invasion comes right up. Yeah, you will probably feel the lack of explanation of the story at some point, but no worries, everything gets in its' place by the end. - I recommend the Hangar 6 R&D DLC as well, since it also gives you the light plasma pistol DLC too, plus, it tells you how the whole invasion started. - There are also some side quests on the base as well, which rewards you with extra missions.And this awesome story plays in the '60s. And if this wouldn't be enough, the alien enviroment, the alien planet every sci-fi thing they made is amazing. The whole universe of the game is very well done, really.You can choose from a variety of alien guns, what I kind of miss is the lack of human weapons. There are also lots of skill for the main character and your agents as well (4 agent type, each has its own skill/perk tree).The difficulty. You will probably find this game very hard even on normal, but if you get to know the basics, how to play, how to use the necessary tactics in the game, it will be a piece of cake. Although, commander difficulty can give you a challenge, you can easily overcome it on your second playthrough.I think this game definetly worth a try (or three, if you're just like me), if you're not convinced by the reviews or either the store page itself, wait for a sale.PROSAmazing sci-fi enviromentThe story is phenomenal, and the twist in it... oh boy.Playing in the good old '60sThis strategic combat system is super coolPretty good charactersThe main campaign containts 11-12 hoursCONSThere should be a bigger list of weapons and grenades.Replay value is low (you finish it twice, then you're done, maybe getting back to it in a few months)Overall: 9.5/10 ",151,57,2,20,17,2,16

												A consolified (read: dumbed down) entry in the XCOM series.Can only recommend for fans of the series who want to get in on the ""XCOM Origins"" Storyline and don't mind slogging through a wastelane of not giving a damn on the way.Levels are Final Fantasy 13-esque strings of corridors, an illusion of choice-of-action never really develops, and thus neither does immersion. I found myself far too often just holding sprint to reach the next blue marked button or yellow outlined door  (aka. plot point) without caring for my surroundings/the actual level at all.And even using the sprinting feature reaching the end of a corridor took far too long, making the game feel like a marathon simulator interspersed with interesting cutscenes. IMHO: Bad leveldesign. The controls and covermechanic also doesn't work half as well in third person as than it did in isometric, leading to some very frustrating deaths.Lastly, the main story was pretty slipshod, even measured against the other XCOM installments. There are several (read: too many) facepalming moments in the story, where the player has to wonder if this mankind is actually worth saving. The main character seems to suffer from severe mood swings, and the highly decorated woman-playing-a-man's-game turns out to be an unintentional comic relief character.If it weren't for the interesting backstory about the origins of XCOM I would've give 2/5, but even for a longtime fan of the series this game barely clears ""meh"" status.3/5			",248,70,7,45,21,0,46

												You know, I'm really surprised this has gotten such mediocre reviews. It's a solid sticky cover shooter with some squad tactics and RPG elements. The game's narrative has some clever reveals and consequential decisions. I'm 12 hours in and only now getting to the endgame. Based on what I'd heard it totally ambushed me as a solidly fun game.

Picture ""Mass Effect"" with a 60's theme and you will have a better idea of what to expect. Its really much better than the metacritic score, so give it a try			",112,32,1,18,13,0,20

												While this game has a somewhat poor reputation because of not being strategy game, it's still a solid third-person action game.  It's not the next Mass Effect, but is still worth playing if you like sci-fi and third-person shooters.The atmosphere is great: a 1960s setting mixing Cold War paranoia and mysterious alien forces. I found the story to be interesting.  It also manages to slip in a pleasing bit of gameplay and story integration. And, if nothing else, facing a Muton on foot has definitely given me a greater appreciation for what my soldiers in the main series do on a regular basis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: At the time of writing, I'm 6.1hrs in, and have up to the Laser SMGIf you forget the fact this carries the X-Com badge, and just want a shooter similar to Mass Effect (with AI Squad mates that have the lifespan of a gnat), but without any of the conversation depth, exploration, or moral choices, then it might be worth playing....However, it does have the X-Com badge, and it's the worse for it.   I can understand the enemies carrying a slightly different appearance (like a muton the size of a small pickup truck, or a Sectopod with a Sectoid in it), but unless there's some glorious retcon later in the plotline, there's absolutely no rationale for why your team (at a very low level) gets abilities like Group Heals, Shield Spheres, or the ability to.... telekinetically(?) Lift enemies and allies by waving your hand.    On top of that, one of the classes gets the ability to... summon?  an automated laser turret, yet another piece of tech that the ""real"" X-Com games never had.So, again, if they didn't call it X-Com, it might be okay...Except for the squad AI.    They have absolutely no sense of self-preservation, or peripheral vision.   I was playing on ""Commander"" (Maximum) difficulty, and had to lower it because the Squad would just do the most asinine things, causing them to be incapacitated, focusing more fire on me and causing my death as well.Couple examples that stick out.   1. We were both in cover behind a wall, sort of a bracket ( ] ) shape, with a gap in the middle.   I got taken out, and ordered him to revive me.   What'd they do?  Rather than take the one additional step to the side so they could run behind reasonable cover, they vaulted the wall, and made it about two steps before the enemy cut them down as well.2. I had positioned both squad members in a building that was gloriously defensible, Explicitly Moved them by the windows shooting at the enemies.   I Lifted one of the enemies, told them both to focus fire on that target.   Target dies, and suddenly one of the squad starts whining about healing, I look, and he is OUTSIDE, UNDER THE WINDOW, completely flanked.  The AI was so busy focusing on keeping Target A in the line of fire, it took cover in such a way that it left it's flank exposed, to the bulk of the enemies (which, BTW, both the main mass, and the target it was going after were accessible from the window cover)Incredibly frustrating, and just not worth dealing with.   Maybe if you pick it up on the Humble Bundle for a couple of bucks, but not worth more than that.			",442,133,9,68,59,4,89

												In general, there’s little to recommend as far as The Bureau goes. The game essentially tries so hard to be 60s Mass Effect, but really only succeeds on the former front, in that it’s 60s as hell. Seriously, it’s the sole shining point here; The Bureau is inundated with shirt-tie-and-vest combos, classic cars, transistor tube radios, and chrome as far as the eye can see, which really injects the proceedings with a much-needed sense of atmosphere. Unfortunately, everything else solidly falls within the realm of mediocrity; the blandly-written protagonist is your typical gruff “tormented past, seeks redemption through fighting the new threat” archetype, and the gameplay that you experience through him is a weird, somewhat tedious fusion of third-person shooter and XCOM-style strategy. Don’t get me wrong, the visuals and effects of the abilities themselves are quite cool (especially in the late game, where you get access to turrets and airstrikes), but you have to hand-hold the inept AI that utilizes them so much that, in the end, you’re gonna be spending 50% of the time shepherding them through every action via Battle Focus (this game’s tactical view), and the other 50% running around and reviving them because they’re so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fragile. Seriously, does the COM in XCOM stand for “Clothes Only, Men”? … (I’m so, so sorry.) Anyway, as a result there is a sort of franticness to the combat in that regard, but unlike its sister game Enemy Unknown, the management of lives is more frustrating than heart-poundingly tense due to the increased repetition and frequency at which “getting downed” occurs. In any case, if you end up purchasing this game (I personally wouldn’t unless it’s less than 7ish dollars), play on “Squaddie” difficulty or below, as there is less a focus on team micro-management, and more an emphasis on blasting aliens with space magic.

												I recommend this game with a caveat. Read on. But first off: This is NOT an XCOM game. If you want XCOM, look elsewhere.This game looks pretty good, runs like absolute balls. Disable PhysX whatever you do. I went from 12 FPS in PhysX areas to 120+. It is NOT optimized for PhysX in any way. I played through the game on Veteran skill and I feel the challenge was overall fair. The combat is very reminiscent of the Mass Effect series, but I'd argue that it's actually better. The actual combat is pretty fun, although some enemies can feel overly bullet-spongy at times. Particularly the ""miniboss"" characters such as Mutons and Sectopods. This is compounded by the fact that you are forced to relocate around the battlefield constantly, as all the weapons have very limited ammo stocks, so you have to scrounge for ammo refills around the area. Keep in mind though that this is in no way a strategy game like its predecessor. This is a 3rd person squad-based cover shooter with tactical elements.The combat has plenty of variety in areas, enemy setups and equipment for your squad. Squad-classes are well diverse and you actually feel like you sometimes need a particular class in a particular battle to succeed, in difference from Mass Effect where you can go with basically anyone and still kick♥♥♥♥♥ I found myself dying a couple of times throughout the game and had to replay a few battles with better tactics, so I'd say difficulty and combat mechanics are spot on (aside the bullet-sponginess). The story is dumb. It's super dumb. I found myself cringing heavily during cutscenes when the characters were speaking. It really feels like no one in this game has half a brain to think with and they're regurlarly acting downright stupid and illogical at most times. Don't get me wrong though: The lore and the alien world/design is pretty cool and interesting. It's just the humans that are absolute toshpots. Especially the main character, Carter, seems like an absolute gorilla who thinks with his hormones.The game has issues with pacing. Sometimes it's easy to follow along the story missions and have a good pacing going, but then suddenly everything grinds to a halt and you have to faff about the base for 30 minutes (I hate all the running around) and then suddenly there are no story missions. Just side missions. So you HAVE to faff about pointless side missions. Not sure I'm a fan of that.In conclusion:Is this game any good? Yeah, I'd say it is. It has its problems absolutely, but I had overall fun. My absolute biggest gripe is the story and writing and how the main characters react to things. I won't spoil anything but some decisions in this game really made me want to eat my desk and the ending is absolute♥♥♥♥♥ Such a cop out story ending I nearly laughed. But I still recommend it as it was, for the most part, very enjoyable.			",124,9,1,16,18,1,33

A Paladin’s Review: The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. It's Really Not That Bad, For What It IsGenre: 3rd Person Tactical ShooterDeveloped & Published by: 2K Marin and 2K GamesPlatform support: Windows, PS3 and Xbox 360Business Model: Base GameCopy purchased by myselfRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]PreambleThe Bureau has had a troubled history. It spent a long time in development hell, changing studios and the game’s design multiple times. Though its 1960s aesthetic was the only thing that stayed consistent during this process. It was originally titled “XCOM”, a first person shooter with some tactical play. It was originally intended to be the focal point of the series’ reboot. The reboot of a beloved turn-based strategy game with mechanics that had become legendary by this point and time. (Yeah, it doesn’t take a genius to see where 2K might have gone wrong). The response to “XCOM” was severe dislike, leading to the game to be pushed back into the shadows of the public eye. Instead, XCOM: Enemy Unknown was released by a different development team and became really successful. Potentially leading the series to a new and bright future. The FPS “XCOM” wasn’t anywhere to be seen and there was much rejoicing. A year later, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified stepped from the shadows. In all of it’s glorious 1962 aesthetic, 3rd person tactical squad based action. It largely got mixed or negative reception. So, the question becomes: did The Bureau justify that reception? Well, let’s find out.   Turn-Based Tactics Combat SystemThere’s no turn-based strategy here. There is a tactical commander’s view that let’s you order your squadmates where to go, when to use abilities and on which alien/enemy targets. A large chunk of your game time will be spent going from combat spot to combat spot. As a whole, the combat is simply ok and it works. It has its satisfying moments now and again but it’s not the most exciting. Especially if you’ve played games in this genre before. However, one thing that I did like were some of combos you could make with different classes. Though I felt like they barely scratched the surface with class synergy and I’d like to see more useful combos in the future. Oh, I didn’t mention this but there are four classes in the game. Commandos (your bruisers), Engineers (deploy turrets and mines), Recon (Snipers) and Supports (medics). Each class has their own distinctive abilities and weapons. The weapons are reasonably weighty with a good amount of impact and firepower to make them all enjoyable to use. The cover system is a bit sticky and unwieldy at times. Far too often, I’d find myself trapped in a spot with no good way out. Or my agents would often find themselves in similar situations. Story and CharactersIf there is one thing I can say about The Bureau, it’s a story of conveniences. Somehow I’m supposed to believe that an alien invasion of this size would be kept secret from the public. The only reason I can buy this is that it’s the 1960s and communication was severely hampered. That somehow, I’m supposed to believe that an alien we captured becomes our ally in a quick heartbeat. Somehow, I’m supposed to believe that we can capture alien weapons and items with the “Venn Brace”. Which I can only assume is a magical tool we carry on our arms. (Where did that Venn Brace come from again?). A lot of this is either swept under the rug or just goes by you so quickly I think they’re hoping you won’t notice because SHINY. DLC ThoughtsI didn’t play the DLC and from what I can see, they don’t seem worth paying or plaything them. One is a gun pack, the other two are short uninspiring missions. I can’t help but feel like these were possibly cut from the final product to be sold as DLC. I didn't feel any particular compulsion to pick these up. PC Settings & OptimizationThe Bureau has a lot of graphical settings. There’s a reasonable amount of screen resolutions to choose from. Windowed mode, v-sync and film grain that can be turned off and on. It also supports up to 120FPS if you’re wanting that. Field-of-view is supported from 65-100 degrees. Any larger changes have to be made in a .ini file. PhysX is featured in the particles & clothing and can be disabled. You’ve got texture, world, shadow and effect detail sliders as well as anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, decal persistence, ambient occlusion and screen space reflection sliders. For the most part it’s a pretty decently optimized game. Though I did have several areas of combat situations where the framerate dropped pretty hard. A DX11 mode also exists that makes the game look somewhat better. However, it’s an incredibly costly mode for not a lot of gain which I couldn’t get it to run at a stable framerate. Final ThoughtsIt’s a good thing that 2K didn’t lead their reboot of the XCOM series with The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Not to knock too harshly on the developers, but this would have killed the franchise dead. Now? I actually kinda want a sequel to this. A good sequel that stays with these developers, doesn’t get passed between multiple teams and doesn’t go through development hell. I think they have a good foundation started, but could use some more work to flesh everything out. As for XCOM Declassified currently, well, it’s just not that bad. It’s got a pretty good story and a decent enough combat system. It does try to be XCOM though it does lack many of the features of XCOM. There’s no research, no base(s) management, you can only command two other squadmates, it’s got less customization and less of the XCOM experience than it should. But for a 1960s take on the XCOM universe from a different perspective, I still kinda like it. It’s got a story with some pretty unique twists and turns, a pretty diverse cast of characters and seventeen hours of enjoyment.

												The 3rd person combat is fluid and fast paced, and strategic maneouvers using squad members gives a good amount of control over how you want to play out engagements. Higher difficulties demonstrate this extremely well.The story is quite alright. If you decide to play out each choice in the dialog wheel however, you might find yourself listening to ALOT of talking. They give good information about situations, but can be quite a hassle if you're not a big fan of this. Some parts of the story feel a bit rushed or lack context, but flows nicely.It plays similar to Mass Effect; dialog wheels, a mass effect 3rd person combat feel, and having a sci-fi/alien atmosphere to it.XCOM DECLASSIFIED IS A PRETTY NEAT GAME. 8.5/10 ",126,19,2,44,26,0,13

XCOM but shooterAfter playing the first XCOM during many hours and watching my squad missing and missing ennemies and then dying, what a relieve to control almost everything, to be less tactic and more ""in the action"".XCOM Declassified is a good game in all game design aspect, the controls, the fights, the customisation features, how ennemies react to your tactics and everything BUT...BUT in XCOM, you don't play for that, you play for the story, after defending Earth the first time, you can't refuse another fight (a new fight which happens before the first one, it's complicated to explain), and the story, I will not spoil, is good, very good.Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Music: 7/10Story: 7/10 ",230,102,2,34,23,3,33

The good:Interesting story.The bad:Graphical glitches at max graphics on AMD cards (and apparently some NVIDIA ones).The AI is absolutely abhorrent (your squad refuse to obey your orders, don't stay where you put them and insist on running through enemy fire because, hey, why not.)A lot of the feeling of ""control"" from the XCOM games is gone (you can't select what to research, for example).Oh, and, of course, you magically get access to all the fancy weapons because of some or other deus ex machina narrative mechanic.I would LOVE to see an XCOM game of this genre but this abomination is unfortunately not it.

												It's easy to see how this game got savaged not for being what it is, but for not being a different game entirely. But on its own merits I really enjoyed it. If it has a primary failing I'd say it's not enough.Almost everything begged to be expanded on just a little more, from the aliens to the tech to the main characters. It felt like there should have been at least one or two more main missions, a few more side missions, maybe some more viable weapons, maybe another enemy type... you see what I'm getting at. The game left me seriously wanting more - not just ""replay it"" more (though I'll probably be getting around to that soon enough) but just more content. The feel of this game would have benefited greatly from 2K Marin having just a little more time and money.But I still had a fantastic time with it. The weapons felt good, and upgrading to the alien weapons felt even better. The powers also felt great, and I never ended up regretting my choices. (Sure, they're kind of limited overall, but they're still fun.) Carter is well-built for holding and pushing at the enemy line, but can easily be played to sow confusion among the enemy's numbers. Your squadmates all had solid power choices as well, with each class fairly well balanced to its role and begging to fit different playstyles. I stuck mostly with the same squadmates throughout the game, as well as the same equipment, but am already considering how to change stuff up for next time. Nearly all the kills will still fall on your shoulders, but judicious use of your squadmates' powers will make it a lot easier - the Support agent's shield bubble is a lifesaver, and everyone else is full of ways to keep the enemies off your flanks or help crack a defensive point.I'm not much of a third-person/cover shooter player, but really, if this is a POOR representative of the genre, then I definitely need to play more. I'm not totally certain I'd buy this full price, but that's mostly because of financial considerations. I got it on sale and it was well worth what I paid.			",110,36,0,50,9,0,42

												The Bureau is a very different take on the XCOM universe... it was set in 1960's, height of cold war, when a jamming wave blanketed the nation, and aliens invaded Earth. With comm blackout, information is slow to trickle in, but it appears the nation's military had been crippled, and only XCOM, a command setup to take control in case of full war, is mankind's last hope. At its heart Bureau is a tactical shooter where you control two other agents to deploy where you want them as well as deploy their special abilities, such as sniper hit, deploy turret, and so on. As the senior agent, you have abilities too, and you'll get more as time go on. Graphics are quite good and the desolation in the middle of 1960's America is quite evocative. Agents were wearing suits and appropriate hairstyles, esp. the ladies. There is also quite a bit of dialog, with choices you have to make (and they will affect the outcome, at least a little) a bit like Mass Effect series. Talk to other people in the base, for additional clues, expositions, notes, and whatnot that tells you more about the people you meet. Characterization is quite nice. Managing the agents during a sort of ""Matrix-like super-slo-mo"" mode known as ""Battle Focus"" is the key here, where you place the agents at vantage points so they can engage the enemy effectively is key. Flanking is often the best way, as are using the environment such as explosive barrels (yes, that too).  As agents gain ""rank"" they also gain special abilities they can deploy. The key is to deploy them at the right place at the right time, and that's your job as commander. The Aliens are nicely animated and sprints into and out of cover and will attempt to flank if possible. However, they are not very bright can can be outsmarted. Later you'll run into bosses, like Mutons and Sectopods (walkers), though most are just Greys. There are occasional elites and commanders. Commanders are tough as they can give shields to other units, but that just makes them vulnerable to strikes when they do that. Add drones, turrets, and you can be in a tough fight. This alternate history is a lot of fun to play in. It is highly recommended if you like the genre.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												It's a nice game when you are a fan of X-com, you get some more story behind everything and the atmosphere is spot on. The game itself is fun at the beginning, at least I could stomach it for a while, but it gets tedious after a few missions. It's the typical corridor shooter you expect these days, but this time you can predict exactly when you run into enemies. Encounter a group, run through some hallways, drop down and have another encounter... rinse and repeat.The management of your crew is shallow and it gets old after a few battles, so before half the game I didn't bother much with it. Other games do a far better job at it. For me the ammo scarcity was also a problem, having to find the right ammo type during each battle felt like a gimmick just to get me out deeper into the battlefield rather than hanging back. A little bit more capacity would have done the trick for me.The last two hours I had to force myself to finish the game, just because it was so repetitive.I'd still recommend this game, but... at a highly reduced price, and only if you are a fan of X-com.

												I am not known to the XCOM series, so I started with a blank page.The graphics and style, I really loved it, the game play in the beginning seemed like a ton of fun.After the tutorial kind of levels I understood I was playing a Gears of War/Mass Effect like game with a 50's style which was appealing enough to cary on not understanding all the hate...Then the rain of♥♥♥♥♥♥started when I played the first real big mission:When real tactics are needed you realize you are stuck with the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI on the planet running around in completely tactless designed level shooting a gunship with a sniper and a shotgun or whatever you picked up (open fields with small walls and a gunship above your head???). I managed but it left me rather frustrated that it was such a chaotic experience instead of having some cool organized action (which is impossible with those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ helping you) and then the same counted for the 3 levels after that.... uninstall and on to the next game.Not recommended!

												This game was simply pretty fun. A lot of the negative reviews come talk about the bad AI, but I never had huge problems with that. Sure, occasionally they'd leave cover for no reason or do other stupid positioning things, but it was never anything game-breaking, just an occasional minor annoyance. My one main problem with the game was that when you go into tactical mode where you're giving orders to your team, it doesn't paus the action, just puts it in slow-motion. This can lead to issues with trying to set up combos or time certain things correctly, because by the time you're done giving orders, the enemy might have moved or your first operative will have already started doing their action. But once you get used to the timing, it stops being really noticable. The story was pretty good, and I enjoyed getting to choose which classes to take into the field, therefore completely changing up how you fight in battles. This isn't anything like the other XCOM games, but if you go into it knowing that, then it's a fine game on its own.So my conclusion is, this was a decent game that doesn't deserve all the negativity it got. I don't know if I would have paid full price for it (and I didn't, because of reading the negative reviews), but if you can catch it on sale, it's definitely worth it if you enjoy third-person, squad-based shooters.

												The combat and squad command system is just a Mass Effect rip-off. Yeah, great, a rip-off from a game which combat portion is already bad enough, whoever came up with this idea must be an idiot. Apart from this, there is nothing else to look at here: bad AI for both opponents and teammates(especially the teammates, they need extensive baby-sitting which is not even fun), average level design, boring story. The only acceptable thing is perhaps the artwork. Hmph, they should rather stick to their initial design, which was an FPS game close to bioshock.			",81,24,1,3,6,1,14

												As someone who enjoys the difficulty associated with the unforgiving nature of strategic, turn-based combat that is the hallmark of previous games under the XCOM title, all I can do is be honest and say that this game did not live up to that, even on harder difficulties.The bullet-time planning mode, while convenient if anything unexpected happened, was otherwise unnecessary, besides combat being fairly linear and predictable anyway: For the majority of battles, you can simply sit behind cover and murder anyone who pops their head up to try and shoot you. Every major combat area provides more than enough ammo to restock anything you would have used. Using abilities serves only to finish a particular battle a few seconds quicker and conserve a clip or two.You can ignore your teammates entirely since they deal substantially less damage over time than you and their AI's are remarkably self-sufficient, plus they never run out of ammo and will revive each other unless otherwise ordered by you.Without leaking spoilers, it can at least be said that the plot is forced and the ending anti-climactic. Plus the achievements offer essentially no challenge, most of which I unlocked by accident without even trying.The only conceivable highlight about the game, the one that kept me playing, was the variance in settings, which was enjoyable. Still, about mid-game it becomes clearly noticeable that the basic layout of all maps is the same, especially in combat areas, and it is only the appearance of the obstacles and backgrounds that differentiates them.All-in-all, a disappointing experience that I would not recommend to any sincere XCOM fan, and not one I would replay even to 100% for the few achievements I managed to miss.

												Quite a decent game, with a very Mass Effect 1-esque combat engine. The small bits of running around the base really help with the immersion and feel of fighting a nigh hopeless war, though all your decisions still feel somewhat...eh. The most you get is a small accessory in combat and a little text saying you done good. The story gets immensely interesting near the end, with a twist most wouldn't expect, but ultimately, this game is kinda eh. Decent for a playthough or two. Get it on sale.			",242,36,1,30,18,0,31

												A Review Mostly for me so I know I’ve completed the story, as well as feedback on the game.My Thoughts:- A good game and a new take on the X-com type, with nice graphics and good story. The tactical feel of it as you command 2 of the agents around a real time battlefield is good.Achievements:- 41 of 41 (100%) achievements earnedGraphics:- graphics are quite well done, with the use of DX11 and everything maxed out looks very well done indeed.Story:- it all starts with one agent and a brief case, that’s when things turn strange, aliens attack earth and its your job to fight them off.Replayability:- maybe 3 or 4 plays same with the DLC.What Could Be Added: more custom stuff for agents as well as a change sex option?Rating:- 8 / 10			",327,58,6,36,38,6,56

												I went into the game with no expectations and found it to be very entertaining. The world building is great and playing as Charlie Sheen was pretty fun, even if his character was a bit bland. Speaking of bland, the majority of the optional dialogue you come across the base is pretty boring. Even as someone who liked the world, I felt like I was suffering through it at times. The combat gameplay is fun, but I've typically liked squad based shooters. Also a very beautiful game.			",45,3,1,11,20,0,17

												The Bureau is a professionally-developed ‘prequel’ to arguably the best series of PC games ever developed. It attempts bring the infamous tactical combat series to the console with Mass Effect inspired squad-based real-time battles. It utterly fails as a PC game and shames the XCOM title.Writers attempted to push the envelope in a few areas: two major characters include a gay Australian medical doctor and a senior female agent who struggles with the patriarchy of the era. Unfortunately, there is still the trope German scientists and the uncreatively written, guilt-driven by typical lost-love protagonist. The main quest develops much too fast, introducing new characters and pivots before the lead agent has sufficiently investigated the story or the player can understand justification for the last plot twist. The non-combat ‘investigation’ missions teased early on in development were never realized.Checkpoint saves, specifically before [skip-able] cutscenes break the games flow. For large battles, this is very demoralizing as failure to defeat a large end-boss means playing through waves of weak enemies ramping up to the climax that you've already seen several times. Combat is at its best when it clones gameplay that we've already seen in BioWare games. Special abilities distributed amongst your always-leveling squad are over-powered compared to level design which teases tactical flanking but is never effective at harder difficulties.Several weapons and items are under-powered and the player has no motivation to explore strategies with them, others (e.g. the blaster launcher) are all-but-required for taking down large enemies. The 'equipment pack' modifier to soldier abilities doesn’t hold a candle to mother XCOM’s soldier customization options. A total conversion of the XCOM:EU for the 60s era would suffice better than this poorly executed attempt at a prequel. Not only would I recommend not buying this, I'd avoid playing it too.

A Screenshot of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a 3rd person tactical shooter developed by 2K Marina and published by 2K Games. In The Bureau it seems as if 2K really tried to expand the XCOM name and branch off with the hopes of making XCOM more than just a turn-based strategy series. Most AAA game developers these days are scared to try new things and branch out into different areas so I give 2K props for at least trying to do something different. I have no problem with 2K trying something new but the fact that they seem to have used the XCOM name as little more than a cash-in is deplorable as this game has very little in common with the rest of the XCOM series. The only aspects The Bureau takes from its predecessors are a couple of the same enemies and a general setting outline. The game seems like it wanted to be an XCOM version of Mass Effect but The Bureau is neither particularly good at being an XCOM game or a third-person shooter.


Shields up! 
A Screenshot of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified

The Bureau's story is essentially that the world has been hit with a series of alien attacks and you, Agent Carter, have to go on a variety of missions for the XCOM program, essentially humanities last line of defense, in order to stop the threat and save the world. There's obviously a bit more to it than that but overall the story is just your basic alien invasion story and has pretty much nothing unique about it to deserve the XCOM name. The setting is interesting as instead of modern weapons you engage the aliens with 70's era weaponry which means that early on in the game you'll be at a severe disadvantage when fighting aliens wielding plasma cannon and laser rifles. The environments that The Bureau has you trekking through are extraordinarily bland and offer very little in terms of uniqueness since the game is as linear as linear gets. The Bureau wants you to explore to find new weapons and backpacks, the only real customizable gear the game has to offer, but what it means by ""exploring"" is to just walk down another hallway or look behind you. I found all the characters to be absolutely repulsive save, ironically, the alien prisoner you acquire early on in the game. Every character has heaps of voice lines overusing phrases like ""we're going to make the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s pay"" and as the aggravating dialogue piles up you end up skipping through it all and not caring at all about the characters or what they have to say. The Bureau also features one or two moments where you have to choices and these moments make you feel as if The Bureau wanted to try and be an RPG in the vein of Mass Effect but instead just couldn't perform. In the end, after listening to nothing but the same old faux-patriotic quips from the whole character lineup you end the game begging for the aliens to hurry up and get on with it.

The combat is really where you begin to see peeks of how The Bureau could have been something great but instead really defaces the XCOM name. The Bureau prides itself on tactical combat where you have to use a bit of tricky maneuvering and strategy in order to save the day and truly this is where most of the enjoyment is at. The gun progression is pretty bad since about halfway through the game you have all the weapons that you'll need and The Bureau doesn't give you good reason to use any of the rest. Some of the guns feel decent but other are like peashooters and even that seems like it may be an exaggeration. The gameplay itself though is very interesting as you really do have to use traditional XCOM tactics like positioning your men in cover or flaking your foes to do extra damage. Every one of the squadmates has a class and these classes each come with unique abilities that progressively unlock as you level each character up. These abilities allow not only for very satisfying visual shows but also for a suprising degree of synergy with the squad as a whole. For example, you could have one man throw down a turret, have another shield it, and then have the final man lift it up so it ignores cover. These abilities and how they synergize with each other is really what makes The Bureau unique and worth a purchase. However, the AI is quite possibly the worst I have ever seen in a game and certainly shouldn't be in a game with such a renowned name as XCOM. You spend most of your time babysitting the AI to make sure they don't run into enemy fire or charge a minefield and in some points it feels almost like artificial difficulty. The AI seriously impacts combat on the higher difficulties but even still there's enough here that I can say it's worth a try.TL;DRA third person tactical shooter with a mediocre plot and cliched characters that is only brought to light by the unique combat system.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming ",756,153,6,109,62,4,159

												I got this game cheap from the Humble Bundle so I can't really complain too much. Overall, it's not a bad game, but I felt that I should warn anyone considering picking this game up. Best way I can describe this game is, it's like playing Mass Effect 2 with the first game's horrible horrible AI companion. I've had them randomly get up and run straight at the enemies or get out of cover for no reason. The combat areas are pretty well designed (some pretty big) giving you a chance to flank the enemies however, there seems to be a leash between you and your squad which makes it hard to set up some strategy because they'll randomly get ported to your location and sometime in the middle of the battle out of cover. Two things I liked about the combat in this game, and I hope we see it in future games like this, is the ability to tell your squad exactly where to go and the ability to queue up actions. Once you start unlocking more abilities for your squad, the game defnitely gets better. There are some cool interaction between different class' abilities. If you can put up with the horrible AI, you might enjoy the game. ",218,59,4,51,10,3,28

												I have been a fan of the XCOM series since the very first UFO Defense came out.  I played it on my 386 PC with Turbo.    I bought this game ages ago, and really never went back to it.  Mainly because I heard such bad reviews, and people basically  saying it stunk.  Bit of advice....take these negative reviews with a grain of salt.  Often the bad review are untrue or just kiddies with nothing better to do. I recently decided to play it, after finishing XCOM2.  To be honest with you I like the game.  Yes it has some wierd quirks, sometimes it has blatant wierdness happening.  Like your squad mates which are running behing you, will teleport to checkpoint ahead of you.  The weapons can be clunky, and the interface can be sometimes frustrating.  However, with all of that, I am still enjoying this one.  It's story has developed well, and has some surprisingly good dialogue and cutscenes.Do I reccomend it?  Yes, with a caveat, buy it on sale.  It's fun.			",249,78,42,15,50,4,87

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a 3rd-person tactical shooter that takes place during the 1960's and absolutely nails its setting. The graphics and art design are fantastic, as long as you get the game running well on your machine. In The Bureau, aliens invade Earth and the XCOM group sends their best to take on the aliens.Combat is very similar to that of Mass Effect 2 + 3 - but combat here is much more tactical, since you have way more control of your party members. In fact, it's pretty much essential to survive that you must use the tactical ""slow-down"" to survive. It's not a BioWare-style tactical pause here - it only slow-down time a bit for you to make orders. You may create, randomize, and recruit agents and their actual looks, class, and everything at your own will and desire. Though, the down-side is that you'll never really feel attached to your teammates - since they do not have personal ""Loyalty"" missions, to make you care about them; this isn't Mass Effect here. If there's anything besides the excellent art direction and setting that 2K Marin gets absolutely right with this game, it's the excellent tactical combat. One thing that is never dull here is the tactical combat - and this is certainly the best reason to play this game. If you liked the combat in Mass Effect 2 + 3 but wanted something a bit more tactical and have more control over your party members when in combat - this is the game for you. Even on Squaddie (difficulty #2 out of 4), this game is tough - and this is coming from someone who plays a lot of games - especially shooters. The game actually suggests difficulty #3 by default - which given how tough Squaddie often is, given the number of times my party died, had to reload a save, or lost a party member to ""perma-death""; I'm not sure if the 3rd difficulty should be suggested as its default! ""Perma-death"" is in effect here - so if you survive a mission and one of your party members doesn't, they're gone from your game entirely.2K Marin did a fantastic job with storytelling & character development in Bioshock 2: Minerva's Den DLC, but doesn't do so as much here. Storytelling events that occur either are quite obvious as to what's going happen next (predictable!); and/or the big pay-off moments just aren't well put-together or is under-developed. By the time the game's story gets very interesting & has an excellent twist, which is somewhere closer to the back 1/4th of the game - it makes the gamer wonder why this sort of execution also didn't happen earlier, as well. But, once this plot-twist happens, the game drops the ball again in another regard: by spreading out auto-save points, which can lead to moments of complete frustration when players have to replay long-winded shootouts. There's nothing wrong w/ grand, long-winded epic shootouts like these - but it could've used an auto-save, somewhere in the middle or before the game brings out the really tough moment - since the game does have difficulty spikes within some of these sections.What it all comes down to, is this: if you want a game with excellent art direction; an excellent setting; looks great in DX11 mode (if your PC can handle it); you enjoy 3rd-person shooting similar to Mass Effect 2 + 3; but you also want a shooter more tactical than Mass Effect 2 + 3 - then this game is for you and it shouldn't be missed. If you're looking for a game with great story and characters, most of the time - this is not that game. It doesn't always execute that stuff consistently. The Bureau could've been elevated to a much greater status, if it actually delivered more consistently on its character + story elements, since it actually does often try to emphasize these elements. Overall, when it's all said and done - The Bureau is a solid and worthwhile 3rd-person tactical shooter.Final Grade: C+			",893,314,36,138,76,13,111

Recommended with a grain of salt  Review This game was a positive surprise to me. I got it from a bundle, and the bad reviews made me thought I might never even try this considering the amount of games in library still unplayed. Playfire reasons I ended up playing a bit from the start, and found that the criticism has been to harsh on this one.Basically the game is 3rd person action game with chest-high-walls. So a cover shooter in short. Very very similar to Mass Effect 2 without the rpg elements.It is surely not a perfect game, not even close, but also it's not as bad as it seems. It's gameplay wise well done, looks good, plays good and all that. A solid performance and not much to nitpick about. Voice acting is decent, animation mostly good and length of the game is good, around 14 hours. Tactics are somewhat hard to learn first, but after playing few hours I felt the system somewhat intuitive. There are major flaws in the way AI behaves with you, but mostly it didn't bother me as long as I didn't keep moving much. On harder difficulties it might prove a lot more stressing to know that you cannot count on your comrades staying where you want them to stay.To my surprise the game was pretty hard, especially in the beginning the game wasn't a walk in the park. Something to remind that this was still in the Xcom universe, if nothing else is the same. Though the game got gradually easier, it still held some harder moments near the end.The parts that this game is lacking is the fact this this isn't a polished game. It feels uncompleted, something like Kotor 2. You feel that there is or was supposed to be something deeper, something better, but it got cut out of the game. The plot is full of weird unexplained holes that only seem to be there because someone wanted a faster ending. It really could've had a potential for much better and even in the end the game surprises with some weird choice options that could've used more explanation or flesh around them. Even though I completed about 99% of the game, I felt that I had skipped some major content.Also the game's level design is somewhat lacking. Although there's a great 60's wibe, it's not much used. Most of the missions are in semi-alien environment where alien structures dot the landscape of 60's america. Also the design constantly spoiles the surprises by giving up when a fight is about to start.    Pros  Gameplay is mostly very smooth and I didn't find any bugs in it. Should work like a charm. Plot is somewhat interesting. Not the easiest game on the market. Gives some challenge.   Cons  Friendly AI is stupid and might have a huge effect on harder difficulties Plot is full of holes and seems uncompleted. Unpolished and poorly finished  ",192,41,1,16,12,4,50

												Must have for X Com fans. Nice design of USA from 60's and good story. If you like shooters based on moving from cover to cover (Mass Effect) you will enjoy this game. Mechanics is quite easy so try a game on every difficulty.There were a situations, when one of my soldiers stuck on a barrel or something. Game has few bugs like others...I will give 7/10.  It's not so good, but You can try it.			",404,83,14,72,43,5,89

												Game initially ran at a resolution that was too high for my monitor, so to fix this, I right clicked the game in my library, clicked ""set launch options"" and typed in ""-windowed"" without the quotation marks obviously. After this was fixed, the game crashed twice at the same part on the first level but I fixed this by verifying the integrity of the game's cache. After this, the game appears to run fine. It has good graphics and is a fairly basic third person shooter with some tactical elements. If you have trouble when starting the game, just take my advice mentioned above and you should be fine. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend it, the plot is entertaining at times, but not for the price of 49.99 USD. This game is easily worth 15, maybe 20 USD, but you've got to love luke warm cover-shooter-hot-bar-magic strategy and a superficial morality system (Think watered down Mass Effect).

												I think a lot of reviews for this game were unfair - perhaps written by people expecting a reboot of the earlier games with their turn-based gameplay.I bought this game as a cheap diversion in one of the sales. I've played and completed the turn-based predecessors in the XCOM series but I started this game with an open mind and really enjoyed playing it. Yes, bits of the story annoyed the hell out of me (particularly the turn of events towards the end of the game) but you know what? I think 2K did a really good job of melding turn-based combat with FPS action and I really enjoyed playing it to the end.It didn't take long to complete - 20 hours in total (and that was to get some achievements) so it's not a patch on Borderlands in terms of longevity but good while it lasted.

												Aparently ordering generic agent number 22 to get behind cover actually means Leave your current cover via the worst route walk across 2 mines and then ignore my order because a grenade came near you. Why are you taking cover infront of the wall the enemy is shooting at agent #22 why? Oh and how about shooting the target I told you and not the automated turret. Yes its pummeling us but i need you to take out the stupid little big head thing so i can go revive #23 who decided he liked to try and mate with a barricade, stuck in an infinite leaping motion trying desperately to leap over a wall no where near where I told you to go.

												Definitely would not recommend it above $10.   Pros:  It has a interesting retro 50s feel to it.   Story seemed to be going okay, as far as I played.Cons: Just about everything else.  Notably the AI is absolutely terrible.   The game is designed around you controlling two partners that are supposed to help you fight.  They don't.   They simply disobey your orders at every conceivable opportunity and are mega-suicidal to boot, often breaking cover to run TOWARD the grenade.    Also notably bad is the UI.  Clearly was intended to be another badly ported game made only for controllers.   The UI to give commands requires you to navigate a checkpoint around obstacles and through mazes for every command, even when its not a line of sight action.    Frustrating is the best word for it when you can't even pause the game entirely to issue the orders.  Just doesn't work.   After watching my 10th squad member in a row, move away from where I told him to set up cover, I finally uninstalled it and dropped it into the trash category.    What exactly is the point of a squad level tactical game, when the AI refuses to do as its told?If it hits a steam sale at some point, maybe it might be worth it then, just don't set you expectation beyond ""terrible"".

												In an alternate timeline: The year is 1950. Donald Draper never joined Sterling Cooper to work as an ad man, he remained in the army and rose through the ranks. Eventually recruited by the CIA, he becomes involved with The Bureau, and helps fight off an alien invasion of Earth. Thats this game in a nutshell: Donald Draper shooting aliens.The gameplay is fun, at first. The Third person shooter + squad combat is neat on the first mission, when you get agents with all their abilities unlocked. But then it takes that away and you have to -slowly- level them up again. Gameplay is largely the same, fighting the same 2 aliens over and over again, except when they occasionally throw in a muton or sectopod battle. Also, one of the big bosses froze up on me and just sat there as my squad gunned it down. Long set peices showing off the devestated cities lead up to cover based combat sections in a predictable pattern. For some reason, there's more ammo than you can carry in the areas without enemies.The characters suffer from a bad case of rubber face, and the shot-reverse-shot dialogue trees become tedious very fast. Which sucks, because apparently a bunch of content is hidden in the speech you go through in the base. It's a cool game in premise, but it doesnt quite live up to what it could have been. A few tweaks and a little more though into varying gameplay would have gone very far in making this better. Although it is a totally different game, XCOM Enemy Unknown does a better job at Squad based alien killin fun. I got this in the Humble Bundle, so its okay for the price, but I wouldnt recommend buying this game straight up, unless it's on sale.			",92,10,2,11,8,1,14

												I bought this along with XCom Enemy Unknown and apparently played them out of order. (This is the first of the two). In terms of gameplay the two games are radically different. This is an FPS, the other is a squad based TPS. In terms of quality, they both differ as well. Enemy Unknown was an amazing game 9/10 in my book where as this game got dull fast. You do the same thing, over and over. Same enemies , same fights,  the game didn't challenge me to think. Only to pull the trigger. The story wasn't great and a lot of plot points were just left.In the end, it's just your average everyday faceless FPS which are a dime a dozen.			",152,21,0,30,23,0,52

												This corridor shooter is based heavily on tactical movement with your squad. The problem is that controlling your squad members is like herding cats. They will frequently run to places you didn't tell them to go, fail to shoot at anything, and even flee from shielded areas you just told them to place. That's fine in a game like Mass Effect 2, where your squad just gets up after combat, but in The Bureau, they die permanently.I like the world and story that the game creates, but when I spend more than half my time in combat trying to save my soldiers from their own stupid AI, then it's a bad time.

												I think it's an excellent, fun, accessible game and a great low-impact X-Com game to boot. It definitely takes the franchise in a different fork (more mission and story driven than strategy) but the strategic aspects aren't completely absent and at later levels if you have the difficulty up you actually need to control your agents and position them if you're going to survive.This is coming from someone who played X-COM and Terror From the Deep on the Amiga back in the day and loved the hell out of them, and I can honestly say I've thoroughly enjoyed the game. It has an LA Noire sense to it, with intrigue and loads of sideplots and stuff you can do if you wander the base and talk to people. I didn't particularly care for any of the X-Coms after Terror From the Deep aside from the X-Com remake, so if you're like me and you like the first two X-Coms and don't necessarily need a heavy squad-management and base builder sim, give it a try.My only lament is that any gear you want you must discover in missions, some of them completely optional. There is no 'research' beyond what the storyline demands, so the game loses some of the greatness of being able to research and retrofit the alien tech as you recover corpses and such. While it's something I missed in the game, the fact that once you salvage alien technology in the field X-Com can reproduce it for all of your agents is cool.I'd like to see a sequel to this game made with some more rpg elements like more skill branching, more skill levels, and research and development. Everything else I found to be quite refreshing, especially the timeline which hearkens back to good old Cold War era paranoia, Area 51 and 'the end of innocence'. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pro's;- Storyline was good (main reedemable feature)- Voice acting (although some was terribly cliche)- Not a bad shooter- Variaty of weapons- Artwork and level design was good - Loved the 60's vibe Cons;- Not challenging- Too short- Too linear- Empty (RPG and Game-wise)Pros explained;The storyline was great IMO, without ruining too much the start of the game starts out slow but then there is further development in the later stages of the game (although you do have to get to the end practically). It fits in with the universe, to an extent, and it ties itself off whilst still connecting itself to future game. Spoiler:  The multiple endings aren't worth replaying IMO as all the choices are at the end but I do like this feature. The voice acting was decent but I did get bored of Carters cliche 60's American hero, they tried to falw him and they did a good job, I hated the guy up until the end, Because i could see his point but still why does nobody in this game follow orders!?. The only other issue was Angelas character (Her emotions are warranted but she is suppose to be a CIA Operative, Comeon)It isn't a bad shooter either for the price (if it's on sale i'd easily say £10 is worth it) for what it has, so long as you dont have any high expectations. Combat is pretty much whack-a-mole style (duck when they fire and shoot when they've stopped/or have your teammates shoot them) still there is some tactics involved. The variaty of weapons are good but only being able to carry two is a drawback but neccessary (as you do need to conserve ammo and adds more realism and for the player to use tactics). But there are plenty of games that are worse than this as a fps.The artwork and design of the entire game I loved, there really isnt much I can critisise (unless we include Carters really annoying animations for hand gestures, where you just see him tapping his fist into his hands every second of the conversation) But overall they looked alien and i loved the contrast of America - Alien. Con's Explained;This game is not long. 20 hours on hardest difficulty and 30%-40% of that was the last mission, the long ending though did leave it enjoyable rather than alot of newer games with anti-climatic endings. But they really could of fleshed out more missions or longer ones. This leads to it not being difficult as enemies typically come in waves, which once you're behind cover you can pretty much eliminate 3-4 enemies before they position themseleves. I wish they used some of the more advanced units earlier or put more together so i felt pressured, like the end mission. (Permadeath on your agents really shouldnt be an issue so long as you keep together) I didn't lose a single agent on the hardest difficulty. I admit I was close a few times on the end mission. Xcom's I know arent linear games, but what i mean by this, especially stating it as empty, was there wasn't many side missions or consequences of certain missions like in the others (which would of been nice). To top it off the missions were linear and there wasn't try this approach or go down this way to get to the objective (unless you call using a different hallway that) the most detailed areas were the combat areas. (understandably) The few areas in a mission you can go another way they're dead-ends to pick up lore (scraps of paper or audio reels), nice but they could of added more. To add to the lore it was a shame they didnt have more for the ""scan"", yes you can scan enemies and it details them and weapons for you which was pretty unique but it was a shame (part from one side-mission) that scanning wasn't used to find hidden things in the campaign or to research enemies or something similar.Lastly the second point of it being or feeling empty is the RPG portion, although you have 4 types of squad mates and yourself you're probably only going to use the engineer and scout class (they have the best abilities by far deploying turrets and mines added with diversion and airstirke) the other two feel lackluster compared (the engineer was only redeemable for the turrent TBH). Adding to that they only have 5 levels, of which each class usually has three abilities and two upgrades for said abilities, YOU HAVE TO USE THESE ABILITIES, it's not a choice between two abilities, its a choice between two classes pretty much. The same thing applies to the protagonist. If youre a fan of Xcom its good for lore and a chnage of pace, just dont think it's going to be as great as the traditional ones.If not and you're looking for a casual gears of war/mass effect Third-Person (which the emphasis on cover, abilities and ammo conservation) This is pretty decent, Unless you fall into one of the two categories I wouldn't buy it.Overall 7/10 Because of the gameplay and I didn't have my hopes up (I expected it to be terrible) But the gameplay aint bad. Then again I paid like £5 for this and i played 30+ hours, deffo worth it for that.   ",60,5,0,30,22,1,35

												Massively underrated game - so much so that I am ""reviewing"" a game for the first time to redress the balance!As a matter of fact, I was almost put off by the relatively low rating this game has, which would have been a shame as I enjoyed it thoroughly. I can only assume that differences in the gameplay compared to the original XCOM have resulted in some overly negative reviews. However, as someone who enjoys FPSs, this delivers and adds in squad management in a fun way. The story keeps you interested, moves along at a decent pace, is nicely voiced and beautifully crafted. I will even confess that it even made me feel as if the Half-Life world had been ressurected at one stage!			",87,13,0,4,5,0,7

												I was heartily disappointed in The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. The premise set itself up for greatness, but the gameplay and execution of the narrative fell flat.I adore the time period and aesthetic nature of the world presented in  The Bureau, but quickly lost sight of that initial enjoyment admist a clunky third person shooter. I frequently found myself misgiving orders, or stumbling through trying to direct one of my squadmates far too often. Awkward describes  The Bureau  best. It certainly tries its best to be a good game, but has too many detractors for me to enjoy it in full.  ",75,15,0,10,6,0,8

												This is a game that (we) X-Com fans wanted to love, but just couldn't. But I believe it has enough to be liked.The first thing that the game has going for it is the noir theme, such an amazing atmosphere, and good voice acting (although the face animations are not up to par with the dialogues). The setting, 1963 IIRC, is spectacularly used to breathe fresh air to the game. There are a lot of little details that really help to build the X-Com world. Also, those are the key elements that save The Bureau from being just a complete rip-off of the first Mass Effect.The whole squad tactical FPS combat is not as bad (some combo between abilities are actually really fun and easy to pull off) as long as you don't mind micromanaging (pausing all the time to give instructions to your teammates). Even so, your teammates will do stupid things, like ignore cover orders and never use their abilities. It's not terrible, but it is frustrating. In fact, you can argue that by the end those AI mistakes are the real difficult level, since by the end of the game you become really powerful and destroy your enemies by using just a little bit of tactical awareness.In general, the plot is well handled, the atmosphere is amazing and everything else is Mass Effect 1 with some minor changes. I loved ME 1. This game? I liked it just ok.			",87,19,1,19,1,0,10

												Back in 2010, 2k Marin decided that it wanted to develop its own cheap knockoff of Mass Effect, but ""Cheap Knockoff of Mass Effect"" was not a very popular title in focus testing, so they licensed the XCOM name to apply on top like a smiley face sticker might be applied next to the ""F"" on your child's report card.  It bears almost no resemblance to the beloved franchise, with no research or base building, tiny squad sizes, very little squad management, and a plot that is incongruous with the original games as well as Firaxis' recent release.In the course of development, it was then determined that creating additional missions or even coming up with a form of randomization would be too costly, and besides, what people really loved most about Mass Effect was running around the Citadel over and over and over.  So with The Bureau 2k Marin adopted the philosophy of Twice the Fedexing, Twice the Fun, and you'll find approximately 90% of your time in game is spent shuffling at a slow pace, unable to sprint or run or jog or walk briskly, up the stairs, down the hall, up some more stairs, down another hall just to talk to someone, and then back down again because even though you have a plasma pistol and laser rifle, nobody has yet invented the walkie talkie and everyone wants to talk to you.  Unfortunately you will occasionally be accosted by actual gameplay, forcing you to briefly abandon your quest for a new world record in Most Stairs Climbed in a Video Game and shoot some aliens, but luckily these missions are short, incredibly easy, and entirely forgettable.  In summation, I highly recommend picking up this game if you intend to play it only while honing your real-life drinking skills, though don't mistakenly assume that your in-game character's past drinking problem will make him more identifiable to you or provide any sort of character depth to make you at all invested in the backstory to the game, because 2k Marin thinks ""character development"" is a reference to the linear upgrade system available in the extremely limited RPG element of the game.

The story is delievered well and the characters are rich. It's also a + if your a big noire fan like me. I love the whole concept of retro detectives meets sci fi.

												After playing just over an hour of this game I must say it is different and enjoyable, but and it is a big but.  It is singleplayer only!The graphics are decent, the controls are decent, the sound is decent there is no real problem with this game.  It is good fun to play and plays nicely.  Just it has no multiplayer and no co-op.I waited a long time for this game, when I seen it being made some years ago and it was said to feature co-op.  I purchased it eagerly wanting co-op... Played it and because Splinter Cell came out the same time I did not want to play this, because playing a game alone is no fun.This game would benefit sooooooo much with co-op with a friend, but alone was just not for me.  Do not get me wrong, this game is enjoyable and nice to play but I stopped playing due to multiplayer Splintercell.It has some nice features, graphics, work arounds and more but it lacks the co-op it really really needs.Worth the money to a degree..

												This game is... embarassing of Xcom. I love that they want to introduce a new thing which is RTS+TPS but it's not working that well. When player has to fight a boss, you might see your AI teammate doing something very stupid and get them self killed. It isn't bad game but it's not well polished. I do not recomment this game due to that fact that the game is not ready but... story is kinda fun when you are able to choose what's going to happens in the future. Conclusion : Again,it's not bad game but it's unpolished game that when things work,it's fun but when it's not? well,it's very frustrated.			",98,5,0,3,3,0,8

												OK so I finished it one time on hard mode.And, to be honest, I wouldn't play it again even for free.But I should give my props to this developers because you must have some tru commitment to make such piece of crap masterpiece.Because I can't remember a single one good thing about this one.All I remember is:Stupid AI of squadmates.Bad controls (just try to throw grenade behind an obstacle).Unbelievably bad animated NPCs and dialogs. Everyone who did this just didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ to what they were doing. I love PRGs but this one I was just skippink because it's some top cringe♥♥♥♥♥♥right here.The ""Storyline"" badly written and executed as well. Feels like a bunch of 7 years old kids were asked to write something after watching one alien invasion movie. Full of cliches and each part is disconnected like you don't believe you can do this so bad.The only 2 cases I could recommend to play this game is:1) to understand what games should not be;2) if you like to play a bad stuff and laugh like ""what is this♥♥♥♥♥♥lol""But even there, this thing is barely worth it's 75% discount.

												  While no particular aspect of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is earth shattering, the overall experience is quite enjoyable and makes for a solid addition to the fairly niche tactical shooter lineup.  Given the fantastic games that get made by 2K, it is strange to me that their development process can so frequently be described as problematic, as was the case for 2K Marin.  This title had some interesting features planned such as detective work and stealth based gameplay, but those unfortunately got cut as the game underwent repeated revisions and delays.  It sounded promising.  As is, The Bureau fails to inspire much passion but nonetheless contains plenty of fun and is without question worth a play.  I have to admit I was very excited about The Bureau prior to getting my hands on it, and even now have a certain amount of bias favoring this one, because of: 60's Cold War Setting Action Shooter w/Squad Based Tactics Scifi Theme  I love speculative, historical fiction.  I loved the Brothers in Arms IP and was ready for more such action, and of course like everyone, I love convincing science fiction.  The Bureau delivered in some regards and not others.  The story expands upon what's already established by previous titles in the IP.  The plot had some clever ideas that I liked, and some that baffled, none of which I can describe without spoilers, so I won't go there.  I didn't play the classic series back when it came out in the mid '90s, so as story and gameplay go, I - unlike the core fans - am blessedly free of the urge to decry any deviations from what made those games great.  My impression is that XCOM is one of those rare IP's that just doesn't need an overly involved story; it is enough that aliens are here wreaking havoc on Earth and humanity must pull together to survive and conquer.    Combat is fun.  It didn't get old before I reached the end, not even after I attempted a new playthrough on the Commander difficulty.  On standard difficulty you can play it all tactical, all shooter or anything in between.  It all works and satisfies.  Putting around the base between missions is okay and rewards the player with bits of background story and unlockable side missions.  Most of the campaign is linear, which is fine by me.  The bugs were few and far enough between that they don't merit mention.  The visuals with graphic settings maxed are excellent and the audio does its job.  My only technical complaint is that the actual movement and placement of your agents (and targeted abilities) with the ground cursor feels a bit console port.  You use skills and reposition often in combat encounters, so this might get tiresome.  I don't have the DLC's and have no knowledge of Hangar 6 R&D.  My thoughts on this game included how a cooperative or competitive mode might work: the player pauses to access skills and issue squad orders in a tactical mode.  So, instead of being able to pause and use that interface indefinitely, start players with only a few seconds of the tactical mode but reward them (jointly in co-op, individually in competitive) with extra seconds of tactical time for skillful play (flanking and exposed attacks, environmental kills, combo and skill kills, etcetera).    After finishing the game, I went and read some major reviews.  In my opinion they're a bit unfair.  My advice is to judge the game on its own merit and decide for yourself.  It may or may not feel like an XCOM title but at the end of the day The Bureau is an entertaining, fun and brief experience that I recommend to anyone who shares the tastes I listed here.TIP: Avoid Rookie difficulty; it is trivial and will bore you.TIP: Don't jump straight into Commander difficulty - instead get a feel for the mechanics first.TIP: Once you are at Commander, remember the game punishes even slight deviations from ideal tactics.  You will consistently have to use everything at your disposal including skills, environment, rapid repositioning and your own sharpshooting.  If you don't, be ready to restart checkpoints a lot..TIP: If you're digging the story and setting, there are side activities to hunt down in base and also letters and audio clips both at base and in the field.  Plus, if you stand near people they will have some funny conversations.			",374,114,5,75,36,6,79

												Fans of XCOM will probably think this is some squad-shooter that someone just slapped the ""xcom"" tag on to try and boost sales after the success of XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  With the exception of the setting and mobs you fight, this game has virtually nothing in common with XCOM.First off there is no research or crafting of any kind.  This was one of the staples of XCOM, that you had to collect alien tech and research it quickly to keep up with the alien escalation.  In this game, the aliens conveniently leave weapons lying around for you to find.  Once found they can be equipped on every squadmate capable of using the specific type of gun.  No manufacturing required either.  Thus, two of the main features of an XCOM game (R&D) are eliminated.Second, your squadmates are utterly braindead.  Seriously, they will stand there getting shot it the face while yelling ""commander what do I do?""  Often after you tell them to move to full cover, they will inexplicably run out of said cover right into enemy fire.  This requires constant babysitting by you, breaking up the flow of the real time combat.  Their special abilities are somewhat useful, but you'll find that most of the mobs you'll have to kill yourself, as they apparently cannot shoot the side of the proverbial barn.Talking to people at HQ is someone annoying.  You cannot run inside the base, forcing you to walk to everywhere you want to go.  Frequently you'll have to move from one side of the base to another in order to proceed.  Then when you do get there the animations are a bit ""robotic"".  The voice acting is fine, but everyone you speak to looks like they just got the body 10 mins ago and are still trying to figure out how to work it.The game map allows you to pick missions, but unlike previous XCOM games there is no pressure to pick the most pressing.  Before, you'd only be able to deal with one threat and have to decide which one is more pressing.  In this game, no problem the aliens take their time and you can beat the missions one at a time at your convenience.  Finally, the main protagonist, Carter, is possibly the most unlikeable character in gaming.  He has the stereotyped ""angry guy who lost his family but blames himself"" backstory.  Yet, he never tries to redeem himself.  Pretty much he starts the game an a-hole and just continues being an a-hole.   At one point, he does something so stupid you want to reach into the game and strangle him.  Overall, this is a half-baked attempt to cash in on the resurgence of XCOM popularity.  Even if you're not a fan of XCOM games, there are far better squad-based shooter games out there.  If you do love XCOM I'd strongly suggest skipping this game.  Even though I got it on sale it was not worth the sale price,			",79,9,0,10,1,0,8

												When I bought this game I thought, ""Well, it doesn't have anything like X-Com gameplay at all, but maybe it wont be too bad.""I was wrong. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥where do I begin, how about gameplay. It plays like a bad, uninspired Mass Effect, the only cool feature being the slow-mo that comes up when you're selecting which skills to use and deciding where to put your AI partners. Theres not much in the way of team management outside of combat. Your AI partners by the way are essentially blank slate goons whose skills and appearance you can customize, and they show up in cutscenes, and thats about it. No dialog aside from stuff they yell in combat. Equipment wise all you got are guns and backpacks, and there are about a thousand god damn backpacks, all with different bonuses, but after you get the straight damage increase or defense increase ones you probably wont bother experimenting, because the bonuses themselves are pretty lack luster. You get most of those backpacks from side missions you send AI dudes to go handle solo so they can get a free level up.Story wise it's a mess. Without getting into spoilers the gist of it is a ""SAVE THE WORLD FROM THE ALIENS"" plot like you'd expect, but aside from the angle of the mass cover up, it's pretty forgettable. Speaking of forgettable, I honestly cant recall the name of the protagonist, he's that bland. With a backstory of ""SOLDIER/AGENT BADASS"" you'd think they'd think of something more interesting that ""He's seen some♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. There are side plots that are straight up dropped, there are moral choices that dont actually matter (aside from one I think, and its not even one at the end) and the general theme of censorship and ""NO ONE MUST KNOW"" is pretty much not there aside from the occasional dialog snippet from NPCs. You dont burn or hide evidence yourself, its more or less just an alien murder ride from start to finish. The game tries to connect itself with the Enemy Unknown/Within game, I wont go into spoilers but it doesnt do it very well, and there are a lot of ""What"" moments.The setting is Americana/Cold War, and while you can sort of see it in the levels and loving on characters, the actually COLD WAR, even though it would be rightly overshadowed by the wide scale alien invasion, only comes up like twice.And besides all that, heres some nit picking!Why are there audio logs everywhere? EVERYWHERE.How does everyone already know the names to each of the alien enemy types? Theres never any ""What do we call it?"" moments, its just ""MUTON! SECTOPOD!""Why does the artillery skill work indoors?Why does this game try to force itself into the EU/W story when it doesnt want to be consistant? ""Nah, we bulldozed all that sick plasma tech and got rid of the info we had on the aliens, have fun starting from scratch while fighting off a second invasion, but its cool, you can have a fedora.""WHY IS IT SO EASY. I played on the hardest difficult and it doesnt make the enemy AI any smarter, just harder to kill.Final verdict: Wasted Potential/10, do not buy.			",125,21,0,20,8,0,29

Plus, if you stand near people they will have some funny conversations.			",374,114,5,75,36,6,79

												This may be the worst 3rd person shooter I have ever played.  There is not a single element of this game that even aproached passable.  This may be the quickest I have ever abandoned a game in my life.  If there is anything notable about The Bureau, it's how it managed to take the worst parts of shooters and strategy games, make them worse, break them and throw it all together.  It's like mass effect with worse AI weapons and powers.Avoid this like a plague, trust me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fans of XCOM will probably think this is some squad-shooter that someone just slapped the ""xcom"" tag on to try and boost sales after the success of XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  With the exception of the setting and mobs you fight, this game has virtually nothing in common with XCOM.First off there is no research or crafting of any kind.  This was one of the staples of XCOM, that you had to collect alien tech and research it quickly to keep up with the alien escalation.  In this game, the aliens conveniently leave weapons lying around for you to find.  Once found they can be equipped on every squadmate capable of using the specific type of gun.  No manufacturing required either.  Thus, two of the main features of an XCOM game (R&D) are eliminated.Second, your squadmates are utterly braindead.  Seriously, they will stand there getting shot it the face while yelling ""commander what do I do?""  Often after you tell them to move to full cover, they will inexplicably run out of said cover right into enemy fire.  This requires constant babysitting by you, breaking up the flow of the real time combat.  Their special abilities are somewhat useful, but you'll find that most of the mobs you'll have to kill yourself, as they apparently cannot shoot the side of the proverbial barn.Talking to people at HQ is someone annoying.  You cannot run inside the base, forcing you to walk to everywhere you want to go.  Frequently you'll have to move from one side of the base to another in order to proceed.  Then when you do get there the animations are a bit ""robotic"".  The voice acting is fine, but everyone you speak to looks like they just got the body 10 mins ago and are still trying to figure out how to work it.The game map allows you to pick missions, but unlike previous XCOM games there is no pressure to pick the most pressing.  Before, you'd only be able to deal with one threat and have to decide which one is more pressing.  In this game, no problem the aliens take their time and you can beat the missions one at a time at your convenience.  Finally, the main protagonist, Carter, is possibly the most unlikeable character in gaming.  He has the stereotyped ""angry guy who lost his family but blames himself"" backstory.  Yet, he never tries to redeem himself.  Pretty much he starts the game an a-hole and just continues being an a-hole.   At one point, he does something so stupid you want to reach into the game and strangle him.  Overall, this is a half-baked attempt to cash in on the resurgence of XCOM popularity.  Even if you're not a fan of XCOM games, there are far better squad-based shooter games out there.  If you do love XCOM I'd strongly suggest skipping this game.  Even though I got it on sale it was not worth the sale price,			",79,9,0,10,1,0,8

												When I bought this game I thought, ""Well, it doesn't have anything like X-Com gameplay at all, but maybe it wont be too bad.""I was wrong. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥where do I begin, how about gameplay. It plays like a bad, uninspired Mass Effect, the only cool feature being the slow-mo that comes up when you're selecting which skills to use and deciding where to put your AI partners. Theres not much in the way of team management outside of combat. Your AI partners by the way are essentially blank slate goons whose skills and appearance you can customize, and they show up in cutscenes, and thats about it. No dialog aside from stuff they yell in combat. Equipment wise all you got are guns and backpacks, and there are about a thousand god damn backpacks, all with different bonuses, but after you get the straight damage increase or defense increase ones you probably wont bother experimenting, because the bonuses themselves are pretty lack luster. You get most of those backpacks from side missions you send AI dudes to go handle solo so they can get a free level up.Story wise it's a mess. Without getting into spoilers the gist of it is a ""SAVE THE WORLD FROM THE ALIENS"" plot like you'd expect, but aside from the angle of the mass cover up, it's pretty forgettable. Speaking of forgettable, I honestly cant recall the name of the protagonist, he's that bland. With a backstory of ""SOLDIER/AGENT BADASS"" you'd think they'd think of something more interesting that ""He's seen some♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. There are side plots that are straight up dropped, there are moral choices that dont actually matter (aside from one I think, and its not even one at the end) and the general theme of censorship and ""NO ONE MUST KNOW"" is pretty much not there aside from the occasional dialog snippet from NPCs. You dont burn or hide evidence yourself, its more or less just an alien murder ride from start to finish. The game tries to connect itself with the Enemy Unknown/Within game, I wont go into spoilers but it doesnt do it very well, and there are a lot of ""What"" moments.The setting is Americana/Cold War, and while you can sort of see it in the levels and loving on characters, the actually COLD WAR, even though it would be rightly overshadowed by the wide scale alien invasion, only comes up like twice.And besides all that, heres some nit picking!Why are there audio logs everywhere? EVERYWHERE.How does everyone already know the names to each of the alien enemy types? Theres never any ""What do we call it?"" moments, its just ""MUTON! SECTOPOD!""Why does the artillery skill work indoors?Why does this game try to force itself into the EU/W story when it doesnt want to be consistant? ""Nah, we bulldozed all that sick plasma tech and got rid of the info we had on the aliens, have fun starting from scratch while fighting off a second invasion, but its cool, you can have a fedora.""WHY IS IT SO EASY. I played on the hardest difficult and it doesnt make the enemy AI any smarter, just harder to kill.Final verdict: Wasted Potential/10, do not buy.			",125,21,0,20,8,0,29

												I never read a review of this game until after I had beaten it.  I wasn't terribly interested in buying it based on the poor review scores it received.  I decided to pick it up on a weekend sale based on a friend telling me they enjoyed playing it.  All I can say is that I'm glad I did.  While I understand where a lot of the reviews are coming from, the story at the end goes batshit very quickly, especially with unexpected and uncharacteristic responses from the main character due to what's happening in the story.  Also the mechanic where you get punished more for partial success than for failure in that if an agent dies and you succeed, he stays dead.  But if he dies and you fail, you start up at the last checkpoint.That being said, the combat is pretty awesome.  It feels like it's taking a page from Mass Effect 2/3 combat but also combining it with a bunch of X-COM: Enemy Unknown's tactics/aesthetics.  It's a pretty game, although my computer struggled with DX11 a little bit, so I ran standard.I plan on playing it again on a more difficult setting.  On normal it was an alright challenge.  I managed to finish the game without losing any agents, though there were times that I'd fail encounters outright multiple times before completing them due to managing my team better.SPOILER(ish)The one thing I did and also very much did not like about the story, all at the same time is that very near the end they give a very good explanation for the 3rd person perspective and the slow down time mechanic of battle tactics.  If you played it, you'll definitely understand what I'm getting at.I definitely recommend this game to fans of Mass Effect 2/3 combat.  For X-COM purists, I hear it's a tough pill to swallow regarding canon, so take it with a grain of salt perhaps?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified was not well received by mainstream reviewers, but I personally enjoyed it a lot. Overall, it feels like a stripped down version of Mass Effect, but the combat stands out above other cover shooters. The game has a lot of flaws, but I encountered no bugs in the core game. The Hangar 6 DLC, however, would freeze briefly every few seconds and rendered the game nearly unplayable. The Bureau's combat puts you in control of William Carter, a rather generic protagonist with a gravelly voice. Conversations in the game are carried out with a radial menu lifted directly from Mass Effect. The dialogue isn't terribly interesting, and some of the characters facial animations appeared to not actually be finished. Their mouths move with odd robotic motions, and their eyes look eerily dead. Carter himself, and some of the other core characters have much better, albeit repetitive animations. The story is forgettable overall, but moves the game on well enough. It doesn't come anywhere close to the likes of Mass Effect though, and the fact that the developers chose to base their game design so heavily on Mass Effect is unfortunate given the weak story. Even still, the combat made the experience worthwhile.Combat in the Bureau is at it's core a cover shooter in the vein of Mass Effect or Gears of War. It also gives you a pair of squadmates and allows you to give direct orders to them. The rookies you start with only have one or two abilities, as well as a command to focus on a specific target, and move to a location. Choosing where to move your squadmates is where the game gets a lot of it's strategic depth. You have to take into account how long they'll be exposed for, how far the nearest ally is if they need a revive, where the enemies are, how much protection the cover offers, and how easily they can use their abilities from their location. Overall it makes for a far more interesting experience than your standard cover shooter. Abilities range from dropping mines, shield domes, artillery strikes, and others.The combat isn't perfect though. Your squadmates seem to move into stupid locations occasionally, either exposing themselves to unnecessary fire, going down somewhere difficult to revive them, or both. It's not quite clear why this happens, but it doesn't happen very often at least. The encounters feel somewhat repetitive, but they ramp up in difficulty at a good rate. The weapons are fairly standard for a cover shooter; human and alien variations of the standard rifle, pistol, sniper and so on. Enemies on the other hand provide a bit more variety, healing their allies, granting them shields, spawning new enemies, or even mind controlling your squadmates.The graphics generally look good, with a variety of scenes ranging from idyllic small towns to metallic alien structures. Some elements though stand out like a sore thumb. An ugly low res skybox in one of the first scenes of the game is jarringly bad to look at in stark contrast to the cutscene that precedes it. Other elements like a destroyed tank with an ugly texture and a low poly model, or the abyss below an alien tower filled with an ugly brown fog that would have been acceptable years ago, but looks disappointing today. The rest of the game, however, especially the weapon reload animations look and sound good.The Bureau's worst offense however, is sure to be a dealbreaker for some fans of the mainstream XCOM games. The only thing The Bureau has in common with XCOM itself is the aliens and the weapon types. Unlocking new weapons is done merely by picking them up off the ground rather than researching them. Dying only puts you back to the latest checkpoint, and while you can lose squadmates permanently if they bleed out in some difficulty settings, I'm fairly sure if you die yourself they'll be back with you at the last checkpoint. By removing research, permadeath, and forcing the player down a linear path, I'm sure some players will deem the game unworthy of the XCOM title. While these issues did grate on me at first, it was the combat that kept me playing and enjoying every minute of it. Even though the story is just average, it isn't particularly time consuming like it is in Mass Effect. While I feel the game could have played more to it's strengths, it was still well worth the time and money while on sale. I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this game to fans of Mass Effect, though fans of the classic XCOM games or Enemy Unknown will not enjoy it unless they also enjoy a good cover shooter.

A (poor) mix of Mass Effect gameplay with XCom universePlaying this game wasn't a horrible experiece, but wasn't a good one eighter.The only really good thing I can say about it is that it really captures the spirit of the Cold War times.-Buggy: at least 3 times I had to reload a chackpoint because the trigger wouldn't kick in;-Bad save system based on checkpoints;-Moral decision have almost null impact in the game (even at the ending where it SEEMS to change something). The truth is that this is a linear ""on the tracks game"" masked as more free decision thing.-There is very low customization options and there is no effort to create an emotional attachment with the characters;-The IA is pretty terrible, forcing you in some parts to to lower the game difficulty to get past them;-The user IA is REALLY terrible;-Combat is clumsy  (this one is hard to explain, the best way to say it is that in Mass Effect, running and shooting is much more ""fluid"" than in The Bureau XCOM;-Short list of sidequest with little to no meaning.I could list some other things. I admit it, maybe I placed the bets to high in this game expecting it to be like Mass Effect or XCOM - Enemy Unknown. But the truth is that this seems like a game that tried to much stuff for the budget they had and at the end we have only a superficial experience of what this ""stuff"" could really have been.

												The negative reviews for this game are mainly exaggerated and dumb. Many journalists and fans discredited the game BEFORE IT WAS EVEN RELEASED with the great argument:' A third-person-shooter for the XCOM-Franchise can't.' If most people hadn't be so prejudiced with this game, it would have gotten way better ratings. I admit the graphics of the game aren't good.I admit the story is kiiiind of weak and lacks pace and thrill. I admit the gameplay is a bit to easy for XCOM-Fanboys and Fangirls.BUT: It's still a nice game. The story is still okay, the gameplay is nice and easy to learn. THE GRAPHICS AREN'T SUCH A DISASTER. You can still have fun with this game, the atmosphere is nice and the 60s feeling is nice and a cool setting and variation. Especially the background in some levels look just hilarious. I have to mention that the atmosphere in the first introductionary level is F***ING INTENSE. The Cold War provides an awesome setting, but I'd would have liked a cooler soundtrack, with more epic or Rock n Roll songs in it. Another positive aspect of this game are the little investigations in the base of XCOM. They are little, easy and short missions, but they unlock sidemissions in the 'outside world', which is an awesome idea. So: If you don't want to pay 20€, wait until a sale. This game is really okay.			",80,1,0,1,6,1,3

												I knew The Bureau had some poor reviews, but the Xcom reboot was one of my favourite games of 2012, so I decided to take a chance. I wasn't expecting a great game, but I hoped the Xcom theme could provide some entertainment. I regret my decision.There are some moments when The Bureau feels like it has the potential to be a good game. There are a wide range of classes and abilities to choose for your squad members, which lays the groundwork for deep tactical combat. You have some freedom to choose which order to play side missions. Most of the familiar Xcom aliens appear, and the campaign lasts an impressive 15 hours.However, all this is completely undermined by some of the worst friendly AI I've seen for a long time, which prevents the combat from being enjoyable. In theory, you can slow down combat at any time and give orders to your two squadmates. In practice, they don't care about your orders. They will run away from cover at random times, leaving themselves vulnerable to attack, frequently resulting in them getting incapacitated. The player then has to quickly revive them before they bleed out and die permanently, which of course means you take massive damage trying to save them. The poorly placed checkpoint only save system didn't help my frustration.Even when they are alive, your squadmates rarely do anything useful. I refer to my screenshot where on one mission I got 95 of 104 kills. Every mission had a similar theme. I only started to feel comfortable when I'd got some squadmates up to level 4 (max level is 5), and gained powerful abilities like the laser turret and the hologram decoy. Plus every level up increases health, so the AI would stay alive a bit longer. But that is a case of too little, too late.I might recommend a game with poor gameplay if the story was entertaining, but the Bureau fails this too. Its a prequel set in the 1960's, but the continuity doesn't even make sense. During the course of the game you'll gain access to laser and plasma weapons, flying drones and psionic abilities. Meanwhile you'll encounter Sectoids, Mutons, Sectopods and Ethereals. But when the present day Xcom strategy game starts we don't have information about any of those things, and this is never justified.Furthermore, the dialogue is poor. Sentences feel like disconnected lines, instead of flowing like a natural conversation, more a fault of the script writers than the voice actors. Lip syncing during in-engine cutscenes is awful and distracting.My advice would be to skip The Bureau and just replay the other Xcom game(s) again.			",144,30,0,15,8,2,16

												The Bureau is an uninspired, and standardised third-person shooter in the vein of Gears of War, with little hints of the 'tactical' play of Mass Effect thrown in for flavour. Set in a parallel 1950s america, with many levels seeming to take place in the stereotypical midwest small towns popularised in so many UFO abduction stories, the player takes the role of a Secret Service agent tasked with delivering a mysterious artefact to the head of 'The Bureau', an unknown and oft-ridiculed section of the US government.Attempting to provide history for the X-COM project as present in the firaxis game, The Bureau toys with themes of sexism in organisations, loyalty, and the importance of self...all with the ham-fisted bashing on a keyboard one would expect of most popular shooters. It takes itself and it's cheesy encironment with far too much seriousness and not enough self-awareness to really make the slightly B-movie plotline work.I was actually impressed with the announce trailers for the original 'XCOM' first person shooter, and thought that while not an 'X-COM' game, it could have been an entertaining and uniue exploration of clandestine UFO investigation from the point of view of a squaddie or corporal. The numerous rewrites and alterations of the project's lifespan, and the apparent dusting under the rug after the success of Firaxis' 'XCOM; Enemy Unknown' have hurt this title.If the pre-order bonuses were still available, I would suggest buying this game only for the X-Com complete pack as a pre-order bonus. Unfortunately, without that particular enticement, I can only suggest to avoid this game unless you feel an unhealthy urge to open plot holes and experience painfully obvious twists in storytelling.

												Вы любите тактические игры ? Любите посидеть и поразмышлять о своих действиях, придумать какой нибудь план для победы над врагами ? Если да -  эта игра не для вас. Бюро представляли как тактический экшен, но самой тактики там кот наплакал, да же на самой высшей сложности игра не заставляет тактически думать, всего по одной причине - тут самые идиотские напарники! Им плевать что вы отдаёте им приказы, им нужно лишь несколько вещей - Высовыватся из укрытия, когда по ним стреляет куча врагов; Стоять на одном месте и пялится в прилетевшую гранату; Выбегать на босса с криками ""ВАААААГХ"" и пасть смертью храбрых за несколько секунд. Если бы игра не позиционировалась как тактический экшен, я бы не так сильно обращал на это внимание. На удивление, враги действительно умно себя ведут, действуют сообща, закидывают гранатами (Ваши напарники даже этого делать не умеют) и обходят с фланга. Геймплейно игра превращается в обычный шутан, аля Gears of War, где всю каманду тащит на себе игрок. На тяжелом уровне сложности, пока не появятся мощные способности - это просто мука. Во всем остальном игра хороша - отличнейшая графика; хороший саундтрек; и отличнейший сюжет и атмосфера. Очень правильно разработчики выбрали время действия игры - редко нам дадут поубивать пришельцев в 60-е года.

Рекомендую всем ознакомиться с игрой, только не ждите тактики от неё и все будет хорошо ;)			",614,142,15,101,29,3,60

												Ok,it's like this. Take Mass Effect. Dip in 1960s G-Man sauce and sprinkle lightly with XCOM tidbits. Fill with the fluffiest story you can sleep through and that's The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. What could've been a nice prequel to the XCOM games is instead a boring,soulless,buggy 3rd person cover shooter with a very ""been there,done that"" feel to it. You get the sniper rifle,you use cover,it's so by the numbers it's basically Counting with Elmo. Not even The Court,just Elmo. So,yeah,Mass Effect offers a better story and more customization options and more varity of companions. However,if you're looking for a 3rd rate shooter who's AI breaks if you go back out the enterence to the combat area and your snipers can shoot through walls,then by all means,enjoy.Update: As of recent patches,the game is now completely broken. What was once bad is made worse as it now lags and cracks and stutters all over. Really,don't buy this game unless you enjoy torturing yourself with everything that could concievably go wrong.

												♥♥♥♥♥Tracy meets the best of the X-Com franchise and fails miserably.  The environment they create is excellent until the characters speak.  Dialog tends to run on about less than important information.  Base management is virtually non-existant and the gameplay itself in tactical mode is mostly redundant and boring.  This game fails to create strategic value or tactical tension that is the hallmark of the X-Com series.  This is indie developer quality at best and worse, indie games tend to be more fun! Nothing about this game is great other than the environment and I would argue the gameplay actually takes away from that heavily.  The other thing is the game runs heavy on even high end systems for no discernable reason.  It is likely that the time to properly optimize this game was never made.  The best correlation to system demand is X-Rebirth which is simulating an entire universe of things happening per frame.  How The Bureau requires and equal amount of processing power is beyond me.  The AI isn't good at all.  Bypass this title entirely.  Even on sale for 10$ it isn't worth it.  Buy some DLC for XCom: Enemy Unknown or Within and have hours of entertainment.  Even the original release of Sword of the Stars II didn't have me wishing for a return policy with STEAM so badly.My Score: 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A cover-based shooter trying to blend itself with the tactical features of its strategy forefathers. Despite its messy development history it's now a decent game for a decent price. As long as you remember that The Bureau is an action spinoff you will have your fun.Pros* Managing your agents is cool and their capacities will make a difference considering you are not given enough ammo to work alone* The story lay down the foundations for the modern XCOM organization with a nice '60s twist* The underground base is quite alive (as long as you visit it once per main mission) with plenty of dialogs and little animationsCons* The gameplay is not varied and you will often yawn at seeing predictable chest-high walls and meeting the same enemies just with more and more health points* The IA of your teammates is pretty bad and will require you to micromanage them, but is overall tolerable if you stick to the Squaddie difficulty* The RPG elements are light with the game itself being rather linearSome polish would have been a welcome improvement but you can still see in the details that much love was poured into the game. It is also pretty easy to get most, if not all of the achievements!			",306,77,1,37,18,0,34

												A great prequel to the XCOM series.  Purely looking at it only as an action 3PS, with no prior interest in XCOM, you will probably not like it.  If you ignore expectations built up from playing other 3PS games (it is not pure 3PS, rather it is sort of halfway between the turn-based isometric XCOM games and a tactical command 3PS), and suspend your disbelief, allowing yourself to get immersed into this great backstory to the XCOM storyline, it's actually fairly enjoyable.  At the risk of comparing the two games (beause TB:XD is in a totally different league to X:E), I see the poor reaction to ""The Bureau: XCOM Declassified"" as somewhat similar to that of ""XCOM: Enforcer,"" people just don't know how to enjoy a game for its intended feel / storyline, and get too caught up in game mechanics!  That said, I think they do some interesting things with it.  Try it out if it's on special.  Enjoy!			",40,16,0,7,2,0,20

												Besides the setting, there is nothing more particularly interesting in this game. I really can't remember the last time I skipped cutscene dialogues, but I had to do it here because the story is just dull. I could have swallowed it if it was cheesy 60s alien cliche, but this is just plain dull. The gameplay is OK, simple and somewhat boring (in particular in the last quarter of the campaign when you spend more time walking down the alien ship's empty corridors than fighting), but eventually OK for a third person shooter with a pinch of tactical management.All in all, the game is a slap in the face to all X-COM fans out there (and I mean X-COM with a dash)!

												I wanted to like this game! It pushes several of my happy buttons, from the XCOM branding, to the Cold War paranoia, to the retrofuturistic aesthetic. This could have been the ambitious first entry in a new spin-off franchise... but unfortunately, nearly everything in the game is marred by a clear lack of polish. I could write about the outdated interface (no mission objectives onscreen or all the other nice little UI touches we've come to expect over the last 20 years), the poor level design (lots of railroading and impassable waist-high obstacles), or several other issues, but by far the worst offender is the combat system. Instead of a fluid, enjoyable experience like Mass Effect 2 or 3, the tactical squad combat is clunky, poorly explained, and extremely unforgiving. It's the heart of the game, and it simply isn't fun.Overall, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified isn't a bad game... just a mediocre one. It does nothing terribly, but nothing particularly well, either. I found myself simply grinding through each little combat set-piece in the hopes that I could reach a more rewarding part of the game, but eventually I just gave up -- my leisure hours are limited, and there are simply more entertaining ways to spend them.

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified hasn't been given the best reviews and there are reasons for that. It has a lot of the right parts to be a good game, unfortunately I feel they missed the mark on making it excellent and instead ended up making a slightly less than average game. Only worth it if you want the experience and if you get it for a discount.Combat:     - It is difficult at times to place your abilities such as mines and turrets, especially when the height changes.     - The shift key controls your sprint and also ducking into and around cover which can get finicky at times.     - While in the tactical command screen it is sensitive and swaps between characters a little too easily.Story:     - Not much to it.     - They don't emotionally pull you in or make you feel connected to any characters.     - Your choices don't seem to matter at all.

												I think this is an example of a game which has poor reviews for the wrong reasons. Like many, I'd just finished playing XCOM - Enemy Unknown and was hungry for a continuation of that. While still set in the XCOM 'universe', it's a very different style of game and many of the negative reviews will be because of that, which is unfair to what is actually a pretty good game. They've made a brave attempt at making a game which isn't a guaranteed money maker, and I think they've done a pretty good job. I love it when developers don't paint by numbers.It's a third-person shooter not dissimilar in gameplay to Mass Effect, though set in the swinging 60's (with a very 50's feel), you have 2 squadmates who you give commands to during Battle Focus (slo-mo), as you work your way through linear mission levels. Personally I'm not fussed by linear levels - I'll take them over non-linear ones which just give the illusion of choice to fill out gameplay time.The game itself is fairly short if you just go through the main missions, though if you're a completionist doing all the side missions and exploring the base properly, and going after achievements, you'll get roughly triple the game time to about 20-25 hours.The graphics are good, and the scenery and level design excellent. They've clearly put alot of work into quality over quantity, and I actually feel bad about not standing around too long to just look at what's been put into it, especially mid to late game. However, if your computer's falling behind on the ol' hardware department, you might find your framerate dropping noticeably in areas.Aliens are what you would expect from an xcom game, and I found the later game to get a bit easy due to a strong compliment of abilities. Still, I enjoyed all the combat, and if you're having trouble with your agents chasing after you when you try to flank the enemy, just manually move them to cover first so they aren't in follow mode.This game's not for everyone. Some will find the pace a bit slow, especially in the base, but honestly the game is 80% off at the time of writing this review (£2.99 ..$4.43 at current rate), which is an absolute steal for the work that's gone into it. If people reviewed the game removing both their expectations, and personal preference for what games they like, and instead based it on the quality of the game itself for its genre (which is what reviews should be based on, not personal taste), then it would be somewhere in the positives for sure.

												The only fact I've managed to declassify from The Bureau is that the game suffers from repetitive combat sequences with poor incentives to progress. Team AI and coordination is clunky and far from intelligent. I spent most of my time spamming squad regroup while just taking on everything by myself. However, if you're a patient soul, you'll come to realize that your squadmates will have powers that are well worth the wait. For completionists, you will have to grind your recruits up a significant amount to succeed in the game's side quests and recruit send-away missions. There isn't a diverse array of weapon options, with no customization options. While I'm sure that this game has a great deal of content in terms of its side quests and collectable discussions, there's just nothing wonderful or immersive about the story that grabbed me. Yes, the allure of a top secret agency is there and the core conflict is imminent. But what has always killed a narrative for me was how predictably static and hollow the protagonists were. Rather than present their information throughout the story, you have to go the extra mile and read about it from dossiers on their desks. As edgy as Carter comes across through his backstory, he loses all his charm when he begins to speak lines you've heard a million times before. The Bureau miscarried the merge of a tactical third-person shooter in what appeared to be a promising premise. It's tepid mechanics and bland characters justify the game's ranking of being mediocre to poor. Don't be fooled by it, even in a humble bundle.			",291,42,3,23,15,3,8

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified feels like a frustratingly incomplete mixture of Bioshock and Gears of War. This could have been a great game. Here are my specific gripes with the game:Some abilities are over-powered, others are underwhelming. Aiming doesn't seem to matter too much aside from headshots. Guns take a back seat to the abilities and you will spend much of combat waiting for cooldowns. Upgrades and items don't include important percentages so that you can determine which gear is best for your characters (this is fixed in the DLC). Levels are sprawling but often feel too sterile or empty. Many of the NPC interactions and other world building elements feel hollow and pointless.You know that point where you are halfway through a bag of potato chips, no longer hungry and filled with self-loathing, but you eat the rest anyway? I had a similar moment halfway through XCOM: The Bureau.			",53,2,0,2,3,0,8

												I went into this game expecting to hate it. I really wanted to hate it because of the name it carried and the fact it had departed so much from what the core of the series was actually about. But I just couldn't. It reminded me of all of those B-list sci-fi shows that were on television in re-run when I was younger and I'm a sucker for that era of science fiction. My one complaint as I began to play the game was laughably that I felt that they had a better design for the aliens before they tried to incorperate elements of the usual X-com lineup into the game. Back when they were stark and strange and unknowable. Shapes and blobs and infiltrations. Dark noises in the middle of the night and having to fight things you'd never hope to understand. That -- is what I wish this game would've kept more of.  That said? I enjoyed it. Friendly AI is . . . frustratingly bad, but it never really impeded my progress any. Voice acting was pretty good. Story was fantastic, with the one complaint I mentioned above. Buy it on a sale. It's seriously not a bad game, for what it is.			",224,44,0,21,9,2,30

The AI on harder difficulty really need to be improve but other then that it's a very good game game..Good Graphic, Great Story, 1960 dudes and killing aliens. Really not a typical XCOM game but good attempt by developer to venture out their comfort zone. Like I said before the only complain i had was the AI for your squadie they need to be improved a little bit instead of me hit space all the time to help them move.And yes i will recommend this game to all FPS fans but just forget about this as a typical XCOM game and consider it well.. Half life with NPC squadie and Some mass effect character powers. 80/100...Well. just finished the game so i will give it an update. The plot was a little twisted and strange toward the end and it gave me a bit mixed taste in my mouth. I wonder if they will attempt to do a The Bureau 2 since quite a bit things are left behind. I wonder.. should i endorse this game even though this game endorse alien genocide.			",2437,942,81,289,309,25,343

												Don't let the phrase X-Com in the title fool you, this is nothing like Enemy Unknown, in style, quality, or replayability. I had such high hopes for this game that I preordered it, picturing tactical combat against all the classic X-Com enemies. Basically, I wanted to be the soldiers I was sending to their doooms in Enemy Unknown. What I got was basically all the most boring parts of Mass Effect's combat system, and a story that couldn't be more forgettable. Combat isn't tactics, it's patience. It is incredibly hard to die, and if you do your completely replaecable squadmates will usually be able to revive you. Enemies take forever to die, most boss fights devolving into you running around looking for ammo as your teammates slowly tick down their gigantic health bars. The ability to customize your companions is very limited, you can only change their guns and add an enhancement item that reduces damage, cooldowns, etc. Oh, and you can change the color of their suits.     The story doesn't make you feel any sort of emotion, it's just Mission X and Agent Y, mixed with a 60's thematic and sci-fi cliches. The X-Com headquarters is kind of neat, but once you realize there is nothing to do there it loses some charm. Maybe it gets better in the last third of the game, but I have a hard time believing dessert will be excellent after spooning down so much gruel.     As I said, I was very high on this game based on the trailers and the excellence of its strategy counterpart, but there is nothing in the execution of this title that backed up that promise. Of my 6 hours, I don't think I had fun for more than 5-10 minutes, and I don't think I will ever play it again. I bought it at ~50 dollars, and a month later it was on sale for 19.99.   That is not an accident.			",89,21,1,44,20,2,30

												It's like Mass Effect except with awful writing, voice acting and AI, plus a distinct lack of choices and any incentive to stray from the narrow linear path.Here is an example of how broken it is. When a team member goes down, they can be revived by a colleague. During this process, the healer is completely immune from damage. They can be getting blasted and smashed by all manner of enemies, but won't be hurt. Of course, once they have finished reviving their colleague, they can be promptly killed - and now the former patient can become invulnerable healer. It's utter nonsense and terrible design.As for having the same button to run, take cover and leap over said cover - well, it just screams console port.Oddly enough, the game improves quite a bit in the late stages. The story finally starts to get a bit interesting, if uninspired, and gameplay actually becomes quite frenetic and challenging. It requires battling through mediocrity to get there, though.

The combat is good though the cover mechanic can be sensitive. The strategy mechanic, called Battle perception I think, is pretty cool and simple and allows for rapid issuing of orders to the squad. The plot is pretty awesome, I would say more involved than the other Xcom titles right now. I'm hoping to see a cross-over soon.			",216,99,2,35,56,3,77

												Animations: 5/10Graphics: 8.5/10Storyline: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Overall: 8.1/10In this game you play as Ex Agent Carter during the year 1962, in the starting wake of an alien invasion which leads to the formation of an organization known as the Bureau.For being in production since late 2006 i belive this game could have been a bit better asthetically and functionally than it is.The A.I. used for the NPC Teammates is rather scetchy at best as you find yourself having to babysit them 99% of the battle, on the plus side they do come with various abilities and classes as well as weapons which if used properly can easily beat enemy encounters.Graphically this game is above top notch. being released during the end of last gen and including the Nvidia PhysX particle effects it really reaches the bar set by others. though it does take a pretty decent PC to run everything maxed out with DX11.Animations during in game scenes (and some out game scenes) could have been brushed up on. Characters seem too chopy at some points, and too stiff at others. Aside from this if animations don't really bug you too much the dialog and V.O.s were done rather nicely and do set some justice to in game cinimatics.Gameplay is rather tricky to get the hang of if you aren't into Tactical TPS games. you controll your two NPCs as well as yourself and must utilize all the teams abilities and each classes strengths and weaknesses to guide them to victory. that being said by themselfs the NPC's are rather useless as stated earlier. but given you can practically controll their every move it makes for interesting game. Another mechanic that's rather interesting is agents, you must keep a ""roster"" stocked of agents all starting at level 1 and choose weather to rotate them, send some on npc only missions, or pick favorites and take only them at all times, as a tactics based game though you are also given multiple classes to used based on the missions and can even swap them out mid mission as needed. adding to the system is deaths, a consiquence to not coordinating your agents and keeping them alive is once an agent is down, he is gone. reguardless of level and abilities thus leaving you only to choose another agent to take his place.Storyline to this game is rather immersive. you can find info on NPC's and current situations laying around, and get side missions. The main missions all of course tie in as any storyline based game should. but getting into it is rather touch and go. they start by throwing you right into the start of the invasion and piece the events before it as you go along. but after getting past the beginning it smoothens out as you play through the rest.Overall though I belive this installment to the XCOM series was done rather nicely. given the time they had i belive it could have been slightly better but as it stands is a pretty strong release and in personal opinion a great game to play. I would deffinately recommend giving this game a shot if you're into Tactical TPS'.			",55,1,0,7,7,0,0

												Despite all the bad reviews, I really enjoyed The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. It's not a perfect game and many things could have been done different, but I had a lot of fun beating the game and it's nice to go back again to the Xcom universe, even if the game has, gameplay-wise, nothing to do with the former games of the franchise. Giving commands was neat, the controls were okay, the voice acting was excellent, the story was okaysh at first, and awesome at the end and during my almost 20 hour playthrough I encountered just one bug, which was easily fixed by reloading the last checkpoint. I played it on the hardest difficulty, so I am not sure this always applies, but the fights were sometimes just too long. Even on the hardest difficulty, it was not as hard as I imagined it would be, but you do have to plan your men movements and always stay behind cover. The variety of enemies is nice and the abilities in the field were a lot of fun to use and combine. Combat was similar to the one in Mass Effect, but there was almost no interaction with anyone in the base and when there was, it was pretty boring. I liked the layout of the maps, though, and how they were all very detailed and were usually used to convey little stories, which can be ignored completely if you want to rush to the end though. Yes, the maps are certainly linear, but I think they were supposed to be that way, just as in most games.So, although the game may not be perfect, I had a lot of fun playing it and defending Earth once again against the aliens. The story got awesome towards the end and it actually leaves you thinking about it. So yeah, I definitely recommend The Bureau: Xcom Declassified... as long as you understand this has little to do with Xcom: Enemy Unknown. They may share the Xcom part, but whereas EU is completely innovative and one of my favorite games for a reason, The Bureau is just an average shooter that will grant you about 15 hours of shooting and fun. Both great games, but completely different genres. I say go for it!			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

												An excellent third person tactical shooter where there's a lot of emphasis on giving the right orders at the right time to your agents.You play as William Carter who at the start of the game is delivering a very important briefcase to the director of the Bureau of Operations and Command, Myron Faulke, at Groom Range when he is suddenly attacked in the room he was given while waiting to go inside the facility by a female officer who starts discharging a strange black substance from her eyes before she turns her attention to the briefcase that then explodes in a blinding white light that completely and utterly incinerates the infected female officer and knocks Carter out, who later wakes up with the gun wound he sustained inexplicably healed.But that is only the start of Carter's problems as an unknown enemy force has attacked the facility and now he must try and get to Faulke and find out just what is going on.This game doesn't go easy on you, even on the easiest setting, as the enemies are extremely relentless and cunning as they will attempt to flank you, toss grenades to flush you out of cover and many other tactics to eliminate you.You can also send your agents out on dispatch missions that can give you access to new technology, a new recruit and other things that can turn the tide of this secret war in your favor.There's also several documents and photos scattered about the base and mission areas that can provide a bit more backstory aside from talking to the agents and personal.The Bureau borrows a lot of elements from the Mass Effect games, especially when it comes to how you give orders to the agents, the various powers that you will unlock and many others, but I feel like its done a bit better here then in the Mass Effect games, especially considering the setting of the game itself.This is without a doubt one of the most interesting and fun tactical shooters for quite sometime to be released on home computers and consoles alike and I highly recommend it, especially to those who are fans of the XCOM series.

												First impression review. Might write a more detailed one later. This game... isn't good. But it's the really frustrating sort of ""not good"" because there's potential brilliance in it. The story would be good thanks to the environment and detail, but the pacing is awful and the dialogue sounds like it was badly translated from another language. Since X-Com doesn't have much story to begin with it needed time to build the pacing and atmosphere that it didn't give itself. The early game is also grossly imbalanced  since your health is much too low to survive for long and your rookies (beyond the intro) start with no remarkable abilities and won't even do much to defend themselves without being told. The interface is slippery and unintuitive, at least with a mouse and keyboard with some truly baffling choices for keybindings. You can rebind some keys and not others, and guess what? There is no removing ""cancel orders"" from backspace. All this said I'd still eagerly recommend the game to a student of game design curious about how to come *close* to something great while still screwing it up. I also think once you adjust to its crap factor, I'm willing to bet it's a lot of fun and rewards creative tactics. It really could have used more development time and polish.

												I really enjoyed playing this game, especially since I'm a huge fan of the XCOM franchise. First of all, they've done a really good job on the setting. The game really gave me the feeling of being immersed in the sixties. And although the levels are linear and offer almost no opportunities for exploration the atmosphere can clearly be felt. The game features the squad tactics we are familiar with but gives them more depth by controlling the squad as a member of the team. Sadly, you can only take two more men with you. At times, I felt I really could use an aditional field agent here and there. And this considering there are four classes to choose your agents from. Plus, you cannot modify the agents with nothing except weapons and backpacks, that give the agents different buffs like increased health and increased ability range. Speaking of weapons, there's not a great deal you can do with them in terms of modifications and/or research. It makes sense from the story point of view but it kinda doesn't give you the XCOM feeling. Still this is a good game if you want to play a squad-tactics third person shooter and shoot some alien invaders back to their homeworld.			",74,6,0,24,4,0,48

If they had just dropped the ""xcom"" from the title and went with a general ""aliens attack"" theme, the result (and reviews) would undoubtedly have been better.I haven't played the game through yet, but overall, I've enjoyed it as much, if not more, than the firaxis xcom game (which ended up feeling like grinding..)

												I recommend this game at a good price (less than $10). It was a bit shorter than I expected but still fun. There are many missions you can select from back at HQ but each mission is very linear with one route to follow. When you meet up with the aliens then it opens into an arena type area to move around.  Having to run around inside HQ to meet up with different folks was was much more irritating that just selecting the part of the base you wanted to visit. I also found myself skipping a lot of the dialog as it went on for too long but at least you have the option to do that. Overall I'd give it a 6 out 10 rating. Nothing special, very little re-playability, but I enjoyed it enough my first play through to feel I did not waste my $10.			",82,22,1,30,31,1,67

												Incredibly under-rated game. Sure it's not the best game ever made in the 3rd person shooter genre but it's obvious that a lot of time and effort went into making this game authentic looking to fit the 1950's style retro sci-fi theme.  It's got a nice easy to use command system and the battles are satisfying. The visuals are the games best asset and for that alone it warrants the games purchase. I bought it at full price when it first came out and have played through it twice. No regrets for paying full price either! The insane sales this game has seen would be FOOLISH to pass up. The only thing I really wish it had was multiplayer specifically co-op... Co-op would've been an awesome addition to this already fun game. Well the game tanked and we'll never see another which is too bad so I highly recommend you give this one a shot, you really can't go wroing with the price. I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10.

												Well i was looking forward to a mass effect type of game in first person, and now im cured of it :).Game play and AI feels like early access, the tactical aspect that works so nice in the other xcom game and in the mass effects games, does not work as well here. I end up making 70% of all kills and the battles feel repetitive.Not all bad: It is a decent first person shooter the game looks fine and it is on sale for less then 4 euro's , which i think is worth it as long as your fine with a medoicre story and not very tactical battles.Finished the game in 19 hours,   overall:   6 / 10			",115,46,3,25,3,3,18

												Is this game good?Well thats a matter of opinion and in my opinion it was very good it has a similar feel to mass effect series were you controller a commander and you issue orders by pulling up a abilty wheel but still maintains the XCOM story which if you new to the series you might be more open but wheather you a old school fan or a newcomer to the series I would recommend this at a 8/10			",221,48,3,53,27,2,36

												The Bureau is a bad XCOM. Even with the mediocre storylines they XCOM games were fun because they had solid gameplay and high replayability. The Bureau doesn't have any of these. It's very linear with little to none RPG elements and side missions. It lacks the feel of ""progressing"" when you play the story.Gameplay is much simpler than Enemy Unknown--more like a shooter, it has a faster pace but it was dumbed down too much and it struggles between an action game and a strategy game.You can have (only) 2 companions and you can give orders by slowing the game down. Command screen UI is simple and useful enough but it has a few control issues when you play with keyboard/mouse. Your squadmates' AI is c**ppy, they just die when you don't give them orders for 10 secondsPros:-60's theme with aliens and conspiracies-Nice atmosphere-Simple UI and command system-Fast gameplay is good if you want a shooter gameCons:-Fast gameplay is bad if you want a strategy game, it's oversimplified and dumbed down-Upgrades and progressing are weak-Story isn't so exciting-Teammates usually become bullet magnets and die if you don't command them-Devs made the worst lip-sync ever in gaming history-It doesn't have the good part in XCOM: Enemy Unknown where you build a good squad and try to protect all of them against powerful alien forces-Many audio problems-Doesn't have much replayability value-Repetitive after some pointI think The Bureau's potenitals were wasted and it became worse and worse in long ""development hell"" that involved multiple studios. If you didn't play any XCOM games before, you should buy Enemy Unknown, not this. If you're a hardcore XCOM fan, it'll probably be a disappointment for you.  If you're looking for an action-TPS, you can find better games in Steam. Worth a try only if it's on sale.			",70,10,5,10,10,0,3

												All in all this was a pretty good game. The controls could have been mapped better and there could have been a bit more done for the storyline. There should have been a bit more done with the Russians as it was a Cold War era game. There also could have been a wider range of human weapons and the recruitment seemed very limited.Once you get past that the game does require a lot of tactical flexibility and a bit of fast thinking (I played through on Veteran the first time). With a limited squad size it forces you to pick, choose, and design your tactics for every occasion. The storyline was a bit short but it did do a good job of sucking you in. I found it to be a good first attempt at the game in this style and will be hoping that they do a bit more with the game down the road.			",108,6,0,22,17,0,37

												Despite all the bad reviews, I really enjoyed The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. It's not a perfect game and many things could have been done different, but I had a lot of fun beating the game and it's nice to go back again to the Xcom universe, even if the game has, gameplay-wise, nothing to do with the former games of the franchise. Giving commands was neat, the controls were okay, the voice acting was excellent, the story was okaysh at first, and awesome at the end and during my almost 20 hour playthrough I encountered just one bug, which was easily fixed by reloading the last checkpoint. I played it on the hardest difficulty, so I am not sure this always applies, but the fights were sometimes just too long. Even on the hardest difficulty, it was not as hard as I imagined it would be, but you do have to plan your men movements and always stay behind cover. The variety of enemies is nice and the abilities in the field were a lot of fun to use and combine. Combat was similar to the one in Mass Effect, but there was almost no interaction with anyone in the base and when there was, it was pretty boring. I liked the layout of the maps, though, and how they were all very detailed and were usually used to convey little stories, which can be ignored completely if you want to rush to the end though. Yes, the maps are certainly linear, but I think they were supposed to be that way, just as in most games.So, although the game may not be perfect, I had a lot of fun playing it and defending Earth once again against the aliens. The story got awesome towards the end and it actually leaves you thinking about it. So yeah, I definitely recommend The Bureau: Xcom Declassified... as long as you understand this has little to do with Xcom: Enemy Unknown. They may share the Xcom part, but whereas EU is completely innovative and one of my favorite games for a reason, The Bureau is just an average shooter that will grant you about 15 hours of shooting and fun. Both great games, but completely different genres. I say go for it!			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

												I had really high hopes for this game, but it unfortunately hits all of my pet peeves for a 3rd person shooter. Friendly AI is not smart enough to handle combat without significant micro management which is extremely difficult to manage in the super slow motion tactical orders mode.To be fair the alien AI isn't any better, however it hardly matters since even your basic enemies require far more damage to neutralize than is reasonable considering your ammunition capacity, and the fact that your own ability to take damage is nil.

												An excellent third person tactical shooter where there's a lot of emphasis on giving the right orders at the right time to your agents.You play as William Carter who at the start of the game is delivering a very important briefcase to the director of the Bureau of Operations and Command, Myron Faulke, at Groom Range when he is suddenly attacked in the room he was given while waiting to go inside the facility by a female officer who starts discharging a strange black substance from her eyes before she turns her attention to the briefcase that then explodes in a blinding white light that completely and utterly incinerates the infected female officer and knocks Carter out, who later wakes up with the gun wound he sustained inexplicably healed.But that is only the start of Carter's problems as an unknown enemy force has attacked the facility and now he must try and get to Faulke and find out just what is going on.This game doesn't go easy on you, even on the easiest setting, as the enemies are extremely relentless and cunning as they will attempt to flank you, toss grenades to flush you out of cover and many other tactics to eliminate you.You can also send your agents out on dispatch missions that can give you access to new technology, a new recruit and other things that can turn the tide of this secret war in your favor.There's also several documents and photos scattered about the base and mission areas that can provide a bit more backstory aside from talking to the agents and personal.The Bureau borrows a lot of elements from the Mass Effect games, especially when it comes to how you give orders to the agents, the various powers that you will unlock and many others, but I feel like its done a bit better here then in the Mass Effect games, especially considering the setting of the game itself.This is without a doubt one of the most interesting and fun tactical shooters for quite sometime to be released on home computers and consoles alike and I highly recommend it, especially to those who are fans of the XCOM series.

												This is a squad-based action game similar to Mass Effect so if you expect it to be just like XCOM: Enemy Unknown you may be disappointed, it is not turn-based tactics on a grid. That said, it is a good game in its own right and focuses much more heavily on the story and character development than its tactics counterpart. There are still different classes and a leveling system of sorts in which you can choose bonuses or upgrades similar to the leveling in Enemy Unknown. The story reveals a lot more about the background of XCOM but don't expect all your questions to be answered either.Hangar 6 R&D - Definitely worth the cost, you get several extra missions to play as DaSilva and take on some more aliens. If you completed the main story and are looking for some more of the same then I recommend this. Don't expect a lot of new content or anything though, it's the same weapons and aliens. The only really new things are the missions and story, and DaSilva's perks are kind of a mix but mostly familiar. This campaign runs entirely separate from the regular campaign (you start a whole new file) so it won't interfere or matter where you are in the regular story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Contrary to most other reviews, I think this game is amazing.

It's probably not worth the current $30, but I got Enemy Unknown and this for $8 during the summer sale and it is definitely worth that.PROS- Great gameplay- In my opinion, a great team control system- Decent storyline- How it has some of the same aliens as other XCOM gamesCONS- Short campaign, could have been made longer and better- Strange conversation system- How you cannot go back to this base after finishing the game (to do side missions)VERDICTIf it goes on sale for under $15, I would say get it.8/10.

												While the game has some janky elements (a few bugs, sounds not triggering and in one instance I had to restart a checkpoint since my ride didn't turn up) it's a fairly solid game that has some neat story elements. The 60s setting is a plus as well; on the harder difficulty setting combat required a fair amount of tactical manuevring and I found myself using the squad command features in every fight which takes it above a gimmick.If you can overlook some lack of polish, The Bureau is an interesting take on the XCOM genre and gives its own spin on the franchise pretty well. It's a shame some stalwharts of the series couldn't make an appearence but otherwise it's a good game and worth a play if you're a fan of both the series and action games in general.

												Mass Effect but with a 60s art style. Teammate AI is a mess with them choosing to take cover in front of enemies or keep running around doing nothing unless you decide to issue commands for them every single second, thankfully this gets slightly better once they level up and can take more damage, and once you level up a few times in which the game becomes a total cakewalk. Other than that the combat is alright and can even become ~~intense~~ sometimes in harder difficulties. The storyline is a mess; outside the twist near the end it's very disjointed with the game assuming you know things you haven't been told yet (your character acts as if he knows these things too) and some characters vanishing two levels from the end of the game and never being mentioned again. Like I mentioned before the entire game plays and feels like Mass Effect but set in the 60s (there's even a base you can walk around in and talk to people after missions). I liked the art style a lot and it kept me playing until the end, but the game itself is kind of a mess due to it being stuck in development hell for 5+ years. Even so it's not Aliens Colonial Marines/Duke Forever horrible garbage, just average. If you think the setting looks interesting and want a slightly strategical third person shooter (think Brother in Arms and Mass Effect as previously mentioned) buy it when it's on sale for u$20 and you'll have fun. Hopefully it'll get a sequel in the future that fixes the issues it has (but it bombed so it won't).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Was really suprised that this game was good! I actually enjoyed it a hell of a lot.My first experience with the XCOM franchise was the 2012 game, which I also enjoyed a whole lot. I would say that The Bureau is a fairly accurate translation of XCOM into a 3rd person shooter. You can give commands on the field, cover is very much essential as is position on the battle field. Even the way missions are seperated into side missions and main story missions, giving the game a similar pace to XCOM (shorter missions taking anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, and the longer ones up to over an hour). Of course in depth this game differs from XCOM in that you will not be maintaining the base yourself, doing research, your boss does that. You simply go out and shoot dudes and command the field and♥♥♥♥♥♥The games weaknesses mostly revolve around the plot in my opinion. It's suprisingly good in parts, but does get ridiculous at times. It crosses the suspension of disbelief line a few to manty times.But the game has a lot of strengths that I don't think it was given enough credit for. The shooting feels great, the weapons are really cool, and the field commands just make you feel powerful and responsible for your squad. The setting is also fantastic, a really slick ""Mad Men"" vibe. So give this game a chance. It is the XCOM experience for people who might not be into hardcore strategy games, and that's ok. Get it on sale!Also: It works on Nvidia Shield			",376,103,12,21,30,8,17

If this was the game they intended to launch instead of the remake, it would have killed the franchise.With that behind us, the game is pretty decent and worth a little more than the 5 bucks I paid for it.The game plays like a more tactical Mass Effect 2 in 1950's America. You control your character in a 3rd person camera and boss around two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI minions that must be somewhat micromanaged. The story is ok and the graphics were well done.			",195,41,1,48,48,1,73

												I picked this game up for 2.99 so I am taking that into account in this review, and I think it is probably even worth full price.The game is, in a nut-shell a poor man's Mass Effect set in the Xcom universe's version of the 60's. The atmosphere is good, and the game itself is 'ok' in so far that it is almost good at a lot of things. It doesn't quite manage to pull off what it wants to though, but still falls into the 'ok' category.Most of what I am about to say is negative, because the game is so close to being good that I am disappointed in how it turned out, but I would still say buy the game - especially if you are a fan of xcom or mass effect, or perhaps only if you fall into those camps.Combat is tough, at least early on which is where I am, because you are vastly outgunned and frequently find enemies that you can hardly hurt. You are also forced (Pretty close to forced anyway) into an Alien shotgun if you want to kill those enamies, and personally I hate shotguns. I expect when you unlock more guns the game will improve, but I haven't made it through that far yet.The big issue with combat for me is that when you bring up the orders menu the camera isn't the most responsive, and since time isn't fully paused it can lead to you giving messed up orders (Such as sending one man left and the other right when you want them both down the same flank).AI is also pretty poor too, especially for your own team who have a bad habit of getting their heads blown off when they should be in cover.Character development is a miss since you only have one progression tree to go down. Why you go down that tree makes sense, but I like more options in my games.The other miss is the research element from the base xcom series, here you just find the odd gun lying around. They make an explanation for why you can pick up some but not other, but it is a bit half hearted.So overall there is a good game trying to get out from under a not quite there exterior, worth playing, worth the £10-15 they are asking, but probably not much more, Go in knowing what you are getting, and you will come out with hope for The Bureau 2 (If they ever make it) rather than disappointment at this one.

												Playing this game was like picking out your favorite flavor of peanut butter & jelly sandwich and getting pickles & sardines instead.  THIS. IS. NOT. XCOM.  It has the name and some of the elements but ultimately it's a huge disservice. This is the game that when it was announced and it's game elements revealed, the fans of the franchise threw up in their mouth a little bit and promptly told 2K the exact texture and flavor of it. They still proceeded to pour this puke flavored goop into a sack with the X-Com logo roughly hand drawn in fecal matter.TL;DR Version:All fan-rage aside, this is a small squad, real-time, cover based, third/first person shooter game with a super slow-mo system for giving commands and using abilities. One of those horrid fusions between fast paced action and strategy that always feels forced and awkward made worse by terrible controls. It has a linear and gag-inducing story with some side missions for plot add-ons with unlikeable, unengaging characters.The mechanics:The controls are clunky and difficult to be precise with since this is a badly done console port, but even if I had a controller for my PC they would still be obnoxious. The movement and area targeting cursor is more like an entity in that you have to 'jump' the off map elements or steer it around objects like a drunken water buffalo to get it where you want it to go. Individual unit targeting is done with a visually jarring 'thermal view' from your character's point of view that is annoying to use and confusing when enemies overlap from your forced perspective. They clearly favored style choices over a useable interface.Your NPC team mates are rather suicidal and often entirely unhelpful.  They never stay in place when sniping or providing suppressing fire and you have to constantly re-issue move commands. I found myself shouting ""NO YOU NINNY, GO BACK WHERE YOU WERE!"" at the screen in frustration several times as I try to flank the enemy like they teach you to do in the tutorial phase. They are also distance-leashed to your main character so if you get too far away from them they break cover and frequently get splattered by a turret or hoard of enemies coating their position in plasma fire.  Alternately when you want them to move, they're slow to comply and take the worst possible path unless you stage their movements out step by step and even then, (!!!) they often still shove their stupid faces into the barrels of enemy weapons.They have this LOVELY habit of bum-rushing giant aliens that promptly curb stomp their squishy heads into red paste rather than using the sniper or assault rifle they're equipped with from range, no matter their behavior settings. They also love to dive on to grenades as if they were at a belly flop competition event, which if it saved you or your other NPC, might make sense, but usually just makes you spam the revive command at the other one if they didn't get taken out as well. Their combat abilities are laughable unless they are targeting something weak or using their special skills. You spend half the game at least either reviving them or being revived yourself, so it made sense that that mechanic was as terrible as possible. You're limited to 2 of these chuckleheads on a mission, thus forcing you to choose which skill set you want with you, often depriving yourself of tactical choices more appropriate for the battlefield. Meanwhile, the rest either are dispatched on non-playable missions to gather resources, NPC's, or unlock new weapons just so they appear to be useful instead of waiting for one of your more frequently used characters to die.On the subject of weapons, your squad mates are limited to a single weapon type that 'fits' their 'class', just so they can shoe horn weapon skills in rather than allow you more customization of your squad to your tastes.  You are constantly out of ammo and you're locked from going back to pick up any you skipped before the next fight.  Despite combat being the main focus of the game, you refuse to carry more than 3 clips of ammo and enemies frequently take at least one full clip to kill, even with the sniper rifle, as you have to break their shields, take down their armor and THEN you can shoot them in the head.  Your NPC's bring unlimited ammo but refuse to share with you of course.  You're forced to comb the battlefield to pick up more from downed enemies, but often you end up swapping to a less desireable gun just so you can kill something. The random ammo boxes sprinkled around are usually in inconvenient locations, forcing you to dive out into the kill zone to retrieve. The combat is reduced to 'attack the weak spot for massive damage' in most cases, especially boss fights with a tedious cycle of hiding in cover between volleys of spam fire and waiting for it to power up and expose it's tender bits.Story:The main plot is just bad. There's a 'zombie' element that is slightly creepy, but ultimately bland, unsatisfying and inconsistent. The use of the 50's time period was made worthless by using modern day slang in the dialogue. While every character is voiced, the conversation trees are irritating to navigate, often making you listen to the main character say the same thing several times just to hear all of the choices, fortunately you can skip it, but if you're not careful you'll have to repeat the conversation AGAIN if you accidentally skip one you wanted to hear. There was an annoying blend of too much exposition and not enough.  Things you wanted to know more about were left vague or skimmed over while trivial elements were expounded on at exhaustive length.The aliens were bad mockeries of the original concepts in some cases with a few new additions.  Sillicoids went from being tough, rocky tank-class monsters to fart-joke comic relief dispatched with a single punch and generally just used as an annoyance or a 'Boo' scare during cut scenes. Mutons went from being numerous foot soldiers to single huge, plodding, damage-soaking monsters that walk at you in a straight line and again eat up all your ammo trying to kill. In the place of Muton foot-soldiers you now have a new race of aliens that are the majority of your opponents and come in many different flavors of annoying; Cloaked, minion-summoning, shield buffers, and snipers as well as just grunts with guns.  Sectoids went from intelligent, psychic, physically weak 'greys' to more comic relief, even to the point of having them thrown out as target practice at the shooting range. The worst was still the Etherials. Used as a plot device somewhere between ""Gaia"" type entities and possession-demons rather than their former glory as the very powerful psychic combatants.I got this game for free and generally treated it as a satire on the X-Com franchise. I have no interest in replaying it again, unlike the original and the newer remake, the story and mission choices are limited and uninteresting and have little relevance or impact on the plot. If you want a good game, buy the remake or get the original. I never want to see a sequel or DLC for this game. I advise against paying for this X-Com decorated vomit-bag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My experience with XCOM games started with XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It was a great game! I recently saw a sale with The Bureau for only about 4 bucks, so I decided to pick it up. Knowing it was different than XCOM, I was a little leary of it being worth playing but hey, it was only 4 bucks. Man was this a diamond in the rough! I'm quite familiar with (and happen to like) 3rd person shooters. So this game was very comfortable for me. On that of that, I loved Enemy Unkown and the strategy part was similar. You probably know by now The Bureau isn't turned based, but you can significantly slow down time while you issue commands. I'm not sure why the meta score is only 66/100. I give this game a good 87 - 92 out of 100. I would have been satisfied paying 30 bucks for it. If you like Enemy Unkown and don't mind 3rd person shooter action, I recommend trying this one out. Especially if it goes on sale again!			",162,60,1,31,6,4,26

												The concept of this - creating an FPS out of a different genre whilst retaining a number of elements from the original - reminded me of Command & Conquer: Renegade (anybody else remember that?). I recall the fun of walking around and in a Hand of Nod and being pretty excited about it. Decent game, that, though a bug meant I never did finish it. Anyway, this takes some of the things we know and love about X:Com (a base, an Avenger, Sectoids, laser and plasma weapons etc) and turns it into a Mass Effect-lite squad-based shooter. You have companion agents, some rudimentary squad management and abilities and (limited) command in the field. I say limited because, whilst you can move your teammates to exploit flanking opportunities, as soon as you move, they move with you, thus negating any positioning you set-up - the AI for them isn't great. It's far from perfect - it's not exactly a looker, there isn't a great deal going on with the environments (it's small-town America, a farm or an alien base pretty much), there's not anything to actually anything to do in the base and it's never anything more than walk forward, shoot, walk some more on missions. Still, I found this to be quite fun. The story was decent, though completely silly, there is variety in the skills you and your teammates get, numerous weapons (though you'll probably stick to 2 or 3 favourites) and the various systems all work. Given that game had a rather torturous development it turned out ok; at least, for the £3 or so I got it for, I certainly got value for money.			",110,49,0,39,8,0,26

												It's not as interesting as I thought. But it does add on more story to the X-COM universe. It's neither a First Person Shooter nor a strategy game. It's more of an ability-aiming/timing game. The world is really very dead and the most interactivity you have is opening a door.PROS1. StoryExtends the story for X-COM. Supposedly, if you were to join the 2 stories together. Earth knew about the aliens in the 60's, but kept it secret. In the 21st century, the Aliens came back and for some reason, X-COM had to redo all their efforts again.CONS1. RepetitiveEvery map is approximately a hide and shoot. Use your ability, hide, shoot and rinse and repeat.2. InteractivityYou can't intereact with the world. Everything is like a wall. Most NPCs are lamp posts.3. WeaponsJust take the Alien weapons instead of human weapons.4. Slow-timeNot exactly interesting. You need to use it to activate your abilities.5. DLC3 DLCs on top of this game. It's really a profit squeezing experiment where they give you a very low level game and expect players to buy more DLC to ""complete"" the game.6. Aiming SystemGrenades don't work well with the aiming system. Can't go past obstacles properly. Powers such as Artillery don't aim well as you have to navigate a bombardment point that is stuck to the floor, causing you to move up and around objects to reach your desired location.

												Is it a good game? Yes. Do I wholeheartedly recommended it? It depends.Don't let the whiny fans throw you off: this is a good game. Now don't get me wrong, it isn't without it's flaws, partially due to how short it is for what was once a $50 dollar game. I feel that it was anything but worth that price tag, so when the price came down, I was pretty pleased.In my opinion, the gameplay was fun, but it's biggest flaw was it's linearity and roller-coaster flow of missions. The thing that makes XCOM: Enemy Unknown so great is how no experience is the same. You could've started your HQ anywhere in the world, and the missions you are given, despite having the same map spreadout, always felt unique and random in their own way. This game would be much better if a tactical interface was included; like being able to choose where XCOM HQ is, like in New York City or Los Angeles, each with their own different bonuses. I feel that the most needed change the games would've benefited from would be each mission being unique: I.E., 120 maps, different objectives, can only keep one area in line between three. While you begin dealing with these threats, you can research numerous ""perks"" in a sense - not that you can get these weapons, but benefits that'll come from making your plasma guns hurt more, to other tech that'll help advance the story.Make no mistake, Major Operations will still be there: however, it'd be awesome if the story progresses as you research technology while you deal with the threat across the nation. That alone would make the game that much fresher.Overall, this is a good game, but it's linearity and lack of depth understandably dissapointed a lot of fans. I just felt that I should write this review to show how it would've been better. Overall, a good game, but not perfect. Really, it's your taste if you want to buy it or not.			",29,4,0,7,3,2,10

												I picked this game up for 2.99 so I am taking that into account in this review, and I think it is probably even worth full price.The game is, in a nut-shell a poor man's Mass Effect set in the Xcom universe's version of the 60's. The atmosphere is good, and the game itself is 'ok' in so far that it is almost good at a lot of things. It doesn't quite manage to pull off what it wants to though, but still falls into the 'ok' category.Most of what I am about to say is negative, because the game is so close to being good that I am disappointed in how it turned out, but I would still say buy the game - especially if you are a fan of xcom or mass effect, or perhaps only if you fall into those camps.Combat is tough, at least early on which is where I am, because you are vastly outgunned and frequently find enemies that you can hardly hurt.

												This is a squad-based action game similar to Mass Effect so if you expect it to be just like XCOM: Enemy Unknown you may be disappointed, it is not turn-based tactics on a grid. That said, it is a good game in its own right and focuses much more heavily on the story and character development than its tactics counterpart. There are still different classes and a leveling system of sorts in which you can choose bonuses or upgrades similar to the leveling in Enemy Unknown. The story reveals a lot more about the background of XCOM but don't expect all your questions to be answered either.Hangar 6 R&D - Definitely worth the cost, you get several extra missions to play as DaSilva and take on some more aliens. If you completed the main story and are looking for some more of the same then I recommend this. Don't expect a lot of new content or anything though, it's the same weapons and aliens. The only really new things are the missions and story, and DaSilva's perks are kind of a mix but mostly familiar. This campaign runs entirely separate from the regular campaign (you start a whole new file) so it won't interfere or matter where you are in the regular story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Contrary to most other reviews, I think this game is amazing. I agree that it shouldn't have the XCOM name, as it is far from the strategical gameplay of Enemy Unknown, but it really is a good TPS. It's probably not worth the current $30, but I got Enemy Unknown and this for $8 during the summer sale and it is definitely worth that.PROS- Great gameplay- In my opinion, a great team control system- Decent storyline- How it has some of the same aliens as other XCOM gamesCONS- Short campaign, could have been made longer and better- Strange conversation system- How you cannot go back to this base after finishing the game (to do side missions)VERDICTIf it goes on sale for under $15, I would say get it.8/10.

												Beautiful environments, engaging combat, and a very entertaining story (with an interesting and unexpected twist, to boot!). I enjoyed this game a ton. The AI can be a bit lacking at times, sure, but what that meant for me was more micro-management. During the chaos of combat, I was forced to account for my other squaddies, positioning them, utilizing their skills, and trying to out-maneuver the enemy. That's really what this game is all about. It's not a shooter, despite it having guns which you aim. It's not some story-driven RPG, despite there being a good story and RPG elements, albeit rather shallow ones. It's pure tactical: time only slows, not stops, while giving orders; positioning and cover counts. You need to care for your squad. That's what I loved about this game.And the setting. And the story. And Carter.			",283,71,2,32,19,3,51

												Mass Effect but with a 60s art style. Teammate AI is a mess with them choosing to take cover in front of enemies or keep running around doing nothing unless you decide to issue commands for them every single second, thankfully this gets slightly better once they level up and can take more damage, and once you level up a few times in which the game becomes a total cakewalk. Other than that the combat is alright and can even become ~~intense~~ sometimes in harder difficulties. The storyline is a mess; outside the twist near the end it's very disjointed with the game assuming you know things you haven't been told yet (your character acts as if he knows these things too) and some characters vanishing two levels from the end of the game and never being mentioned again. Like I mentioned before the entire game plays and feels like Mass Effect but set in the 60s (there's even a base you can walk around in and talk to people after missions). I liked the art style a lot and it kept me playing until the end, but the game itself is kind of a mess due to it being stuck in development hell for 5+ years. Even so it's not Aliens Colonial Marines/Duke Forever horrible garbage, just average. If you think the setting looks interesting and want a slightly strategical third person shooter (think Brother in Arms and Mass Effect as previously mentioned) buy it when it's on sale for u$20 and you'll have fun. Hopefully it'll get a sequel in the future that fixes the issues it has (but it bombed so it won't).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice little third person game which links strategy trying to create more of a sense of story on the base of a single character in comparison to the usual XCOM games where you dont control a specific character. Still enjoyable regardless.			",148,52,1,21,19,4,12

												Honestly. If I could give a more of a meh review than anything else. It is not the worst game I have ever played. Nor the best. I feel like early game and mid game it was actually decent to good but by the end of the game... it just wasn't to great and you could tell that they were rushed insanely. I really wish the game had more time in the oven and was more like the original E3 trialers than this.Story was decent until it stopped and just made itself confusing for no reasons at all. It went through the motions and all that by the end.Also a lot of weird performance problems as well. I have a 980TI and it had slowdowns downards to 30 frames from a steady 60 FPS. No idea why but the Xcom games seem to have that problem these days.Not a bad game if you buy it less than 10 bucks. Other than that, I don't recommend unless you somehow found this in your library of games somehow.			",146,68,1,30,13,3,38

												If you liked Mass Effect style of play with an XCOM theme and many of its own play styles, you will really enjoy this game immensely!Not sure why all the negative reviews, if they were expecting XCOM set in the 50's, they must have misunderstood the game description. Although the game IS XCOM set in the 50's, it uses its own unique style of play. It really is a very well made game, a few things bother me but not enough to kill the game for me, on the contrary, its been a lot of fun and I just love that the game is in the XCOM universe. The design style is really impressive, they did a great job capturing the feel of the times, very impressed.Its too bad its sales seemed flat, the creators of this game really deserved a hit for what they delivered. A fun, well designed game that uses Mass Effect style play as its combat foundation along with many of XCOMS weapons, skills and overall charm.Its definately worth getting. If you're just looking for another XCOM game, this is not it, its much more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The trailer doesn't do this game justice, I've been so skeptical of it from the screenshots and trailers, but the second I started playing, I was hooked.Beautiful timeset (I'm a sucker for the cars of that era and suits)Good use of teammates *glares at Resi 5*Interesting use of the base (going back after each mission)Plus, to me, it felt like I was playing something that could co-inside with Resistance Fall of Man (that's a good thing).I'm really enjoying it, even on the second level with the dear in your path and the banner falling, and the fact you can see your own refelction, little things like this is what makes me admire a game so much more!7/10			",127,6,0,3,7,0,23

Many says that this spin-off is ruining the XCOM series name, but since, I've never played any main XCOM game, I can't comment much on that.

												An ok game. Combat gets repetetive fast, despite new weapons. Teammates reach level cap too fast. Running around the base is too tedious.

I'd give game 7/10, 8/10 if you love XCOM and want to play a prequel spinoff that just tells you how it all started. Not too much realistic, but it's an fps, it's supposed to be flashy. It's a spinoff so don't treat it as a core XCOM game, as it feels and plays differently.			",434,75,9,98,66,1,99

												Recommended.Basically, it's the XCOM universe as far as I understand it, just earlier than XCOM.But BE ADVISED:It's NOT like the XCOM games. This is an arcadish third-person shooter, and it's more focused towards arcade. Still, it's a storydriven campaign, very nice graphics, and if you've played XCOM you'll recognize your adversaries. Part from that this plays out during the early 60's, and it's sort of a return to the drive-in movies of alien invasions from the 50's.On top of the third-person setup of this game, it also includes tactical elements due to you being allowed to order and direct your ""squad"" or allies that join you. Depending on the difficulty that this game is played at, tactics can either make things easier, or make things possible. What this game does though, is to put you in the role of one of the frontline soldiers of XCOM. The guys and gals you're commanding in the XCOM games, here you're one of them. As such it's a very nice approach to that universe and those games, and as long as you keep that in mind, playing it is a very fun complement to the other XCOM games.But, if you expect an XCOM game in it's full with squad command, turn-based, top-down and so forth, this is not for you. If you're still curious, pick it up on sale and try it out.If you on the other hand fancy third-person shooters, like the XCOM universe and don't mind linear campaigns and some arcadish approaches, by all means pick this game up at full price.

												If you are a big Xcom fan like I am, you will consider this a more than fine addition to the Xcom Franchise -- although it is a significant departure from the ""canon"" of the other games. Set in the 50s, It pits the protagonist and two squad-mates against an alien invasion with WW2 weaponry until you can capture the weapons of your foes. Your squad mates can be different classes, and develop cool powers over time, which should allow for different play styles, but sadly there is little motivation to swap between your favorite (and most experienced) soldiers most of the time. Graphics are cool, power implementation is cool, and you can ""bullet time"" at any point in combat to decide exactly what your squad does (and positioning as well as skill management MATTERS) but the time does not go SO slowly that you don't have to think fast to avoid trouble (cooking grenades, sudden flanking) -- combat is fun and really makes you think... I drew satisfaction both from pitched battles and finding clever solutions to situations. The story is engaging, in a genre where there's been enough retread over the same types of mysterious baddies this game has a novel take on the enemy -- they are both worthy of wanting to understand, contempt, and fear. Types of enemies are QUITE varied, too.The Bad?: Game is pretty linear, though tries not to be. Squad size a step back from every other Xcom game. No research or Alien Autopsy (which is arguably one of the cooler elements of Xcom) though there IS some alien interrogation.Overall, a pretty spiffy game that is fun to play and has a cool story and it's own flavor. Both different enough to be novel, and familiar enough to please the Xcom fan. No regrets here, great squad-based 3rd-person tactical.			",292,82,1,91,36,2,74

Yours and your team's abilities are really awesome (mine, turret, shield, critical shot, invisibility, etc) and they're really come in handy in the fight.

												I remember this game getting a lot of ""meh"" reviews when it came out, but I think it deserved better.  The story isn't life-changing, but it is very interesting and different.  A huge amount of love clearly went into building the world and all the little stories within; the attention to detail should impress most who look.  Controlling the game, with it's heavy reliance on managing one's squad, is a little clunky and takes some getting used to.  However, you get to be good at it and feel pretty fancy when a plan goes like you want it to.Honestly, my biggest complaint is that Carter's voice is a parody of Modern Shooter Protagonist.  It's not Mark Hildreth's best work; he sounds like he's trying too hard to be gravelly.  Everyone else is good, though!  This game is definitely worth a play.  It's long enough to be a good value and fun enough that I didn't want to put it down for hours.			",109,70,0,16,6,1,13

												I really wanted to like this game. It has a really cool 60's aesthetic, the shooting isn't bad, and production values are good. Besides, I love the Xcom series. But this is such a pain to play through I'm not sure I'll ever finish it. You are saddled with two incompetent teammates at all times the game really wants you to use. But they're too stupid to be of any use if you don't micromanage them constantly, breaking the flow of combat. They die quick, and since their AI is bad, they often get out of cover to die in a few shots. The Bureau is a frustrating and poorly designed game that is more likely to infuriate than entertain, sadly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would rate this game 7/10.Note for windows 10 users like me: The Game is not working on win 10 with newest physX drivers. Crashes all the time. The only way to play it, is to disable physX. Without PhysX it works just fine.About the game: + I really like the 60s look+ The graphics are good even compared to games of today (2016)+ The game is heavely story driven and the story is interesting+ Fighting is fun (mostly), but the aiming seems not be very accurate+ The game is not a traditional third-person shooter because having a team you can give orders adds some strategy elements to the game+ The orders UI is well done and easy to use+ I love the personality of agent william carter, he is a cold, kinda bored anti hero guy+ there is a direct x 11 version of the game (even though the game is pretty old now)+ Today it costs a fraction of what it did when it got first released+ Game in the X-Com universe (yeah it's not an X-Com turn-based strategy game)- autosave really sucks, I really hate autosave, please game devs stop making games with autosave - the physX bug mentioned earlier, but I did not find any other bugs so far- AI is far from being perfect, your team members as well as the aliens have problems to find good cover spotsThis strategical part is a welcome change compared to other similar shooter games where you have no team to command. It also has some RPG aspects as there are lots of dialogs and you can evolve your character.Personally I think it's a good game. It's a good 3rd person strategical shooter and for the price it costs today it's not overpriced.I saw a lot of reviewers saying this is not like X-Com and giving it a thumbs down because of that, I think this is really stupid. It's nowhere written this an X-Com sequel. This is clearly not an X-Com turn based strategy game like the other X-Com games, it is another kind of game in the X-Com universe, but clearly not a turn based strategy game (no idea where people read this or why they think it is)! It's an 3rd person action game, some sort of stragical shooter, nothing less and nothing more.			",257,61,18,35,33,1,76

												This is NOTHING like xcom. Don't go in expecting anything similar. They'd be as well just removing XCOM from the name.If you can get it for 10 euro, it's worth it. Otherwise, there are games with far better gameplay out there.If you do buy it, buy the plasma pistol as well it's a massive help to get past the initial boring bits. The game is quite polished and isn't outright BAD but falls down with:- The AI. It's dumb as hell. If you tell them to stand somewhere, and you yourself move, they will often run to keep close to you - making flanking irritating to impossible- some of the encounters will cause you to die out of just bad luck and sheer number of enemies spamming grenades at you. With no mid level saves it's a pain to do an entire segment again.- reloading will wipe any buffs, so you have to spend a while reshielding or rebuffing- there's nothing tactical about it. It's cluster frack management. - there no explanation why half your guys have ""magic"" abilities at the start. They just do.- reference to the gear on your arm is made at several points. It's not explained why you have it or where it came from- the base segments are irritatingly slow to navigate as you cannot sprint- when your team mate's abilities are on cooldown, they are essentially useless.- the engineer can only have a shotgun for about 80% of the game, and the shotgun is severely pointless. yes, they can place a turret but they can't keep the turret up themselves so if it died he'll mince about doing very little- combat is unsatisfying- stats of each backpack (character modifier) aren't clear, so it's not really obvious what will be better.- light plasma pistol is a must. the enemy has a massive upperhand early on really dragging the ""bad"" part of the game on.- and on that note, the game doesn't really get remotely fun till your guys start hitting level 4 or 5.- some ammo capacities are overly restrictive making some weapons not really feel like an upgrade when they should- inexplicably you cannot have female followers, despite the animations clearly being available given that the female agent weaver joins you to provide fire support			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Oh, it's a... third-person shooter.""  I was a bit surprised, expecting something a little more like the previous XCOM game, Enemy Unknown.  The setting looked quite promising, at first.  I even snickered a little bit in the first mission, when I picked up an 1962-vintage M14 battle rifle to shoot aliens with.Of course, it has the obligatory cover system which seems to be required of any run n' gun game of this sort, but only some manage to execute effectively.  Does this game?  Well... sort of: considering the fact that some other games' cover systems can manage any maneuver with nothing more than WASD, the direction you're looking, and the Spacebar, The Bureau seems to go more for a style where each little variation on ""jumping from cover to cover"" needs its own key.  Good, I suppose, if you've had trouble getting the more ""intuitive"" cover systems to do what you want, but for me it breaks up the action a little too much.  ""Okay, I need to get to that desk which is a bit ahead of me and to my left.  So, I hold Left, and press... V, I think, and then...""A bit of a learning curve on the cover controls, though, is not a game-breaker.  It did, however, all fall apart for me eventually.Pretty soon after you've gotten a taste of ""how to shoot"" and ""how to not get shot,"" you're presented with a big, steaming pile of a squad command system.  The Bureau has you giving commands to your agents, not too unlike Enemy Unknown did - apart from the fact that you *are* also one of the agents.  What you end up with, then, is a game where you play a real-time, but dumbed-down version of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, in between bouts of playing an okay-but-not-amazing third-person shooter game, using a clumsier version of the dynamic pause squad-command system from the Mass Effect trilogy.So, if you *liked* XCOM: Enemy Unknown, or the Mass Effect trilogy... don't play this.  If you like the XCOM series enough that you simply must at least *try* The Bureau, do yourself a favour and at least wait for a sale, which will reduce the sting if you end up being as disappointed as I was.

												I really wanted to like this game. It has a really cool 60's aesthetic, the shooting isn't bad, and production values are good. Besides, I love the Xcom series. But this is such a pain to play through I'm not sure I'll ever finish it. You are saddled with two incompetent teammates at all times the game really wants you to use. But they're too stupid to be of any use if you don't micromanage them constantly, breaking the flow of combat. They die quick, and since their AI is bad, they often get out of cover to die in a few shots. The Bureau is a frustrating and poorly designed game that is more likely to infuriate than entertain, sadly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a real XCOM. The team's control is not a Rainbow Six, but you can give them the appropriate orders to survive and win on the battlefield. Yours and your team's abilities are really awesome (mine, turret, shield, critical shot, invisibility, etc) and they're really come in handy in the fight. The missions and the maps are various, not just go there, kill that type. I really like running around on the base, talk to everyone, doing side missions. It adds a lot to the game and you'll find out a lot about the backstory. And last but not least, I love the cold war atmosphere.			",380,157,32,15,33,3,54

												If you are a big Xcom fan like I am, you will consider this a more than fine addition to the Xcom Franchise -- although it is a significant departure from the ""canon"" of the other games. Set in the 50s, It pits the protagonist and two squad-mates against an alien invasion with WW2 weaponry until you can capture the weapons of your foes. Your squad mates can be different classes, and develop cool powers over time, which should allow for different play styles, but sadly there is little motivation to swap between your favorite (and most experienced) soldiers most of the time. Graphics are cool, power implementation is cool, and you can ""bullet time"" at any point in combat to decide exactly what your squad does (and positioning as well as skill management MATTERS) but the time does not go SO slowly that you don't have to think fast to avoid trouble (cooking grenades, sudden flanking) -- combat is fun and really makes you think... I drew satisfaction both from pitched battles and finding clever solutions to situations. The story is engaging, in a genre where there's been enough retread over the same types of mysterious baddies this game has a novel take on the enemy -- they are both worthy of wanting to understand, contempt, and fear. Types of enemies are QUITE varied, too.The Bad?: Game is pretty linear, though tries not to be. Squad size a step back from every other Xcom game. No research or Alien Autopsy (which is arguably one of the cooler elements of Xcom) though there IS some alien interrogation.Overall, a pretty spiffy game that is fun to play and has a cool story and it's own flavor. Both different enough to be novel, and familiar enough to please the Xcom fan. No regrets here, great squad-based 3rd-person tactical.			",292,82,1,91,36,2,74

												This is NOTHING like xcom. Don't go in expecting anything similar. They'd be as well just removing XCOM from the name.If you can get it for 10 euro, it's worth it. Otherwise, there are games with far better gameplay out there.If you do buy it, buy the plasma pistol as well it's a massive help to get past the initial boring bits. The game is quite polished and isn't outright BAD but falls down with:- The AI. It's dumb as hell. If you tell them to stand somewhere, and you yourself move, they will often run to keep close to you - making flanking irritating to impossible- some of the encounters will cause you to die out of just bad luck and sheer number of enemies spamming grenades at you. With no mid level saves it's a pain to do an entire segment again.- reloading will wipe any buffs, so you have to spend a while reshielding or rebuffing- there's nothing tactical about it. It's cluster frack management. - there no explanation why half your guys have ""magic"" abilities at the start. They just do.- reference to the gear on your arm is made at several points. It's not explained why you have it or where it came from- the base segments are irritatingly slow to navigate as you cannot sprint- when your team mate's abilities are on cooldown, they are essentially useless.- the engineer can only have a shotgun for about 80% of the game, and the shotgun is severely pointless. yes, they can place a turret but they can't keep the turret up themselves so if it died he'll mince about doing very little- combat is unsatisfying- stats of each backpack (character modifier) aren't clear, so it's not really obvious what will be better.- light plasma pistol is a must. the enemy has a massive upperhand early on really dragging the ""bad"" part of the game on.- and on that note, the game doesn't really get remotely fun till your guys start hitting level 4 or 5.- some ammo capacities are overly restrictive making some weapons not really feel like an upgrade when they should- inexplicably you cannot have female followers, despite the animations clearly being available given that the female agent weaver joins you to provide fire support			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bureau is like 80% of a really, really good tactical shooter. The rough edges are numerous and obvious, but if you can look past those, you can have a lot of fun with it.

												Boring game with nice background.The level design is killing the pace of the game.- Jump from a small edge- Enter a large place with many cover block all around- clean the place- run for a while with radio tchat- Encounter a small edge ...- Jump from the edgeThis game really miss dynamic level design. Radio com during fights, random encounter between the usuals arenas, npc tchating while walking. And shorter main missions. More UI around new items & research ... this kind of things.

												I don't know if I'm the only person in the world who still remembers them, but The Bureau is a lot like Gearbox's old Brothers in Arms series: it's a third person, tactical squad shooter where you're expected to win by ordering your men to flank and use their special abilities rather than killing everything yourself. A more recent comparison, and this is fairly obvious based on the UI and such, is Mass Effect 2/3's combat (but again, with less focus on the protagonist killing everything himself).It's a pretty good-looking game (it's UE3 with fairly pretty lighting, and a really solid aesthetic direction), and I've only run into a couple of minor bugs (a flying enemy got stuck under the level a couple of times because they were spawning behind a tall wall and attempting to go under it) - performance and stability are solid on my system. It's a good port, too, with lots of video options and a good FoV slider (it's dumb to have to mention this, but hey, modern gaming).I really don't get why it got the review scores it did. It's a really polished, fun title in what is admittedly a fairly niche genre, and to cap things off, it has one of the more intelligent war plots I've seen in video games (yes, despite being a game about the 1950s FBI fighting little grey men). It's also fun seeing what are basically levels from XCOM: Enemy Unknown translated to third person.All in all, if you're a fan of tactical third-person shooters, I can only recommend this. It's great.			",561,76,4,58,19,3,53

												I would rate this game 7/10.Note for windows 10 users like me: The Game is not working on win 10 with newest physX drivers. Crashes all the time. The only way to play it, is to disable physX. Without PhysX it works just fine.About the game: + I really like the 60s look+ The graphics are good even compared to games of today (2016)+ The game is heavely story driven and the story is interesting+ Fighting is fun (mostly), but the aiming seems not be very accurate+ The game is not a traditional third-person shooter because having a team you can give orders adds some strategy elements to the game+ The orders UI is well done and easy to use+ I love the personality of agent william carter, he is a cold, kinda bored anti hero guy+ there is a direct x 11 version of the game (even though the game is pretty old now)+ Today it costs a fraction of what it did when it got first released+ Game in the X-Com universe (yeah it's not an X-Com turn-based strategy game)- autosave really sucks, I really hate autosave, please game devs stop making games with autosave - the physX bug mentioned earlier, but I did not find any other bugs so far- AI is far from being perfect, your team members as well as the aliens have problems to find good cover spotsThis strategical part is a welcome change compared to other similar shooter games where you have no team to command. It also has some RPG aspects as there are lots of dialogs and you can evolve your character.Personally I think it's a good game. It's a good 3rd person strategical shooter and for the price it costs today it's not overpriced.I saw a lot of reviewers saying this is not like X-Com and giving it a thumbs down because of that, I think this is really stupid. It's nowhere written this an X-Com sequel. This is clearly not an X-Com turn based strategy game like the other X-Com games, it is another kind of game in the X-Com universe, but clearly not a turn based strategy game (no idea where people read this or why they think it is)! It's an 3rd person action game, some sort of stragical shooter, nothing less and nothing more.			",257,61,18,35,33,1,76

												Basically this entire game is starting a mission, walk 5 feet, battle, talk, battle, battle, battle. You go back to base where you can't do anything except listen to a couple people with no actual impact on the game. You then select your next mission and just battle your way through it. There seems to be no actual point to this game. Your NPC team mates can't hit the broad side of a barn, leaving you to do 90% of the damage even when you have control of what they are doing. No research to be done, nothing cool whatsoever. Fight after fight after fight. Such a crazy disappointment. If you liked any of the XCOM games, don't bother with this one. I wouldn't pay more than 5$ for this. Thank god I bought it on sale.			",232,42,1,22,12,0,24

You can't buy anything these days for $12, I've never played the other xcom games so I have nothing to compare this game to.But from what I can see its not a bad game in the least, sure there are better AAA games out there right now; but you have to pay $50 plus for a game like that. I think this game is well worth the $12 I spent on it while it was onsale. For sure I wouldn't spend more than $20 on a game like this, but so far I think its pretty decent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bleh - I couldn't be bothered to finish this. It had a lot of potential, but it just isn't much fun.- Team AI is horrid. I can live with them being mostly pointless or just serving as special ability vehicles, ala Mass Effect. However they are aggressively stupid. Periodically they will decide their cover is bad, and charge forward into the enemy, or way over-extend themselves. This would be a stupid nuisance, if it wasn't for the permadeath. If you could tell them ""go here"" and rely on them STAYING there, that would be ok too.. but the moment an enemy lobs a grenade, they take off.- Abilities are lackluster. Only 3-4 abilities per class is sort of boring. Often a guy would level and I would bring up their level-up menu to see what neat stuff they would get, and be disapointed.- Enemies are bullet sponges.- Most weapons don't feel very effective.- While the game starts by sort of implying there will be upgrades and upgrade trees, it is boring. There are laser upgrades to the main weapons (that are not even reliably an upgrade.. I'm convinced the Laser SMB is worse then all the bullet weapons). Every character gets basically 1 gun, and 1 backpack. The backpacks each have a different type of buff (+dmg to shielded enemies, +dmg to headshots, etc), and thats it for their equipment.All told, I was fairly disapointed in this. I figured at 7 bucks or so (the sale price I paid) it would be a good time with action similar to mass effect but meh. If they kept the combat system but had more depth to the powers, more depth to leveling, better AI, and more depth to equipment, this could have been awesome.			",231,62,3,69,47,1,74

												Checking the steam score I had very low expectations with The Bureau. However, after finishing the game the final impression is positive. For sure it is not an excellent 3rd-person tactical shooter but also not a fiasco. If someone expects stratetic elements of the original Xcom titles he/she will be underwhelmed. But from my perspective the same is more or less true for the new Xcom games: while very good turn-based strategy titles they are nowhere near as perfect as the original masterpiece of the 1994.Pros:+ excellent graphics for models and environment, very concincing lighting effects + very good soundtrack+ variety of skills, weapons and team members to choose from+ nice recreation of the sixties+ interesting idea to walk/interact inside the base you build in the Xcom games+ story is, on average, good with some nice twists+ cover seems to work, same of team coordination although player actions have a much greater role than companions`.Cons:- I did not quite liked the introduction with the alien invasion and the plot seems to be played in fast forward at some instances. From the story perspective it feels like a sequel to a game we never played. I would prefer much more focusing on ""first contact"", i.e. early missions from the very beginning of the alien attack, searching crashed or landed ufos. The game starts from the middle or from near the end of the plot. Xcom organization gets hold of very advanced alien tech too early and too fast in the game.  - some important pacing issues. Parts in the missions include lots of walking without doing anything. A lot of back and forth is happening inside the base without any obvious reason. Running inside the base could be a good idea.- Some ideas/concepts seem incomplete. For example there are dialogue options without changing something in the main story line. You find some logs, infos etc but again they play little to no role.- Alien environment seems a bit repeated and boring compared to the earth setting. - sometimes AI players seem to follow strange paths leading to suicide.- veteran difficulty seems quite steep especially in confined environments (but you can change it).- some aspects of the main plot are left unexplained (what happened to Carter?) or are not very believable (the whole USA got invaded and almost obliterated by the aliens but eventially the goverment managed to cover everything up?)No comment on the DLCs as I have not bought/played them. DLCs with weapons etc leave me completely uninterested. All in all a flawed but still interesting squad-based action game. It plays in the Xcom universe but is very different from the turn-based strategy games. Recommended, especially at discount.			",609,272,14,86,47,5,125

												I know this game got a lot of mediocre reviews and it does have it's problems but if you don't go in expecting a AAA game of the year candidate and take it for what it is you should have a fun time. It kinda reminds me of a janky, low-rent Mass Effect set in the 1960's. The battles can be tense as hell but it also knows when to be quiet and just let you wander around. If you're looking for a cheap 20 hour third person shooter you could do a hell of a lot worse than The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.			",104,36,2,17,8,3,26

												Initially hated the game, but went back to it after a year. In the end, thought it wasn't too bad, even though it felt like some weird mass-effect rip-off.Cons: The agent management system is horrible, and the cover system feels very clunky and unrefined. Some parts of the game can be pretty frustrating on higher difficulties (but you have the option to lower the difficulty whenever through the menu). Missions can feel stale after a while as in the end you are always fighting against the same bunch of enemies, which become progressively more powerful.Pros: Has some fun RPG elements like advancing skills. Great voice acting. Overall story is engaging and interesting enough, but don't expect an AAA RPG story arc.Would recommend the game to XCOM fans.			",59,7,0,4,4,0,4

												Could've been, and should've been so much more.Over all, I've been entertained by this game...but it seems like such a missed opportunity.  The idea of a squad-based third person shooter as an installment of XCOM is interesting, but ultimately it's poorly executed in this game...a pale reflection of Mass Effect.  Better AI, a bigger diversity of weapons, and more interesting passive/active abilities would've been a significant boost.  As it is, the game is quick to master, and as there's little else in the way of gameplay, it begins to make the game feel repetitive.  The  RPG elements provide hardly any depth, the items ultimately seem like nothing more than skin changes.  I have no idea why they decided weapons should be picked up in missions (instead of researched or built at your own pace) and nothing should have a clear representation of what effects are provided.  Does this backpack (your only other piece of equipment besides weapons) provide more damage resistance than that one?  Who can say, because the game sure doesn't.  More on the management side could've been a bit of a boost to gameplay as well.The story is utterly disjointed...suddenly it will present information that I'm seeing for the first time as though I should be well versed in it.  It's poorly paced, characters can be a little bland and cheesey, all of which could be okay if the overall storyline and gameplay were more interesting.  As it is, it's just downright confusing at times.All in all, it's an okay game.  I'm just disappointed that for whatever reasons (be it bowing down to exterior pressure, excessive development time, too many changes of direction) it feels like it could've been a lot more.  From the review, it probably sounds like I think it's a bad game.  I don't.  It's just passable, and it's not something that I would imagine that I'd ever pick up again after my first play-through.

												Could've been, and should've been so much more.Over all, I've been entertained by this game...but it seems like such a missed opportunity.  The idea of a squad-based third person shooter as an installment of XCOM is interesting, but ultimately it's poorly executed in this game...a pale reflection of Mass Effect.  Better AI, a bigger diversity of weapons, and more interesting passive/active abilities would've been a significant boost.  As it is, the game is quick to master, and as there's little else in the way of gameplay, it begins to make the game feel repetitive.  The  RPG elements provide hardly any depth, the items ultimately seem like nothing more than skin changes.  I have no idea why they decided weapons should be picked up in missions (instead of researched or built at your own pace) and nothing should have a clear representation of what effects are provided.  Does this backpack (your only other piece of equipment besides weapons) provide more damage resistance than that one?  Who can say, because the game sure doesn't.  More on the management side could've been a bit of a boost to gameplay as well.The story is utterly disjointed...suddenly it will present information that I'm seeing for the first time as though I should be well versed in it.  It's poorly paced, characters can be a little bland and cheesey, all of which could be okay if the overall storyline and gameplay were more interesting.  As it is, it's just downright confusing at times.All in all, it's an okay game.  I'm just disappointed that for whatever reasons (be it bowing down to exterior pressure, excessive development time, too many changes of direction) it feels like it could've been a lot more.  From the review, it probably sounds like I think it's a bad game.  I don't.  It's just passable, and it's not something that I would imagine that I'd ever pick up again after my first play-through.

												I have played all of the XCOM games and love the series, so being able to play a third-position shooter take on the XCOM universe was very nice and refreshing.If you like the series, alien themes, third-person action shooters, and squad-based tactics, you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are fantastic with lots of special effects in the form of mutons (mutations taken from the alien technology). The music fits very well with the theme and setting - it is appropriately intense whenever the action calls for it. The controls are fairly straightforward, and the tutorial mission is great at helping you understand both the controls and how to issue orders to your squad without being too long or too boring. The learning curve is moderate, however, the game can be extremely unforgiven in the commander (hardest) difficulty. There is permanent death if your squad members are downed and not revived in time on commander difficulty; furthermore, reviving them only stabilizes them - meaning they are out of combat until the instance is cleared of all enemies. I am playing on this difficulty, and have had many situations where I had to slow-play and defeat all the enemies on my own. Your squad members are heavily reliant on your orders, especially in the harder difficulties.The story is pretty good, and there is a lot of extras provided in the form of audio recordings and files if you choose to look for them. The gameplay reminded me a lot of Mass Effect, down to the very first muton power you unlock for your character - lift. The feedback is very good, showing the enemy's health at the top center of the screen, and having large grenade icons warning you of the blast radius. During battles, you can go into battle focus, which slows down time to a crawl and allows you to issue your orders. There is a range where you can order your squadmates to move/do actions, which I found to be very nice. You can have two weapons equipped at a time, and you will slowly unlock new equipment (the first being a bag that increases your headshot damage). You may have only 2 other active squad members at a time.Cover is extremely important, as the enemy will try to actively flank you and can become very aggressive. Most combat instances will have a few ammo drops to refill your weapons, and explosive barrels are littered in many areas to help you kill mobs of enemies quickly.As you gain experience, you will level up and can choose different perks for both you and your teammates. There is a decent variety of customization - you can change every agent's clothing color (pretty basic), and their background changes the type of perks that can be unlocked. You can recruit new agents, and when you do this you will be given an option to choose both their class and their background (ex: engineer class with technical expertise, leading to faster cooldowns on abilities). The XCOM base is not as explorable as I'd like, but it is still fun to walk around and talk to people - or read the extra content like agent dossiers.There are a number of side missions for you to play and unlock more mutons. Completing these help you gain levels and increase your psychic arsenal to defeat the alien invaders. Very good game, especially if you are a fan of the series.Definitely recommend!

												First off, I have absolutely no experience with the XCOM franchise, so I can't say how the plot stands with the other games, or how faithful the universe is.Besides, I haven't played a tactical TPS in a long time, which means that I may overlook some aspects that avid players of the genre look forward to.But here are my general thoughts. I'll try not to be too detailed, since AAAs have such a bigger scale compared to what I'm used to playing.So. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a tactical third person shooter, set in the 60's, in the first alien invasion of Earth. The best of the best are united in the XCOM to fight this invasion, and cover it up to protect the population.You'll go through several missions (some minor, some major), and you'll get to know the people you're working with between each, in the base.You have a squad of 3 people (you, and 2 AI partners), that you have some control over, during the fights. There are different classes in the game, and with each come different skills to aid you in battle. Some are support focused (providing shields, damage buffs, etc.), engineers (focus on tech, turrets, etc.), artillery (with long range deadly shots), you get the drill.Each of them can be leveled up to rank 5, and you go as far as rank 10. With each rank you choose 1 of 2 perks (sometimes, 1 of 1... tough choice, there).Let's start with the presentation.It's a AAA game, and that's very clear. Everything looks really nice, and it felt the theme surprisingly well, with the lighting effects giving the game an old sci-fi feel! Other parts of the game looked more generic, unfortunately. But overall, it certainly looked great, with good particle effects, lighting, and physics. The music also fit the theme very well, both the 60's feel, and the sci-fi. Unfortunately, it was very far apart. I don't feel like they've used the music very effectively, specially in the tense and emotional moments, the music in those was simply underwhelming.Overall, it didn't really feel as unique as it could have. As a AAA, it did very little to standout, despite being pretty good aside from that.One thing it did well in the beginning, was portraying the time setting well, using posters, and even the conversations with the different people.Moving on. The gameplay started out pretty good, but the probems soon started to reveal themselves. I chose to play in Commander Difficulty at first. The problem with that, was the friendly AI. They died within 4 seconds of the start of the fight. And I'm not exaggerating!If I sent someone to revive them, they'd just stand in the middle of the shots and would die as well. And that was pretty much the experience. That kind of challenge wasn't welcome at all. I spent way more time trying to keep my squad alive than fighting! So... after about 5 missions I decided I had enough with it, and turned it to Veteran. I died twice in the whole game after that. Once in the last mission, with throws wave after wave of enemies after you.There's just such a big discrepancy between Hard and Very Hard... that's not a very good balance, in my opinion.   Commander mode could have been really strategic and tense, if the AI was worth something.       Unfortunately, it was really bad. And you could see in the end, comparing their kills to yours. You alone did about 95% of the job, so yeah...   Other than that, it wasn't bad. You had several different weapons at your disposal, different enemies had to be taken out in different ways (not too different, but a bit different nonetheless), the skills lead to some nice teamwork... I wasn't bad!   It was not spectacular, but I was fairly enjoyable.   As I said before, between missions, you'll be in the Hub Area. Here, you can talk to the scientists, engineers, pretty much everyone, and get their view on the invasion. You'll also know why they're there, and what they're working on. That was cool. It didn't blow my mind, but it's good that it's there, if you feel like exploring a bit more.   There are also Notes, Photos, and Audio""Logs"" spread out, during the breaks between battles. These also give you a bit more insight into the world, which is always good!   Something that really bothered me though, was the Audio Logs. You had to stand near to listen to it. ... Why? The whole point of audio logs is to keep the player exploring, while being presented with the backstory. And they managed to screw it up, and have you stop your playing to listen to it... It makes no sense! Might as well give you a note instead of an audio log... I don't understand.   There's not much else to say about it, really. The cover system works fine, for the most part. One complaint I have, is that you can't roll into cover! That's really important, in my view! You can roll out of the way fine. But if you roll into cover, it doesn't connect, so you'll stand up, fully vulnerable, after rolling. And you'll take unnecessary shots. I don't see why it's not in there either, but oh well...   I may seem overly negative about the game, for a positive review. The fact of the matter is, that it mostly functions very well. The gunplay is solid, movement in fluid, combat involves some level of tactic, while ordering your squad members, ...   It's not a bad game at all. It's simply not a very good one either, and for full price, I definitely do not recommend it. But if you're curious about the setting, or you're a fan of XCOM, I don't see a problem in getting in a sale, or something along those lines.   The character interactions, though, were really bad in my opinion. And so was the way they handled the ending. SPOILERS HERE. So, while you were playing with one character for the whole game, learned about his intentions, played his role, they decided to switch things up. In the end, you had to choose another character to control. (You're an alien controlling them,  basically) You had 3 choices that were not very well explained. Nor well executed, with the past they set up.   The new character played exactly the same way as the previous one! You go from a badass field agent to a scientist who barely every fought, and they have exactly the same abilities and skills! It makes no sense whatsoever! And they also expect you to make the choices you've made with the previous character, as if they were the same... Depending on the character you choose, you'll get a different ending, based on each person's ideals, and that was good. But aside from that one cutscene in the end, it felt a very shallow choice. And even before that, there was ONE seemingly important choice... Well, it was just a cameo. There was no choice at all, it was all an illusion. And a pretty bad one. Oh well.    Overall, I expected more. But for the price at which I got it, it was a fine game. Won't change the world in any way, but it was enjoyable.			",474,130,11,42,29,3,58

												I really wanted to love this game. I'm a huge fan of both the XCOM series and FPS games. It seemed like an awesome blending of things I love set in an awesome time period. However, the game just isn't polished. Your AI team mates make terrible decisions, forcing you to micromanage them which derails the pace of the game. The interface is clunky and the game crashes frequently.They want the game to be semi-tactical but they don't give you any options to do that outside of issuing orders. None of the gear you get has stats in any meaningful way. I.E. you'll get one piece of gear that says it increases critical hit damage, but then gives no clue as to how much compared to another piece of gear that does the same thing. You also lose all of the cool meta play of how XCOM is run except for in a few forced ways.*****Possible Spoilers*****Probably the worst part of the game is the writing. The voice acting is fine but the dialogue is cliche after cliche. The characters act inconsistently. In one scene you'll go rogue and in the next chew someone out for doing the same, then support someone else for going rogue in the scene after. The choices people make are unbelievable, including allowing agent after agent to disobey orders. The internal logic of the game is busted. For example in the opening mission you're paired with a guy who can throw out laser turrets even though XCOM hasn't gotten that technology yet. The game is constantly throwing out situations/abilities/technology that don't make any sense or follow the XCOM universe's rules.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Typical console 3rd person port. Not a bad thing, actually using a controller is easier than KB/mouse. Has quite complex actions, puzzles are kind of different for me, but fun and having computer AI helping you is a cool thing. Sort of team based co-op. Graphics are pretty cool and I love blasting little green men! Its story based and pretty linear. But for a casual gamer as myself, I prefer that anyways. Not too deep or complicated.. Kill things, move on.			",815,195,33,60,28,3,43

												While this game departs sharply from the turn based mechanics found in the pervious XCOM games, I found it to be a compitantly excuted experience for a real time squad based strategy game. While this game is by no means original, borrowing from other games like Assassin Creed: Brotherhood and Mass Effect, it doesn't attempt anything it is uncapable of executing. There are some story line based elements, such as characters not facing the people they intend on talking to in what intends to be an immotional scene, one would think that this detracted from the experience. It only did so minorly. The mechancis of this game carry it. Only at the end when they throw you in a room with wave after wave of enemy did I ever feel that the game was being unfair, however I only wiped once. Any time I had died prior It had been my own tactical fault for playing the game for what is is not: A FPS. As the game proceeds, I found more and more fault with the team pathing AI, and sometimes in the later levels where the terriegn is more complex, I found I needed to baby sit thier movements, but the majority of of the time they handled fine.In Summary I would recomend this game, especially at the price it is at present.

												This game is something that had the potential to be great. The ability to slow down time to a near stop, and chose where your men go and abilities to use was well thought out.

They also hyped up the whole, your soldiers will die if they bleed out and don't come back.

												I wasn't introduced to X-Com until the very recent X-com: Enemy Unknown, which I loved dearly. Upon seeing this third person shooter game based on the same game series, I was immediately skeptical. However, my love of Enemy Unknown got the better of me, and I ended up pre-ordering the game. I wanted to love this game. I really, really did. I love the other X-com with a passion; and this game truly could have been great. It is not. Everything about this game is just...dull. The dialogue is dry and predictable. The main character is as basic, sullen, and gloomy as you can get. Everything about this game is a stereotype. The gameplay is repetitive and boring. It's basically just go somewhere, shoot 70 aliens, go home. In the other X-com, it was an accomplishment to take down 10 aliens with a 6 member team. In this game, you're regularly taking down 50 or more with 3 people. There's really not much strategy to it, either. Your teammates are dumb and require constant instructions on where to go, and you'll find yourself more often than not just going to do everything yourself, because it's faster. It tries to incorporate a little bit of strategy by allowing you to do extra damage via flanking your enemies, but that's about as deep as it gets. Overall, this is dull, uninspired, and feels like a B-movie version of the worst Mass Effect game.  Even saying that feels like I'm giving it too much credit.			",203,26,2,36,13,3,23

												First off: It's not a bad game. It's solid for what it does - mostly being a Cover Shooter.But it feels lackluster in every regard.The main discipline, the actual tactical shooting doesn't feel very tactical unless late in the game. The AI is unreliable at best, the options are limited to targeting a specific enemy, moving to a position and a very limited set of active abilities which almost all offer some kind of damage output increase instead of supporting utility. The enemies feel very bullet spongy even on lower difficulties and only pose a challenge through their masses combined with the team-AI running into open field, especially in the second half of the game.Customizationwise the game doesn't offer much. A handful of weapons in the archetypes of assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, sidearm and heavy arms divided into three ammunition types. Bullets against unarmored, Laser against shields and plasma with a damage over time effect, though the difference doesn't matter much in the field and your basically limited to whatever you find during the missions anyway. The skill trees offer some choices which again don't account for much, just as the backpacks. It all feels like more was planned but eventually cut.All of this makes the game play like a generic cover shooter for a long time.The level design offers some pretty nice scenary and fantastic atmosphere at times but with large gaps filled with generic corridors and obstacles (and some invisible walls) conviniently placed to only allow a narrow path. Whenever you see a wider area, be assured to have enemies incoming. Since the linear design doesn't allow much exploration, it is surprising that the paths branching left and right of the main path are often pointless and empty or give a new backpack schematic at best - which you can mostly also get from the dispatch side missions.The story is based on the older (50s - 60s) SciFi movies with slight horror mixed in between. Think of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or similar - or Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons which has basically the same premise ;)Again it feels cut on every end. There are some illogical jumps in character behaviour, descissions which don't matter at all, dialogue which repeats itself or is even nonsensical and the campaign feels very rushed with various Dei ex machina. The writing also does a very good job of making the main character as unlikeable as humanly possibile, throwing out oneliners like Duke Nukem which drip from pathos and stupidity.The whole XCOM feeling from the classic games or the remake is barely there apart from the alien names - you're only fighting on US American soil, with US Americans and have no contact to or intel about any other nation. Even the mission map is limited to mainland USA, making the whole global invasion a very US-centric thing.There are also some very annonying design decissions in the game:Firstly it's Checkpoints only. Died in the 3rd wave of a shootout? Feel lucky if it places you right at the beginning of the fight instead of some rooms prior. It doesn't even allow free saving outside the missions during exploring the base.Placement of team members or deployable abilities makes you basically move them along the physical path in the same 3rd person view instead of ignoring obstacles, stairs or maybe giving you more of a bird's eye view. All while the battle doesn't pause but only slows down, which means moving a mortally wounded squad mate out of the danger zone may end up with him being shot during the command giving.Having sprint on the same button as taking cover leads to some strange positioning sometimes, especially since you can't stear during sprinting.During the first part of the game you will open doors, having a short scene of your character securing the room with raised weapon through which he is uncontrollable and which is always pointless since there are never enemies behing those doors. Nor anything other to speak of. Later in the game this suddenly stops but is replaced with long empty corridors and elevator rides during which nothing happens.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wasn't introduced to X-Com until the very recent X-com: Enemy Unknown, which I loved dearly. Upon seeing this third person shooter game based on the same game series, I was immediately skeptical. However, my love of Enemy Unknown got the better of me, and I ended up pre-ordering the game. I wanted to love this game. I really, really did. I love the other X-com with a passion; and this game truly could have been great. It is not. Everything about this game is just...dull. The dialogue is dry and predictable. The main character is as basic, sullen, and gloomy as you can get. Everything about this game is a stereotype. The gameplay is repetitive and boring. It's basically just go somewhere, shoot 70 aliens, go home. In the other X-com, it was an accomplishment to take down 10 aliens with a 6 member team. In this game, you're regularly taking down 50 or more with 3 people. There's really not much strategy to it, either. Your teammates are dumb and require constant instructions on where to go, and you'll find yourself more often than not just going to do everything yourself, because it's faster. It tries to incorporate a little bit of strategy by allowing you to do extra damage via flanking your enemies, but that's about as deep as it gets. Overall, this is dull, uninspired, and feels like a B-movie version of the worst Mass Effect game.  Even saying that feels like I'm giving it too much credit.			",203,26,2,36,13,3,23

												First off: It's not a bad game. It's solid for what it does - mostly being a Cover Shooter.But it feels lackluster in every regard.The main discipline, the actual tactical shooting doesn't feel very tactical unless late in the game. The AI is unreliable at best, the options are limited to targeting a specific enemy, moving to a position and a very limited set of active abilities which almost all offer some kind of damage output increase instead of supporting utility. The enemies feel very bullet spongy even on lower difficulties and only pose a challenge through their masses combined with the team-AI running into open field, especially in the second half of the game.Customizationwise the game doesn't offer much. A handful of weapons in the archetypes of assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, sidearm and heavy arms divided into three ammunition types. Bullets against unarmored, Laser against shields and plasma with a damage over time effect, though the difference doesn't matter much in the field and your basically limited to whatever you find during the missions anyway. The skill trees offer some choices which again don't account for much, just as the backpacks. It all feels like more was planned but eventually cut.All of this makes the game play like a generic cover shooter for a long time.The level design offers some pretty nice scenary and fantastic atmosphere at times but with large gaps filled with generic corridors and obstacles (and some invisible walls) conviniently placed to only allow a narrow path. Whenever you see a wider area, be assured to have enemies incoming. Since the linear design doesn't allow much exploration, it is surprising that the paths branching left and right of the main path are often pointless and empty or give a new backpack schematic at best - which you can mostly also get from the dispatch side missions.The story is based on the older (50s - 60s) SciFi movies with slight horror mixed in between. Think of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or similar - or Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons which has basically the same premise ;)Again it feels cut on every end. There are some illogical jumps in character behaviour, descissions which don't matter at all, dialogue which repeats itself or is even nonsensical and the campaign feels very rushed with various Dei ex machina. The writing also does a very good job of making the main character as unlikeable as humanly possibile, throwing out oneliners like Duke Nukem which drip from pathos and stupidity.The whole XCOM feeling from the classic games or the remake is barely there apart from the alien names - you're only fighting on US American soil, with US Americans and have no contact to or intel about any other nation. Even the mission map is limited to mainland USA, making the whole global invasion a very US-centric thing.There are also some very annonying design decissions in the game:Firstly it's Checkpoints only. Died in the 3rd wave of a shootout? Feel lucky if it places you right at the beginning of the fight instead of some rooms prior. It doesn't even allow free saving outside the missions during exploring the base.Placement of team members or deployable abilities makes you basically move them along the physical path in the same 3rd person view instead of ignoring obstacles, stairs or maybe giving you more of a bird's eye view. All while the battle doesn't pause but only slows down, which means moving a mortally wounded squad mate out of the danger zone may end up with him being shot during the command giving.Having sprint on the same button as taking cover leads to some strange positioning sometimes, especially since you can't stear during sprinting.During the first part of the game you will open doors, having a short scene of your character securing the room with raised weapon through which he is uncontrollable and which is always pointless since there are never enemies behing those doors. Nor anything other to speak of. Later in the game this suddenly stops but is replaced with long empty corridors and elevator rides during which nothing happens.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR Get this game on sale, but spend no more than $10Now that thats out of the way, i will start by saying this game was OK. Not great, but not bad either. The gameplay reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins (in terms of the squad command) mixed with a cover-to-cover 3PS. Its fun for a while, but ordering around your squad can be a nuisance. They like to run to random places and get cut off, then go into bleedout. Not a big deal on lower difficulties, but on higher difficulties, if they die, they die for good. Gameplay score 8/10The story is interesting. It was pretty good up until the final few missions, then it took a nose dive. The very end brought it back a little, but the fact remained that the twist at the end made no sense with the rest of the story. I won't spoil it any more than that. Story score 7/10The graphics are really good. Better than XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Not top notch, but still very good. Graphics score 9/10Overall, I'd give this game a solid 7/10, mainly because of the stupid plot twist. If it had actually progressed the way it should have, i'd have given the game 8.5/10.

												Early coverage and reviews had me worried about this game.  Having now played it, however, I am pleasantly surprised.  It's a totally different game from the other XCOMs I know and love, but somehow it still captures much of the same feeling.  The tactical combat is a little confusing and clunky at first, but by the end of the game it's second nature.  The 60s-noire vibe is also a refreshing change.The bottom line is that this game is NOT like the other XCOMs in terms of gameplay so if that's what you want you will be disappointed.  It IS a creative re-telling of the XCOM story in a cover-based squad TPS set in the cold-war era.  It's pretty linear with the only hidden features being special 'packs' and dialog/story details.  However, the story and dialog are good enough and in terms of game mechanics it's one of the better cover-based shooters I've played.Takes 15-20 hours to beat the game based on difficulty and exploration.

												I have played all of the XCOM games and love the series, so being able to play a third-position shooter take on the XCOM universe was very nice and refreshing.If you like the series, alien themes, third-person action shooters, and squad-based tactics, you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are fantastic with lots of special effects in the form of mutons (mutations taken from the alien technology). The music fits very well with the theme and setting - it is appropriately intense whenever the action calls for it. The controls are fairly straightforward, and the tutorial mission is great at helping you understand both the controls and how to issue orders to your squad without being too long or too boring. The learning curve is moderate, however, the game can be extremely unforgiven in the commander (hardest) difficulty. There is permanent death if your squad members are downed and not revived in time on commander difficulty; furthermore, reviving them only stabilizes them - meaning they are out of combat until the instance is cleared of all enemies. I am playing on this difficulty, and have had many situations where I had to slow-play and defeat all the enemies on my own. Your squad members are heavily reliant on your orders, especially in the harder difficulties.The story is pretty good, and there is a lot of extras provided in the form of audio recordings and files if you choose to look for them. The gameplay reminded me a lot of Mass Effect, down to the very first muton power you unlock for your character - lift. The feedback is very good, showing the enemy's health at the top center of the screen, and having large grenade icons warning you of the blast radius. During battles, you can go into battle focus, which slows down time to a crawl and allows you to issue your orders. There is a range where you can order your squadmates to move/do actions, which I found to be very nice. You can have two weapons equipped at a time, and you will slowly unlock new equipment (the first being a bag that increases your headshot damage). You may have only 2 other active squad members at a time.Cover is extremely important, as the enemy will try to actively flank you and can become very aggressive. Most combat instances will have a few ammo drops to refill your weapons, and explosive barrels are littered in many areas to help you kill mobs of enemies quickly.As you gain experience, you will level up and can choose different perks for both you and your teammates. There is a decent variety of customization - you can change every agent's clothing color (pretty basic), and their background changes the type of perks that can be unlocked. You can recruit new agents, and when you do this you will be given an option to choose both their class and their background (ex: engineer class with technical expertise, leading to faster cooldowns on abilities). The XCOM base is not as explorable as I'd like, but it is still fun to walk around and talk to people - or read the extra content like agent dossiers.There are a number of side missions for you to play and unlock more mutons. Completing these help you gain levels and increase your psychic arsenal to defeat the alien invaders. Very good game, especially if you are a fan of the series.Definitely recommend!

												Insanely underrated game. Those who expect a sequel to XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within, will be extraordinarily disappointed with The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.This is not a turn-based strategy game. This is a squad-based third person shooter. There is definitely strategy involved with selecting the proper soldiers (two squadmates to assist you at a time) with the appropriate weapons and knowing how to manage their abilities in order to conserve the most ammo, maximize opportunities for kills, etc.; but it's incredibly different from the previous entry to the XCOM series.But change is not a bad thing, anyone interested in the (albeit fairly cliche at this point in time) concept of an alien invasion in the midst of a futuristic-styled 60's era, will enjoy The Bureau's story. It throws a few interesting twists to keep it from being entirely cliche, and overall executes the concept it goes for, perfectly.While XCOM Declassified is definitely not for everyone, fans of alien sci-fi with an open mind to change for a series, who are willing to learn how to properly manage their soldiers (there is a bit of a learning curve and frustration in the beginning), will certainly enjoy this game. Especially on its frequent dirt-cheap sales, it's impossible to go wrong. Buy this game.			",206,37,0,21,20,0,21

												I recommend this game, but only under specific terms. As anyone with a working understanding of what XCOM is, this one only counts as an XCOM game under similar terms. If you want deep tactical combat and a sense of existential dread fighting back a cybernetic, mindfraying enemy ages ahead of humanity, this is not the game for you. The combat amounts to skulking around and shooting heads poking around cover and making sure all your crazy ill-begotten alien abilities are in constant cooldown. I'd be surprised to see if someone in the credits took credit for designing these levels, because there's almost no incentive to even try to play strategically--you'll win by getting killed a lot and hoping you won't die the next time you respawn at the checkpoint just behind you.Not a lot going on with it mechanically. It's enjoyable. It's plain. It was on its way to being a top-grade squad shooter, then never articulated itself past the poorly-aging mechanics of games like Freedom Fighters and Republic Commando.Sadly, if it's lore you want, you're likely going to be left wanting. The game fleshes out the XCOM universe with fleeting moments of coherence, almost like the devs knew what they were doing was only wearing XCOM clothes and never going to breach into full-fledged canon. Conspiracy theorists may take issue with that proclamation, but yeah well so what.There's one specific thing this team got really right. If you're old enough to know what Man's Life magazine is, you're going to get some nostalgic chills when you take in the game's hypermasculine adventure-pulp vibe. Bad game or good game, there's a campy satisfaction in playing as our leading man--Oklahoma-born, corn-fed, brick-chinned Central Intelligence Alcoholic William Carter against deathray-wielding moon men, wearing his best plum-purple tactical sweater on black ops deployments. If your hat gets shot off in a firefight, it's gone for the rest of the game.The atmosphere is, in the early moments of the game, breathtaking. The insidious quiet of landing in these freshly-ravaged towns is stunning and sobering. The moment I first entered XCOM HQ and strode past a bunch of brass wearing pinstripe slacks, suspenders, sleeves rolled up, smart ties and slicked hair, smoking listlessly on tabletops watching radio intel slowly etch onto churning paper printouts, I was completely hooked. It felt like I was somewhere whole and real.But really, in this game, the aliens' perfect, inscrutable plan of attack is to make sure all their ranking officers at the frontline are wearing elaborate, glowing, Please Shoot Me First armor. Checkmate, says Jeff Goldblum. The game is a sickly, sci-fi-obsessed child of Cold War-era American exceptionalism without the heart to go too far down the satire path, but this is not the platform for a foreign policy ethics essay, so pass along, nothing to see here.Development hell doesn't always kill everything, and value survives in this little curio of a shooter. Hear the chilly, blurry radio feedback in your headphones when you enter Tactical View to take out a pod of flanking Sectoids. Just listen to the earnestness with which one of your squadmates asks, in the middle of a burning forest, ""We're gonna make'em pay, right boss?""""Yeah boys, we're gonna make'em pay, all right.""

												tl;dr: This game was fun and felt fresh, but your followers' AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and TPS makes movement a little awkward. Certain useful commands are missing that you can't issue to your followers. It's also short. I still recommend.I got into this thinking it was going to be another turn-based tactical game, but I was pleasantly surprised. It turns out it's a TPS where you can slow time and issue commands to your three-man squad while moving around and shooting the faces off of aliens. Much like the other XCOM games, you and your comrades can activate skills which you acquire by levelling through a skill tree based on your class. Also like the other XCOM games, there's a cover system.Overall, the game was fun, and the mechanics felt fresh. It's like experiencing XCOM through the eyes of a field agent, and that's awesome. With all that said, the game had two main drawbacks. The biggest one is that your followers are clinically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They're highly inaccurate with weapons, they have a tendency to run straight into enemy fire or out of advantageous positions, and they often do stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like dive away from a grenade and then run straight back into its blast radius. As a result, you have to micromanage them just to keep them alive, using them mainly for their abilities or to draw fire. That isn't to say they don't do damage; you just can't trust them to take down any enemy on their own, so your strategy generally ends up revolving around you personally taking out key targets. The second issue is more minor: movement is clunky, at least on the PC. Part of it has to do with it being a TPS, but there are other problems as well. As far as I know, in order to jump over a wall, you need to take cover behind it first. Also, when you're sprinting, you automatically take cover behind any wall or obstacle you run into, which is frustrating when that either causes you to get killed or fail to revive an ally before he bleeds out. I feel like this could have been avoided this if the button for taking cover wasn't the same as the button for sprinting.I feel like the game would have been a lot better if you could at least tell a follower to hold a position, take cover without firing, or provide cover fire (along with an improvement in follower accuracy). Too often, an ally gets killed because you can't tell him not to move or not to shoot. And without using any abilities, you have to personally provide cover fire for your allies in order to have them move safely to another location.Overall though, I had fun so I'm giving this a thumbs up. The only thing is that since it's so short, I recommend that you try to get it at a cheaper price than $20.			",224,67,2,23,25,2,30

												First off, the game is actually fairly good. It tries to emulate the gameplay of Mass Effect, both in combat with a cover 3d person shooter style, and with multiple dialogues choices during the downtime you have at the XCOM's base or during the main missions. As a fan of both i have to say that it does it decently. All this packed with XCOM's alien invasion background, and the historical period in wich the story takes place, makes for an interesting spin off even considering the flaws. For example, soldiers are a bit of a chore to manage on the field and outside of their abilities are basically useless, and more often than not they will fall in combat requiring you to help them or watch them die. The permadeath of yours squad members is basically the only element of the original titles that traslates in this specific game: you will not have to manage resources, build your base, or research alien tech. So don't expect a game that plays like XCOM going into this. If, and only if, you are a fan of the things i have mentioned above you'll most likely enjoy the game for what it is. However i feel i cannot recommend this title to anybody, because even years after the release it keeps crashing. A lot. We are not talking about some random freezes, i had around 20 crashes during the whole campaign and it has been very frustrating, expecially when occurred in the middle of long fights. Some have reported that by disabling PhysX it gets better, but it was not my case, and even if the game is good at his core i can't say i had a good experience playing it. At the end i don't feel it was worth the hassle. Keep this in mind if you decide to buy it.			",92,42,1,13,3,0,8

												An intriguing third-person shooter set in the XCOM universe. A lot of familiar monsters are on view, and familiar weapons too. The plot is at least somewhat interesting, with a lot of choice about what missions you perform when. And there are a few unexpected plot twists that keep you guessing.The game's big ""gimmick"" is that you can engage in some limited small-unit tactics, giving orders to your squadmates who can deploy different abilities to help you. You can send them to catch the bad guys in a crossfire, or tell them to revive you when you take too much damage. It offers some intriguing possibilities, but the control scheme can be a little bit too finicky. More than once I've accidentally activated the wrong ability by having selected onto the wrong person without intending to.If you can get it cheaply on Steam sale, go for it. Not sure I'd pay full price, though.			",159,45,0,23,16,3,29

												Ok scrubs here's the scoop: If you're looking for a game that's going to add another tint of rose to your nostalgia goggles and allow you to relive the so-called ""golden age of gaming"" before the plebes rose up and helped the Vandals overthrow Rome, then this is not your game. This is, however, undeniably an XCOM game. It has squads, it has the chance of your agents dying and it's missions are such that you can't be everywhere at once.You will feel like you're fighting against technologically superior forces and just barely scraping through. The weapons and setting are believably in post-war Americana with all the xenophobic and culturally normative undertones of Mom and apple pie; suspension of disbelief achieved.Where it lacks on paths parallel to the main missions and, in particular, character development, it has the skull-ventilation of aliens in spades.Plays-like-mass-effect's-little-brother/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the Xcom universe. To anyone else, you'll probably find it pretty bland. I enjoyed it but it can be a little unforgiving at first until you power up. The visuals are a little drab and you'll get tired of Carter's constantly gruff voice and fist to hand animation in cutscenes. Other than that the combat reminds me a bit of Mass Effect and there are some cool ways to mix abilities of the three characters. Permadeath is present but unless you're playing on higher difficulties you probably won't even experience it past the beginning of the game. Definitely grab it on sale right now, don't pay full price though. Overall I had fun with it, but I'm a big Xcom fan and enjoyed seeing the enemies I know in a different setting.

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is the Third-Person shooter which places you in the shoes of Agent Carter. A CIA Agent turned X-COM Agent. The game's start is well paced, it isn't an hour long mission which gives you the details in one whole package, instead, it is phased in little cutscenes throughout major missions and through your own exploration of the surroundings. The game is very similar to Bioshock Infinite in the way your companions behave, the gunplay and also the collectable notes, audio logs and the image which appears on the right hand side of the screen, similar to the way the audio logs do in Infinite.The collectables are easilly noticable and have little actual challenge to them, however there are a lot you can miss if you just run and gun through the missions. The AI support you have are actually quite good from my experience, I had read many reviews claiming the AI were bullet sponges etc, but for me they were well placed during combat and only got injured through my own fault in dealing with enemies. The game uses a system which allows you to control what you and your teammates do during combat. For example, moving them behind cover and marking a specific target. The game also has customisation for your character and teammates, so you can get attatched to your team and then watch them die... But, luckily that didn't happen to me. And if you want to break away from the immersion of a full scale alien invasion... if you can really get immersed in that... and customise your teammates to have 'fabulous' (for lack of a word) colour schemes such as Pink, Purple, White and more Pink!The gunplay is great, each weapon has a different leve of damage or recoil and the sound isn't just reused throughout. The only issue I have with the guns is that later on, picking up a laser weapon is the easy way out, as it is just running around after the enemy collecting ammo afterwards, without that fear of running out and having to push back to collect more. The maps for each level is also a brilliant feature, as far as I saw each map is unique and has lots of different routes and ranges of cover to make each fight unique and to also really allow each player to have his own tactics played out just perfectly, in my case that was send a sniper to flank whilst myself and my other teammate stuck behind cover keeping them distracted. The enemy AI is at times silly but they do take cover and pose a threat should a teammate down and need reviving, the capatilize on errors such as a lack of ammo too, pushing forwards when you don't expect it. This being my first XCOM game I can't really say if the enemies are the same but I can only assume so. In addition to this being my first XCOM game, I would recommend watching or playing Enemy Unknown before saying it isn't as good as Declassified, as from some gameplay I have seen, they look quite different.The Bureau doesn't follow the usual turn-based style which other XCOM games do, which allows for much better, flowing combat and tactics. However, this takes away time to think  about what is happening as sometimes I found myself going off my plan to cope with enemies. The game features quite a few cutscenes, some of which are in HD, some are in SD, which at times can be quite confusing and annoying as it doesn't look and sound as good. But I managed to get used to the cinematics in the lower definition, the game itself has brilliant high quality level, gun and character designs, with nice little touches on things like hats, ties and cloth which sway in the wind, get shot off in the case of hats and also get knocked around when you pass by or shoot through.Overall, The Bureau for me is a huge success, thoroughly enjoyable and exciting at all times. I never found myself bored and found the story gripping and suprisingly well written. The multiple choice system allows for a unique knowledge of each character, (If you go through all the options in dialogue with them.) and the games ending is well done as well. I would say behind GTA 5 on console, (Hopefully PC soon!), The Bureau is my favourite game I have played in this year, and last since we are very early into 2014! I would recommend this to anyone who liked the Mass Effect or Bioshock series and to anyone looking for something else to play.			",112,17,4,9,29,3,32

 XCOM Declassified  Some secrets to hold onto for forever... I heard from several reviewers and friends that this game was absolutely horrible and to an extent I agree with them. Declassified I found was much more interesting when I first read about it in a gaming magazine. It WAS supposed to be a pulp sci-fi suspense story played in First-Person, however several happenings in 2K forced its re-purposing into the 3rd Person shooter we have here.The game does manage to hold onto the pulp 60's sci-fi style, unfortunately it quickly gets buried under all the shooting and with that becomes almost irrelevant. A sad thing, in my opinion. For I enjoyed the early previews of the original project, even IF it being an FPS. I did hope that the writers would have managed to create a good suspenseful story to cover the somewhat generic feel of the FPS, it was a bit naive to think that in retrospect. Since the only thing that runs the games industry these days is the AAA's and they only care about money and I could argue that the game is partly bad because of that.However, to the game.Sadly under performing and uninteresting, I did not hold much hope for it. Given what I've heard about it, but to finally see and play it.. Urgh. The game is a good example of a good concept ruined, it does manage to be a decent enough precursor to the XCOM series as a whole, but it does it so badly. It's almost not worth mentioning.The games story managed to underwhelm me and I now understand why that certain mission ended rather abruptly, the ""pop a cap in ye ♥♥♥♥♥ "" part, to quote a man more articulate than me.The game suffers from AI problems, namely the AI team-members being complete idiots. Unless you give them the order to take cover into a specified location, they might walk right to the enemy and get downed. Most of my crew died due to that fatal flaw in their brain development. Otherwise the fighting is O.K and that's pretty much it, I can't for the life of me tell you a good combat mission the game had.I feel like my time has been wasted, there is no reason for the game to be this dull. It feels like the developers just up and quit halfway through after the project was re-organized.I cannot say anything more, for my head is starting to ache from thinking about this.XCOM Declassified gets a D.For it fails to be interesting in every aspect, the story is dull and uneventful, the action is boring, nothing eventful happens for the entirety of its runtime. A sad example of spoiled possibilities.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If its gonna have the xcom branding i expect to be able to tell my squad to hunker down so they shoot less and go into defensive mode.StoryStory is full of plot holes. Theres a plot twist near the end of the game that dosent have a ton of impact. The dlc missions that add to the story provide more plotholes than fill them.

												All in all it was well worth the bundled price with the predecessors of the series. I love enemy unknown and grew up on terror from the deep. This is nothing like these, expect a cover tactical shooter that is driven by a narrative akin to the series. Life forms from somewhere else have arrived, and they are terribly aggressive and we apes (sorry creationists), being the busy little warriors we are are now tasked with overcoming a dominant invasion force by doing what we love--killing stuff with noisy things.This is a story-driven XCOM shooter. It was refreshing to play as the agents themselves and the story was good enough to keep the player going. Fighting enemies in real and slowed time makes mutons much more menacing. You also can't count on a team of snipers as your squad will always be three people. Fights are exciting as maps are well arranged to encourage scattering your team to flank, support, or divert enemies. I would recommend keeping the difficulty up high as lower levels allow for easily exploitable AI. At one point I was dropping teams of five monsters in a couple seconds mainly through well placed powers and team members. Unfortunately, there isn't much in the way of variation in outcomes so don't expect anything quite so dynamic.Worth a single run through but I do not feel compelled to replay it. I'd give it a 6.5 out of 10, fun but borrows too much to stand out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though the level design is very linear and does not allow alternative routes and only very limited tactical options I liked this game very much: The story line, though fairly predictable must of the times - with only a few twists, was interesting and kept me playing on until the end.Graphics are pretty nice and the look & feel of the 60's really fit the setting. Combat - especially on highest difficulty - requires coordination of your squad to be successful. This is well incorporated into the shooter setting by the ""bullet time"" like slow down during which you can give orders to your squad.All in all I really liked playing this game and can recommend it to everybody who likes the XCOM setting or has a nick for tactical 3rd person shooters.

												This game was a blast to play. It isn't a hardcore FPS, so don't go into it expecting those sorts of mechanics. It has the basic FPS down and some interesting progression-based abilities. It's more of an interactive story, than a true FPS.The kitschy, historical feel of the game is spot on; you feel like you are in a 50's/60's sci-fi movie. The story is well-written, even if some choices are a bit one-sided in the outcome. However, there are a few places the story can turn so sharply from a single choice I was surprised.I feel this game has gotten a bad rap. There are far too many bad reviews with derogatory comments that are not deserved. I had originally skipped this game and only received it as part of a combo sale some time later and I can say I am so glad that I had the chance to play it.Edit:Over a year later and I still hold the same opinion of this game.

												Are you thinking about taking advantage of a sale?  Do you think this is a game that will combine your love of strategy, shooters and the intriguing world of XCom? For the love of god DON'T DO IT!  I recommend that you save your money or literally throw it in to a sewer, either way you'll be better off.Now, I'll admit I ended up mildly addicted to The Bureau and I have pretty much played it to completion (to be honest... I couldn't wait to finish it so I could uninstall it and never see it again).  However, while this game may appear to offer a lot, believe me, it will deliver only frustration.MY THOUGHTS:1.  It is the buggiest game I have played in recent memory.  I started playing at launch and thought 'oh well if I give the dev's some time to patch things maybe it won't crash every 15 seconds...' WRONG.  Stupid me.  Three years later and this game is still a soup of CTD bugs, gameplay bugs, stupid autosave locations and even more CTD bugs.  I can't begin to express how frustrating or frequent these bugs are.  It is insane, the only reason I haven't finished the game is it keeps dying on me.2.  For gamers looking for a strategic shooter, prepare to be disappointed.  The AI is useless and the squad/order/bullet-time mode may as well not exist.  Your squadmates offer nothing of value other than the occasional revive and they're so damn squishy the only orders you'll make are to tell them to get out of your way.  The only time this game is difficult is when it spawns so many waves of aliens that you run out of ammo.3.  For gamers looking for a well balanced shoot 'em up, prepare to be even more disappointed.  The guns are completely unbalanced and unchallenging; human weapons are useless and alien weapons are a range of boring lasers with no recoil that are virtually indistinguisahble from each other.  4.  For gamers after an exciting first-person story in the XCom Universe, start crying now.  Stilted dialogue, an unintelligble plotline and terrible characters await.  The game tries hard to throw up a few 'dilemmas' but fails miserably.  You form no attachment to the stupid two dimensional main characters/plot devices.  This is in large part because any interaction with NPCs has no bearing on the game at all (it just sinks hours of your time in pointless dialogue and loading screens).  So, what does The Bureau: XCOM Declassified do right?  + It is a mindless point/click shooter (which can be rewarding if you want to disengage your brain)+ You *do* get to shoot at some of your favourite XCom baddies+ There is a brief novelty of M14'ing an alien in the headWhat does The Bureau: XCOM Declassified do wrong?- They took my money before I realised how bad and rushed this game was- Three years later it is still an unplayable bugs nest- Story was written by a five year old- Characters are less plausable than D-Grade anime- Gameplay is so dull you'll need to be waterboarded awake- Graphics are rubbishIn summary, this is a bad console port with basically no redeeming qualities.  If you're silly enough to blow $50 on this game, come back after 5 hours and all I'll have to say is... told ya so!			",88,2,0,12,5,2,29

												I know this is a very controversial game, hence it's mixed reviews. My son was all into XCOM and I picked this up for him during a Steam sale and he seemed to love it, quickly finishing it and it's DLC. It took me a while, but finally through the magic of Steam Family Sharing, I decided to give it a go. And honestly, to my shock and dismay. I liked it. No, it's not XCOM the strategy game. No, it doesn't seem to follow the established ""lore"", such as it is. But if you can approach the game as a tactical rpg-lite squad shooter with a decent story, I think you'll be impressed. For hardcore XCOM fans, think of this as an alternate universe version of XCOM or treat it as it should be, it's own thing. Now onto the review!+/- Graphics, being built on the Unreal engine, are pretty good. It has some nice particle effects, models are pretty good, and a decently variety of both enemy models and settings. It very much has the ""Bioshock"" look to the UI and world, while art direction pulls a good 50's vibe and flavor to most everything. Weaknesses are mostly confined to poor facial animations and sometimes stiff looking movements, but overall the game has a clean and consistent look that works really well for the game.+/- Story and voice acting is played upon very heavily in this title, far, far more in this title than any previous XCOM game. There are multiple NPC's and your own character that are all developed decently well, if not anything exceptional. You can tell they were heavily inspired by the Mass Effect school of Story but they never quite reach those heights. Most dialog is decently written and spoke well, but while enjoyable, there is no top tier level story telling to be had and much of it feels like it contridicts much of what is presented in the XCOM game. Purists might cry foul and let what is presented distract them, but again, pretend it's an alternate version of the XCOM universe and enjoy the more personal ride.+/- Combat and powers are obviously the main focus here and this is what drives most people batty. One thing I've learned playing through this entire game is that moving your squad mates is mostly an exercise in futility. Just save yourself some pain and let them move themselves. That doesn't mean you don't coordinate them because this is not a game that you win  by playing it as a shooter. Do that and you WILL cry. Powers are everything in this game and using your teams varied abilities is paramount to winning the game. Using your abilities will greatly slow down time (but not pause), allowing you to choose both your and your teammates abilities and their targets. In this respect (opposed to moving your teammates) the game works very well. Nothing is more satisfying than being pinned down by a sniper, Lifting him out of cover, and focusing fire to take them out quickly. Or taunting an Outsider, which makes them focus on one character and advance, right into a mine dropped by an Engineer. Realizing you can queue up multiple attacks helps you power attack the most dangerous enemiese quickly. I spent much of combat making sure everyone's powers are constantly being used AND upgrading them in a manner that fit my playstyle greatly improved the flow of combat and made the game more enjoyable. I will warn you, as at the start of the game, when you have few abilities, that the game is much more frustrating as the gunplay is at best, competent. This is not a run and gun game - that will kill you fast. Cover, flanking, short bursts, grenades, and abilities will win fights. Nothing else.This game isn't for everyone, but if you like more tactical FPS, something that's a little different, and something with an interesting 50's take on XCOM, I'd recommend it. You can get it cheap regularly during steam sales and for those sale prices, it's highly recommended. Final score - 3.5/5			",194,94,6,30,11,3,28

												This game has a sin against it... it's boring. And uninteresting. It starts out alright but after that it devolves into the same combat encounter over and over and over... Yes, you can bring different Agents along with different abilities but somehow it still doesn't set it all apart.The Bureau only became interesting right at the end but, frankly, the rest of it didn't make it worth it. Not recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heyyo,Sadly? The AI ruins what could have been a fun Tactical Squad-Based Third-Person Shooter... Which is too bad since the squad AI can actually kill enemies unlike most other squad-based games as of late so they actually contribute to combat... but at the same time? They do detract by being idiots whom if you don't give move orders will usually stick too close to the player and not run from grenades which enemies use quite a bit...Now that I've mentioned the major weakness of the game? I'll talk about the strength which is the visuals... and wow are they good! Just look at the screenshots even. The Art, 3D modeling and mapping department definitely did their job on this game. The use of Unreal Engine 3 shines with Direct3D 11 goodness to show off the visuals of the game. The only thing that could have made this game better is better Anti-Aliasing.. I have the ingame Anti-Aliasing set to ""High"" which is the highest setting yet there's still quite a lot of pixelation. My guess is they used FXAA which doesn't compare to proper Multisampling Anti-Aliasing of times past.Voice acting is also pretty good. Varied cast and decent attention to detail helps add to the game as I felt like the voice actors actually game a damn about the lines they were reading.The storyline is also pretty decent about how the aliens invaded and how you're fighting to gain their technology to combat them with and that makes this game feel like a good spin off of X-COM... and it would have been if the damn AI wasn't so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Whomever worked on the AI coding of this game sadly let down the rest of the team since this is a singleplayer game thus AI is extremely important... maybe they needed more time or more staff dedicated to making the AI better? Either way, it's too late for this game.			",466,98,12,57,64,6,85

												The Bureau is a solid squad based cover shooter with tactical and RPG elements.  You must fight off an alien invasion to 1960ies earth and unravel the mysterious forces at work.  You command a squad of agents with different specialties and you and your agents can be leveled up with different abilities and buffs as the game progress.  You can control your 2 allies on the field (very similar combat to Mass Effect 2 & 3) by placing them in different positions and assign powers to use.  The powers are fun and vary from bio and machine allies, bombs, turrets, mind control, levitation and more!  Combat is fluid and fun and the best part of the game.The setting feels like 1960ies America, or at least what the movies describe as 60ies America, and I really enjoyed the ambiance from the visual appeal of a town, college or rural area.  There are lots of aesthetics thrown in like old TV screens, lab equipment, diners, cars,  etc that really capture the feel of 60ies living.  Unfortunately your squad and other characters you interact with are wooden and bland.   However you are able to make choices in conversation and there are a few interesting twists near the end that your choice will have some impact on the story.  For a sci-fi invasion angle, I enjoyed the story, it’s just that the wooden NPC’s drag it down and take away some of the immersion created by the set pieces and combat.I hate to review a game in the context of another, but my advice is if you have played Mass Effect 2 & 3 and loved it, you need to play The Bureau as it’s the closest thing to more Mass Effect.  On its own the Bureau has enjoyable gameplay, solid atmosphere with a fun campy story that is brought down by bland characters but is still a worthwhile light RPG experience, plays great with a gamepad.  FYI – if you have an AMD graphics card turn the physics options off to have a high frame rate.  Otherwise X-com Declassified is a looker even on mid-level machines.			",150,66,2,40,3,1,4

												If you like tactical RPG shooting games, mainly Mass Effect, then you'll find this game to be an enjoyable, yet not amazing or incredible, game.The story is alright, you defend 1950's-60's America from alien invaders who have better technology and numbers than you. It isn't as good as others in the genre but with a few twists here and there it doesn't drag down the enjoyment. The characters, an important part of these kinds of games since you will be talking to them so much, are only passingly enjoyable and many of them don't have enough going for them to make them memorable. Some of the main characters are fine but they aren't as good as the ones in other games.The setting is a refreshing change from the norm of today's shooters. The clash between olden day America and the futuristic alien architecture is pleasing to look at as you see the destruction between the two. I liked the clash so much that I was a little disappointed when it changed to primarily alien bases later on in the game.The graphics are nice, using the unreal engine 3 to a great extent. Character models look nice and the effects are fun to look at. The game has additional Physx support and so cloth and particles flow smoothly. I have AMD so I couldn't really use it. The graphics aren't spectacular to look at, but I enjoyed what I saw.Gameplay is fun and challenges you to direct your team to victory. I played on the hardest difficulty, commander, and it wasn't too difficult once I got a handle on things. You can't take too much damage in this game, and unlike other games health doesn't really regenerate and you can't heal too often. This forces you to use your squad to its fullest capacity instead of going Rambo and doing everything yourself. The abilities are useful and directing your team in slow motion, since the game doesn't pause when you plan out your actions, is engaging and enjoyable.The enemies are a little boring as many of them are just humanoid soldiers that don't act any different than any other game. The bosses, on the other hand, are fun and challenge you in tough fights. Things like Mutons, Sectopods, and Gunships become even scarier as they soak up damage and force you to rely on your team's abilities to slow down, damage, and distract the enemy. It really gives you an accomplished feeling when you can plan and take one down without anyone getting really hurt.In the end, I enjoyed this game and recommend it to anyone on the fence on getting it during a sale like I did. It may not be the best of its kind in the genre, but you won't really have a bad time while playing it.			",994,308,40,109,90,10,105

												6.5/10Great look and feel, fun gameplay, a bunch of fun characters and a storyline that’s gritty at times and campy at times. Overall I enjoyed the game, but unfortunately The Bureau keeps teasing so much more that it doesn’t deliver on. I was constantly left in a state of feeling mislead and disappointed (spoilery examples below). I recomend this game if:1. You liked the combat mechanics of Mass Effect 2. Didn't like it in Mass Effect when your decisions impacted the storyline    2b. Can convince yourself this is a sort of retro Mass Effect DLC3. Like watching Facilities and Operations personnel do their jobs.4. You really enjoyed watching Super 85. You think smoking is cool.--MILD SPOILERS and WITTY CRITICISMS ahead—Me: Hey game, you really nailed that 1960’s look and feel. You’d think nobody could look tough in 1960’s tweed pants and sweaters, but boy! My character looks tough as nails!  And I love how you contrast the quintessential, idyllic setting of small-town america against the cold gruesome architecture of the invading aliens.Game: Why thank you! Did you notice how I even touch on some of the social tensions of the 1960s? Like racial issues, sexism, and the paranoia inherent in McCarthyism?Me: I did! It’s maybe a little heavy-handed at times, but no biggie; I’m still really excited to see how these social issues are explored as the game progresses.Game: I’m glad you noticed! Because soon enough these concepts will all just fade into the background and even though you’ll want to discuss them with NPCs, it’ll never come up as an option!Me: Oh… okay.----Game: Hey, look at all these unique NPCs, each with thier own unique personality. You know, if the combat reminds you of Mass Effect, then I bet it's just as important to invest in these characters like you do in Mass Effect. After all, I stress SUPER HARD that this game is about collaboration and teamwork under pressure. And the dialogue mechanics are eerily similar to Mass Effect!Me: I liked that about Mass Effect, Mr. Game, so I'll totally spend as much time interacting with NPCs between missions as I spend on the missions themselves. Plus, as I talk with them I learn more about my own characters' personality and grizzled past. I want to know more about the mysterious, hard-headed protagonist than just about any of the other characters.Game: Good idea! Dig up his story as much as you can. That way, you totally won't expect how that “I’m difficult to work with, but always get the job done"" Clint Eastwood-style protagonist totally loses his effin marbles at the end and you have the play the last chapter as some omnipotent alien puppet-master taking possession of characters you never really care about.Me: I'm sorry, what? Wait, in that last chapter where are all those folks I spent the whole game learning about? The ones I DID care about?Game: I’m sorry, who?----Game: You captured an alien combatant! Hey, his attitude towards humanity is changing—maybe later he'll be able to join your squad. Wouldn't that be cool?Me: Hell yeah. I'll keep checking up on him between missions and help him on the road to acceptance as he matures as a character.Game: HA GOT YOU! Kill him. Like literally, I am making you. Do it.Me:    :’(----Game: Oh no! There's an enemy in your base, tearing it up! You better catch him!Me: Right you are Mr. Game! I spent so much time investigating all the different departments in my base, I don't want him to wreck any of it.Game: Right! Well then you better chase him through all these super interesting labs filled with neat experiments and devices and people, none of which were ever accessible to you up until now! Hurry and catch him!Me: Oh, wow these places do look really cool as I sprint through them. I'm excited to go back through here and interact with all this new content after I’m done with this chase!Game: TOO BAD LOSER. You will literally never set foot back in ANY part of your precious base after this current plot point is finished. GOOD DAY.Me:    :’( ----Game: Uh-oh! Two characters are pinned down in different areas of the map. It looks like you have to chose which NPC you want to go help! Don’t worry, I’ll let you know now that someone else is going to help the character you don’t choose, so IN NO WAY is this an arbitrary way of making you choose which character is going to die. Me: Game... why do you hate me...			",52,19,0,9,3,0,4

												As a guy who was able to find some enjoyment in the call of duty story lines, this game wasn't much of a difference. The repetive ""Pew Pew"" gameplay, the upscaling enemies having no skill on the easiest difficulties and picking up a random gun on the field and instantly aquiring the knowledge on how to use said weapon(don't forget shooting down an alien spaceship with your Colt M1911!). Besides that, I really like the concept of the game, just the way they did it. First off, the base, i don't know if it's just me, but i got lost so many times in the base, i would always be at the weapon range when i meant to go to research, the amount of people in the base was not preportionate the size, and the people on duty, just looked like they were ""derping around"".When i started combat it felt like Cod+Mass effect gameplay, so it was pretty much 3 guys hiding behind a car taking potshots at aliens who were stupid enough to poke their heads around corners.The troop system is interesting, with a 3 person sqaud going out leaving the 20 other guys back at base doing nothing because all the other missions are done. The only way you can get everyone to a good enough level is by sending everyone on a side mission.The story is filled with ""many"" oppurtunities to get to know the game, but it's just a bunch of talking and Agent Carter doing weird hand motions while he talks. Also the plot twist about the suitcase makes no sense, and it doesn't give any explanation as to how agent Carter got it. Also how it's only concentrated on the US and we have no clue about the rest of the world(Could make for some great DLC). There's not much about Carter's past except for the random flashbacks that he get's. The game is in no way similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown at all with the style of the enemies, and the 1960 US styled. Of course this is on purpose to give a different view, but there needs to be more about how tense the cold war made everyone in the US besides that one cutscene at the military base.Ah the DLC, the first DLC is just a pay-to-win thing where you get a cool gun at the beginning of the the game, the other 2 DLCs add some content which add some more to the story, but it doesn't really resolve the glaring story problems that already exist.Overall, if u enjoy CoD and was able to like the story, and the Mass Effect Gameplay, then u will have a great time with this game			",567,153,9,100,81,10,129

												This is not a bad game as reviewers claim it to be, its not the greatest game ever made, but it has its upsides and downsides. Its not a traditional xcom game, but more of a Mass Effect simmilare game. Defenetly worth playing it, enjoyed this game more than some of the recent FPS games i played.Postive+ Awesome visuals, all from graphics on characters, envoriment to effects and lighting, kickass.+ Intressting gameplay, with the amount of skills you and your agents have.+ The strategy part in this is okey, it was abit difficult at start to give orders, but once you get into it, its pretty sweet.+ Intressting level design, events that happen within them, places to see, keeps you wanting more.Negativ- Repetetivt overall layout design: weapon crates before bossfight, placed one midlevel aswell. Section blocks, you knew a combat was to accure after these. Go offtrack the objective position, to discover something and on your way back you get ambushed.- Alot in the story didnt make any sence or was poorly explained.- The AI agents can be pretty useless if you dont give them orders or keep track of what they are up to.- Very limited customization.Completed the whole game and all the DLC material. I thought it was pretty entertaining despite its flaws, if you get the chance to pick this game up, do it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Both the spiritual successor and spiritual predecessor to XCOM: ENEMY UNKNOWN, in this thrilling reboot, the enemy is both KNOWN and DECLASSIFIED. Although I confess that I don't actually understand the title, because in XCOM DECLASSIFIED, the enemy is not only.. well, classified.. but you engage in a vast cover-up campaign in the epilogue. Sooo. There's that. Whatever. That's not important. What IS important is that if you can overlook the gameplay, music, and writing, this game was really good! Unfortunately, and with much regret, those three things were included in the game and for some unknowable reason were made integral, and so the final score must suffer slightly as a result. The ending was very strange with a weird narrative device that would have been interesting in a written format, but felt a little frustrating with you being ripped out of the driver's seat of your own character.

												The game is clunky, the squadmate A.I. is suicidal in a game with perma-death and gear for your soldiers along with traits is badly explained and nebulous on what it does. There is no research or capturing for upgrades, though there is a leveling system that gives you access to more abilities as you go. Back to the game's clunkiness, guns have obscene amounts of recoil and if you don't use a mouse and keyboard you can't aim worth a damn. However the movement is also clunky and only really manageable with a controller. Enemies are massive bullet sponges as well. Had potential to be great, it's sub-par at best. Maybe good for a few hours at the current sales price.			",141,25,0,51,1,0,8

												When I first heard about ""The Bureau: X-COM"" I was both happy and sad, I was excited that it was going to be set in the 60's, I'm a sucker for old timer stuff (L.A. Noire, Mad Men etc.) but I also found out it wasn't a strategy game like ""X-COM: Ememy Unknown""... I was very skeptical at first, however after playing it for a couple of days now, I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed and my earlier skepticism was completely wrong, this truely is a great game!The visuals are absolutly marvelous, so much detail put into almost everything, the games style really captures the 60's era beautifully, as well as the sci-fi elements, all executed perfectly, beatiful and surreal at the same time. The sounds were also top notch, from the perfectly tuned soundtrack to the subtle ambiance of computers humming in the background, distant battles and leaky pipes, gun fire and explosions, the pew pew pews of laser cannons and the screams of Grey's being splattered on the battlefield, it all truely sucks you into the gameworld.The combat is much better then I expected, a great merger of 3rd person shooting and tactical strategy feel very comfortable, lots of skills/perks and 2 partners to issue orders to at any time, a little bit of management thrown in for good measure and lots and lots of skillful headshots and well placed grenades fill the action quite nicely, I was never bored, the difficulty was just right, unlike ""Enemy Within"" which could be hellish at times.Lastly is the story, overall it was quite good, had a great start, good pace, very strong arc.... then sadly fizzled at the end, I was a bit confused on the complete 180 the main character pulls in the last 30 minutes of the game, didn't make sense to me, besides that tho, it was quite good, lots of notes, photos, recordings and characters to interact with to enrich the backstory.In the end, I had a great time with ""The Bureau"" not quite sure why all the negativity towards it, I was a little skeptical at first but I'm glad I gave it a chance, one of the better games I've played all year, a great little mix of X-COM meets L.A. Noire meets Mass Effect, three games I absolutely love! 9/10			",959,285,31,72,60,7,99

												XCOM Declassified is a third person cover shooter with a somewhat turn based combat (its not really turn based but the game slowed down when you bring up the squad menu). Think of Mass Effect in XCOM universe but not that polished. The AI is somewhat dumb and you have to ordered it most of the time.The first part of the game is annoying because of your squad's AI, many times I almost gave up on the game and thought to bury it in my backlog. But once you finished a mission or two and you leveled up a bit, the game kinda grow on you. I suggest that you turn down the difficulty to easy in the first part of the game then just turn it up again when you leveled up a bit and got some laser/plasma weapon.Overall, its an ok game. Not great but not bad either. IMO, its worth the time that I spent on it finishing up the game and the 3.99 euro that I paid for it.			",1121,447,46,195,159,19,225

												Game is essentially Mass Effect set in 1960's XCOM without any meaningful dialogue options or deviations in the storyline based on choices you've made. Combat is fine other than your squadmates having no self-preservation, and the interaction of certain abilities with other objects is interesting. Voice acting is great, dialogue and story are pretty good. ""Customization"" is essentially useless. As more guns are introduced, it's quit clear that you essentially trade ammunition for firepower. Of the 20 or so backpacks available, a handful stick out as being viable. The lack of written companion characters left a huge hole open, I would have loved to take agents Weaver and DeSilva out on some missions. Instead, you get throw away red-shirts, who you only keep around because they need to be leveled up.Specific problems:-Short campaign (16 hours or so, with the optional missions)-No replay value-Lack of customization-Storyline inconsistencies-The entire end of the gameBuy this on sale. It's fun while it's good, but I wouldn't pay higher than $5.			",118,20,2,29,22,2,37

												Do not bother with this game, it looks the part and the voice acting of some of the NPC characters are superb, but the game play is repetative and not in a good way, instead of immersion you get a complete disonnect from what is happening and the story pace and telling is lack luster in the extreme, now i am not saying there are not moments of real joy or that you will not have fun but just beware you are getting a complete average game no real thrills yet no real pit falls, a distinct AVERAGE game by any stretch of the imagination.

												I wanted to give this game a chance because I love the Xcom universe. Visually it's very pretty. But it's another example of a game RUINED by trying to cater to console (controller) players. The control interface suffers on PC, because it is dumbed down for the controller.At the end of they day I found it unplayable, and a waste of money. Which is a bummer.			",38,1,2,4,1,0,2

												So another XCOM Game. This time a tactical 3rd person shooter eh?Whats good:Squad managment works wellStory is interestingInteresting tactical combinations (ever tried to go with 2 shield/taunt frontliners? ...works amazing Oo)Combat mechanics and feedback work quite fineThe 50s style is a big plus, i like that (but thats personal taste!)Whats bad:Its too easy... even on highest difficulty and with achievmenthunting...its still fairly easy compared to other xcom games! The amount of free choices are quite limited throughtout the gameThe ai is dumb as ♥♥♥♥. Sadly that counts for the enemy as well as your own troopers  :/Its fairly short and i estimate the replay value to be quite low. There isnt much too see after u played through it once. Sure there are some choices you could do different next time...but they are scattered so thin in between all the battles that its most probably not worth itThe character devolpment is quite shallow. And i mean that by all possible points:Equipment, skills and personalityConclusion:If you like Xcom games or  50s style / 3rd Person tactic combat : Then i'd say u are safe to buy this one :)			",159,32,0,63,15,0,39

												This is a good game in essence but in execution its not. The Bureau is a butchered console port that crashes every 5 meters you travel in game. I have tried multiple solutions such as windowed mode, running it in compatiblity mode and disabling PhysX, none of these things fix the crashes, making the game unplayable. This is the main reason for the negative review.If not for this issue, I would give the game a yes recommendation for how bad the plot is but for how good the actual gameplay is. Yes there are issues with sqaddies running into crossfires and dying, or not taking cover whilst being shot at but the gunplay works well when you are controlling Carter. Unfortunately, I have not been able to see more then about 15 mins of gameplay as the game constantly crashes for no reason.Also if you are looking for an XCOM/X-COM game, this is not it. This is its own game. If you want XCOM that does not crash and is an RTS, stick with the original trilogy or the remake of the original X-COM.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a mediocre FPS. The idea is that you're running a squad and are supposed to flank enemies but the maps are too narrow to do that effectively. Your squadmates are awful - you either need to micromanage them or do everything yourself.I didn't play that long, but from what I saw strategies are limited. As I said before, the maps are narrow, usually a road with wrecked vehicles or the equivalent, and the enemies are pretty close to you when they appear, so it's not like you've got a lot of choices about where to move. I can't see a sniper being any use at all.It's not the worst game I've ever played by a long shot. They did a good job of recreating the atmosphere of 1962, and I enjoyed that vibe they created. But this game is just not very good. I got this as part of a bundle and wouldn't recommend you buy this alone.			",33,14,1,22,26,3,7

												What to say..  If you're looking for a turn based experiance of squad VS. mobs of alien hoards you may have come to the wrong game but...I really enjoyed The Bureau.  It might not be in the traditional spirit of previous Xcom games.. and feels like a mashup between Mass Effect and Gears Of Wars, but it really seemed to deliver.The Burearu is a game about the struggle of a classy detective and his squadmates against inhuman odds.  The action is live and every order you make counts.  The combat is full of tension and adrenaline, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  If you're a fan of the Xcom lore and don't mind a deviation in gameplay style I'd definately recommend XCOM declassified.If you are in it for the turn based mechanic however, I plead with you to wait for the next xcom title, as the active third person shooter gameplay may not be up your alley. It is quite polished and I can not think of a single complaint to make, but it does not follow the gameplay tradition of the games of the series that game before it.That said, I have played all of The Bureau main campaign before writing this review (save for the post final boss content) and am 100% satisfied with the game save that I wish it was a little longer.

												could have been alot better.... should never have aliens speak at all... especially not english. Don't rush the games out of production to make a buck.... video game designing is art and so time should be taken so that it can be finished and polished instead assemble line production. My other issues with the game is that they changed the appearances of the aliens so that they are not recognizable from the turned based xcom game this game is derived from, which is a very good game. Also they changed the storyline from the turned based game, storyline also seemed a bit confusing at times ... very much despise the dialog and having to continually run around the base chatting with people for information as in mass effect 3 which made the game terrible in my opinion. Starts to feel like your playing a soap opera or something .... ok ok... so i like the managing and all but this game could have been so much better if they made it more like turned based game this is derived from. Its an alright shooter especially now that its on deal with steam but its overall a bit of a disappointment but I very much recomment the turn based enemy unknown excom game.			",137,19,0,24,19,0,37

												The Bureau tries very hard to be Mass Effect with an XCOM setting. It doesn't quite make the mark.The combat system has the potential to be better than what's found in Mass Effect with more opportunity for tactics with positioning, traps, and area denial abilities however they gunplay is unpolished and lacks the visceral feedback a headshot should have. The controls lack polish and the ability pathing system often gets stuck on certain edges and often times require awkward positioning to hit the intended marker.Backgrounds and scenery range from pretty damn good to foogly and character models feel dated and jarring inside of cutscenes. The ingame engine looks far better than the cutscenes which leaves one to question why the bawls they decided to not use the better of the two.Voice acting is well done though the dialogue lacks oomph and can come off as droney due to the dull characters. Sound and music miss their cue more often than not and when they function properly, lacks presence. Sound effects are missing from many scenes or muted for no apparent reason and some select recordings are overly loud.Pacing of the story was actually decent until they hit a jarring ""PLOT TWIST!"" moment and everything went into rollercoaster super fast action mode and not in a good way. It is like skimming through half of a story when it was just starting to get good.The Bureau lacks tries very hard to do what Mass Effect did but it lacks the interesting characters, budget, and polish to pull it off. XCOM has very interesting lore that this game somewhat tapped into via the scientists with their wacky inventions or the technology strapped to your character's arm and back. Sadly, good characters, story, and dialogue are almost non existent leaving the game feeling bland and average at best.Still, the combat abilities of this game are interesting and hopefully expanded upon in other games.  Third person shooters needs something else to do besides hide behind a wall and shoot once in a while and The Bureau's crack at it is a good start.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a third person gears of war style cover shooter mixed with a hipsterific alternate sixties setting and topped off with strategy elements on cooldown. Basically Mass Effect meets Mad Men meets Men in Black. If you play this game on the veteran setting and spend most of your time in battle focus mode, it makes for a decently entertaining challenge. The combat is solid, the strategy elements make it fun as long as you baby sit your teammates. Throw down turrets, lift enemies out of cover, sniper shots, stim buffs, it's got a nice variety of classes and skills, making most builds useful. The graphics are top notch, with support for DX11 and very cool eerie atmospheric environments and events. This game could have easily been a triple A epic, but in the end falls short of the hype to forever be destined to only be decently average experience.The story, unfortunately is all over the place, the game can't decide if it's a linear action heavy popcorn flick, a deep choice driven narrative, or a half-baked open sandbox rpg and just ends up with a sort of muddled, forgettable plot with everything thrown in. I have a feeling many cutscenes were endlessly revised by the devs.If you love the xcom games, then you'll probably hate this game, but if you like Mass Effect, then pick this up and you'll have a weekend rental ... errr whatever steam's equivalent is, sale price, yea ... thats it.

As some people have pointed out, friendly AI is pretty bad, so if you play in hard mode you'll have to reload some of the missions over and over again, making it a frustrating experience. In easy mode, though, you don't have to babysit your squadmates that much and the combat becomes much more fun and interesting.			",100,112,19,27,31,1,16

												First Impressions:Impressive amount of depth for a squad-based third person shooter - clearly built with a lot of love.It's the first in what hopefully becomes a very successful spin-off of the much beloved XCOM series.  In traditional XCOM, the entire game is played from a tactical point of view, giving orders to a unit of soldiers fighting against the alien menace. In the Bureau, you play as the commander of a squad, participating in combat as well as using a pretty unique ""Battle Focus"" system to issue orders.The actual issuing of orders is a bit tricky at times - the soldiers don't always do what you want them to do.  However, once you get used to the goofy little nuances, it easily becomes the most compelling and interesting feature of the game.A lot of people will tell you that this game isn't XCOM or it's some kind of abomination.  Those people are known as idiots.  This game was always intended to be a spinoff - If you're looking for something truer to the original experience, you're looking for XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  It has all the flavor and intrigue of XCOM, but again, it's a spinoff - it has a non-traditional gameplay style. It's my opinion that this is good. Others can disagree, but I don't actually care what they think.			",850,155,26,144,50,4,79

												I found The bureau: XCOM Declassified a very enjoyable game. The story and the setting are quite interesting, but I would advice everyone to play it with the lower difficulty levels. As some people have pointed out, friendly AI is pretty bad, so if you play in hard mode you'll have to reload some of the missions over and over again, making it a frustrating experience. In easy mode, though, you don't have to babysit your squadmates that much and the combat becomes much more fun and interesting.			",100,112,19,27,31,1,16

												The game has a bad rating my most, while I agree by no means is this the best game in the world, the story is OK, being able to fully adjust the control is good, and the game looks good, now for the bad, the videos were done in low graphic mode or something the game it self looks better than the video, the audio is off too. The combat is a bit boring, its the same thing over and over. Its not a bad pick up for $5-$7.50 price range			",102,19,1,22,10,0,29

												A decent Third person, action game with a focus on squad based tactics and cover mechanics. The story is a bit schlocky and sometimes boring, but the action segements make up for it in general. There is an interesting twist towards the end of the game which is original and fun. Overall, it is a decent enough game and provides about 15 hours of gameplay, but hard to recommend at full price.			",193,40,2,46,14,0,60

												If you like stradegy games and third person shooters, this game is definitely the game for you. To me the third person shooter made me feel like I was playing 'Red Dead Redemption' without the crazy fast lock on mechanic. For the stradegy potion of it well, it was awesome, I mean I really haven't ever played any XCOM games but the ones I have actually tried have been somewhat boring for me. Don't get me wrong, I love stradegy games, but I just haven't ever really been a big fan of turn based stradegy.The game features a captivating storyline that may or may not keep you on the edge of your seat, I mean come on who doesn't like space and aliens?In this game you'll get a squad on every mission, all having their own abilities just like in any XCOM game. You can customize the character's name, class, suit colors, and face. I do wish you had more to work with on the clothing portion of every character. But I won't take off score just for that!Each character you can arm with pretty much any gun as long as it's related to that specific class. For example, the support class starts with an M14 rifle, he can only use guns related to that so he is NOT able to use sniper rifles or shotguns.Lets dive in to the enemies, some are weak, some are strong. The weak ones you can just blow off your shoulder, you could run into a group of them and you may live. But in time you will start facing repair drones, and some aliens even have armor that you have to shoot off of them to even start to do damage to them. I thought the game was too easy until I got to those guys. Now, it's a descent challenge. And I like it.I love the story and gameplay. 9/10			",166,10,1,18,16,0,22

												This game is a t.i.t.s eventhough you don't see next gen♥♥♥♥♥♥ I wasnt sure if I was gonna like this game or not when I bought it. But right when the first mission's combat started I fell in love with it. The cover & shoot is so awesome. I wasn't sure I was gonna like the whole slow time & command your units, but once I came to know how it worked it was just a piece of cake with no frustration. Highly RECOMMENDED & Highly ADDICTIVE!! Although after a few minutes into the game you'll notice every character's animation is the same for every conversation you've. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU, IF :If you're expecting a run'n'gun.If you expect to kill all your enemies all by yourself.And any other reason you've for not liking this game.			",157,8,9,7,3,0,7

Short Version:7.5/10Overall, this game has nice visuals, solid squad-based tactical shooting, an OK story, and OK character and squadmate progression.Think Men in Black's weapons and effects meets Fallout 4's Pre-War setting.Longer VersionA reasonably well fleshed-out spin-off to the XCOM series, but it doesn't really carry and of XCOM's signature traits such as base-building, research, global council etc. For progression, you and your squadmates gain XP for killing aliens, and you find new equipment dotted around the linear levels. There is a base, but its purpose is more of a hub where you can talk to characters, edit your squad, and sign up for misions.It's not amazing outside of missions, but you will spend the majority of your time on assignments, blasting away at aliens. This is where the game shines; the levels are fairly linear, but each combat area is well-designed so that it is somewhat challenging, but gives you the chance (or sometimes forces you) to use all the weapons and abilities at your disposal. In doing this, very few, if any of the pieces of equipment and abilities feel redundant. The visuals are simple but nicely stylised, and the story is pretty much what you'd expect; a bit dry, but makes sense, and is just good enough to string the missions together.The obvious comparisons to the XCOM strategy game are: it's like manually leading a small, 3-man XCOM squad but there's no base-building elements character progression/loadouts are much more simplified no real consequences for your actions; permadeath of squadmates can be circumvented by loading the last checkpoint (very frequently saved) slightly stronger emphasis on story more linear, but has side-missions and one or two other diversions much nicer graphics, both in terms of quality and style, in my opinion ",263,31,10,20,10,1,14

												Having played XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I must say The Bureau is an entirely different experience altogether. Unlike Enemy Unknown, the Bureau is more like a rewritten story of how XCOM came about. Despite many reviews criticising it for being too rigid and not really an enjoyable experience, I feel otherwise.In my humble opinion, The Bureau storyline was splendidly written. Never once did I feel a sense of boredom. The gameplay can be cruel too, one wrong move and bam your created teammate/AI dies. Perhaps most people won't feel the lost but for me it did. When my AI died in one of the later missions I felt the full brunt of the impact, as I had to resort to using one of my lower level-ed AI in his stead. However that gives the game realism and in that sense the player have to make each and every decision wisely. On a side note, the gameplay(3rd person FPS) reminds me a lot of GRAW2(Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2). As for replay value, it really depends on individuals. I probably would give the game another go and try out different classes but at the same time maybe not. Please pardon me for sidetracking, but I couldn't finish Bioshock Infinite, although it was spectacular I felt that it was overhyped, and not really my type of game whereas Dishonored had me engaged. Therefore as I said it depends on individuals! Just to give anyone reading this a hint: THERE WOULD BE A PLOT TWIST :D All in all, I give the Bureau the mighty thumbs up it deserves and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of FPS!

												This game is simply amazing. I don't normally game for more than one hour every few days but The Bureau had me playing nonstop for 6 hours straight two days in a row. I understand that this XCOM game is not like the others in the series as the point of view is different and there are no turns but it really is worth playing. You still however can assign tasks to each of your team mates. The game is more of a first person shooter unlike the previous XCOM games but it trutly is an amazing game. I'm in chronic pain and sitting for even an hour is hard so sitting for 6 is normally impossible for me but I was so enthrolled with the gameplay and story that I was able to ignore my increasing pain. Normally in games I don't really care about the story, my main interests are the gameplay and the graphics but with The Bureau I actually listened to every converstation and cut scene and went around reading all of the paper work left on desks. I have beat the main game and am now working on the DLC (this by the way is also really good) but I really suggest people try it out. I'm not sure if there is a demo but if there is give that whorl.. I truly do think it will be worth it. If there isn't a demo watch a YouTube gameplay video without comentary (that way it's not biased). Overall I give this game a 10/10. Totally worth the money I spent! Give it a chance, I really don't think you'll regret it!			",321,67,4,18,29,0,23

												If the gameplay of BioWare's Mass Effect and Telltale's The Walking Dead had a child, and if the ambiance of X-Com and Fallout had a child, and those two children grew up and had their own child together, that child would be The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.  The game is a lot of fun, and presents itself very accurately in its advertisements.  It's a squad-based tactical game where you control the main character and two squadmates.  You put your squad together as you run around the base solving dialogue mini-quests and then launch when you feel you are prepared.  The game stays true to its XCOM lore, and you are given lots of scenarios to test your tactics.  The game took me about 20 hours to beat on Veteran, and I didn't get all the achievements.  The game is fun, can be challenging, and appropriate for all ages.  For $25 this game is an absolute steal, for $35 it's a great grab, and for $45 you get what you pay for.  8/10			",72,17,0,17,6,1,37

												I'm just going to clerify this now. I love the original XCOM games. The ones that were hard as hell, and made everything into a exceedingly one sided game of Russian Roulette.That being said, I can't honestly recommend The Bureau. While it is an XCOM game, it just lacks the feeling of XCOM. The chance to hit doesn't mean anything like it did in the old games, and as long as you have line of sight it's almost always a hit. There is strategy in it, and I do appreciate their attempt to make height and range a factor in battle. But the skills that your units gain from combat make it too easy to bulldoze through the aliens.On the other hand, it does have a very interesting story. One that shows history in a stranger light, and almost seems like it came from a tabloid magazine or some conspiracy theorist's mind. It's interesting, but could have been so much more. XCOM is known as a world organization, yet in this game is only shown as a United States one. Yes, there is reasoning for it in the story, but that doesn't mean that you have to limit the game map to just the US. What about Canada? Or Mexico? Maybe Europe or Asia? What happened there? How did they fight? Did they fight?Maybe thats just me asking too many questions. But there are plot holes that could have been filled. Overall, it is ok. Not good enough for me to recommend it to anyone, but still stable enough to be played and enjoyed by some. Graphicly, it looked nice. Explosions and blood was somewhat realistic, and the details in the aliens was nice. Gameplay wise, it could have been stronger, and less formulated like most 3rd person shooters.I'd honestly give it a 3/5 rating, with a strong warning to anyone who wants to buy it.

												Good for a bargain, but I wouldn't buy at full price again.It's tough to decide to recommend this game or not. The first half of the game gives a pretty interesting set of third person shooter mechanics, squad based combat and an interesting story. About half way in they screw with your character and it really breaks the immersion, and the combat just goes OFF THE CHARTS ridiculous. The story line also devolved quite a bit. Overall, I liked all the XCOM references, but the mechanics don't hold up to the ridiculous spike in game play difficulty and the story line loses itself about half way through.

												Very good game. Essentially, this is Mass Effect but with a XCOM skin. Which is basically saying that it's a really good game. Tactics and commands being issued effectively is more important than shooting skills. The classes are well realized, though I feel the Support class is very weak, it still has uses. The missions are kinda long, but like I said, Mass Effect with a new skin. The graphics are pretty good looking, nothing crazily award winning, but some of the vistas are quite pretty. Rating from 1 to 10, I'd give it a 8 - 9, maybe an 7 depending on how the last quater of the game shakes out, especially considering the price tag.			",71,13,0,19,2,0,17

												The Bureau sets a nice retro feel to the classic XCOM theme, but it fails in immersion, natural animations, and strategy.  Watching any of the characters brings a constant repulsion for the natural movements in every aspect.  Bad animation.  For immersion, there are only a few objects to interact with in any scene and only in a few ways, usually just examining, and there is usually only one direction to move (linear).  I don't mind the hero super powers, but the constant, instant life revives do require a large suspension of disbelief that interfere somewhat from the enjoyment.			",18,2,0,6,2,0,8

												This game has one good feature: -Cool graphics.Then there is the rest:-The game progresses by the choices you make. You usually have one option, so that is just laughably horrible, and a waste of time.-The gameplay characters are iconic idiots, through and through. I have yet to meet one NPC that would even resemble a real person.-The gameplay engine is annoying with some horrible, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and simply stupid flaws. Example: The sniper is the best weapon (most fun and actually useful), but you can only carry 15 rounds. If you know a little bit about weapons, you will know that it uses almost the same ammo as the autorifle, and you can carry 200 rounds for that. For no reason other than annoying the player. Just horrible and unexplainable...-And the game controls themselves are bad and unprecise. -Almost every major encounter starts with a cutscene. Standard ""OMFG this was never playtested but anyone with a brain""-experience. This usually means your character (and his stupid followers, more on that later) will run out in the middle of any place to make sure any tactical advantage or chance of survival is forfit before the fight starts.-The followers ability to only follow orders for a short period of time makes you want to kill them yourselves. And giving orders is a slowmo of real time, which means the unprecise tactical view is, on it's own, a reason not to play this poor excuse for a game.			",235,40,0,81,29,6,72

												This game is a t.i.t.s eventhough you don't see next gen♥♥♥♥♥♥ I wasnt sure if I was gonna like this game or not when I bought it. But right when the first mission's combat started I fell in love with it. The cover & shoot is so awesome. I wasn't sure I was gonna like the whole slow time & command your units, but once I came to know how it worked it was just a piece of cake with no frustration. Highly RECOMMENDED & Highly ADDICTIVE!! Although after a few minutes into the game you'll notice every character's animation is the same for every conversation you've. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU, IF :If you're expecting a run'n'gun.If you expect to kill all your enemies all by yourself.And any other reason you've for not liking this game.			",157,8,9,7,3,0,7

												This is a review from someone that has never played any of the other XCOM games. I find this game to be fun with a decent story and lots of action and tactics to be used when encountering the enemy. I am not certain why this game has negative reviews but I am thinking it is because it is so different from the other games in the series - if you can look past that you may find a very fun game waiting for you to play. This is an action tactical game where you and two squadmates take on the enemy and you have to postion your men and yourself in order to achieve victory. You train your men up and enter battle while finding out things about the invaders. If you like old campy sci-fi movies from the 50's and 60's you will feel right at home with this game.

												If you're looking for a classic turn-based XCOM game, this one isn't for you.  But as a 3rd person shooter, with a 60s setting, and alien invasion story, its a good game overall.GraphicsPassable, but not impressive.  Nice style, decent quality. * PhysX Particles causes a huge drop on my 970.GameplayMass Effect ultra-lite.  My only major complaint about the gameplay is that squad mates don't automatically use abilities, awkwardly slowing down the pace of combat.  The targeting system for some abilities is handled very oddly.  Lack of weapon variety, but cover and shooting mechanics work well, and abilities have impact, with minor variety, and incentive to level up, though some classes seem much more useful than others.  StoryAlien invasion in the 60s!  Kept me interested, though it feels detached from other XCOM games.			",302,25,6,60,22,1,51

												The game looks great and can run quite well on lower end hardware. The gameplay is different than most games as it is a hybrid between FPS & strategic skyview games. I find it quite easy to play, on for some reason default ""Veteran"" difficulty but some people in the reviews have said that it´s too hard etc. I think this is a great game but the storyline is very short for the money it costs (I have completed it in 18 hours, so I wouldn´t recommend buying this game seperately without any bonuses, I got it for free from my brother as I´m his equivalent of game-bin.

												If you want a TLDR review: this is Mass Effect's combat system 1:1, in Mafia I-II world, with enemies from XCOM:EU. Nothing more, nothing less, and with a few spots that could have been better.First of all, the story is close to non existent. Basicly everyone is functional as role that keeps an undercover agency working, instead of having any kind of personality. This isn't a negative thing, it's not why we ever liked any XCOM for, and this one isn't any different - until the very end. That where the devs decided to go for Mass Effect 3 storytelling, and not only they achieved a similar, but an even worse disaster of things that doesn't make sense anyhow, even on a single character's decision level or as game in a whole. Or just basic logic. But, this is mainly the last hour, and you'll have about 10-13 before that. How's that?That part, is actually great. Just don't even think about touching a console controller or playing on normal difficulty. The combat is really challanging, smart and tactical, later on however can become slightly automatic and boring even on Veteran difficulty, just because you naturally reached better technology, levels and abilities. Other than that, it's like you have a dream Star Wars: Republic Commando, just not Star Wars, and there is more customization to it. Which leads me to my last point where I can throw anything bad on this game: customization. XCOM:EU could have been better on visual customization of our soldiers (and it's sequel is really good looking on this part!), but Declassified is another step back from that. You can change names, 3 or 4 colors on a suit, and that's it. When you recruit a new agent, you can also choose from ~8 premade faces, plus skin color. You cannot have women as agents, or customize visual looks, which is really a miss because you are not supposed to blend in to the crowd, you meet noone but aliens anyway.Overall: Declassified is good, as an average good game can be. It has some unique touches here and there, the action depending on your chosen difficulty level can be really great, but it's one of those games that have absolutely great gameplay, but nothing else. The story is non existent, the customization in it's current form is really hurting that it's not deeper, the characters are throwaway faces. And that's totally fine for XCOM:EU that is a strategy game, but the whole reason Declassified exists as it is, is changing the perspective and bringing it down to a personal level of a group of agents, and it's a failure at that. If there is ever a sequel on this and they can improve on that, it's potentially GOTY material. For this, it's great, but you have to know why you buy it, to not have expectations the game cannot meet. My only problem is, that it still tries, and does it bad. But that's only the last hour, don't let me made you back off if you are thinking about buying it. That means you are looking for a good, really tactical TPS. Declassified, is really good at that.

												The AI in the game is AWFUL. It would have been better if they did NOTHING without your consent, because often times, if you tell them to take cover to avoid being gunned down by an enemy on a turret, they will run full speed right into its line of fire the moment you look away from them. So combat, which was the most common thing in this game, is extremely frustrating and you are guranteed to lose multiple squad members in every mission.			",384,123,3,32,30,6,19

One day I'll probably go back, but as of now, the best thing about spending $50 on this at launch was the XCOM pack that came with it (all previous XCOM games).			",418,98,7,34,36,1,48

												First things first. This game has most of XCom lore I can think of. Except for explanation why present-day XCom has no idea about these events. Even though in the game they specifically said that whoever have that knowledge is either dead or with XCom already. So that plot hole is pretty much only bad thing. Now to good parts. FIrst of all - they explained aliens structure properly via dialogs and not mumbling of an alien in the end of a game. That's cool. In fact they even explained why this game is in third person view.Gameplay is probably one of the most solid gameplay I've seen for a while. AI is amazing! They constantly try to push you into the open and♥♥♥♥♥♥you with plasma/lasers. So u have to use your full arsenal of guns and abilities.Graphics - m-m... it's a game which I think most likely was targeted for current gen consoles. And it wasn't made by Naughty Dog or DICE. So don't expect mind blowing graphics. It's only good.Voice acting will bring ya into that era of movies from 90s where main character speaks with crazy action hero voice while constantly croaking.I'd give it something like 8/10 and recommend to buy and play it. Go on Veteran for your first playthrough. You'll love what game will throw into ya :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified got mediocre reviews for a reason... For eight hours you play a mostly fun tactical shooter, with a solid, kind of quirky story. Then, IT (IT being a story spoiler) happens. The games throws in this twist that kills it. I mean, really kills it. It tries so hard to get that shock ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, and it does. And here comes the big 'BUUUuuuUUT"", it then proceeds to have the main character of the game, no foreshadowing, nothing... GO BAT♥♥♥♥♥♥CRAZY. I mean nuts. He's tries to reject IT, and IT doesn't like that. They force feed you something that just makes the storyline extra dumb. I really wish everyone would wait for this game to be worth 15 - 20$ (or your regional equivalent) and then give this game a shot. Even if you only play it for, say, three hours. By that point you will have seen all that the game has to offer, and be able to say ""Yes, i do want to see what this game did wrong. Why does everyone think this game is so bad?"". And trust me.. When you get to the twist, and hear what IT has to say, it will be followed by ""oh, that's what it was""i realize this isn't a recommendation... but, atleast someone will see it. Right?

I found myself routing and beating the 'hardest' aliens in seconds.  The story was some what enjoyable other than the main character getting super powers (suchas being able to lift aliens and turrents into the air) without so much as trying to figure out where the powers came from... At least until he actually get's slapped in the face with the answer then nolonger wants them...  I was able to beat the game in 23.7 Hours (Commander difficulty) so I'd wait for a 50%+ off steam sale to pick this one up if your not a die hard XCOM fan.

It has some unique touches here and there, the action depending on your chosen difficulty level can be really great, but it's one of those games that have absolutely great gameplay, but nothing else. The story is non existent, the customization in it's current form is really hurting that it's not deeper, the characters are throwaway faces. And that's totally fine for XCOM:EU that is a strategy game, but the whole reason Declassified exists as it is, is changing the perspective and bringing it down to a personal level of a group of agents, and it's a failure at that. If there is ever a sequel on this and they can improve on that, it's potentially GOTY material. For this, it's great, but you have to know why you buy it, to not have expectations the game cannot meet. My only problem is, that it still tries, and does it bad. But that's only the last hour, don't let me made you back off if you are thinking about buying it. That means you are looking for a good, really tactical TPS. Declassified, is really good at that.

												This game is nothing like XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I was expecting a strategy game, instead I got a first person shooter with awkward controls and an AI that couldn't fight it's way out of a paper bag. The cinematics and the conversations are well done, and the game looks good, but it lacks the polish of a properly finished game. The characters can only level up to level 5, and their new skills underwhelm. The game is a cover based shooter, but I find myself stuck to the cover as I try to leave due to the awkward controls. They don't explain why the main character gets the ability to lift people at level 2, I think they put it in there to copy Mass Effect. And what's this with the DLC weapons? The game basically gives you weapons, there is no R&D. An there is really only a couple different weapons in the game without DLC. The DLC is an obvious cash grab, not something that adds to the game, but something that should have been included in the first place! The game is still entertaining, but definitely not a blockbuster hit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually like this game thus far. I play it on one of the higher difficulties and it's nice that you have to use a bit of tactic to win. Sometimes it's annoying how weak your squadmates are but they have some OP skills so that evens it out a bit. Overall it's a very good game to pick up for 5-10 bucks if you're into games like mass effect or so...			",221,37,3,14,22,0,13

												The Bureau was a joyless game. The characters were flat and stiff, as was the story. The combat is a watered-down version of Mass Effect, also devoid of any real fun. Easily a third, if not more, of the game play time is spent simply running from room to room in your base; tedious and dull. I never felt really rewarded for any of the missions, it was just and endless progression towards the end. Even when you unlock the UFO, your combat sessions still begin by showing you arrive in the same old copter from the beginning of the game. The game simply refuses to give you any memorable moments, almost spitefully pulling you forward on a short leash.The combat works, but feels more like an initial draft and not a fully fleshed out system. Since the rest of the game is simply running from room to room on your base endlessly, you'd think they would have crafted a deep, engaging combat system. You would be wrong. It's relatively fast paced, ammo is limited which forces you to scavenge the levels for weapons. I can see how they intended this to keep players from nesting in secure spots for very long. Your party has abilities, several of them directly taken from ME's biotic powers, it's just nowhere near as enjoyable. Even though the maps change throughout the game, the combat itself begins to feel repetitive very early on.Even at the end, which I won't spoil for those who feel they must play this game, you are asked to make a choice between characters from the story, characters you have no reason to care for one way or the other. It's as if they felt suddenly at the end you must face a terrible decision and arbitrarily shoehorned one in. The ending was terrible and left me very unsatisfied. I did complete it. At 17 hours it's barely a few evenings worth of play, which is a good thing. By that point I was ready to be done.			",80,31,1,25,5,0,19

												When I saw all the early previews for what they wanted this game to be I was excited. It was creepy, it was tense, it was dangerous, and it looked fun.This is not that game.This is a third person shooter with a stilted plotline, meaningless choices, and hours of walking down a straight path shooting at aliens from behind a chest high wall.At one point in the game you are told that your forces are doing terribly against the aliens. I was never sure how that could be as I was killing hundreds of them each level.The problem was that they were trying to build up the tension of putting you in a world where you were outgunned, outmanned, and pretty much screwed. And then put you into a third person shooter which requires you to shoot and defeat enemies left right and center for it to be fun.The combination doesn't work well.There's no unlocking weapons, technology, or anything else. You will recieve weapons when you pass levels, and you will gain equipment when your people level up. There's no sense in reall changing loadouts because they'll all feel the same in the end.Your allies will be remarkably usless at doing anything other than getting themselves killed. I can not remember a single time they pulled me out of a dangerous situation, even when they had the single remaining enemy flanked.And the choices you can make are rendered moot by the end game. I fought to save one character. Did it make a difference? Maybe, depends on the ME3 ""Which button did you choose"" ending. Anything before that? Never gets mentioned.There are better third person shooters, dont' waste your time or money on this one. It just never lived up to it's potential.			",138,34,0,41,7,0,9

												If you want a TLDR review: this is Mass Effect's combat system 1:1, in Mafia I-II world, with enemies from XCOM:EU. Nothing more, nothing less, and with a few spots that could have been better.First of all, the story is close to non existent. Basicly everyone is functional as role that keeps an undercover agency working, instead of having any kind of personality. This isn't a negative thing, it's not why we ever liked any XCOM for, and this one isn't any different - until the very end. That where the devs decided to go for Mass Effect 3 storytelling, and not only they achieved a similar, but an even worse disaster of things that doesn't make sense anyhow, even on a single character's decision level or as game in a whole. Or just basic logic. But, this is mainly the last hour, and you'll have about 10-13 before that. How's that?That part, is actually great. Just don't even think about touching a console controller or playing on normal difficulty. The combat is really challanging, smart and tactical, later on however can become slightly automatic and boring even on Veteran difficulty, just because you naturally reached better technology, levels and abilities. Other than that, it's like you have a dream Star Wars: Republic Commando, just not Star Wars, and there is more customization to it. Which leads me to my last point where I can throw anything bad on this game: customization. XCOM:EU could have been better on visual customization of our soldiers (and it's sequel is really good looking on this part!), but Declassified is another step back from that. You can change names, 3 or 4 colors on a suit, and that's it. When you recruit a new agent, you can also choose from ~8 premade faces, plus skin color. You cannot have women as agents, or customize visual looks, which is really a miss because you are not supposed to blend in to the crowd, you meet noone but aliens anyway.Overall: Declassified is good, as an average good game can be. It has some unique touches here and there, the action depending on your chosen difficulty level can be really great, but it's one of those games that have absolutely great gameplay, but nothing else.

Short Version:7.5/10Overall, this game has nice visuals, solid squad-based tactical shooting, an OK story, and OK character and squadmate progression.Think Men in Black's weapons and effects meets Fallout 4's Pre-War setting.Longer VersionA reasonably well fleshed-out spin-off to the XCOM series, but it doesn't really carry and of XCOM's signature traits such as base-building, research, global council etc. For progression, you and your squadmates gain XP for killing aliens, and you find new equipment dotted around the linear levels. There is a base, but its purpose is more of a hub where you can talk to characters, edit your squad, and sign up for misions.It's not amazing outside of missions, but you will spend the majority of your time on assignments, blasting away at aliens. This is where the game shines; the levels are fairly linear, but each combat area is well-designed so that it is somewhat challenging, but gives you the chance (or sometimes forces you) to use all the weapons and abilities at your disposal. In doing this, very few, if any of the pieces of equipment and abilities feel redundant. The visuals are simple but nicely stylised, and the story is pretty much what you'd expect; a bit dry, but makes sense, and is just good enough to string the missions together.The obvious comparisons to the XCOM strategy game are: it's like manually leading a small, 3-man XCOM squad but there's no base-building elements character progression/loadouts are much more simplified no real consequences for your actions; permadeath of squadmates can be circumvented by loading the last checkpoint (very frequently saved) slightly stronger emphasis on story more linear, but has side-missions and one or two other diversions much nicer graphics, both in terms of quality and style, in my opinion ",263,31,10,20,10,1,14

												Having played XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I must say The Bureau is an entirely different experience altogether. Unlike Enemy Unknown, the Bureau is more like a rewritten story of how XCOM came about. Despite many reviews criticising it for being too rigid and not really an enjoyable experience, I feel otherwise.In my humble opinion, The Bureau storyline was splendidly written. Never once did I feel a sense of boredom. The gameplay can be cruel too, one wrong move and bam your created teammate/AI dies. Perhaps most people won't feel the lost but for me it did. When my AI died in one of the later missions I felt the full brunt of the impact, as I had to resort to using one of my lower level-ed AI in his stead. However that gives the game realism and in that sense the player have to make each and every decision wisely. On a side note, the gameplay(3rd person FPS) reminds me a lot of GRAW2(Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2). As for replay value, it really depends on individuals. I probably would give the game another go and try out different classes but at the same time maybe not. Please pardon me for sidetracking, but I couldn't finish Bioshock Infinite, although it was spectacular I felt that it was overhyped, and not really my type of game whereas Dishonored had me engaged. Therefore as I said it depends on individuals! Just to give anyone reading this a hint: THERE WOULD BE A PLOT TWIST :D All in all, I give the Bureau the mighty thumbs up it deserves and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of FPS!

												Good for a bargain, but I wouldn't buy at full price again.It's tough to decide to recommend this game or not. The first half of the game gives a pretty interesting set of third person shooter mechanics, squad based combat and an interesting story. About half way in they screw with your character and it really breaks the immersion, and the combat just goes OFF THE CHARTS ridiculous. The story line also devolved quite a bit. Overall, I liked all the XCOM references, but the mechanics don't hold up to the ridiculous spike in game play difficulty and the story line loses itself about half way through.

												Very good game. Essentially, this is Mass Effect but with a XCOM skin. Which is basically saying that it's a really good game. Tactics and commands being issued effectively is more important than shooting skills. The classes are well realized, though I feel the Support class is very weak, it still has uses. The missions are kinda long, but like I said, Mass Effect with a new skin. The graphics are pretty good looking, nothing crazily award winning, but some of the vistas are quite pretty. Rating from 1 to 10, I'd give it a 8 - 9, maybe an 7 depending on how the last quater of the game shakes out, especially considering the price tag.			",71,13,0,19,2,0,17

												The Bureau is not a chore, although it does feel as if some of its welds are not wholly set. However, it is hard to know who exactly will pay full price for it – its mechanisms and its title both evoke franchises offering more depth and replay value, which are already discounted. A release before the big guns start their winter, next-gen offensive may tempt the curious, but this may be one for fans of the series to keep an eye on rather than rush out to buy. 2K, meanwhile, can look towards their next project, having at least delivered what many thought was an impossible project.

												Good shooter with good story. It is not ""typical"" X-COM. It is not turn based strategy. I do not really know why it has a X-COM in title, because if somebody sais 'X-COM', I think 'turn based strategy with bad aliens to kill and with technologies to discover'. No, no, no. It is not this game. But! It is damn good game. Full of action, with good story behind. Really nice production. Imho one of better shooters of last years.			",272,138,7,33,21,1,33

												3rd person, squad based, action, tactical shooter versus aliens. This game is about Alien invasion on a late 1900's Earth. You play as a XCOM Agent, carefully selected people who were professionals in their field of work, before joining the The Bureau. Be it in CIA, FBI, NSA and other agencies.XCOM is a secret US government facility, made to counter invasion attempts on US soil. Game has really good story but a bit not realistic with all the ""borrowing alien technology"" aspect. World art style is mix of 1950-1970's retro and futuristic alien sci-fi elements.There are many weapons in the game, from WWII pistols, rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenades to sci-fi alien weapons, that share similar concepts (plasma pistols, plasma rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc.). All alien weapons are energy based, with their own ammunition.You can recruit different types of soldier classes, that are experts in their field of combat. Be it simple engineer, that can deploy turrets, sniper that can deal heavy damage from range, commando who can absorb damage and taunt enemies, or support class that can boost your squads damage, increase survivability, etc.Each class has their own skill tree, abilities and weapon preferences. One is good at range, other can survive a lot of punishment, third can manipulate the battlefield to your advantage, etc.. Personal and squad abilities can be chained from tactical ""Focus"" mode, you can very easily position your soldiers, order them to focus one target, revive injured ally.AI is very good and will often flank you, flush you out of cover and rush up on you, depending on what alien unit it is. Game environment and level design is great, with a lot of room for flanking and surprise attacks. Enemy variation is also good, with close range, long range units mixed with air and stealth units.Game is somewhat similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown in some aspects. You control, improve, gear up your squad, send them on rescue, Intel missions or accompany them on more harder side missions apart from main story missions. You can recruit only male soldiers for your squad, if someone wanted females, it's not possible. Sadly you don't research alien technology yourself, or make items, those are automatically managed by game and XCOM Agency itself.Game has a lot of character dialogues, with choice and effect, consequence system. Voice acting is good, texture quality and visuals are good, character control and animations were decent. Game is about 15 hours long and was a blast to playthrough. It's not as punishing as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, being a shooter, game is fairly forgiving and there's a lot of room for personal error, compared to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.Game was very fun and enjoyable.

												I'm loving this game!  It's a really good addtion to the Xcom universe that I love. It is unorthodox to the normal Xcom games. Maybe this was the reason for my late adapting.Now I can enjoy the pace of the game. I definitly like the turn they took with this game. It looks great and the story seems good so far.  I mean I love U.F.O’s mysteries as well as the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  Maybe it’s just my geeky love for U.F.O’s in general.  Whatever the case if you like Mass Effect I think you will like this one too. This game deserves more then Mixed review. Definitely needs to be in the positives. I highly recommend it to Xcom or Alien geeks like myself.			",74,24,0,11,2,0,4

Your squadmates are idiots and seem to  die often early on; plus you lack any abilities that will really help you early on.  Towards mid-game everything becomes MUCH more fun.  I ended up playing with a Tank/Sniper combo that allowed me to just wreck alien enemies.All said and done, I would definitely recommend this game, but the beginning is rather frustrating.

												The Bureau XCOM Declassified isn’t bad game as people say it is (especially XCOM hardcore fans).I know that it isn’t a classic XCOM game and that it struggles to find its place in the XCOM-series. But it provides a solid experience if you´re a person who likes 3rd person shooters and sometimes meaningless shooting.The story is quite intriguing.  The combat is decent and the AI of the enemies is surprisingly good. The command system works remarkably well because you have to constantly issue new orders to your NPCs. Things that I disliked was that the combats weren’t that strategic as the other XCOM games, sometimes it was just too much meaningless shooting.  The world felt like the game Resistance, and it felt really empty which made the game a little boring time to time. The DLC that the game has to offer is just not worth is because it does not add anything new. If you want the DLC buy it when the game is on sale.I give this game a solid 7.5/10.

												Gameplay - Mass Effect 2 clone. However, I felt it was more crucial to employ squadmember skills during battle than what i was used to in Mass Effect 2 on similar difficult. This is a good thing. (Saying Mass Effect 2 since i haven't yet completed 3)Difficulty - I played it on the second hardest difficulty and although the learning curve was alright, it started out alot tougher than expected. Expect a hard time against your first Muton unless you're above average in tactics and how you pick your squads.Graphics - The graphics are alright. I'm not really that good on judging them though since i put gameplay first. Everything reminded me again of Mass Effect 2, though the the backdrop is the early 60s in the US. The main character animation during story dialogues was repetive though.Story - I expected a lot more shallow story from the get go. It really suprised me how it twists and turns later on. The side missions were quite a bit lacking though, and again something picked up from the Mass Effect franchise. I didn't really feel there were any rewards to them either.Sound - Music and sound effects were solid. Voice acting above average and in style with what i feel is true for the 60s. There are also quite a few references to early 60s rock music.The Bad - Although i encountered no gamebreaking bugs, there are a few annoying ones. Like dialogue looping after the sequence is finished, items that have been checked will glow again after a side mission if you have tips on in options and a few glitchy things now and then.Bottom line - Anyone with interest in 3rd person action, bioshock rpgs or the Xcom franchise should find value here. I really enjoyed it while not expecting it to be anything more than a twitchy, corridor, action game.			",152,33,1,17,12,0,33

												First things first. 1, Forget about metascore (currently around 6.5), this game is far better than this.2, This is not a strategy, it´s a tactical TPS.3, I am not hardcore XCOM fan (I played only XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within - and I love those games)4, I´m fat and I have a bad haircut. Deal with it.When The Bureau was announced, I was super excited, because the trailer looked amazing, the premise of alien attack situated in the USA in 60s as FPS with some tactical elements seemed great. We all know that there were some problems during the development and that the game was reworked many times. That sounds like a bad thing ( *cough* Colonial Marines *cough*), eh? Well it is NOT. GRAPHICS are stunning (I played on DX11). Seriously, I´ve never seen a game with better lightning of a scene. I often caught myself just staring on the scene and taking screenshots, because it simply looked beautiful. It required a decent hardware though on HIGH setting, I played on MID-HIGH. No cons. 10/10 GAMEPLAY The main part of the game are fights of course. Ever played Mass Effect? Imagine that, but better ( HERESY!). Far better. Yea, I said that. Here is the thing. On a mission, you can take two agents with you. Each agent can have one of four classes (Engineer, Recon, Commando, Support). I´ve ended up using Support and Engineer (Engineer can put a turret or mines on the battlefield, Support creates a shield, can give a stims to the whole team etc). You have a special class, called Agent. You can Heal, do some kind telekinetics, put a drone on a battlefield, and at level 9 out 10, you can use a mind control ( yea, those are not the agents you are looking for). You can give the commands to your team via command list (imagine KOTOR). When you press SPACE key, it will put you in slow motion mod and you have lot of time to think (not that much though, the game is not completely freezed). At the beginning of the game you will not use it that much, but when the♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan (that means when Sectopod or Muton introduce themselves on a scene), you will beg for mercy and most of the time, you will end up planning what to do, where to put your agents, and wondering how the ♥♥♥♥ you are supposed to kill them all. This game is challenging on a first walkthrough. Not THAT hard, but decently hard.    The weaponry of this game is not too big ( Colt 1911, M14, Springfield,  then laser and plasma variations, grenades), but nothing to complain, the main power of this game is within the abilities/perks of the team).   One thing bothered me though. A.I. of the squadmates. There are not dumb, not really, but they are not shooting much when no order is given to them, and they do not roll out when a ♥♥♥♥ing grenade is under them! That was the only thing that was frustrating me. 8.5/10STORY is decent, nothing original of course, but it drives you towards the end, because you will want to know what the hell is happening here (or ... well, THERE). The main character, William Carter, is and old school badass agent with some serious issues from the past, but when the♥♥♥♥♥♥needs to be done, he is called for duty.  I do not want to spoil anything, so let´s just say that story is kinda ""mass-effectish"". 7/10FINAL VERDICTI enjoyed this game very much, it was challenging, with not original, but interesting story. Together with awesome graphics and gameplay, I must say to the world - ♥♥♥♥ METACRITICS. I do regret that I didn´t bought this game at launch but on Summer Sale, and it´s shame that there will be no sequel ( the game was not succesful in terms of sales)9/10			",450,96,12,47,36,7,51

												Not quite in the same style as XCom: Enemy Unknown, this XCom title takes on a more first person/squad approach.  It's playstyle is a mix between real time and turn based.  To compare it to the original 1990s XCom series, this game's combat system mirrors the attempts at real time integration with turn based strategy which was attempted in the XCom Apocolypse game.  If you're looking for a game similar to XCom Enemy Unknown, this is likely NOT the game for you.  I recommend the DLC of Enemy Within.  If you're looking for a stand-alone, good game, in the XCom universe, that's a mix between FPS, TBS, and RTS, pick up this title.			",78,12,0,12,7,0,12

												This is a good enough game but has some pretty bad points as well. It's a good  game, good bit of fun alternate history however it does contain a few problems. Namely, an issue with a lot of games where it gives you command over a squad, is the AI squad. The game gives you full control over two teammates, little good that is as they don't listen to you... at all. It's like leading the two blind mice (it would've been the three blind mice but the third one didn't listen to what he was told and died.). You can give a move command and he'll move there but only for a short period of time and then decide it's time to rush the enemy that's the size of The Hulk. You tell them to attack a specific enemy but as they are in fact, the blind mice, they start to shoot at a completely different enemy. You can even have them flank the enemy, getting the perfect angle and shot onto the unknowing little alien but they'll still miss or fire in short enough bursts that a turtle could evade them. So you pretty much end up doing everything yourself and just using your teammates abilities, if they haven't died from trying to scare the enemy away by running really fast at them that is.Another issue is how they throw massive enemies at you without telling you anything about them, little hints or giving you appropriate weaponry to defeat them. I remember the first time they threw an enemy gunship at me and expected me to take it down with a rifle. I think it's rather obvious to say that it took a while.Other than those two points which do continuously get really rather annoying it is an alright game. I haven't played the original XCOM games so I have nothing to compare it to or moan about as ""It's not like the originals"" or whatever so yeah. Good game, awful teammates. Buy this game, Or don't. Whatever. It's your money. Make your own decisions. You'll never get far in life looking for some random persons approval.			",166,30,2,8,10,1,3

												The Bureau is a game with a lot of baggage. It was first announced as the way 2K was choosing to revive the X-Com franchise, a decision that was understandably received with a considerable amount of bafflement and ill will. Yes, people wanted a modern X-Com, but that meant a turn-based strategy game of research and tactical battles, not some shooter. The fact that, as shooters went, it actually looked pretty interesting and ambitious was largely lost in the outpouring of disgust over the brand they chose to attach to it. Then it faded from view, and in the meantime Firaxis' much more faithful franchise reboot was announced and even released before The Bureau came back into view, now branded with that name. Unfortunately, it was clear that some ambition had been lost along the way, and its development was revealed to have been troubled and fraught with drama. It came out to a general wave of indifference, and was promptly dismissed.Having now completed it, I believe this indifference was unwarranted. It's true that it's not X-Com. And the game originally previewed might well have been a better one. But the end result is a rather enjoyable melding of squad tactics and quality shooting, with light RPG elements; attached to a fairly compelling scenario of apocalyptic alien assault. Both major and side missions have interesting things to show you, and reveal more about the nature and motivations of your foe, and there's even a pretty spiffy late game twist. And I really appreciated the sequences where you walk around the XCOM base between missions. The various people you can converse with are all fairly well drawn as characters, if not horribly deep, and there are additional story tidbits and several layers of ambient conversations and announcements throughout, changing after every major mission.Mind you, it's not perfect, either. The notion that all of this is a secret that's been covered up for decades is, well, just not plausible at all, especially when the rest of the time they want to give you a sense of the appalling scale of events. Some of the conversations are a little prone to repetition. And there are some disappointing technical issues, some of which seem to be specific to AMD cards from what I've read, but others seem more generally problematic. I had severe framerate issues with either PhysX setting on and active (i.e. if I was around PhysXed cloth or effects), and on settings above Medium (at least in the DirectX 11 client), the shadows were prone to very distracting and glitchy flickering. I've also read some people have had issues with crashes, although I personally did not experience these.The technical issues were pretty easy to work around, and if you're prepared to quietly ignore the premise that any of the game's events are covert, that's not the biggest deal in the world either. So I don't feel either of these things should put you off The Bureau. I quite enjoyed myself all the way to the end, and I would definitely recommend it.			",1073,506,26,239,122,9,209

												The Bureau XCOM Declassified isn’t bad game as people say it is (especially XCOM hardcore fans).I know that it isn’t a classic XCOM game and that it struggles to find its place in the XCOM-series. But it provides a solid experience if you´re a person who likes 3rd person shooters and sometimes meaningless shooting.The story is quite intriguing.  The combat is decent and the AI of the enemies is surprisingly good. The command system works remarkably well because you have to constantly issue new orders to your NPCs. Things that I disliked was that the combats weren’t that strategic as the other XCOM games, sometimes it was just too much meaningless shooting.  The world felt like the game Resistance, and it felt really empty which made the game a little boring time to time. The DLC that the game has to offer is just not worth is because it does not add anything new. If you want the DLC buy it when the game is on sale.I give this game a solid 7.5/10.

												Gameplay - Mass Effect 2 clone. However, I felt it was more crucial to employ squadmember skills during battle than what i was used to in Mass Effect 2 on similar difficult. This is a good thing. (Saying Mass Effect 2 since i haven't yet completed 3)Difficulty - I played it on the second hardest difficulty and although the learning curve was alright, it started out alot tougher than expected. Expect a hard time against your first Muton unless you're above average in tactics and how you pick your squads.Graphics - The graphics are alright. I'm not really that good on judging them though since i put gameplay first. Everything reminded me again of Mass Effect 2, though the the backdrop is the early 60s in the US. The main character animation during story dialogues was repetive though.Story - I expected a lot more shallow story from the get go. It really suprised me how it twists and turns later on. The side missions were quite a bit lacking though, and again something picked up from the Mass Effect franchise. I didn't really feel there were any rewards to them either.Sound - Music and sound effects were solid. Voice acting above average and in style with what i feel is true for the 60s. There are also quite a few references to early 60s rock music.The Bad - Although i encountered no gamebreaking bugs, there are a few annoying ones. Like dialogue looping after the sequence is finished, items that have been checked will glow again after a side mission if you have tips on in options and a few glitchy things now and then.Bottom line - Anyone with interest in 3rd person action, bioshock rpgs or the Xcom franchise should find value here. I really enjoyed it while not expecting it to be anything more than a twitchy, corridor, action game.			",152,33,1,17,12,0,33

												This game gets a bad rep which is kind of sad.  Sure, its not a turn-based XCOM game, but the trailers alerted you of this from the offset.  And yes, its not the FPS game we were waiting for either.BUT if you take the game for what it is, it is a good solid game with a decent story, and some good fun to be had.  A third-person squad/action game with a ""pause and give orders"" mechanic, it plays like Mass Effect 2 / 3 set in the XCOM universe.If you're a fan of XCOM its great to see some of the enemies in their earlier incarnations, and if you're fond of americana culture set in an interesting period of time, then this game is worth a look.I'd recommend buying it when its on sale, but enjoyed it and would recommend it to others who are fans of the genre.

												I really liked The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.I've played every XCOM, that have reached the marked, to completion. And I have to say that this one is by far the best graphically and map by map. But I think it is still lacking in playability overall when weighing in base construction, research, alien discoveries.The storyline was OK and on par with what I expected, but I am still left with the feeling that it was cut a bit short somehow.Overall, still a recommendation from me.

												NOTE: Reviewer's game difficulty was set to Commander, finishing the game with no deaths. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a squad-based third-person tactical shooter not unlike the Mass Effect Series. Although it does not quite reach the heights of Bioware's Magna Opera, it still delivers moments of greatness throughout its 10-hour campaign. --CAMPAIGNThe storytelling is well-paced, although some cutscenes can use some work with regards to its fluidity. These cutscenes attempt a more filmic look, but it transitions poorly once control is handed to the player. The characters themselves could have had a more fleshed-out backgroud, but as it stands, most of the them fall under recognizable tropes.Lore can be found scattered throughout the world, and they greatly contribute to the atmosphere of the game. Of course they don't directly contribute to the game itself, but for players who enjoy getting themselves immersed in such world-building, they are certainly a neat touch. The locations for each level are also highly varied and colorful. Hyper-modern games have a tendency to look really brown or greyish, but The Bureau breaks away from the pack and surprisingly manages to convey a sense of desperation even amid the richness of the color palette. The developers could have certainly put more effort into the battle areas though--an organic and subtle approach would have gone a long way into keeping the player engaged. Boxes and railings suddenly take on a symmetrical form, walls and cars inexplicably appear in positions that don't make much sense except as cover. Still, it is only a minor gripe and it doesn't take away from the presentation of the game. --MECHANICSThe gameplay is akin to many third person cover-based shooters. It patterns itself closer to Mass Effect--one button is highly contextualized, from sticking to cover to sprinting, or vaulting objects. It works for the most part, although having individual buttons for different things could have allowed the game to be more precise. The shooting aspect is enjoyable, and the ability to issue commands to your squad is an exercise of thinking. Running and gunning is not a viable option, especially on higher difficulties. As such, patience and a quick mind is integral to the success of your team. Each encounter is similar to a puzzle begging to be solved: do you distract the enemy with a diversion and plant a mine behind them? Or should you force them to scatter and pick them off one by one? Nothing is binary within a firefight. Everything is dynamic, and it is the player's responsibility to constantly assess and reassess the situation. Friendly AI could definitely use some tuning though (mainly on autonomous cover choices), but it does not detract from the overall usefulness of the squad AI. RPG aficionados also have some options in tinkering with their squad composition. Differing playstyles can easily be accomodated by the game, with each agent being highly customizable from their perks right down to their equipments , although changeable outfits would have been a welcome inclusion in the game. --CONCLUSIONAll in all, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a welcome addition the XCOM franchise. It may not be on the same level as the Mass Effect Series (which it seems to have patterned itself to) but it is definitely an enjoyable game. Critics and naysayers alike have been too quick to dismiss the game without actually paying attention to it, just because of the silly notion that it is NOT XCOM. Well, no♥♥♥♥♥♥ its The Bureau--it's simply its own game within a larger XCOM universe.			",48,5,0,6,5,0,3

												Despite my initial hesitance toward the change of style for this game (from its initial showings), it's a surprisingly competent tactical TPS set in the early XCOM universe. It begins as your standard cover based shooter, but once you've moved onto the first main operation, opens up quite a bit as you unlock new abilities for both yourself and your squad mates. In some early game operations you can still sit behind cover for most firefights and take potshots at enemies, but a) that's *really* boring and b) doesn't work on harder difficulties (I played on ""hard,"" I guess, but there's still one difficulty above that).In many of the later operations, enemies will flank your position, throw grenades to flush you out, or rush you head on with cloaked enemies and mutons with jetpacks. The fun (and frustration) comes from flanking enemies with your squad mates (giving you a damage bonus) and using their abilites to funnel enemies into your line of fire, but I found myself in many battles to constantly be waiting for my heal ability to be on cooldown, or running around reviving my squad who have run out of cover for no reason. The game doesn't seemingly give you the ability to ""keep"" your squad in certain positions; sure, you can order them around, but it always felt that once I moved far enough away (far enough being not very far) they would move out of cover and subsequently die, forcing me to take a ton of damage to revive them and waste my heal ability on myself.All that aside (and despite some minor quirks I had with the controls) I enjoyed my time with it. It's no XCOM UFO Defense or even Enemy Unknown for that matter, but it offers enough challenge and tactical options to be worth one playthrough.			",948,450,36,149,93,10,136

												This game was very enjoyable. The setting was great and the story was pretty good, although i didn't care for the choice the main character had to make about 3/4 of the way in. It is a cover based shooter but your squad relies solely on you directly giving them commands and cannot accomplish anything without your input. If you are able to quickly react to heavy enemy fire and give orders and utilize your own abilities, then you will enjoy the gameplay. The squad leader has the ability to slow down time during combat to issue commands, but the enemy will still be firing on you as this happens.All in all this game is worth a play through.

												Well, I don't understand all the criticism towards this game. I actually genuinely liked it. It isn't the best game I have ever played, but it is really well done.First of all, the graphics are incredible - character animations, locations design - everything works for the atmosphere. I just wish they added some elements destruction, such as destroying chairs and tables.The game itself is third-person shooter with covers and tactical pause during which you can give orders to 2 your companions. There are different companion classes, and they have different skills. I constantly used such abilities as put the turret or use critical shot during my playthrough.The story starts very slow, but closer to the end it runs so fast and is full or different twists and revelations. Sure, it has lots of cliches, but it isn't that bad. There are even three different endings depending on your choice.All in all, the game is above mediocre thanks to very well done shooting and giving orders mechanics and thanks to great graphics. 7.5/10			",263,157,14,55,23,4,33

												Honestly, it a solid game. Sure there are some things that are off in this game, such as the enemies being bullet sponges, the exclusion of a jump button, and how the abilities interfere chronologically with the story, but overall the gunplay is solid and the strategical squad commands feel like XCOM at it's simplist core. However, your squad AI doesn't always listen to you and they usually end up in the enemy's line of sight. Music is repetative, but fitting. The visuals are fantastic. It has a vibrant cartoony feel that's very Bioshock Infinitesque. Overall, even though the 3rd person setting is a weird departure from the traditional Turn Based gameplay, it still holds up with the XCOM name. 2012's Enemy Unknown is far better than this, but if you enjoy games like Mass Effect, then you should get this. 7/10			",339,57,4,27,30,5,39

Be prepared to do all the grunt work and using your squad mates only for special occansions. Story is decent, but I think falls apart at the end.  Also is a game that will have you play through 10 minute fire fights again if you die and have to restart. Picked it up at $12 and think it was worth it as an XCOM fan.

												I followed the wandering development of The Bureau: Xcom Declassified for a number of years. Patiently I observed as it transitioned from FPS to 3rd person hoping that it would not suffer in it’s long development cycle. I’m sorry to say that despite some rather nice visuals it suffers from serious design bloat. As teams changed, development laboured and it seems as they moved onward they continuing to tack on new fresh ideas. Perhaps this was done to show progression and relevancy for upper management. But it comes across as a series of continuously muddled concepts that were never truly flushed out.Combat jumps between uninspired to slightly broken. Agents can take shots through some obstacles or take excessive damage sitting flush against walls. The sparks of laserfire can be seen clipping through various barriers and my snipers can shoot through several layers of walls. Grenades are a bit off. The enemies can seem to toss them across the stage while my weak human arms can only lobe a grenade a few feet further than a effective shotgun blast. I bet the enemies can lobe grenades a bit further if they were to throw them towards me. Rather they throw the grenade upwards and vaguely in my direction. I’ve been counting the number of seconds from when a enemy throws a grenade and when it lands on my feet. On average I’m aware of a grenade is on it’s way for 4-6 seconds. Then another 4-5 seconds before it detonation I could be half way across the map before it goes off. Not a very effective weapon, at least for them.Speaking of ineffective you learn quickly that as your allies are made of paper and the close combat of the shotgun, and alien equivalent shotgun are the most useless weapons in the game and I can not think of a single instance where close combat would be recommend unless you want to kill you allies. But they seem to do that quite well on their own. They are eager to jump into the action early in the game, but while I enjoy their eagerness to prove who can go down in a fight the fastest its recommend you keep them out of harms way until they prove themselves to be useful in a couple of levels.Although being a powerhouse can be fun overtime the missions are tedious. Pop all skills and target the biggest enemy. Rinse and repeat. It's rare to jump between cover with a few expections during the last few missions. Other than a single boss battle all combat mission play out the same. The variety of enemy types is varied but can nearly all be destroyed with the same tactics again and again. But enough about the combat because that’s the best part of the game. While it’s a bit too easy, too-linear, and mostly uninhabited ""hot"" zones  there are far worse offenders.In the brilliant 2012 X-Com the time spent at your bunker was filled with activities to improve all your stats build new areas etc...Let’s not dwell too long in comparisons as it’s simply not fair. The return to your bunker goes between serviceable to unbearable. The conversations you have with the members of X:Com are done with dialog trees. Perhaps showing it’s influence from mass effect a bit too much! But the conversations are pointless. Full of false choices or at their best tedium to unlock a extra mission you can’t participate in. The nuggets exploring this area are banal conversations, in-active NPC’s & and fetch quests. Most of them can be skipped or simply forgotten. Some of these conversations will lead you to a mini game where you scan an area by holding L (360 controller) where you can see objects that need your attention a-la detective mode. These seem totally optional and only open paths for your extra team mates to go explore and level while you are following the main story. Frankly I’m having an ok time with it. I don’t want to throw it under the bus, it’s pretty boring outside of combat and after you get a few levels on yourself and your team mates it simply becomes a slaughter fest where nothing can harm you. I highly doubt we will hear about this franchise again and it’s a shame because at it’s best you can see what it could've been. It takes too much inspiration from better games and does not improve on them. It's a project that just needed to get out the door. Too much time, money and engery was spent re-hashing a collection of mechanices, techniques, artistic approaches over year to simply have them all go to waste. At least it was released and we'll never have to wonder, ""what -if?""5.5/10Recommend by if it's on sale. I'd kick myself for spending more than $20.			",405,80,8,36,29,1,30

Source[playertheory.com]The squad presses up against the cover, silent as can be. Peeking over the edge, they get a view of the alien patrols that wander the Small Town, USA street – the tiny squad of three is easily outnumbered five to one.These odds aren't anything new, though.Times slows down as William Carter, the commander of the mission, whispers his commands. ""Spread out. Take flanking positions."" He has one soldier throw out a turret on that side of the street to flush the outsiders out of cover. The other, armed with a sniper rifle, he has targeted an opposing sniper on the far end of the street. ommands given, Carter targets a shielded unit mid-street, and using some advanced technology strapped to his wrist, plans to lift him up into the air to be used as target practice.Time returns to normal, and in unison, the squad moves and begins their planned attack.The outsiders don't stand a chance.""The Bureau"" is the latest addition to the XCOM series of strategy-based, humans vs. aliens games. What separates ""The Bureau"" from most of the other games in the popular series is how it puts you on the ground with your squad as an individual, rather than a commander seeing everything from above. You're given a third-person perspective of the battlefield, and you're allowed to move around freely like in any other shooter. Unlike any other shooter, however, you're also given the responsibility of giving commands to your squad, lest they stand behind cover and take badly aimed pot-shots at the enemy until the End of Time.That responsibility to command your squad is what makes ""The Bureau"" an irrefutable part of the ""XCOM"" series and is also one of the more frustrating functions of the game. ""The Bureau"" is not a turn-based game. You aren't able to stop the time once a mission begins, which makes timing squad commands a very difficult thing to manage, especially in the middle of a particularly rough firefight. As a bit of an aid to the player, time does slow down when Carter goes into ""command mode,"" but it doesn't ever seem to be slow enough. Without the top-down view of the battlefield, it's much tougher to send your squad to the exact area that you need, which I suppose is more realistic given your on-the-ground commander perspective of the game, but it also occasionally leaves the player sending his squad to locations where they stand idiotically next to cover and get riddled with laser fire.For that reason, the game really does reward the player for being strategic and patient during the fights in the game. The only problem with that is that the fights start becoming really predictable. You'll be traveling through war-torn America and turn down a street with a view of the road covered with rows of flipped cars and boxes and other types of cover. And suddenly, aliens appear and start running at you!That is how each mission basically goes. You walk around, have two to three fights in carefully prepared battlefields, and then you win. Occasionally, they throw a new enemy at you or some reinforcements drop down in a flanking position so you have to rethink your strategy, but it's never horribly difficult to get yourself out of those situations.If there was ever a reason that I lost a battle, it was because I made a mistake trying to rush through it. A lot of fights feel exactly like the last fight, and you end up just wanting to get through them to get to the other side.There is the RPG element to the game, which is very similar to what was seen in ""Enemy Unknown."" There are various squad classes, and each one has a skill tree they are able to climb up to get new abilities. That tree is very small however, so the decision process is kind of underwhelming, and any strategy you have during character advancement is rather limited.Like in ""Enemy Unknown,"" you have the ability to customize your squad mates when you hire them, which is a feature I really like in games like this. I love building up teams based on my real-life friends, and I do it every time a game gives me the chance. Typically, those characters are always the first to die, but I still try to do it. I always get attached fastest to characters that I'm able to create, and that bond to to your squad is a key part of the ""XCOM"" games. The player is able to customize a lot about their squaddies, down to the color of their tie in the suit that they wear into battle. The one thing they can't change is gender. ""The Bureau: XCOM Declassified"" is a boy's only club, which I suppose goes with the atmosphere of the era the game is set in; just about everything was a boys only club in that time. There is a female NPC character that occasionally helps Carter in battles, so the potential for female teammates was there, but the players just don't get to have access to it. I guess we'll just have to chalk it up to adorable/nostalgic 1960's sexism.One of the things that I found cool and amusing about ""The Bureau"" is what the typical ""XCOM"" squad wears into battle. They don't rely on kevlar or any kind of body armor. They go out in their suits. Sure, some do wear camouflage, but most of the squad classes are dressed to the nines for their battle against invaders from space. Agent Carter goes between being dressed like he's a character in ""Mad Men"" to looking like a twin of Sterling Archer (black turtleneck and all). The ""XCOM"" squad, Earth's only defense against complete and utter annihilation at the end of super advanced aliens, has never looked as good as they look in ""The Bureau.""The story of ""The Bureau"" starts off as nothing special. Earth gets attacked by an alien force, the military is destroyed, and it comes to the brand new XCOM team to overcome this threat. You do all the cliche things that a team working as Earth's last hope would do. You rescue the guy that's an expert in the alien technology. You do your best to save civilian populations. You capture a live outsider. And eventually, use their own technology against them to do an ""Independence-Day-Shut-Down-Everything"" type of mission. It's really standard stuff with completely average voice-acting carrying you through it all.That said, there are a couple redeeming things about the story. You encounter the first pretty early on - a mysterious virus from the outsiders that infects civilians population and turns them into ""Sleepwalkers."" They ooze black stuff from their eyes and just walk around in circles repeating whatever it was the last thing they were doing before the ailment completely took hold. They don't attack you; they just continuously mutter their ""last words"" and walk around aimlessly. It creates a lot of creepy atmosphere in the destroyed American towns in which most of the game's missions take place.In the final act of the game, the story veers dramatically off the path of the predictable and does some crazy stuff that I did not expect. I won't go into it to avoid spoilers, but it's an alright twist with multiple possible endings.I played through ""The Bureau: XCOM Declassified"" trying really hard to like it. It was interesting at first, but the average story and clunky game play really strayed from what I loved so much about ""Enemy Unknown."" This newest addition to the ""XCOM"" series was definitely a risk by developer 2k Marin, especially with the fantastic and immensely popular formula for ""Enemy Unknown"" sitting right there, and I'm not sure that risk paid off. ""The Bureau"" just isn't a very interesting game in comparison. It has its moments for sure, but those moments are fleeting and in the end, they're not really memorable. If you're a fan of the ""XCOM"" series, you probably shouldn't miss what ""The Bureau"" adds to the series, but if you're looking for something as strategic and difficult as ""Enemy Unknown,"" you're going to be disappointed.But at least you'll be dressed well.6/10			",310,65,3,54,39,2,74

												Mass Effect 1: XCOM Declassified the game.  this is how i could best describe it.  excelent cover based 3rd-person tactical game.  while this isn't a traditional top down turn based strategy x-com, i give them credit for at least trying something new.  While this isn't the best 3rd person squad based tactics game out there, its by no means bad either.  if you liked how mass effect played and you like the xcom storyline then this game is a good match for you.  if you're only looking for the traditional xcom experience, you will not like this game.  its a mixed bag of goodies but of course not everyone will like it.  Personally I love 3rd person squad shooters so i can definately recommend it.  Those that are on the fence about it, take a look at more than one review site, look at different reviews and opinions or youtubes and find out for yourself!			",380,65,4,73,23,4,55

												With more time and budget, it could have been a huge hit. There's a lot of mechanics in there that give us a glimpse of what it could've been. Also, bugs, tons of them, and a weird feeling of ""unfinished-ness"" all around, from NPCs who talk to you but stare at the infinite instead of you to squad mates that teleport right in front of your face every time you cross a door.As it is, though, it isn't too bad to be honest. It's quite entertaining, and once your squad is beefed up, the combat is fun. But it's sad to see and think how it fell short of its potential.I'd give it a 6,5/10			",644,146,32,90,80,9,123

												Decent enough 3rd person shooter, but ultimately fails at what it tried to achieve. Your squad is pretty dumb and the command  mechanics are kind of wonky. Be prepared to do all the grunt work and using your squad mates only for special occansions. Story is decent, but I think falls apart at the end.  Also is a game that will have you play through 10 minute fire fights again if you die and have to restart. Picked it up at $12 and think it was worth it as an XCOM fan. Pay anymore than $15 and I would have felt ripped off.			",281,58,7,23,20,4,26

												Honestly, it a solid game. Sure there are some things that are off in this game, such as the enemies being bullet sponges, the exclusion of a jump button, and how the abilities interfere chronologically with the story, but overall the gunplay is solid and the strategical squad commands feel like XCOM at it's simplist core. However, your squad AI doesn't always listen to you and they usually end up in the enemy's line of sight. Music is repetative, but fitting. The visuals are fantastic. It has a vibrant cartoony feel that's very Bioshock Infinitesque. Overall, even though the 3rd person setting is a weird departure from the traditional Turn Based gameplay, it still holds up with the XCOM name. 2012's Enemy Unknown is far better than this, but if you enjoy games like Mass Effect, then you should get this. 7/10			",339,57,4,27,30,5,39

												While not the best game I have ever played, it plays out much more like an interactive movie than a game. The story was an interesting new direction to the XCOM franchise, though it would have made a much better movie than it does a game.All in all though, it is still enough for me to recommend it to anybody willing to put aside gameplay in favour of an enticing story arc.

												I followed the wandering development of The Bureau: Xcom Declassified for a number of years. Patiently I observed as it transitioned from FPS to 3rd person hoping that it would not suffer in it’s long development cycle. I’m sorry to say that despite some rather nice visuals it suffers from serious design bloat. As teams changed, development laboured and it seems as they moved onward they continuing to tack on new fresh ideas. Perhaps this was done to show progression and relevancy for upper management. But it comes across as a series of continuously muddled concepts that were never truly flushed out.Combat jumps between uninspired to slightly broken. Agents can take shots through some obstacles or take excessive damage sitting flush against walls. The sparks of laserfire can be seen clipping through various barriers and my snipers can shoot through several layers of walls. Grenades are a bit off. The enemies can seem to toss them across the stage while my weak human arms can only lobe a grenade a few feet further than a effective shotgun blast. I bet the enemies can lobe grenades a bit further if they were to throw them towards me. Rather they throw the grenade upwards and vaguely in my direction. I’ve been counting the number of seconds from when a enemy throws a grenade and when it lands on my feet. On average I’m aware of a grenade is on it’s way for 4-6 seconds. Then another 4-5 seconds before it detonation I could be half way across the map before it goes off. Not a very effective weapon, at least for them.Speaking of ineffective you learn quickly that as your allies are made of paper and the close combat of the shotgun, and alien equivalent shotgun are the most useless weapons in the game and I can not think of a single instance where close combat would be recommend unless you want to kill you allies. But they seem to do that quite well on their own. They are eager to jump into the action early in the game, but while I enjoy their eagerness to prove who can go down in a fight the fastest its recommend you keep them out of harms way until they prove themselves to be useful in a couple of levels.Although being a powerhouse can be fun overtime the missions are tedious. Pop all skills and target the biggest enemy. Rinse and repeat. It's rare to jump between cover with a few expections during the last few missions. Other than a single boss battle all combat mission play out the same. The variety of enemy types is varied but can nearly all be destroyed with the same tactics again and again. But enough about the combat because that’s the best part of the game. While it’s a bit too easy, too-linear, and mostly uninhabited ""hot"" zones  there are far worse offenders.In the brilliant 2012 X-Com the time spent at your bunker was filled with activities to improve all your stats build new areas etc...Let’s not dwell too long in comparisons as it’s simply not fair. The return to your bunker goes between serviceable to unbearable. The conversations you have with the members of X:Com are done with dialog trees. Perhaps showing it’s influence from mass effect a bit too much! But the conversations are pointless. Full of false choices or at their best tedium to unlock a extra mission you can’t participate in. The nuggets exploring this area are banal conversations, in-active NPC’s & and fetch quests. Most of them can be skipped or simply forgotten. Some of these conversations will lead you to a mini game where you scan an area by holding L (360 controller) where you can see objects that need your attention a-la detective mode. These seem totally optional and only open paths for your extra team mates to go explore and level while you are following the main story. Frankly I’m having an ok time with it. I don’t want to throw it under the bus, it’s pretty boring outside of combat and after you get a few levels on yourself and your team mates it simply becomes a slaughter fest where nothing can harm you. I highly doubt we will hear about this franchise again and it’s a shame because at it’s best you can see what it could've been. It takes too much inspiration from better games and does not improve on them. It's a project that just needed to get out the door. Too much time, money and engery was spent re-hashing a collection of mechanices, techniques, artistic approaches over year to simply have them all go to waste. At least it was released and we'll never have to wonder, ""what -if?""5.5/10Recommend by if it's on sale. I'd kick myself for spending more than $20.			",405,80,8,36,29,1,30

Peeking over the edge, they get a view of the alien patrols that wander the Small Town, USA street – the tiny squad of three is easily outnumbered five to one.These odds aren't anything new, though.Times slows down as William Carter, the commander of the mission, whispers his commands. ""Spread out. Take flanking positions."" He has one soldier throw out a turret on that side of the street to flush the outsiders out of cover. The other, armed with a sniper rifle, he has targeted an opposing sniper on the far end of the street. ommands given, Carter targets a shielded unit mid-street, and using some advanced technology strapped to his wrist, plans to lift him up into the air to be used as target practice.Time returns to normal, and in unison, the squad moves and begins their planned attack.The outsiders don't stand a chance.""The Bureau"" is the latest addition to the XCOM series of strategy-based, humans vs. aliens games. What separates ""The Bureau"" from most of the other games in the popular series is how it puts you on the ground with your squad as an individual, rather than a commander seeing everything from above. You're given a third-person perspective of the battlefield, and you're allowed to move around freely like in any other shooter. Unlike any other shooter, however, you're also given the responsibility of giving commands to your squad, lest they stand behind cover and take badly aimed pot-shots at the enemy until the End of Time.That responsibility to command your squad is what makes ""The Bureau"" an irrefutable part of the ""XCOM"" series and is also one of the more frustrating functions of the game.

												So The Bureau: XCOM Declassified was not exactly the game I was expecting nor was it as good as I was hoping. It has entertaining cover-based tactical shooting with very heavy emphasis on monitoring your squad-mates. For example: one achievement requires you to complete a mission without firing your weapon so, in addition to your own powers and abilities, you must rely solely on your squad, spending practically every fight in the command menu issuing orders. Getting this achievement was possibly the funnest time I spent playing The Bureau, which truly shines when you take command of your team (their AI is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ otherwise).Opinion:LAWesome			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a third-person tactical shooter set in the 1960's and allows the player to take control of Agent William Carter, a washed up agent with a haunted past. This game is different to the other entries in the XCOM series in that the game does not play like an RTS game or feature an isometric view, and is instead played as a standard cover shooter with an over the shoulder view. Does this make it a good game? Yes.While hardcore fans will of XCOM will find this change of formula jarring, I personally found this formula to be a unique technique and a fresh flavour specific to the XCOM series. While the game plays a bit more like Mass Effect this time around (you can pause the game and command your team mates via a command screen, such as ordering them to move or use special abilities, etc) , it still feels like XCOM, as you still have to take strategic care in how you enter combat situations. I liked how you had to be strategic in how you placed your team mates, and how you must constantly adapt to combat as enemies flank you and draw you out of cover. This made for a tense and enjoyable gameplay experience, and is definitely a must on the harder difficulties. Unfortunately, the AI of your squadmates leaves a lot to be desired, and you will definitely get frustrated by their lack of competence. You will also get frustrated by the generic and often boring characters as well as the lacklustre plotline; this is standard alien-invasion fare, and anyone else looking for a riveting science fiction story will need to look elsewhere. I rarely find moments of the plot interesting, except for the rare dialogue encounters with the aliens themselves, which were a joy to behold. However, none of the other characters offered much in the way of development and voice acting, and I found them bland and uninteresting.The graphics are quite nice, and lots of love and care have been dedicated to the lighting and detailed environments in the game. Many of the details in this game are quite nice, and this game looks extremely good when cranked up to max settings whilst running on DX11.In short? The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a unique yet unusual entry in the XCOM franchise, and is a reward to fans of tactical shooters in general. Despite the occassional stumble in gameplay, incompetent team-mate AI and a lacklustre story, The Bureau is a solid game and I recommend it highly despite its flaws. I give this game a 7.5 / 10.

												Wow, this game is surprisinly good and is probably one of my favorite underrated games I've played so far. The cover-based 3rd person shooter gameplay is very similar to Mass Effect, so if you're a fan of the series, this game is worth picking up. Story is decent, so it's worth playing at least.P.S. Don't listen to the harsh and hate reviews on this game because it's actually pretty good if you like cover-based third person shooters.			",283,67,5,26,24,3,12

												I don't get why people won't recommend this game to others, I really enjoyed it!Honestly, the only downside I found was some kind of ""FPS drop"" bug that I have no idea how I fixed lol.The graphics are great, really.Game story is great.The AI isn't the best but not a problem at all, just give your agents orders.Good game.

												This game was kinda confusing in the beginning: Whether I was playing an espionage, zombie killing or an alien invasion game. Well I got it after a few minutes, but anyway I'm going to review about XCOM Declassified.This game demands some strategic movements from the player. Each agent you take could individually have various focusing abilities and strength. It is your decision which agent will accompany you and how much of a synergy they could bring out. For instance, if you have a sniper, then it could be good to have a mechanic to improve in a bit of defense and additional artillery.In the beginning it might not be too difficult even without much usage of skills, but it will become more challenging towards the end. Different types of enemies will appear and it is your job to kill enemies as fast as you can, and survive.Also the choices you make will affect the ending too. Choose wisely!The scenery is mostly alien tech, which I found interesting and took a few screenshots. Overall it looks beautiful. I have enjoyed a good amount of time playing XCOM Declassified, so I think it's worth the price I've paid :)			",43,1,0,0,1,0,5

												Underrated. It shares some similarities to X-COM lore but not many, hence the X-COM name being after the colon. It is just as well to ignore the X-COM references altorgether and instead enjoy it for the solid, often entertaining 3rd Person action game with combat similar the Mass Effect series. The game does a good job of telling its story and immersing you into the world and your character. It isn't game of the year material, but considering the rocky road to release this title had it's a minor miracle that it turned out good. I recommend it to anyone except die-hard X-COM faithful who can't get past the ""X-COM"" in the name.			",935,268,52,171,148,8,265

												This game gets a bad rep which is kind of sad.  Sure, its not a turn-based XCOM game, but the trailers alerted you of this from the offset.  And yes, its not the FPS game we were waiting for either.BUT if you take the game for what it is, it is a good solid game with a decent story, and some good fun to be had.  A third-person squad/action game with a ""pause and give orders"" mechanic, it plays like Mass Effect 2 / 3 set in the XCOM universe.If you're a fan of XCOM its great to see some of the enemies in their earlier incarnations, and if you're fond of americana culture set in an interesting period of time, then this game is worth a look.I'd recommend buying it when its on sale, but enjoyed it and would recommend it to others who are fans of the genre.

												Great graphical style, perfectly serviceable voice acting, and reasonable story, though the dialogue is a bit repetitive in places. I don't generally like team tactics-based action games but I got used to it. I suspect some of the people who don't like this game were imagining more game elements in common with the other Xcom-brand games, but I never played those and have no interest in strategy games. Could have been longer; lasted me 3-4 days. Recommendation assumes bargain price, naturally.			",254,119,0,40,6,0,12

												I really liked The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.I've played every XCOM, that have reached the marked, to completion. And I have to say that this one is by far the best graphically and map by map. But I think it is still lacking in playability overall when weighing in base construction, research, alien discoveries.The storyline was OK and on par with what I expected, but I am still left with the feeling that it was cut a bit short somehow.Overall, still a recommendation from me.

												Despite what the professional reviewers may say about this game, it is a solid third-person shooter. The game mechanics borrow heavily from Mass Effect 1, since you can give orders to squad mates, use alien powers such as lift or summon a friendly blob, and talk to NPC's between missions. Even the dialogue uses the multiple answer wheel from the game. The story is deserving of the XCOM title, contrary to what others may say. I'm not an XCOM elitest, so the fact that this game wasn't an RTS didn't bother me. Enemy Unknown was a great game, and to me The Bureau can proudly call itself an XCOM game as well. The final act has an interesting twist and the post-finale voiceover has a cool nod to EU. The game is not perfect though. Your squad mates are far from intelligent. Alyx Vance or Elizabeth, they are not. They are not completely useless either. Give them an order and they follow it just fine. The problem is that major baby-sitting is required. There are some graphical issues, such as ties clipping through the characters chest, or textures taking some time to load in. As well, there is a base hub you can walk around in-between missions to explore for documents, but there's not much in it. As I said already, The Bureau is a solid third-person shooter with an interesting story, good voice acting, and amazing looking locales. If it's on sale, give it a buy. As for the DLC, it can probably be left alone. Code breakers is a side mission that takes all of 10-15 minutes, the pistol is just that, a pistol, and Hangar 6 is a horde mode style game type that provides some background information on the game's plot. Overall I give The Bureau a  7/10.			",156,20,5,9,12,2,20

												'The Bureau' is yet another prequel, this time for 'XCOM: Enemy Unknown', the hard as nails turn-based strategy game. Xcom is mainstreaming and it works rather well: decisions are now made in real time (with a Max Payne like slow mo break when you are commanding your other troops), and you can control 'Carter', the hero, like in any third person shooter. The beginning of the adventure is impressive, going around in the 60s USA under an alien invasion brings back some proper 2K Nostalgia with touches of steampunk (telekinesis, and tesla rifles) but eventually gameplay becomes repetitive as there is no progression like in the first game. Your soldiers only have 5 ranks (but the new turret throwing engineer category is cool) and the levels are totally linear. You just push through with your 3 man team (you can't make it bigger later in the game - even if some NPC do join on certain missions) and there is very little strategy involved. It's probably worth playing on veteran at least for more of a challenge. All in all there are about 20 missions (around a dozen 1-2h major ones and a few 15min minor ones), so it's basically half the gameplay time of the original. The story and dialogue are rather good and the new outsiders with vertical mouths are fun to chat with. You don't have the same sense of Doom and crisis management you felt in the original but it's still pretty fun.			",218,26,0,17,5,0,12

												I recommend this game, expecially if you liked mass effect in terms of combat. You actually HAVE to control your team, issue orders regularly, ask yourself which guy to bring along each time, and how to approach situations etc.Higher difficulties, as in ME, bring forth the robustness and fun out of the combat system. Therefore, don't bother with lower difficulties since those don't give any incentive to playing the ""commander role"", because you can pretty much solo everything.The story holds a major twist that's actually brilliant and excellently done with in my opinion, very, very good voice acting, and a nice '60s theme to pack everything into a nice, enjoyable package.It gets repetitive after a while, because of low enemy variety, that's true : the game's biggest problem right there.All in all, disregard the metascore and have fun.

												This game combines good third-person shooter with the field strategy elements in the original xcom games. It has a really nice combat system making you think each of your moves before excuting them. While fun for the first half of the game, I quickly got bored because of the repetitive gameplay. It is basically moving to an area, killing a bunch of ailens, and then move to another area, kill more ailens, etc. and finally get the objective. It gets really boring espicially witout the base-management system in the traditional xcom game. The enemy AI is really good espically if you play on the harder difficulties; however, the friendly AI are really bad. In my play through, my agents got stuck in corners and wouldn't move when I tell them to regroup; they constantly ran into gernades; sometimes stand still for minutes before moving to their assigned location. My most memerable experience was when I got shot down right beside one of my agents. I ordered him to revive me, while the other agent taunts the enemy. But the agent kept on shooting, even after I commanded him several more times to revive me, leading me to die and reload the last checkpoint.As for the story and the interactions between you and the other characters, it is well made and indepth. The characters are intresting and you can read their files to find out more about them. Each characters have different personalities making it very intresting to talk with them.In conclusion, the game is repetitive and sometimes frustrating witht he glitchy friendly AI, however the challenging enemy AI and the intresting story made up for it. I would give it a 5/10 if there was a rating system.			",44,2,1,8,3,0,3

												Well, this one is intriguing. It has a an interesting story, decent gameplay, albeit repetetive after some time and a real 60s feel to it. On the other hand it is hampered by messy glitches, which are usually only fixable with restarting from a save from at least 10 minutes ago, because some scripted sequence refused to start. I would still recommend it to people who love XCOM, because of the storyline. Personally, I am biased towards the game, because it somehow really pulled me in. So, subjectively 9/10, if I am trying to be more objective, than 6,5/10.			",100,19,2,16,10,1,16

Couldn't play the game cause I was babysitting them the entire level.  I don't want a micro-managment FP Shooter game. It tries to be both an FPS and the original Xcom with an order system and slow time while you play but just falls flat.  If the team AI were better it might work but its just broken.

												Not quite in the same style as XCom: Enemy Unknown, this XCom title takes on a more first person/squad approach.  It's playstyle is a mix between real time and turn based.  To compare it to the original 1990s XCom series, this game's combat system mirrors the attempts at real time integration with turn based strategy which was attempted in the XCom Apocolypse game.  If you're looking for a game similar to XCom Enemy Unknown, this is likely NOT the game for you.  I recommend the DLC of Enemy Within.  If you're looking for a stand-alone, good game, in the XCom universe, that's a mix between FPS, TBS, and RTS, pick up this title.			",78,12,0,12,7,0,12

												Not sure why this game is so hated. It isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it was certainly fun. Pros-Mechanics are fairly easy to figure out-Enemies are varied and enjoyable to fight-Missions aren't terribly difficult, but there are some nasty (and fun!) fights that require some thinking and planning to win-Storyline is a bit of a mystery until later game, but the wait was worth the pay off, imho-If you are an avid XCOM fan like me, this game is a solid shooter entry into our beloved franchiseCons-Storyline is somewhat short, especially for a game that is primarily about the single-player experience-As far as shooters go, this game is average. The basic shooting mechanics aren't going to win any awards. Doesn't mean they are bad though-Even a token multiplayer co-op experience would have been nice			",61,2,0,9,15,0,49

 The Bureau: XCOM Declassified - Compact Review ===> Essential Purchase> Recommended Purchase >> Purchase if on sale > Purchase if greatly discounted> Purchase not recommended=== Challenge Rating (Maximum Difficulty): Medium  Average Longevity (All Missions, No DLCs): 10-12 Hours === Overview This XCOM spin-off detatches itself from the turn-based strategy typical of the series, aiming instead for real time, slowable combat, very similar in style to the system seen in the Mass Effect series, if you happen to be familiar with it.You will be tasked to command a 3-man team and engage various missions against the enemy alien forces, who threathen to destroy humanity. There is character progression, 5 different classes with unique abilities, possibility to manage a fairly sized agent roster, varied weapons and special backapcks to unlock and use.Variety in equipment and skills is good, but the gameplay will basically be skirmish after skirmish with aliens, which is not bad because enemies are also quite varied and lethal, but on the long run it might get boring for players who seek a lot of diversity.However, let's dig into details.=== What is Good + Tactical Real-Time combat system is well done, satisfying, accessible, but deep enough for veterans+ Good variety of weapons, upgrades, skills and enemies to fight+ Collectible diaries, notes, and additional dialogues and tasks are good for extending lore / story+ Good variety of settings for missions+ Artifical Intelligece of enemies is decent, they'll make you sweat in some occasions+ Decent graphics and models [Advice: disable PhysX because it is the cause of 99% of game crashes]=== What is Bad - Artifical Intelligence of Teammates is terrible and they will run into horrible deaths on multiple occasions- Babysitting teammates constantly causes huge headaches and can lead to tactical disasters- Dispatch Missions where you send agents can never fail and they always return successful and upgraded- Certain skill / weapon combinations on single enemies are overpowered, can kill any enemy in seconds if done right- 5 Levels for Teammates fill too fast, over half campaign with no progression, should have been 10 as main character- Difficulty spike in first levels, becomes way easier once you get Alien Weapons, difficulty balance could be better- Most Backpacks have gimmicky passives that are never really useful, only few really are=== RATING: 73 / 100 - A decent XCOM spinoff with some dents and sufficent longevity, worth if on sale.

												Lots of good dialog with great story. Combat system is decent, but the AI is not good, so you're comrades will do stupid stuff even when you command them. Graphics look beautiful. The game is very linear, you have only one way to go, but you do get change to choose what missions you do first.Don't listen the hate what the game gets, I really can't see any reason for all these bad reviews.

Could only understand half of what one alien said.  Some of my favorite oldies songs thrown in as well.Gameplay:  Squad based fun, controls can hang a little when deploying objects.Overall:  Ending felt rushed but a good game to have in the collection.

												A lot of people bash this game and I believe it is because they expected an isometric xcom RPG and instead got a 3rd person cover shooter. I understand, just like Fallout 3 was so different from Fallout 1 and 2. I did play Xcom enemy unknown so I know what people expected from this game.  However, as it stands on its own it is a good game. It is basically Mass Effect set in the 1960s US. I, personally. had fun this game and would recommend it others. Controlling the squad is great, the abilities are not overpowered and the various locations are interesting to explore. 8/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												If you are a PC player, SAVE YOUR MONEY! The keyboard/mouse controls are the worst I have ever seen in a PC game.  It's like trying to play Beethoven's 5th Symphony on the piano when you've never had a piano lesson. (It can be done but not by many.)If you don't press the correct sequence of movement keys (W,LShift, LShift, for example) you can't do anything (shoot, move, command others). You just stand there getting killed while you try to figure out what keys you are supposed to press that will unfreeze you. Tool tips and commentary appear in various areas of the screen so you don't reallly know where to look. The tutorial, such as it is, flashes by the screen so quickly you often miss the instructions.Perhaps it plays better if you connect a game pad to your PC... I don't know because I don't use a game pad. The story line is decent. For a TPS game the field of view is very limited and, once again, the keyboard controls are an abortion. On top of all of that, even when you do get the right key sequence, the game software is VERY slow to respond (I have an i5 quad core and an Nvidia GTX750, so I don't think it's my gear).Ambitious project. Major FAIL.  Major disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story feels like it was written by a 14 year old who just found out about what conspiracy theories are; the voice acting is at an average AAA level, the gameplay is your standard third person cover shooting, but is dragged down due to enemies being bullet sponges, movement is somewhat fluid, but not nearly as fluid as something like gears of war. The tactical element is close to non-existant; you can send orders to your squad mates, but you'll spend most of your time just sending them back due to them often moving without you ordering them to and placing themselves in bad positions that gets them shot down. Also, the fact that every dying squadmate just comes back, makes death feel unimportant unlike previous XCOM games. Visually it's pretty good looking, but the graphics nor aestetichs will leave a lasting impression on you considering that there are games like Metro: Last Light out there.IMO it's a ♥♥♥♥ you/10 but at some moments I was almost entertained so there's that.

												Well, I really like XCOM, I played the old ones years ago (more of the first one, UFO DEFENCE, and less of the others), and i REALLY enjoyed the 2012 reboot ENEMY UNKOWN. But even so, I don't recomend this. It has a somewhat nice story and a somewhat interesting ending, but the gameplay is really shallow and the story is full of plot-holes. I would give it 5/10, but only because I like XCOM and this game has some of the feeling and (very little) references. They could have made it much better just changing some little things here and there and having a little more time to think of the storyline...			",293,43,4,50,29,5,74

												Wow, this game is terrible. Shoddy command mechanics (done better by Mass Effect), dull writing, terrible voice acting, samey combat, and more. The game isn't even sure if it's set in the 1950s or the 1960s either - Sherman tanks are serving alongside M14 rifles and many men still wear hats even though they were on their way out. This game deosn't even have the central mechanic that drove your strategy in XCOM - the capture of materials to upgrade your technology. Sometimes you just find equipment lying around and that's that. No live capture mechanics, no research, nothing. I got this in a Humble Bundle for a fraction of its original price, and I still feel like I paid too much.			",116,16,1,9,7,0,25

												What is it with games now days that try as hard as possible to use as many words as possible? Is this an English class, or do they throw darts and pick what seems ""cool""? I suppose an upside is that they don't re-use the same names all the time. Yes I'm looking at you Prince of Persia. Which one? ♥♥♥♥ed if I knew.So XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a top-down RTS where you have six soldiers and can make your own guns to take into- What? Wrong game? We're talking about the other one? Alright...So The Bureau: XCOM Declassified -and yes I have to copy and paste that name every time because it's about as long and complicated as your relationship as your recent sexual partner- is a third person shooter where you can take two brain dead ♥♥♥♥♥ and pick up any gun that seems to have the coolest ""pew pew"" sounds off the ground. Can I go back to the other XCOM now? No? Another six paragraphs? Alright...So you play as Jimmy Raynor- I mean William Carter who, similarly to Raynor, wears Clichés like he picked up a pile suits made of them at a cheap clothes store and decided to smother himself in them because he didn't wake up dapper enough that morning. His family was murdered, which explains the clothes shop, and he is now haunted by it because of course he is. He must have obtained his grizzly♥♥♥♥♥♥voice by drinking their liquefied corpses. Well, You're supposed to feel sympathy for them but you never have any reason to. I once turned to a friend and say one of his lines in his grizzly as hell voice , but that line could have come anywhere, say... Batman.The story is that Carter made out with this alien chick, probably a bit too rough though, and it turns out that his box of clichés went missing, and the alien chick probably took them to have a little gander. So he goes on a mystical adventure to re-obtain them but is interrupted and escorted by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to this Bureau that Carter has never heard about, and pretends doesn't exist, but just like mass effect, everyone sees you as some kind of war hero, and treat you as god, despite you having no idea what the hell is going on.Similar to Mass Effect, you have a choice in what you want to say, with awkward eye-contact, but unlike mass effect, there is not good or evil options, which I suppose is good, so you don't have to decide whether you want to be good, bad, or in the middle which gets you no-♥♥♥♥ing-where. But you also aren't talking to party members with interesting back stories, you talk to random ♥♥♥♥♥ in suits.What the ♥♥♥♥ is with all the suits? Why is everyone in a suit during an alien invasion. Should they not be in armour? Let's put it this way, aliens invade, like they do, and everyone was too busy looking dapper and thought it looked cool. Are they ironically being hipsters? Got'ta wear a suit. Every other game wears armour, so we have to wear suits because we're posh and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then again, it does make a nice change from dressing up in skulls, pots and pans such as in, say, Borderlands.Maybe I should actually talk about the combat, as that's the only thing that hasn't been terrible so far. So the combat is hopefully good while everything else is quite lackluster.Pahahaha! Good is it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! The AI are  about as smart as mother chickens. Something, let's say... A cardboard cut out of a cat lobbed a grenade, the AI yells ""Grenade!"" then sort of sits on it, aiming to keep it warm and birth a baby chicken because no one else would want a child with them, and then they wonder after about five awkward seconds of me yelling they wonder why their brains are against the wall. So the AI is ♥♥♥♥ed. What about the guns? Well unlike Unknown COM Enemy X you don't make your own weapons from scrap, or research, or days of sitting outside the engineering bay staring at it, and then when it's done you dress it up in a bow tie. and throw a birthday party, and then use it in the field and fan girl about how awesome it is. But in XCOM Bureau Declassified The, you jus sortof find it. Which completely goes against anything in XCOM, where in other games the alien weaponry self destruct so you can't use it.Oh, but don't worry. There's still the regular SMG, Shotgun, Pistol, sniper ect. But there is no special slot for the pistol to go, and you can only hold two guns at a time which feels like Duke Nukem Forever. Euugh! I just thought of Duke Nukem forever, thank you XCOM Declassified Bureau The.Speaking of the pistol, it's completely pointless other than for precision head shotting that do ♥♥♥♥ all within Bureau XCOM The Declassified as enemies have so much health you might as well fire BB pellet's at their powderizd uterus. Though the pistol reminds me of Tomb Raider's combat. The new one that is, not the old one. I'm reminded of it due to the way you can sit behind a chest high wall and make a nice sized hole in their head. Or uterus. Oh ♥♥♥♥ me how have I not mentioned chest <dry heave> chest high walls. The game puts chest high walls -or cars- anywhere that there is some kind of combat. Even if you had to swat a fly, suddenly chest high walls fall from space and crush the fly that you were fighting. Thanks a ♥♥♥♥ing lot now get out my game. When you try to move on, carter just cello tapes to any wall that he happens to subtly brush past, as if he's scared of the next room, or he's trying to tell you something but he's a man of cliché's and can't be arsed. Oh, but when you actually do enter combat he refuses to stick to the damn wall. On multiple occasions I exited a cut scene, which threw me into combat, I ran at a wall, He swiftly avoided it and straight into open, and got gunned down. So I then turned around, in attempt to get to the wall, and he ran straight past it again and dropped dead. So my partners panicked, and tried to revive me by running in the complete opposite direction and get headshot.All in all, my favourite part of the game was that at the end you have to go on a suicide mission with the chosen one- What? Wrong game? I was talking about the XCOM: Enemy Unknown? Sorry, I was playing XCOM: Enemy Unknown, It's a top-down RTS that 2K gave us while threatening to make this garbage- oh no The Bureau has gone playing with the birds again. I'd better call the 020-9ADVICE-ON-BETTER-GAMES ",161,19,2,23,11,2,35

												Even if this game was free its not worth your freaking time or effort. The missions, story, and characters make games like call of duty look like a masterpiece. This game is soo buggy and repetitive that I want to pull mys eyes out. You will have times where the AI or game in general bugs out and will not open the door that you need to get through, blocks your progress with a invisible wall when there should be none, or fails to spawn the enemy leading to you getting stuck in the ""arena"".All of this forces you to reload a previous save point and hope it doesnt ♥♥♥♥ up again.

												The Bureau Xcom Declassified was at first an FPS but then it got scrapped and we got a strategic Third person shooter but will you want to play this game ? In the Bureau you play as William Carter who is a CIA agent who is trying to deliver an artifact to a secret goverment facility but an Alien Invasion happens and its up to you to stop the alien invasion. So how is this game ? Its actually quite good and the reviews for this are way too harsh because its not that bad actually. So first of all if you like mass effect you will simply love this game because theres alot of things similar to Mass Effect. Like the talk wheel and also the combat is quite similar. So now for the good. Amazing story with twist and turns along the way which is a great expierence. The game has a huge hub before the missions and in missions the maps are quite good. The game is quite short maybe 7 to 6 hours long. The game also graphiclly looks great. The combat is fun and simple all the diffrent members are awesome to use in the battlefield. now for the bad. The game might get repetetive after a while and the talking sections might drive you insane sometimes. Some bugs as well. So overall The Bureau: Xcom Declassified is a great game which you should own no matter if youre an Xcom fan or not. I Give The Bureau: Xcom Declassified a 8/10.Now for the the dlcFirst of all we have the Light Plasma Pistol. Its a great weapon which pretty much one shots everything so if you want to breeze through the game get it. I give the Light Plasma Pistol DLC a 8/10Now for the Codebreakers mission. In the mission you play as Carter who goes to a radio transmission facility after the alien invasion because it went silent. Overall this mission is only 10 minutes long and is not worth the full price only get it on sale i give the Code Breakers Dlc a 4/10And finnaly we have Hangar 6 R and D. In this dlc pack you play as Nico DaSilva before the events that lead to the main game. In this Dlc you work on a SleepWalker case and you try to relive the memories of the victim to find out whats causing the infection. Overall This dlc is amazingly bad. All you do is fight waves of enemies every level and it gets boring incredibly fast. This Dlc is also quite buggy as well. Only get this dlc on sale For the achievements or to witness how it all began. I give Hangar 6 R and D a 3/10			",905,350,32,94,59,7,85

												I was pretty disappointed in this game.  There was 1 gem, the rest was very underwhelming.Gameplay: highly repetative.  Every level is a corridor.  You skill up quickly and you're using max level agents all with the same abilities for more than half the game.  Gun play and cover system feels like it was ripped directly from Mass Effect.Story: *Spolier warning* highly problematic.  While it reuses the familiar aliens, some of them are jumbled up in terms of ability and concept.  We can tell this game is intended as a prequel to Enemy Unkown (which I played first), based on general story elements and the music (ending music for The Bureau is the theme for Enemy Unknown).  In EU the aliens are all controlled by the Etherials, in TB the Outsiders control all the aliens.  EU: Outsider is a ""being of pure energy"" while the Etherial is physicalish.  TB: Etherial is pure energy, Outsiders are very tangible.Also, if you get any of the ""good"" endings in TB, you have to wonder why you don't start out EU with plasma weapons and cool backpacks that give you shields and other goodies.  The only logical conclusion is that you chose the Weaver ending...which is an annoying ending as you watch all the tech vanish for no good reason.*Major Spoiler* Continuity aside, there is one well written section where gameplay and story meld together to form a cool experience.  It's the point where Carter tries to break away from the Etherial that you realize, you haven't been playing Carter, you've playing as Asaru controlling Carter, and all of the Player based abilities to slow time and issue orders while gaining a 3rd person view of the field is merely a part of Asaru's abilities when riding a host.  That was well written.  Whoever did that ought to write more games.			",70,5,0,7,2,0,18

												The 60's setting could be so nice, something fresh. The idea of a Squad shooter in XCOM Universe sounded interesting. Bought it in a Sale and now after almost 5h i gave up on it.The game runs awfully(Core i5 4500K - 8GB DDR3 RAM - Raedon R9 280X OC)- In the First Mission you go to a Small town and the first combat ran at 5 - 10 FPS. Try managing your Squad like this -.-- Shadow and light flickering randomly- Switching to or from DX11 didn't help at all. get to the townsquare, FPS goes downhill.- The AI is a Joke for a Squad based game. You are more busy, trying to keep these Idiots alive than actually combating somehting. Even if you manually order them to a cover, they manage to get shot behind that cover in about 10 seconds. because these idiots mostly pop their heads out right when the enemy starts shooting.In the First 2 Missions i spent more time running between my Squadmates, reviving them, at app. 20 FPS than doing anything other. TL;DR:Don't Buy. The cool 60's Flair isn't worth it. The game get's this flair because it's a secret timemachine, warping your PC back to the 60's too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a masterpiece. Forget about the turnbase X-com, except for the story, its not at all the same type of game. But its my type of game. Like reading a good book. I always had nightmares happening in the 60, don't ask me why because I was born in 72. But the feel of the game recreate perfectly the old sci-fi movies of that time, the music, the design , the colors, everything. Like in my damn nightmares. Every 10 minutes when I was playing I told myself what a great game it is. I dont know if they will release another game of this type, its not really opened for a sequel. But forget the negative comment of the sad people because its not turn based, thats a really great game.			",214,66,7,30,23,2,37

												Sucks. Glad i paid only 2 bucks for it. It has nothing to do with previously fun XCOM games. It even took the original lore and twisted it.   IT IS A SHOOTER ON RAILS. The weapons really suck.   Plus the gratutious language in the game makes it feel like its something my 13 years old brother wants to play.. Every other word is JESUS and GDAMN. I'm not a religoius man, but get real. Just another soup mix game that had a cup of water added to it.   NOT WORTH MONEY OR TIME.Also: if it keeps crashing, turn off the PHYSX crap in the video menu.			",176,25,4,31,15,2,21

												This game is a masterpiece. Forget about the turnbase X-com, except for the story, its not at all the same type of game. But its my type of game. Like reading a good book. I always had nightmares happening in the 60, don't ask me why because I was born in 72. But the feel of the game recreate perfectly the old sci-fi movies of that time, the music, the design , the colors, everything. Like in my damn nightmares. Every 10 minutes when I was playing I told myself what a great game it is. I dont know if they will release another game of this type, its not really opened for a sequel. But forget the negative comment of the sad people because its not turn based, thats a really great game.			",214,66,7,30,23,2,37

												I wish I would have given The Bureau: XCOM Declassified the time of day a while ago. Having played it now, I can see that I was wrong to judge it based solely on it’s cover. The Bureau is a fantastic game. Once they can figure out how to work A.I. a bit smarter without creating a robotic uprising ending in the near extinction of humanity, games like this will get drastically better. Not having your allies shove their faces into bullets will be a great addition to most games. The cursor thing is still my biggest gripe though. I know you can increase the range of abilities, but that only partially fixes the problem. The cursor movement in this game needed a bit more love. The looks, sounds, and most of the voice acting were all great to experience if you just weren’t ripped back into reality when your cursor wouldn’t do something properly. Having the live action fights and a 3rd person shooter aspect were a nice way to change up the XCOM series. I hope we see a sequel someday.Full Review: TheVideogameBacklog.com ",249,46,0,36,14,0,28

												I picked up this game on a steam sale, amid the lackluster reviews. While the general concept of the game was good, the story and the replayability is seriously lacking. I was hoping for a first person take on the popular X-COM games of late. This game was too linear, and too short. Side missions were pointless. Tons of backpack upgrades, but for what? With a team of only 3, you're left with very few choices. If you're an X-COM fan and this is cheap, pick it up. If you're on the fence, wait until the next X-COM game or pick up the OTHER X-COM titles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished playing through this pile of feces so you won't have to. Combat functions like Mass Effect, accept your team will run head first into lazer machine gun fire. They will also occasionally watch you die, its a bit.... infuriating. Near the very end, just before the last mission. Your main character is taken away from you and you get to pick between an old doctor and a virtually unknown female agent, you've had five conversations with this female agent. Anyway the game drags on well past the point it should have ended. the real issue is the meaningless mission between story missions. I believe they had a good idea at some point, who knows when that died.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If this was a generic TPS-RPG, the Bureau would be merely okay, cookie cutter in presentation and gameplay, and ultimately forgetable without leaving a good or bad impression.As an X-Com game? Absolutely awful, about the only thing it has in common are the enemy types and name of the organization, everything else wants so badly to be Mass Effect 3 IN THE  EARLY 60'S, right down to most of the powers being barely renamed versions of Mass Effect's biotic powers, but otherwise working exactly the same.Pick it up on sale if you feel you really need, but otherwise, avoid this game.

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME. You see the meta score, believe it.I got this game through a Humble Bundle sale so I didn't really lose any money on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I played it just to see if it really was as bad as the reviews said.First off the A.I. is terrible. Your teammates will randomly move forward and get killed or stand in the open, and they die so quickly. Even if you set a target for them it feels as if they aren't actually doing anything, it's like they're using rubber bullets. It's just clunky and doesn't work. The storyline and characters are just as horrible, they have 0 emotion. After a certain character dies the main character is so worked up over it and it's talked about for 5 minutes when I really didn't care for this certain character whom died because he was never really important or made out to be important to the ""storyline"" at all. There's probably more reasons to dislike this game I just haven't played it long enough to find more and I don't intend to. This game just feels unfinished or like a quick publish for the XCOM series (or continuation of games about killing aliens.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't just any ordinary 3rd person shooter when it looks to be one, in this you'll have to take the time to quicky come up with a stradegy or you'll never win. It's pretty similar to mass effect, but I wouldn't be doing as much thinking then in, The Bureau.Customize your squad any way you want for the mission, there appearance, equipment, talent, and name. Then level them up with which ever ability you want them to have for your team. They act on there own well, but you wouldn't want them to so be aware on what there doing.The story is solid, I wouldn't want to spoil it.I can't comment on the graphics since I'm a low spec gamer.The Music fits right in with the theme of the 60's It's worth getting, but not at it's full 50$ price.

												Bureau is an interesting departure from the norm for the XCOM series. It sees the hero battling through aliens in a 3rd person semi tactical interface using special powers and abilities to overcome foes through the complementary skills of the squad as a whole. Use a turret to pin enemies down then stealth a squad member around the side to flank and kill them. The graphics are pretty good but it is a bit of a system hog needing a hefty PC to run at full detail levels. Whilst the gameplay is in no ways bad it is not exemplary and plays pretty much like a re-skinned Mass Effect 3 but without as detailed or engrossing a storyline. Worth a budget price or interest from fans of the series.			",255,51,4,82,52,8,104

												Deeply lacking in originality ..  It pains me to see the XCOM ip used on this.I was so bored, I started dissecting what could have possibly went through the producers minds as they hacked this game together."" Kids like that Mass Effect game, let's take their tactical system .. """" Oh !  You know what else they like ?  That wrist thingy from Fallout 4, and Fedoras! ""This is not to say that it isn't satisfying to have your team go to point A while you lay cover fire, and have them shoot at bad guys.  In a way, it made me think of XCOM agents drawing attention from hostiles and fighting tactically ..But it's buried behind gimmicks stolen from other games that it hardly feels like XCOM at all.Just some creativeless, soulless use of an IP that just happened to have been noticed by some AAA producers.After beating the second mission, I talked to everyone and read every bit of detail and thought to myself ..  Do I really want to put myself through another round of ..  Go here, tell my two agents to move to A and shoot at enemies that can't find cover and spam abilities ?  There's nothing hard about, no creative solutions.Immersion breaking in how often you'll find yourself cut off from a shortcut because you can't do a pullup onto a platform ..  That and all of your other agents are being shipped in Ammo Crates too so you can switch them out in mid mission.			",70,16,0,10,3,1,4

Posted: September 30, 2014
												There are numerous factors to this game, some are positive, some are negative but overall I believe the balance is tipped towards the negative side. I will cover each factor to keep the review clean.StoryThe game has an interesting and overall fresh setting which I have to admit I liked a lot. Coldwar era, everyone scared of Reds, and overall one can't help but wonder that in such an era, where not just disbelief and distrust hinder the human side but even technically, they are way behind than the ""modern"" human resistance of Xcom: Enemy unknown, a game from the same developers, that is connected to this one.On the other hand the story develops towards open confrontation with the aliens which makes the whole thing unbelievable - especially after the developers going out of their way of providing hints about the connection with the other Xcom game, where we know nothing about previous alien encounters... while an open war with aliens ought to be something hard to forget for humanity.Even not considering the connection to the other game's storyline, it feels strange that while we are practically in open war with the aliens yet it just doesn't feel like it.  Aand this is where gameplay kicks in.GameplayYou control the protagonist, commanding a small team of men, issuing tactical orders in the heat of battle. Sounds nice. Problem is the way this plays out.Control can be truly clunky at times, certain abilities do things that just doesn't seem logical (an ability that forces an enemy out of cover looks the same as any other shot etc.) or just plain skip explanation how they do it but what truly kills it is the ai. Dishing out orders can be a pain while under fire and while time slows to a near complete halt you find yourself panicing. Not because of enemies outnumbering you or anything but simply because even seemingly solid orders can get yourself killed since your teammates tend to perform actions in a suicidal manner. That becomes apparent first when you are hit by a grenade attack and they either run away in fear (mostly right towards the enemy, exposing themselves even with tons of cover around, etc.) or just stay and get fried. Another problem is the effect of cover which tends to be erratic. You are in cover yet the enemy seems to have no problem whatsoever hitting you - and your teammates die fast.Enemies tend to be foolish too and while they do expose a lot of themselves it is still hard to take them down - even the weakest sectoids. Sure, later you can get upgraded equipment but honestly, when I see an enemy that is supposeldy physically weak (sectoids) soak up 10+ shots to the head from a carbine without flinching... I feel somewhat annoyed.GraphicsThe game has what it takes to provide proper visuals while it's engine would be capable of far more realistic looks - this art style is alright. Certainly not the best looking one around (even considering age) but no problem. On the other hand the design of certain things can be... strange, even forced.Some aliens look like the generally known versions, greys etc., modelled practically the same way as the ones in Xcom Enemy Unkown, thus providing a certain amount of consistency which is always nice while the other group of enemies consist of metallic... machines?... mainly following a geometric theme. Both groups are fine on their own but making them appear together, they just don't fit. Not because alien enemies cannot be diverse and varied or sorts - simply because the technological level of the metallic enemies seem to vastly outclass the ""flesh and blood"" enemies, resulting in a difference that makes one think that they are not even from the same game.Overall the game can be good, with enough patience you can ignore the problems I have mentioned... but honestly, not worth it. Ai and controls are core mechanics, if they are messed up, your whole experience will be plagued by fails that you can hardly do anything about. I as a player don't like it when the game just decides that I win or lose and honestly, that's how this felt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME. You see the meta score, believe it.I got this game through a Humble Bundle sale so I didn't really lose any money on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I played it just to see if it really was as bad as the reviews said.First off the A.I. is terrible. Your teammates will randomly move forward and get killed or stand in the open, and they die so quickly. Even if you set a target for them it feels as if they aren't actually doing anything, it's like they're using rubber bullets. It's just clunky and doesn't work. The storyline and characters are just as horrible, they have 0 emotion. After a certain character dies the main character is so worked up over it and it's talked about for 5 minutes when I really didn't care for this certain character whom died because he was never really important or made out to be important to the ""storyline"" at all. There's probably more reasons to dislike this game I just haven't played it long enough to find more and I don't intend to. This game just feels unfinished or like a quick publish for the XCOM series (or continuation of games about killing aliens.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, this isn't a bad game. I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Why? Because this game is essentially a 11 hour stripped down version of mass effect. Even the story shares similarities...+ Looks pretty good+ Story isn't that bad+ General gameplay is pretty good+ Most of the characters are pretty good (not much character development though, unless you want to read through every single 'note' in the game.- Main character is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Had some fps issues every now and then- Had some lighting/shadow issues every now and then- Game is super short - timescale doens't really seem realistic within game- AI team is pretty useless in terms of kills and positioningIf you like the look of this game then just buy Mass Effect. You'll get more hours out of it and it's way better. (Apart from the first one... that sucks). If you've played Mass Effect and want something similar then this isn't a bad choice. Pick it up if it's on sale. 6/10  ",113,14,1,18,20,4,23

												I really dont understand all the frack this game is getting, it doesnt deserve to be a ""Mixed"" rated review game. Ive played all XCom games on release and i have not liked them all but this one i gotta say it tooked me by suprise. Its NOT your regular XCOM game, that much is obvious, but its a new a fresh approach to the XCOM universe. It gives you the chance to explore the lore and the real fisical instalations of a base like no previous game let you before, you get to talk to engineers, researchers, medics, coms, etc, increasing the game imersion in the XCOM world and has the bonus of happening in the 60´s, the golden era... Elvis, James Dean, milkshakes, jukeboxes, rock&roll, its Back to the future man!!! The Graphics are very good, sound and music are top notch and the voice acting is prob one of the best ive seen in games so far. The story is quite good and the gameplay is not that diferent from what we have seen from the past, the only diference is that we have to develop our tactics alot faster now which in this case makes the action parts alot faster paced. The only regret ive got its that it ends, i really want more of this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story doesn't flow properly. Tons of plot holes.No saving, only checkpoint autosave.

												I love 1950-60 games. And I love this one too. Everything is fitting and the commander mode is very smooth. It feels like I am actually one of the units in 'Enemy Unknown'. There are some main complaints I have about the game tho'. The glitches, they are not common, but they get in your way. Also the AI is horrible. All I wanted one of my men to do was come to my cover, but he just ran infront of our enemy. Also, its not so much something bad, but annoying, he calls every dead person he sees a  ""Poor b######"". I understand if he knew them or like they were trapped and had now way to help themselves. But come on.Over all, its good but not worth $30. Get it on a sale for about %40 or higher.

Posted: September 30, 2014
												There are numerous factors to this game, some are positive, some are negative but overall I believe the balance is tipped towards the negative side. I will cover each factor to keep the review clean.StoryThe game has an interesting and overall fresh setting which I have to admit I liked a lot. Coldwar era, everyone scared of Reds, and overall one can't help but wonder that in such an era, where not just disbelief and distrust hinder the human side but even technically, they are way behind than the ""modern"" human resistance of Xcom: Enemy unknown, a game from the same developers, that is connected to this one.On the other hand the story develops towards open confrontation with the aliens which makes the whole thing unbelievable - especially after the developers going out of their way of providing hints about the connection with the other Xcom game, where we know nothing about previous alien encounters... while an open war with aliens ought to be something hard to forget for humanity.Even not considering the connection to the other game's storyline, it feels strange that while we are practically in open war with the aliens yet it just doesn't feel like it.  Aand this is where gameplay kicks in.GameplayYou control the protagonist, commanding a small team of men, issuing tactical orders in the heat of battle. Sounds nice. Problem is the way this plays out.Control can be truly clunky at times, certain abilities do things that just doesn't seem logical (an ability that forces an enemy out of cover looks the same as any other shot etc.) or just plain skip explanation how they do it but what truly kills it is the ai. Dishing out orders can be a pain while under fire and while time slows to a near complete halt you find yourself panicing. Not because of enemies outnumbering you or anything but simply because even seemingly solid orders can get yourself killed since your teammates tend to perform actions in a suicidal manner. That becomes apparent first when you are hit by a grenade attack and they either run away in fear (mostly right towards the enemy, exposing themselves even with tons of cover around, etc.) or just stay and get fried. Another problem is the effect of cover which tends to be erratic. You are in cover yet the enemy seems to have no problem whatsoever hitting you - and your teammates die fast.Enemies tend to be foolish too and while they do expose a lot of themselves it is still hard to take them down - even the weakest sectoids. Sure, later you can get upgraded equipment but honestly, when I see an enemy that is supposeldy physically weak (sectoids) soak up 10+ shots to the head from a carbine without flinching... I feel somewhat annoyed.GraphicsThe game has what it takes to provide proper visuals while it's engine would be capable of far more realistic looks - this art style is alright.

												This is a poorly made pile of garbage that should've never seen release. Even knowing that there's new dlc for it makes me want nothing more than my money back, and some mind bleach so I can forget I ever played it.Allow me to go into detail as to why:First and foremost, the game isn't finished. There are graphical and technical glitches all over the place, but not so much as to make the game unplayable. The game also looks like something from 2003, but with an extreme bloom filter and some shiney guns. Remember the whole research and progressing threat thing from xcom? Yeah, that's nowhere to be found in here. You have a series of very linear missions, with some side missions, and a cast of side characters who really are completely underdeveloped. Your soldiers all have one voice. One voice, with no variations, like in xcom EU/EW.The only condition I'd see as feasible ground for buying this pile of donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥would be if the developers were holding you ransom, with a gun to your freaking head, and were telling you to buy it. It took me about 14 hours to beat, so I guess it's kind of a long-ish game, but so's getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥probed with a spoon. A long game isn't necessarily a good thing, if the game itself is garbage.The only really good thing I can say is that there's a relatively good twist at the end. It actually comes very close to being the best part of the game for me--but it's at the end, so the best part was when I finally beat this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and uninstalled it. In short: DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES			",261,50,2,66,22,1,47

												edit: this game keeps crashing randomly. Thumbs down period.This game attempts to lift off but sort of falls flat while doing so.I havent't played any of the XCOM games but from what I've read from other reviews, it doesn't come close to the XCOM series.The pros:Graphics aren't bad.You can achieve success in battles by correctly positioning your guys.The game pulls off a 1960s era feel.The cons:Controls feel clunky and awkward, making running, crouching and taking cover clumsy at times.You will wrestle with your character as he takes cover when all you want him to do is run away.The options to select different conversational points with characters in the game when you are not in a mission allows for greater depth and exploration of the story. But you can simply go to the next mission without speaking to everyone. At one point before you go on the ship, the game has you literally go back and forth between Faulke and characters in another section of the headquarters. I am literally running from one place to the next. Thank god there is a skip button for the boring conversation.Off-mission you are pretty much relegated to running around headquarters talkign to people. Because of the size of the complex, it gets boring fast having to weave back and forth from one room to the next. It's not very easy to keep track of all of your goals after having spoken to someone and they change the second some new information comes up. 45 minutes into this game you realize that the game is B O R I N G.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												STOP! Don't spend full price on this game. Its not worth it. Here's why:The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a game that went through tremendous development hell. In its early stages, as the game was being made, there was a tremendous backlash from fans of the original X-Com series. The problem was the use of the name X-Com for a game that had none of the look or relation to the original X-Com series outside of alien invasion. If 2K simply called it The Bureau UFO Invasion Declassified, they could've made the game as intended... But no, they stubbornly decided to keep the X-Com name attached to the project which only served to severely interfere with and cripple its development process. Playing this game, its clear it was far along in development before the s*** hit the fan, and the project stalled as 2K struggled with methods to make the game more familiar to fans of the original X-com (by finding ways to make references to 2K's X-com reboot. A game I don't think would have been made if The Bureau X-com Declassified didn't♥♥♥♥♥♥off those fans of the original X-com)The result is a 3rd person shooter whose quality swings between mediocre and ok. Periodically you'll come across areas and level designs that seem overly generic and somewhat rushed or unfinished. The Bureau also has a sort of identity crisis by featuring Enemy Unknown fodder enemies fighting along side the aliens unique to this game.The story itself is a trainwreck. The end game story isn't just insulting and confusing, its practically nonsensical. Without spoiling anything, its hard not to feel bad for agent Carter.Personally, I find the game ok at best. I've already played it to completion on PS3 and I wouldn't recommend it. Especially not to an X-com fan. The only reason I have it is Steam keeps running a sale where you can buy X-Com Enemy Unknown and get this game with it for spare change.			",201,56,2,27,23,0,53

												Really wanted to like this game. But it suffers from a boring plot, with random crashing and terrible AI Partners that doesnt do what you tell them to do for some reason. One of the dumb AI partner decides to go 100-200 yards away from me before he got shot down, and parts where the AI refused to move at all during gun battles ... I and another partner needed to be revive.. And the AI just stands stand there in same spot refusing to move even when i commanded him to revive me.			",507,60,20,66,22,3,35

												All I remember about this game is  hating it just based on the idea of it. I've played every Xcom since the release day of the original UFO Defense, and have logged more time in it over the years than I have spent sleeping and eating combined. I've seen some horrible attempts at shoe-horning IPs into every new hot genre to come to gaming, and they all stunk. So when I saw the previews of Mad Men Vs Giant Oil Spills, I thought it was the dumbest thing yet to happen to a franchise that had been abused like a prisoner of war over the years.While it is horrible on almost every computer that tries to run it (the framerate will dive so bad, that the audio stutters), the design of the game (think Gears of War without the size 85 boots) is fun. But where this game REALLY steps out and earns its recommendation is the story and it's presentation. If you set your graphics filter to 'film grain' the game really comes to life as a period piece of fiction.The dialogue is amateurish as many of the characters seem to have an uncanny grasp of modern slang (including the aliens!) and use language and phrases not accurate to the time period, but the story still works on a fundamental level. If you are a die hard XCOM fan who passed on this just out of defiance, you'll find that the only existance of anything XCOM is more along the lines of an easter egg rather than an actual theme. (You hear many references to the SKYRANGER, but when you see it, the few chuckles you get are worth it).get this game on sale, and play it - you'll enjoy it.			",59,20,0,23,19,3,25

												who doesn't love 1960s cops?. Anyway, The Graphics were great, Gameplay was also great. You can actually command you group of officers where to move and who to atack so that's pretty cool. But come to the minors, You can't actually jump. yes that's right no jump button otherthan the jumping over boxes or ledges no regualar jumps. the mouth movement during dialogue was also good and the story and mystery of the game is brilliant. There are actually some pretty cool upgrades, after you get your hands on enemy weaponry you can lift a target and have your squad gang up on him, or you can push them back with a burst of the outsider guns. Each Squad member has his own specialties like taunting, critical strike etc. which make it interesting to explore the potential of all squad members. The Controls were pretty simple i really enjoy the game. 8/10.			",45,2,3,2,3,0,1

												I bought this game for only $4.99, so my judgement of this game would be quite different from someone who purchased it for $59.99. That being said, the game is good as it is bad. The story starts out pretty good, but by the end, becomes little more than incomprehensible gibberish. The combat is solid enough, and forces you to use cover, but enemies love grenade spam tactics. To make it worse, the snap-lock cover can become really finicky and stick you to places you rather not be ending your life with a quick dose of lasers and grenades. I like the reliance on abilites, including your squadmates, however, the pitiful AI makes more than half encounters end in fustruation as you are forced to babysit them and manually extract any real use out of them. DirectX11 API is broken with framerates dipping into the low 20's, and this is on a very powerful rig. The graphics are pretty, nothing exceptional but the variance of American landscapes powered by Unreal 3 is a nice treat to the eyes. The Alien locales, on the other hand, are of the generic ""shiny grey metallic tile"" SCI-FI variety.The best way to summarize this game is to call it a inferior Mass Effect clone set in 1962. It is by no means a bad game, and surely worth $4.99 in entertainment money, but to expect more from such a quality developer of the Bioshock games, you'll only end up dissapointed.

												Fairly O.K. game, but it suffers from some of the most embarassing animations that aren't only annoying but make the game unplayable (when the action cursor drops 2 stories down) as well as boring maps with obvious flank points. I actually think it did a good job at recreating XCOM at the point of view of one of the basic soldiers who doesn't edit the base or whatever, but it is not really enough to overshadow the annoyances of the game. The combat is good, but unfortunatley soldiers literally level up in one mission almost all the way so there are few skills and they are not as rewarding to look towards. It is not a bad game, but why you would get this at full price I have no idea. 7/10			",49,1,1,5,1,0,10

												I tried this game at a friends for a couple of hours, loved it, then bought it. I quickly noticed it isn't worth more than $15 due to one main thing: the intelligence of your teammates. If it weren't for your teammates doing bonehead things often, like instead of, when ordered, relocating to behind a wall they go in front of it and get ♥♥♥♥ing shot down instantly, this game probably would have gotten much higher scores from critics. So far, in only the second mission that I have played, the sound glitched out half way through a mission and I could weirdly only hear a few sound effects and the sound kept doing a static glitch in and out that I have never heard before in a game. Even after restarting the game, the mission was still sound-bugged. Thankfully, the next two missions I did were not. The auto-save function during play is done kinda poorly. Whenever it autosaves, which is often, it does a hard lag-lock stutter for a second. Something else that is very annoying, sometimes my graphics settings revert back to default when I launch and I have to change them back and restart the game.The Difficulty - There is no middle ground in the difficulty, there are four choices. It's like do I want to play just above noob mode or just below get murdered instantly mode? No medium difficulty is inexcusable in any game. especially this one, and here is why:Your ♥♥♥♥ing teammate AI is some of the dumbest AI I have ever seen in a game. On the 3rd difficulty, veteran, they just get downed instantly in fights forcing you to go pick them up and then YOU get downed. But you have no choice because if you lose a guy that is a high rank that you have been working on for a long time, he is gone for good. And even if you command them to go to a certain spot, they will still eventually randomly reposition, meaning they stand up and take massive dmg from enemy fire while taking the stupidest route possible to their next cover, ignoring the cover they could be using to get there. But this does not always happen, thankfully. If I had known that when your teammates die they are dead permanently, I would have seriously rethought buying this game. There is nothing on this earth more frustrating than losing something you worked hard for because of the AI being the dumbest AI I have seen in a very long time in a game. Why even have perma-death when it would be stupid to accept it when it is a far superior idea to just reload a checkpoint? The only way to combat this is by setting the difficulty to level 2 out of 4. If you tell your teammate to reposition, they do not always do it intelligently. I told my guy to move to a new spot and assumed he would use the provided cover, which there was plenty of, to work his way to the spot. No. He stood up and ran across the middle of the battlefield, took massive dmg, then was downed at his new spot instantly. Having literally no choice but to run and pick him up so he didn't die and I lose him for good, I ran to pick him up and was also downed because while reviving you are exposed, and it was mission fail, restart at checkpoint.To be fair, playing on veteran mode is entirely possible, it is just not fun at all because of how the developers decided to make your teammates ♥♥♥♥ing stupid bags of sh-t. And when it is time to gear up before a mission, there is zero point whatsoever in taking more than two seconds to know what backpacks to have your teammates wear since they are stupid as f-ck and will be often taking dmg when they should not be: A PACK THAT REDUCES ALL ENEMY DMG like the Guardian Pack! The fact that they give you the option to give them other packs is a slap in the face when you can/should only choose the one I said. And their skill trees have choices, lol. Again, if you have any brains, you will choose the skills in their trees that are going to best help them survive longer, and if they have none of those, choose skills that aim to help support you in whatever way possible or get a different squad mate.Besides all of this ignorant programming done by blindfolded starved caged confused monkeys headbutting/jumping on typewriters, the game is actually really fun provided you are playing on ""squaddie"" difficulty and nothing higher, unless you are a pretentious liar who says ""no man it's fine I enjoy it on the highest difficulty you just need to get better"". Keep lying to yourself, queer.On a more positive note, the whole idea of a 3rd person shooter in which you can at any time hit space bar and give orders to your teammates (which is the only thing that keeps them alive) and everyone has cool down timer skills is a great idea and when your teammates aren't doing stupid sh-t and ruining the fun, is a blast to play. When everything is going well, I find myself having a great time. The skills are cool and fun and the weapons are your standard fun fare, plus alien energy weapons which are cool and fun to use so far. It can sometimes depend on the situation, but if I had to give someone one tip about this game and one only, it would be take a short or mid-range gun like a assault rifle or shotgun, and ALWAYS keep a sniper rifle as your secondary weapon, especially if you are trying to play in veteran mode. Every head shot you can get with it, regardless of the mode you are in, is a precious thing that can turn a battle from total catastrophe and losing teammates, to a decisive victory. Yes, the sniper rifle is that important, provided you have good aim and get lucky and your dumb as rocks teammates haven’t gotten downed by the time you can snipe anything. Giving orders to your squad is very simple and intuitive and they perform what you want the first time, so no re-issuing orders are needed.The sounds are great (minus the God awful glitch I encountered on only the second mission) and the graphics are above average, except when textures are still filling/popping in and it looks like minecraft for a few seconds. That does not happen often though, thankfully. The best part about the game are the effects which are done quite well. The mission structure and upgrade system is done well also.Verdict:Buy this on sale and only on sale for $15 or less. The single and only reason to avoid paying more than $15 is because the developers did not put enough care and time into making your teammates act intelligently. Instead, they are some of the dumbest AI teammates I have ever seen in a game. And that takes what could have easily been my score of 9/10 for this game and smashes it over the head with a bowling pin into a 6/10 like Daniel Plainview did to Eli at the end of the movie There Will Be Blood, which is what you will want to do to yourself after fussing about with your sub-human intelligence level AI teammates.

												So... What happens when an overly ambitious publishing house (Take Two Interactive) is jealous of the marketing potential of one of its development houses' franchises... And wants to milk the franchise more thoroughly/ more quickly than that franchises' home development house (Firaxis) is willing to? It hands the franchise over to one of its other development houses (2K Marin) and tells it to make a derivative product that by-and-large is derivative at-best, and delivers no unqiue value... But manages to grab more money more quickly from unsuspecting fanboys of the franchise. That's what ""The Bureau: XCOM Declassified"" is, IMO: A money grab. Fortunately, though... The game is good enough in its own right for me to not completely feel as is I've been screwed over twice. (Once by being hoodwinked, and twice by buying a bad game.)Make no mistake: this isn't XCOM, in the classical sense. Instead, think of it as a complete mod for Mass Effect. That is... Mass Effect with an XCOM skin.Combat is *not* turn-based. Rather, it is ""real-time + bullet-time-style slow-down""  for sake of using special abilities (a la mass effect - complete with selection wheel and everything...). Time is *not* paused when in the selection wheel; rather, time is greatly reduced. Relative to ""pure/true XCOM"" games, strategy and item management are *greatly* simplified in favor of tactical gunplay. There's no base-building element at all. Weapon and gear are simplified, relative to traditional XCOM games. Flanking/ hidden/ exposed attack bonuses are similar.(Story-wise... This game is best considered a prequel to the XCOM series (I'm specifically thinking of XCOM: Enemy Unknown - don't have experience with the previous ones).)Presuming one's expectations are ""reset"" with the above... I'd recommend purchasing this *at 50% or greater discount only* (not at full price). It *is* sufficiently immersive, has a decent enough of a story line, and a couple of neat twists... Such that it's worth playing through, IMO. Although it has about the right playthrough timelength (when bought at discount), note that it has zero replay value. (IMO)Simply put... This game looks like (a ""period-correct"" variant of) XCOM, and resembles XCOM... But it certainly doesn't *feel* like XCOM... And it sure as hell doesn't *play* like XCOM. Despite all of that, however... It's worth a discount buy, as it's not a bad game in its own right.I do wish they would have left the name ""XCOM"" out of the title, though. It would have prevented some player disaapointments due to false expectations, IMO.			",85,9,4,2,12,0,34

												This Review is Clasified.if you like Xcom but prefer Shooters.. this is what you want or just fun Alien shooter.great story in my opinion tho, not gone spoil any of that.there are a view options in the story tho its not anything like the decisions you got to make in other Xcom games.if i should compare it to anything id compare it to the latest wolfenstein game.. crazy but  alot of fun when your on the ride. ;3i gotta say that the graphics look a bit poor like its straight from Enemy unknown but set to 3rd person insted of top down which makes the graphics look alot wurse then in Enemy unknown.i played through it on low quality simply because it seems poorly optimized on that part. on high or normal quality i couldnt really get a stable frame rate, but then again graphics arnt everything.its options menu isnt that big but it does have FoV sliders (didnt expect to see that on a 3rd person game but yea) rebindable keys etc.			",381,104,21,49,73,3,70

												I know this is wrong, but I actually enjoyed what I played of it. As a ""Tactical"" TPS I found it fun at times. I enjoyed when I got a sneak attack to kill everyone before a shot could be fired. However, the times that I was forced to fight wave after wave of enemy got boring. The graphics are nice, gameplay is solid, and the story is interesting. However, don't treat it like an XCOM game, it isn't like them. The main complaint I have with the game is the bullet sponge enemies. Those type are never fun. When the game forces you to think and use your abilities, it is good, when it doesn't, it is average. Play on a harder difficulty if you want to enjoy the game.			",296,63,6,36,21,5,47

												Give it a chance.XCOM's return to prominence has been an interesting one, originally an FPS with little to do with the original series, it was scrapped, and it's side project, Enemy Unknown, became an unexpected hit. Following in the wake of it's success is The Bureau, kind of a half way house between the original FPS concept and the popular strategy remake. Many of the original concepts from the scrapped FPS return here, such as the 1950s setting, the 'silicoids' and the investigative themes.What on the surface looks like a shallow cash-in, is actually a very deep and enjoyable hybrid TPS/RTS game, but in order to really enjoy The Bureau you have to be willing to give it a chance and excuse some of it's shortcomings.It's story is paint-by-numbers, it's characters are shallow, the levels are linear, it's everything you'd expect from a mediocre shooter, but for those willing to invest in the game, there's a deep and tactical experience to be had, not to mention some genuinely clever plot twists that most people won't see coming. The Bureau boasts many of the features of a 'true' XCOM game, you'll unlock better equipment as the game progresses, you'll recruit and train soldiers who can die permenantly, and you'll need to be strategic and use your assets creatively in order to win against increasingly grim odds. What sets it apart from the traditional XCOM games is the story driven campaign and the more personal perspective of being a soldier in the field. It features quite nice graphics at times, and the 50s setting and aesthetic is charming, reminiscent of Bioshock and Fallout. The cover-based shooting is simple but tight, and using the tactical view, which slows time and allows you to issue orders and use skills, is a joy to use, you'll get immense satisfaction from pulling off combos. For those fans of the XCOM universe, old and new, this is a must have game, and for fans of third person shooters and strategy games, this is a solid addition to your library.  ",185,12,4,19,14,3,30

												Coming from a new to the XCOM series perspective, I find it hard to understand why this game got such negative reviews. I'll admit my first reaction to the game was that it was underwhelming and would get repetive fast. However the further I played into the game I was drawn in by the story. I already liked the idea of a 50s era noir setting with aliens and I just wanted to know what would happen next. Sure there are a few areas which could have used a bit more depth, however I feel the story makes up for that. For example, my agents reached level 5 with much of the game left to go so it was a bit dissappointing to see that they had reached their maximum capability with so much left of the game to complete. That being said, the graphics in this game are really nice for the most part. The AI I can see could have used a bit of work, although I can understand the choices they made to keep them 'dumb'. If all the enemies just rushed you on the hard difficulty there would be no way to defend youself, literally, and the game would be impossible.Overall, I really enjoyed this game though. The story was gripping, yet a tad dry at times with the 'investigations',8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having loved the experience of playing XCOM Enemy Unknown exactly for its turn-based characteristic, I was somehow reluctant to try Declassified as a first person shooter version.I generally liked the game for the atmosphere and beautiful graphics, both on Earth and space levels.But the game is too repetitive to be considered a great game.It can be quite challenging, that is true, but it never really captivates you.You do not feel rewarded as in the turn-based version, even though there was a great deal of luck and chance factor involved in the previous game.Still, it is worth your money if you want a beautifully designed shooter.

												This game gets a bad rep because it's not like other XCOM games. Standing on it's own, this game is pretty darn good. If you are a Mass Effect I would definitely give this game a shot. The game play is engaging as you control your team in tactical fashion by way of pausing and giving orders. You build your team and agents up throughout missions, even dispensing new recurits on their own misisons where they can gain experience and join you in future battles. If you get caught in some mayhem and an agent on your team goes down, you'll fight for your life until the end of the battle at which point your trusted pilot Barnes will dispatch you a new recruit. While the characters are quite thin, the dialog options terrible, the story hooks you in enough to enjoy the ride as you try to save the world. This game is definitely underrated and far better than expected when giving the chance.			",92,21,0,15,1,0,3

												Considering what I'd previously heard about this game, I expected that paying $4 for it would still be too much. Turns out, I was incorrect on that. From what appears to be a full copy-paste of the pacing of Mass Effect 2, a decent if strange storyline grows. The only real complaint I have is the two-weapon limitation, but that's always a problem because you're usually going to either pick the assault rifles or the SMGs because everything else is situational and if it's in the wrong situation, you're just going to run out of ammo with about 7 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemies still left alive, and depending on your AI partners is a good way to get yourself killed since they're about as useful as someone who thought Colonial Marines was a good game at an Aliens convention.

												Just finished this game and I really loved it, the story is good and it's really worth playing. It's not like a typical alien shooter but it can do all sorts of things like controlling your squad soldiers and using ""magic"" to get to your enemy's. The game itself is sometimes a bit buggy, sometimes a soldier of your squad is stuck somewhere so you have to finish the wave of aliens first before you can go on or there are huge fps drops for no reason (game related). Short version:  It's really worth the money when it's on sale!			",55,3,0,5,3,1,3

												The Bureau:Xcom Declassified feels like what would happen if you combined the Game engine of Mass Effect with the Lore of Xcom and set it all back in the 1960's. The combat relies heavily on the Battle Focus, which allows you to direct your squadmates. Anything from simple ""Move"" orders to more complex ""Target"" this enemy order. On the whole i'd rate the game a 7/10. Not bad, but it tries to incorporate some of my favorite games into one and falls a little short. If you can get it on sale for $10 go ahead and get it. It's worth the gaming detour.			",295,51,3,51,24,5,47

												Considering for how much you can get this game now, I would recommend checking it out. I have the feeling, the developers never fully realized if they want to commit to the tactical combat, or to the third-person shooter. And you are forced towards the tactical route the higher you set the difficulty - the enemies become quite the bullet sponges. Maybe there are people who enjoy it, I certainly don't. Yet, the story seemed entertaining enough for me to finish the game, which is more than I can say for the majority of the titles these days.			",191,65,4,45,18,1,61

												I must say that this game is one of the best I have ever played. Great graphics, wonderful characters, good gameplay mechanics and very beautiful settings. There is only two problems I have with the game. First of all, you have to get used to the character's voices, because in the beginning, everyone's voice sounds like that stereotypical government voice that closely resembles a chicken bone being lodged down your throat. Next is the ending... it's bloody awful. It's not the event that ends the game that kills it off, it's the events leading up to it. The fact that you HAVE to switch characters was a bad idea no matter which character you took. This killed the game off completely and ruined it for me. Honestly, take Weir was next playable character, as I was connected to Carter too much and Weir's ending is much more pleasant. Other than that, I completely recommend this game, but make sure you know who to trust and who to stay connected to the most.			",124,19,3,6,16,2,20

												Setting aside the style change from tactical top down to first person shooter, this game is a mess.The first issue to strike most is the that code is not optimized, and places a strain well beyond what should be required to run what is at heart a relatively simple game (from the perspective of a major studio production).Secondly, the play style is a poor rip off of Mass Effect style, but instead of giving you teammates who can almost function, the developers here have given you two berserkering mentally deficient man-children as partners.Third, the plot structure is awful. It's almost as if written by a a gang of 12 year olds who weren't allowed to communicate. This lack of plot structure becomes readily apparent when you first arrive at the Xcom base, where you are told that the location has to be ultra secret, or the aliens will just blitzkrieg it like they did the other bases. After that tidbit, you'll told that the Major (or whoever, I don't remember) has an urgent mission for you, while at the same time being told you should just wander around the base and acclimate yourself. When you finally decide to check this mission out, it turns out an alien has snuck into the base and is trying to plant a bomb. Seems like that would have been mildly urgent, but naw, not a big deal. Plus, this doesn't blow your base's hidden location for, um, some reason?Fourth, the game will only appeal to arcade-style folks, anyone looking for a remotely indepth game play will be disappointed. Random alien weapons are left laying around for you to basically run over and pick up, destroying any hope of making an indepth game.Between the terrible performance issues, god awful teammate AI, poor plot structure, and simplistic play style results in a game that should never have gotten 66/100 from the critic average. I think they got blinded by the pretty graphics, which only really work on a great machine.Oh, and the studio closed, so don't expect patches. Don't buy it. Ever. Even on sale.

												Ever wondered what Mass Effect would look like if it was sent back to the sixties? Well look no further!Those that have played Mass Effect will see a remarkable similarity with that series, gameplay wise. Yet it still has the David vs. Goliath feeling that Xcom gives.Gameplay: 9/10 Like I said, think Mass EffectGraphics: 8/10 Good but not perfect, sometimes goes gainy around laser/plasma blasts.Story: 7.5/10 Well, Xcom can only have so much compexity with this series, just because that you almost always know the ballpark of the ending. Full story+DLC's is about 28-30 hours to complete on normal difficulty.Controls: 8/10 Keyboard is not ideal, as with all shooters. Controller recomendedOverall: 8.25/10 Also Steam has resonable prices, comerable to that of a store, but no tax, not to mention the sales from time to time.No known crashes or major glitches.

												The Bureau is a solid tactical shooter that had an intresting twist in the story and played out rather well overall. My impressions are based on a playthrough at the highest difficulty level so I don't know how easy it gets if you crank it down.Combat in the Bureau is not your typical shooter gameplay at all - if you run and gun you will very quickly get murdered by even the most basic of encounters. Most of your combat time is spent in a slow motion tactical menu where you can utilize soldier skills and designate targets and where to move.  Your soldiers level up as you use them in missions and gain skills based off what class they are and what you choose for them. While playing on the harder difficulties if they bleed out they will die for good adding an extra level of tension but if you stabilize them before they bleed out they will come back to life after you've killed everything in the area.I really did feel like the commander because of the combat system and how it is very strictly defined by what you tell each soldier to do - they aren't AI's that will do everything on their own, if that's what you want this isn't the game for you at all and you will hate the combat. I felt combat was very fun and was the strong point of the game.The story.. I have to admit after like 5 hours in I just started skipping all the dialog I really didn't care about the story at all in this particular game for some reason. Even skipping through it though it did yield a cool twist towards the end of the game that very likely causes different endings, though how different I don't know.I recommend giving this game a shot, atleast at a discount maybe. On the hardest settings and doing every side mission I came across the game was not even 20 hours and it has no multiplayer - you could very likely cut that in half rather easily on lower settings and skipping side missions.

The result is terrible.			",208,33,12,59,27,1,58

												This game is simply broing. Starting with the plot (easily predictable!) and ending with the gameplay. Combat isn't challanging a bit - which might be a good thing becouse AI of your teammates is terrible. It's not rare for them to stop following you order so they can join the player... yeah, I know - the more the merrier but it's rather difficult to do flanking maneouvers if you minions keeps following you or stops going to designated location halfway and decides to go back. Also dialogs are annoying - characters have around 3-4 dialog animations. After second mission you will be bored or annoyed by the same gestures repeated over and over. Small number of equipement. Majority of backpacks is useless. Weapons are few and are always direct upgrades of previous one of that type (Ballistic => Laser => Plasma). Are there any good sides? It looks pretty nice. But that's all... and not enough.			",118,10,0,17,5,1,15

												Considering for how much you can get this game now, I would recommend checking it out. I have the feeling, the developers never fully realized if they want to commit to the tactical combat, or to the third-person shooter. And you are forced towards the tactical route the higher you set the difficulty - the enemies become quite the bullet sponges. Maybe there are people who enjoy it, I certainly don't. Yet, the story seemed entertaining enough for me to finish the game, which is more than I can say for the majority of the titles these days.			",191,65,4,45,18,1,61

On the lowest difficulty setting, you're pretty much an unstoppable juggernaught of a commando force that can decimate entire armies.  On the highest difficulty setting, you'll be lucky if you come back with a single teammate alive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, if you have played previous xcom games, this one is totally different. 3rd person shooter with tactics on combat. I enjoyed it a lot in my first walkthrough. The atmosphere is great, detailed enough, story based at 60's is really funny, reminding me old classic sci-fi/noir movies. The characters are also good.The gameplay now is what you make it to be. You have 2 soldiers in your squad, who obey to your orders (well not always). You have some choices of what you want them to do. So you either just give orders and let them have their fun, or you grab your gun and kill every alien comes your way. You choose. My overall rating:PLUS:-unique atmosphere, detailed enough with a great taste of old sci-fi and noir movies-music-missionsMINUS:-gameplay's AI is bad (squad is basically dumb sometimes, in a ridiculus way)-dialogs and story make in some points no sense at all-graphics are good but with low fps (i think this has changed with a patch, i havent tried it yet)So my rating: 7/10			",57,8,1,3,1,0,11

												I enjoyed the retro feel of the game, but the linear path of the story and lack of choices limited it's overall impact for me personally.  In many ways the combat felt like ME with the ability to slow combat down and give orders.  I thought the alien models were well done as well as the music.  I enjoyed it and saw it through one playthrough.  In terms of replayability I would say it is limited in my opinion.  The DLC content was also average at best. Overall I would give it a 7/10.

												Oh man, this is a good game. If you like XCOM and Third-Person Shooters, you will LOVE this game. Seriously. I started with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, completed it and bought this. I downloaded it yesterday. I have spent hours on this game.The start of the game is really gripping and immersive. This stays throughout the entire game. And you can relate to most of the characters. Apart from Carter, but that is explained later. The missions are enjoyable and, I don't know if this was just me, but you end up doing everything you can to ensure all of your agents survive. The talking feature is a nice touch, and just helps you feel like you are the character. Almost as if you are another entity forcefully controlling humans. And holy s**t is the ending good. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but it is a great and unexpected ending. It depends on your ending though. Although, I don't actually know if there are alternative ending- it'd just make sense if there were. At the end of the day, I would reccomend you buy this game, especially if you like XCOM, Strategy Games, Action Games or you just want to try something new. And remember to survive, adapt, win.

If you like anything like Mass Effect then you may want to try this however don't expect anything too great apart from the visuals and combat. It has some of the elements of being a very good game but is pretty much medicore.			",250,31,1,38,11,3,34

												Considering for how much you can get this game now, I would recommend checking it out. I have the feeling, the developers never fully realized if they want to commit to the tactical combat, or to the third-person shooter. And you are forced towards the tactical route the higher you set the difficulty - the enemies become quite the bullet sponges. Maybe there are people who enjoy it, I certainly don't. Yet, the story seemed entertaining enough for me to finish the game, which is more than I can say for the majority of the titles these days.			",191,65,4,45,18,1,61

What I liked: Got all XCOM games and Spec Ops: The Line with purchase The 60's style is fun, Mad Men fan hereWhat You Need to Know: This was the reason I never pre-order games anymore Story is laughable, with boring characters with lame dialogue options trying to imitate options and character development The whole feel of a tough, desperate struggle to win like every other XCOM game is not here at all No research or progression to feel like you need to earn your rewards. Best example is getting better weapons are just pickups in the levels. WTF!!! so all your struggle and time to try and achieve awesome upgrades is gone and is the worst decision ever made The combat is basically a poorly done Mass Effect clone. China could of done better, jk Don't ever play this game unless you want to use it to learn how not to make a game, especially off an already established series( Look at halo wars on how to get it right)My Score:DPrice:$45!!Main reason for dislike: Resembles nothing of Xcom franchise, and a terrible clone of Mass EffectGames similar that are better:  Mass Effect series Halo Wars Series( in taking a franchise and doing a new genre with it) ",224,25,1,13,29,1,28

												I have heard many good and bad statements about this game, but bottom line: It is a good story based RPS with an awesome twist. It is not a XCOM game in traditional sense, but hey, no one is keeping you from playing Enemy Unknown. This game could easily have been released as a free standing title, but hey why not set it in the XCOM universe? You should play this game.			",90,18,1,19,32,0,50

												Fun game. Combat feels a bit like the Gears of War mechanics with a splash of Army of Two.  Team of 2 units and you, as the commanding officer.  Orders are very easy to issue.  Agents have 4 different classes.  I don't recall the names specifically, but you have a sniper, engineer, support class, and a tankier character who uses an assault rifle.  Graphics aren't superior, but they're not god awful.  This game can be played on the weakest of PC builds.  Story is interesting but bland at the same time.  It reminds me of the Cowboys Vs Aliens movie.  When I started playing, I thought the game would be bad since I got it with the BioShock humble bundle and I've never heard of XCOM.  Turned out to be really fun and I fully enjoyed every moment spent playing.  I haven't noticed any glitches either :)			",100,9,1,15,9,0,16

												It is quite a pity that this game has such a low score on Metacritic...probably because most people expect it to play like the original XCOM...Anyway, this is quite fun - the story is over the top and nonsensical until close to the end, where a few things are explained.Regardless of that, though, combat is nice - you control yourself (3rd person) and 2 other agents against various groups of aliens. You fight in real time in the usual way - aim and shoot; and you can also go in a slow motion mode temporarily to issue orders to your squad, so that they can go into cover, focus on specific enemies, etc.On top of the normal shooting mechanics, you and your squad ""level up"" with experience and get perks, which make the combat a lot more interesting - for example by deploying turrets, levitating enemies, etc.Graphics are nicely done, writing is full of cliches and a bit annoying sometimes. Time spent in the base organising for fights and moving the main story along is quite boring, and I would have preferred to simply watch some short clips instead.It works great with a gamepad. And it took me around 20 hours to do pretty much everything available.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not terrible, not great, not exactly mediocre either.  Fun for the most part but some brain-dead ally AI hold the game back.  Story is interesting enough and the 50's asthetic is pretty neat.  Gameplay only gets fun after you get through the first few missions so you actually have some abilities to play with.  Worth playing if you happen to have it sitting in your library or find it for 5 or under.			",202,84,2,18,11,3,27

												Lackluster Alien Killing. Combat style of Mass Effect and facial structure / character depth of LA Noir. It's fun for bursts at a time the leveling system is alright but little is affected by picking different paths in the skill tree. Whatever perks you miss you can have another person pick up making your choices meaningless. With the difficulty set at its highest the AI is there however most of the difficulty comes from the nerf bullets that are placed in the gun in this setting. Lots of talking and paltry character background for some of the main characters but it all feels cliche, (e.g.), the main character is a lone gun who lost his family and blames himself. The nicest thing I can say about this game is how things react with nvidia physx turned up. Cloth moves properly and when doors fall apart it looks very nice. This doesn't happen much and it doesn't mean you can make your own path as you are shoved down this corridor into slightly different aliens. Being that this game is only a year old you would think the graphics would still be decent which they are but the same can be said for metro last light and that just got a graphics release meaning they both were not made to meet the demands of the pc gaming community. If you love other XCOM games this adds to the lore and is worth the time. If you are like me however and could take it or leave you will get bored with the occasional oh and aw of flashy explosions and hopes for a challenging situation only to be found forced through another beigh town, hallway, or steile enviornment with the same few enemies. 7/10 Average, boring with tight controls .

												Even though this game is your typical XCOM game, the story may be in a bit of a shambles and has a few bugs, I do reccomend it for the combat element that does feel tactical and hectic at the same time; a surpsiring meld of FPS and Stratergy. If you like anything like Mass Effect then you may want to try this however don't expect anything too great apart from the visuals and combat. It has some of the elements of being a very good game but is pretty much medicore.			",250,31,1,38,11,3,34

												I liked the idea of this game, but the tactical elements it tries to do are just so poorly done. The team AI is so brain dead and issuing commands with such a limited perspective just slows the game down because you're spending so much time running around reviving your dumb team mates. They should have just let you simply switch to teammates and control them outright instead of selecting them and moving the camera around the screen all day and issuing commands. If they wanted to make a spin-off XCOM game that was a cover shooter they should have committed to that instead of putting in a very poor tactical system just for the sake of using one to make it relevant to the XCOM setting.

												I enjoyed The Bureau.  While it is not quite up to the snuff of Enemy Unknown, I still feel it did a solid job as far as the XCOM franchise goes.  However, I would recommend that its purchased during a sale rather than pay full price for it.  The most solid trait for me was the quintessential feel of 1960s.  The grainy film effects to McCarthyism  and big government doing all they can to hide the facts recreate the essence of Big Brother.  The fact that you can create agents from military to agency backgrounds also helps embellish this idea.The only downside I feel is that the endings feel a bit lackluster.  Then again, its one of the few XCOM games I have been able to play to also have multiple endings (though not requiring the player to be so focused on their choices from the very start.  You'll understand by the end what I mean.)			",146,19,0,11,11,5,30

												First off, I am a huge X-Com fan, Ive put way too many hours into the game, and is probably my all time favorite game. That being said, I was not too excited about The Bureau, but it was on sale for like 4 dollars and I couldnt pass it up. And least to say, i was pleasantly surprised. it wasnt the best game I have ever played, but it deserves much more credit it has been given. The game mechanics are decent, and your squad does suck at the beginning, but later one as you level them up and get better equiptment, they become more useful.

Overall, ity is a pretty good game, with a story that will surprise you. if it is on sale, i would suggest getting.			",15,3,0,4,0,0,11

												it's hard to appreciate this game in its own right. i've been a fan of the x-com tactical turn based games since the UFO Enemy Unknown release back in the 90's, so this incarnation as a 3rd person cover shooter for me, is really jarring.it's cool to see the whole alian invasion from a different perspective but there is SO much unexplained, or without depth - such as your characters ability to heal. So you have a device on you arm that .. uses sci-fi magic to heal? okay.. sure.Overall the game plays like a poor man's Mass Effect. Excelling at little, but not really failing at anything it attempts. Just skirting around the line between curious mediocrity and boredom.			",521,133,15,53,30,1,54

												It is quite a pity that this game has such a low score on Metacritic...probably because most people expect it to play like the original XCOM...Anyway, this is quite fun - the story is over the top and nonsensical until close to the end, where a few things are explained.Regardless of that, though, combat is nice - you control yourself (3rd person) and 2 other agents against various groups of aliens. You fight in real time in the usual way - aim and shoot; and you can also go in a slow motion mode temporarily to issue orders to your squad, so that they can go into cover, focus on specific enemies, etc.On top of the normal shooting mechanics, you and your squad ""level up"" with experience and get perks, which make the combat a lot more interesting - for example by deploying turrets, levitating enemies, etc.Graphics are nicely done, writing is full of cliches and a bit annoying sometimes. Time spent in the base organising for fights and moving the main story along is quite boring, and I would have preferred to simply watch some short clips instead.It works great with a gamepad. And it took me around 20 hours to do pretty much everything available.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, if you have played previous xcom games, this one is totally different. 3rd person shooter with tactics on combat. I enjoyed it a lot in my first walkthrough. The atmosphere is great, detailed enough, story based at 60's is really funny, reminding me old classic sci-fi/noir movies. The characters are also good.The gameplay now is what you make it to be. You have 2 soldiers in your squad, who obey to your orders (well not always). You have some choices of what you want them to do. So you either just give orders and let them have their fun, or you grab your gun and kill every alien comes your way. You choose. My overall rating:PLUS:-unique atmosphere, detailed enough with a great taste of old sci-fi and noir movies-music-missionsMINUS:-gameplay's AI is bad (squad is basically dumb sometimes, in a ridiculus way)-dialogs and story make in some points no sense at all-graphics are good but with low fps (i think this has changed with a patch, i havent tried it yet)So my rating: 7/10			",57,8,1,3,1,0,11

But this was onsale so I couldn't help but grab it and try it out and I am so glad I did cuz I been missing out and I love it.

												Fun game. Combat feels a bit like the Gears of War mechanics with a splash of Army of Two.  Team of 2 units and you, as the commanding officer.  Orders are very easy to issue.  Agents have 4 different classes.  I don't recall the names specifically, but you have a sniper, engineer, support class, and a tankier character who uses an assault rifle.  Graphics aren't superior, but they're not god awful.  This game can be played on the weakest of PC builds.  Story is interesting but bland at the same time.  It reminds me of the Cowboys Vs Aliens movie.  When I started playing, I thought the game would be bad since I got it with the BioShock humble bundle and I've never heard of XCOM.  Turned out to be really fun and I fully enjoyed every moment spent playing.  I haven't noticed any glitches either :)			",100,9,1,15,9,0,16

They're also apt to get themselves shot to death deep behind enemy lines if you forgot to hold their hands through fights.XCOM only recruits the best and brightest.... from the short bus.

												I expected a knockoff of Mass Effect, not an X-COM game, so this review is not based on anger that this isn't a ""true"" X-COM, whatever that means.  Frankly, as a squad shooter, the game feels clunky, there are too many menus to navigate, and it failed to hook me in the first few hours.  There's a lot of games out there, and I'm not willing to put five or ten hours in a game before it begins to get interesting.  Either I simply didn't get the strategy element of the squad (and I beat all 3 ME games on hard) or there's something broken in the way squaddies die every couple of seconds even if they're behind cover.  Idiot AI has them running across open ground when I order them to stay put, and jumping in front of me when I'm shooting.  If you've got a high tolerance for frustration, maybe you can get through to the ""fun"" part of the game, but I'll go try Wolfenstein instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It tries to be a strategy game and a TPS at the same time.  The TPS part was lacking, and the strategy was difficult to manage properly.  Perhaps I played it wrong, but I was lacking ammunition and my allies were mostly useless, so it seemed like a lost cause.			",82,7,2,6,8,3,14

												I am a massive fan of the XCOM serries but I feel this game was extremely sub par and struggled to play the few hours I did. I have been a gamer a long time and hold things to higher standards probably more so than most. There are too many good games in this genre to waste time playing this. Story - The voice diagloues are similar to a Mass Effect but have 0 consequence based on choice as far as I got. The mouth movements are very harsh and there are only 3 or 4 body animations the main character will do. Even in the few hours I played, this REALLY bothered me. I would of rather had still faces with text bubbles popping up like a SNES game versus what was done. The quality of the actual voice acting was decent but doesn't come close to making up for the rest. The story itself is dull, aliens have attacked and you scramble to get your defenses ready and find out why.  Combat - I find the Mass Effect serries combat to be MUCH more engaging than this, but they share a great deal of similarities. It is a 3rd person tactical shooter. You need to use cover and special abilities given to each class to win. Graphics - Very poor character animations in dialogue. Combat animations are okay. Nothing to brag about.Over all - I cannot recommend this game because it simply lacks polish. If you aren't good at shooters maybe this game will provide more in terms of tactical ability needed, but for it was put the troops on the flanks and shoot until the enemies are dead. I would absoutely recommend the Mass Effect serries over this because it is better in every aspect.			",233,25,1,39,11,3,52

												I found the story interesting, but it just wasn't worth the frustrating gameplay. My AI team m,ates would keep walking out of cover insted of staying in the spots I told them to. When trying to run I would stick to every piece cover I got close to. (run cover and valt are all the same key). I tried I really did. 3hrs in and Its not worth the pain in my hands.

												As an Avid Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 player, I picked this game up because I had always thought an XCOM shooter game would be way cool. I was not dissapointed. BUT, it's imperative that you know that going into it, this is not so much an XCOM game as it is a shooter Stylized to be LIKE XCOM. Also it's in the 60s because why not. The story was alright, and explains how it *could* be part of the new XCOM universe, but honestly if you're looking for story driven games, there's much better out there (and if you're not, you can essentialy skip through the entire story part by just mashing the skip button and always choosing the lefternmost response). Listening to your squadmates talk gives a humerous aspect to the game, and although I've seen many complaints about it I had very few problems with the squadmate AI on my own run through the game. A few times they would find weird paths to do what I ordered them, or get stuck on a wall for a few seconds, but no serious problems. The gameplay is interesting enough that I could see myself replaying it eventually. Very fun, but a pretty short game (get it on sale unless you REALLY want it). All in all, a very fun time and worth the price.I'd also like to mention, I played this game entirely with a USB ported XBOX-360 controller, NOT a keyboard and mouse. I've heard terrible things about how the game handles with those, so be forwarned you might have to rebind some stuff to get a good control scheme on Keyboards.			",85,17,0,21,26,0,14

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is the imagination of a classic series of turn based strategy games as a first person shooter.  The game begins in Pima, New Mexico where strange happenings are afoot and suddenly a coordinated alien strike disrupts global communications, supply lines, etc.  The Bureau is an over-the-shoulder shooter with a “time-slow” button that allows the player to give commands to their squad.  Those who have played the Mass Effect games … the combat is exactly like Mass Effect.The Good:  The fights in this game a pretty fun.  Good battlefield layout made for lots of fun fights as you slip from cover to cover. Further, the ability to move your squaddies and deploy skills and hardware gave a neat strategic over lay that made the game more than just a “shoot-em-in-the-head-over-and-over” fest (in lower difficulties).The Bad: Sadly, everything else is ranging from not good to terrible.  The entire game is one long hall way; there’s never two ways to a fight, a way around a fight, etc.  The story … well dang, I am honor bound to never spoil anything no matter how good or how bad I think the writing may be.  That said I’ll be interested to talk to someone else who’s played this to see if the whole last 10% of the game was actually as bad as it seemed of it is super wonderful and I’m just a dope and didn’t get it … IDK, not worth playing again to find out.  The voice acting is mediocre at best and the tech-tree (or extreme lack thereof) is downright offensive to anyone who’s played the older X-Com games (there is no tech tree, you find a weapon just sitting there and pick it up … yours now).  The game is also SO comically straight forward that you almost have to avoid the “secrets” since they are mostly shiny things at the end of short hallways, like … you can nearly see them from the main rout!  Just in case you actually did miss anything the stuff in these “secret” passages you can take comfort in that it is either ammo you didn’t need or a gear schematic that they game will give you later.  This game also commits the cardinal sin of game difficulty: enemies get more HP and do more damage / run a head-shot script per level of difficulty which turns the game into a “shoot-em-in-the-head-over-and-over” fest.  The Funny: The game was also not bug free which, when games are bad, can be nice since it serves as comic relief.  I fell through the floor of places I was walking toward twice and once the camera locked onto my face and didn’t move after dialog.  The combat raged on and I proceeded to just sit there, adoring the main characters steely grimace while getting gunned down for being out of cover.  OH!  Whether or not you play the game though, be sure to look up the commercials!  The marketing for this game was more fun than the entire game!  Seriously, the stuff they did on Twitter and small webisodes and such were SUPERB!  The marketing people for this deserve to be on much better projects that’s for sure!  I’d hire then in a snap!The Summary:  I give this game 5 out of 10.  It’s not quite as bad as when they made Shadowrun into FPS but this is pretty bad.  Think of a game like Chess.  We know it as a game where strategy and a careful, mistake free execution are keys to success.  Then take the strategy out and let all the chess pieces run anywhere they want and shoot!  That’s what you get when you turn a game like X-Com into an FPS.  If you want to sit down and shoot at aliens for a few hours while you watch TV and the game is on Steam-sale for 5 bucks or less you won’t kick yourself for picking up a copy, I’ll give it that.  With all the good titles out there though I can’t imagine anyone so hard up for something to do that this would be a good buy.  The fights are fun if ya like a quick shoot-em-up but that’s all I can say.  Thank God Sid Meyers got the rights to this game as well and made a FANTASTIC turn based strategy X-Com; that is everything X-Com should have been!  GET THAT ONE INSTEAD!			",162,19,0,32,5,0,39

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified - это ответвление от легендарной серии тактической стратегии XCOM. И с другими играми серии она не имеет ничего общего, разве что присутствие сектоидов и название самой организации. Каким-то крутым геймплеем или хорошо придуманным сюжетом игра не блещет, но игра хорошо пропитанна атмосферой 60-х. Сам краеугольный камень игры, а именно её тактическая часть, хорошо реализованна. Также можно свободно побегать по базе XCOM и повыполнять какие-то побочные небольшие квесты в ней. В целом, первый шутер во вселенной XCOM оказался не без минусов, но на пару вечеров эта игра вполне сойдет. 7.5/10.			",104,43,2,14,2,0,2

												The Bureau was born of a false assumption, and it shows. When development began on the game, the prevailing belief among its publisher and the industry at large was that games in the vein of the original XCOM lacked widespread appeal, and that gamers yearned for first person shooters. After the excellent XCOM Enemy Unknown helped refute this preconception, the Bureau and 2K Marin were clearly left in the awkward position of drastically rewriting a product that was already stung by criticism in advance of its launch. The result is a hybrid third person shooter that borrows its aesthetic from Mafia, its gameplay from Mass Effect, and a tactical facelift from XCOM. Its thus far underwhelming story no game should take the blame for. None of these elements click together neatly even if they are at times competent. It resembles four jigsaw puzzle sets cut to size fit with scissors. In order:1) The game's visual presentation is badly flawed. Clipping issues felt common, and even on moderate settings the game has repeated framerate stutters. Protagonist William Carter's hands repeatedly clips through his shoulder holster in dialogues that look stiff and uncanny even by the standards of the genre. One support character walked clean through Carter. Even when it's working the visuals can get quite goofy. Agent Carter resembles no one as much as Sterling Archer, down to the Tactleneck. That said, the 60's aesthetic is kind of fun. Old computers whirr in the background, the Pipboy lifted from Fallout is a nice touch, and the aliens ripped from XCOM look good. It's at least a colorful game, and the infected humans dubbed sleepwalkers do look suitably creepy as they glitch through the same moment over and over again with blood flowing from their eyes.2) At its core, the gameplay alternates between third person squad combat and some light base management. Whereas Enemy Unknown made the base feel aspect feel important, and gave weight to the decisions made, there is nothing of the sort here. Agents can be sent on missions, but success is simply a matter of dispatching the sufficient number of agents. Even Assassin's Creed has more depth than that in the metagame. On battle it's mostly functional. Guns have weight, powers plagiarized from other games (looking at you: lift) give the right level of ""oomph"" to fights. But even here there are fundamental problems. For a start, while the aliens are controlled by a hive mind, at least they collectively have a brain to speak of. The same cannot be said of your squadmates. Sending them to a spot is no guarantee they won't decide to run over to you. While they know enough to run from grenades and to attempt to take cover, the game's understanding of cover is so flawed I had one agent run straight into the sightline of a mechtoid repeatedly because the game thought the spot was ""safe"". To cap it off, each dumb decision can get an agent killed. If they felt expendable, that would be one thing, but with only two men and consistent checkpoints, just losing one is both annoying and easily fixed.  Weapons also lack sufficient ammo to take down the bullet sponge Mutons and Sectopods sent in to break up the monotony of play. At the end of most fights you're left scrounging for another gun to scratch off its last bit of health. Still, there were stretches where things held up enough to give some interest. 3) The XCOM additions to the game more or less boil down to visual tweaks. With the exception of the more boring and humanoid Outsiders, the aliens are straight from XCOM. As a result, they feel more interesting and varied than the mainline battle troops usually sent against Carter. The other aspect, the cover system that appears in the tactical menu seems to have little point other than to confuse the AI when it bugs out.4) Finally, and most damningly for a game with such heavy emphasis on story, the narrative is almost comically awful. If the mantra of movies is Show, Don't Tell, and that of gaming is Play, don't show, then the Bureau loses at both counts. Agent Carter is supposedly a drunk, but the two beers I drank this evening were two more doses of alcohol than I've seen him imbibe. He's also a loose cannon, who inexplicably obeys every order given. NSA Chief Faulk, the amoral boss is also supposedly paranoid, but I only hear about any of these traits when characters make a point of talking about them.  An alien invasion is underway in major cities like New York and DC, but I only hear of it in random text blurbs. The Bureau is also supposedly covering this all up, somehow including the disappreance of an entire mountain, the loss of several dozen army bases and towns, two nuclear launches, and the appearance of literal alien skyscrapers that create their own star cover. And I haven't even finished the game. Characters are introduced and killed off before we're given any reason to care about them, and memorably in one moment an infiltrating alien even switches sides after two lines of dialogue. Nothing makes sense, and all of it is presented with the same stiff armed, dead eyed conversation wheels Mass Effect could barely salvage with superior dialogue and voice acting. Even on sale this isn't worth the time and frustration, except as a laugh.			",126,16,0,16,7,0,22

												There's a lot to like and dislike about The Bureau. The connection with it and Enemy Unknown are tenous at best; other than name, and a visual callback in the form of EXALT in Enemy Within, the two games are completely seperate. The visual style is good, and distinctive. The 60's era, Cold Era setting is unique and distinctive, and the game looks fantastic. Curiously, the game decides to give each of your individual classes a completely different look. While this helps you to identify them instantly, it also doesn't really lend a sense of being in an organized unit, more like a guerilla organization. Perhaps they meant to get the sense of desperation across, though it came across as more like a dysfunction junction.The story is passable. The twist is surprising, but not earth shattering. If you're perceptive in fact, perhaps you would've seen it coming.Audio work is steller. Weapons, they sound good. Other than the Scatter Laser, which for some reason is like an animal squealingl everytime you pull the trigger, the rest of the weapons sound solid and dependable, and you can really feel the hurt that you put out. The audio cues that your squadmates give are loud and clear, and the spoken dialogue is pretty good. Gameplay is okay. This is a cover based shooter, and it shows. In fact, it shows too much; you can tell an ambush is coming by the suspicious amount of cover. Though it generally blends well with the environment, it's a telling sign when you come across a series of low walls between you and your objective, and some conspicious explosive objects, but no enemies in sight. You always have two squadmates with you, but they might as well not be around. We'll get to that in a bit. With your squaddies you can outflank the enemy, but with the plethora of cover busting abilies at your disposal, you really just need to wait for your cooldowns. Oddly enough, the game doesn't let you free-throw your grenades, instead making them a targetted AoE ability with no cool down.Now on to the AI. The enemy AI is good. Stunning, even. It will pin you down with suppressing fire while flanking your position. It will flush you out with grenades. It will take advantage of an advancing muton to rush your position, flanking you while you deal with the muton, which by the way can take a literal storm of bullets and still keep coming. But surely, you must be thinking, with your two squadmates, it'll be difficult but manageable.No. It's fustrating, that's what it is.Because your own team AI is astoundingly bad. Your squadmates won't use their own abilities on their own initiative. They will often expose themselves to enemy fire to empty their clip, and get downed in the process. They won't relocate when getting flanked. They'll spend almost all of the time in combat asking you for orders or asking for healing. They get downed very easily, because I saw with my own two eyes my squadmates roll away from an enemy grenade, only to run back to it because it was the closest cover. It's not a squad based shooter. It's a solo shooter, with two of the enemy on your side. Its a shame, because as  the enemy AI shows, 2K CAN develop intelligent AI, they just decided to hand the player possibly one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friendly AIs in video game history. Perhaps they didn't want it to be too easy for the player, but as the AI stands, it's the most fustrating thing to experience in the game. In conclusion, if you can weather the terrible friendly AI (which I did, just barely), the game isn't that bad. Taken on its own, as a seperate part of the XCOM family, it's a good inclusion in its own right. This game could have been so much more; all they had to do was increase the competence of your teammates. But as it stands, it's extremely fustrating.			",155,14,0,23,18,0,56

This game could have been so much more; all they had to do was increase the competence of your teammates. But as it stands, it's extremely fustrating.			",155,14,0,23,18,0,56

												The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is the imagination of a classic series of turn based strategy games as a first person shooter.  The game begins in Pima, New Mexico where strange happenings are afoot and suddenly a coordinated alien strike disrupts global communications, supply lines, etc.  The Bureau is an over-the-shoulder shooter with a “time-slow” button that allows the player to give commands to their squad.  Those who have played the Mass Effect games … the combat is exactly like Mass Effect.The Good:  The fights in this game a pretty fun.  Good battlefield layout made for lots of fun fights as you slip from cover to cover. Further, the ability to move your squaddies and deploy skills and hardware gave a neat strategic over lay that made the game more than just a “shoot-em-in-the-head-over-and-over” fest (in lower difficulties).The Bad: Sadly, everything else is ranging from not good to terrible.  The entire game is one long hall way; there’s never two ways to a fight, a way around a fight, etc.  The story … well dang, I am honor bound to never spoil anything no matter how good or how bad I think the writing may be.  That said I’ll be interested to talk to someone else who’s played this to see if the whole last 10% of the game was actually as bad as it seemed of it is super wonderful and I’m just a dope and didn’t get it … IDK, not worth playing again to find out.  The voice acting is mediocre at best and the tech-tree (or extreme lack thereof) is downright offensive to anyone who’s played the older X-Com games (there is no tech tree, you find a weapon just sitting there and pick it up … yours now).  The game is also SO comically straight forward that you almost have to avoid the “secrets” since they are mostly shiny things at the end of short hallways, like … you can nearly see them from the main rout!  Just in case you actually did miss anything the stuff in these “secret” passages you can take comfort in that it is either ammo you didn’t need or a gear schematic that they game will give you later.  This game also commits the cardinal sin of game difficulty: enemies get more HP and do more damage / run a head-shot script per level of difficulty which turns the game into a “shoot-em-in-the-head-over-and-over” fest.  The Funny: The game was also not bug free which, when games are bad, can be nice since it serves as comic relief.  I fell through the floor of places I was walking toward twice and once the camera locked onto my face and didn’t move after dialog.  The combat raged on and I proceeded to just sit there, adoring the main characters steely grimace while getting gunned down for being out of cover.  OH!  Whether or not you play the game though, be sure to look up the commercials!  The marketing for this game was more fun than the entire game!  Seriously, the stuff they did on Twitter and small webisodes and such were SUPERB!  The marketing people for this deserve to be on much better projects that’s for sure!  I’d hire then in a snap!The Summary:  I give this game 5 out of 10.  It’s not quite as bad as when they made Shadowrun into FPS but this is pretty bad.  Think of a game like Chess.  We know it as a game where strategy and a careful, mistake free execution are keys to success.  Then take the strategy out and let all the chess pieces run anywhere they want and shoot!  That’s what you get when you turn a game like X-Com into an FPS.  If you want to sit down and shoot at aliens for a few hours while you watch TV and the game is on Steam-sale for 5 bucks or less you won’t kick yourself for picking up a copy, I’ll give it that.  With all the good titles out there though I can’t imagine anyone so hard up for something to do that this would be a good buy.  The fights are fun if ya like a quick shoot-em-up but that’s all I can say.  Thank God Sid Meyers got the rights to this game as well and made a FANTASTIC turn based strategy X-Com; that is everything X-Com should have been!  GET THAT ONE INSTEAD!			",162,19,0,32,5,0,39

												I kind of want to express my own opinions on the game, most of it what I am about to say has been said before so I'm pretty much preaching to the choir here.Pros:-Decent Combat System-SOME similiarities to former XCOM games-Surprising amount of detail put into areas-decent graphicsCons:-Poor voice acting and lip sync-Ridiculous plot with a bad ending-Unconvincing 1960's theme-Uninteresting and underdeveloped characters-cliched protagonist-repetitive gameplay and level design-poor squadmate AIIf you want me to elaborate on anything, ask in the comments.

												I am a massive fan of the XCOM serries but I feel this game was extremely sub par and struggled to play the few hours I did. I have been a gamer a long time and hold things to higher standards probably more so than most. There are too many good games in this genre to waste time playing this. Story - The voice diagloues are similar to a Mass Effect but have 0 consequence based on choice as far as I got. The mouth movements are very harsh and there are only 3 or 4 body animations the main character will do. Even in the few hours I played, this REALLY bothered me. I would of rather had still faces with text bubbles popping up like a SNES game versus what was done. The quality of the actual voice acting was decent but doesn't come close to making up for the rest. The story itself is dull, aliens have attacked and you scramble to get your defenses ready and find out why.  Combat - I find the Mass Effect serries combat to be MUCH more engaging than this, but they share a great deal of similarities. It is a 3rd person tactical shooter. You need to use cover and special abilities given to each class to win. Graphics - Very poor character animations in dialogue. Combat animations are okay. Nothing to brag about.Over all - I cannot recommend this game because it simply lacks polish. If you aren't good at shooters maybe this game will provide more in terms of tactical ability needed, but for it was put the troops on the flanks and shoot until the enemies are dead. I would absoutely recommend the Mass Effect serries over this because it is better in every aspect.			",233,25,1,39,11,3,52

												I expected a knockoff of Mass Effect, not an X-COM game, so this review is not based on anger that this isn't a ""true"" X-COM, whatever that means.  Frankly, as a squad shooter, the game feels clunky, there are too many menus to navigate, and it failed to hook me in the first few hours.  There's a lot of games out there, and I'm not willing to put five or ten hours in a game before it begins to get interesting.  Either I simply didn't get the strategy element of the squad (and I beat all 3 ME games on hard) or there's something broken in the way squaddies die every couple of seconds even if they're behind cover.  Idiot AI has them running across open ground when I order them to stay put, and jumping in front of me when I'm shooting.  If you've got a high tolerance for frustration, maybe you can get through to the ""fun"" part of the game, but I'll go try Wolfenstein instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To make it short and painless, the game does nothing really well. Story: BadAction: not really excitingTactical elements: fakeBasically a cover shooter with some tactical elements, neither the shooter part nor the tactical part work satisfyingly. 3rd Person shooter controls feel cumbersome, getting into cover and especially getting out of it (due to the huge amounts of grenades thrown at you in higher difficulty), aiming, running, jumping over obstacles, and even picking up ammo often gets a challenge of its own. Your squad, even though equipped with nice abilities, constantly dies of AI stupidity, beating the game only becomes possible because enemy AI is not any better. Speaking of the enemy, combat is dull and gets repetitive soon, instead of playing out the strengths of the tactical command UI, the game constantly throws you into small arena-like areas where you fight waves after waves of increasingly armored and shielded enemies (gimmicks like the rocket turret soon become entirely useless against enemies they dont even scratch. Like Mutons. And there are a lot of Mutons). Little example for the badness of game design: There are enemies you better attack from behind. So the obvious idea would be to tell your squad to get into cover to divert the enemy to sneak behind it to get a good shot. Often though, there simply is no ""behind the enemy"", and even if there is, your stupid squad will follow you automatically if you get more than a few meters away from them (of course they not rarely die in this attempt to follow you). Regarding the story, a lot more potential was wasted here. Alien Invasion meeting 1960s Cold War Paranoia is a great idea but they dont really made anything interesting about it. Instead of facing the claustrophobia of living in a subterranean bunker base while hell breaks loose on the world, you have to persecute the obligatory Shodan-Skynet core villain who you just need to kill to stop the entire invasion. Biggest joke: in the end, it just gets covered up, but if you actually get so far to see the end you have already stopped following the idiotic plot anyway. Steam says I put 25 hs into this crap. Needless to say it was wasted time....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not very far into this yet and already I have tons of problems with it--problems that have nothing to do with X-Com loyalty. I'm not even that experienced with traditional X-Com. My problems stem from this being a very problematically designed tactical shooter with a story and writing that just doesn't add up...or make sense...or make me feel anything. First off lets talk mechanics. As a tactical shooter, this game does at least try to bring more complexity to the genre, but that complexity is undermined by a control system that feels very loose and innacurate (I'm talking about aiming and shooting here). In addition to that, the AI of your companions leaves much to be desired.  Even when you are giving them orders regularly and changing their positions often, you will find that they are generally inneffective and frustrating to work with. I'm sure that they improve some as they level, but I doubt even then that it will totally solve how chaotically and unpredictably they behave.As for the story, it is about as mediocre as they come. Neither the writing nor the cinematic presentation are very good at all. Often the cinematography and dialog are so bad that I have no idea what is happening. The result is a game that feels like it is coming apart at the seems. The presentation is so sloppy and disjointed that the only way anyone could possibly enjoy it is by not paying attention to it and filling in the blanks with their own imagination.This game should have had it all for me. I am huge fan of retro science fiction worlds and X-Files-esque conspiracy laden story telling. Despite that, I can only express dissatisfaction with this game as a product. It is simply a broken, unpolished, cash-in by a company that should know better at this point. For shame 2K. For shame.If you're just looking for a tactical shooter with a decent story, try Spec Ops: The Line instead. That game has an incredibly satisfying cinematic atmosphere, despite its tactical mechanics being simpler and more familiar. If you're looking for a good retro sci-fi game with aliens and government agents and all that stuff...well, tell me when you find one because I'd love to play it.Who I'd recommend this for:Virtually no one. This is one of those games that is only for people who have decided to like it before they ever even played it. If you're into the surfaces of the game world and have a lot of patience for poor mechanics, you might have a good time. If you're someone who is simply interested in playing bad games (and I say that earnestly because I do think there is nobility in that, especially for designers) you might want to give it a try as well, but I wouldn't pay full price if that's the case. Hell, I wouldn't even pay half price. I bought this game on sale for $15, and I wish I had waited until they were chuckin' it away for $5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So the obvious idea would be to tell your squad to get into cover to divert the enemy to sneak behind it to get a good shot. Often though, there simply is no ""behind the enemy"", and even if there is, your stupid squad will follow you automatically if you get more than a few meters away from them (of course they not rarely die in this attempt to follow you). Regarding the story, a lot more potential was wasted here. Alien Invasion meeting 1960s Cold War Paranoia is a great idea but they dont really made anything interesting about it. Instead of facing the claustrophobia of living in a subterranean bunker base while hell breaks loose on the world, you have to persecute the obligatory Shodan-Skynet core villain who you just need to kill to stop the entire invasion. Biggest joke: in the end, it just gets covered up, but if you actually get so far to see the end you have already stopped following the idiotic plot anyway. Steam says I put 25 hs into this crap. Needless to say it was wasted time....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I heard a lot of bad things about this game when it first released. I could understand the point most people would make in regards to the X COM series. After playing through the game I have realized its not so much of a bad game as it is ok. In the sense that it has the key components of a game and I did not run into any problems really. The games just is not exciting as one would figure with an alien invasion and a country in ruin because of it. One of the major flaws in the game i think is the lack of character I hated having to talk to other npc's in the game because i just didnt care. I found myself constitenetly skipping dialogue just to what i was thinking was a mission to only have to go to different part of base and talking to someone else. I would have to say this game is good if its in the bargain bin or on sale for less the 10$.			",150,31,8,28,14,1,19

			While there are better cover shooters out there and better XCom games, if you're looking to bridge between the two genre this game does an good job.		

While there are better cover shooters out there and better XCom games, if you're looking to bridge between the two genre this game does an good job.  With the game focus on ground combat the research and base building aspects are almost after thoughts. The strongest part of the game is the over the top 1960s setting with characters chain smoking in every scene and wearing three piece suits in combat.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

If no attention to detail or just the little things grind your gears. This game ain't for you just like it most certainly isn't for me. Tried it, don't like it, Uninstalled forever into the void. If you want to play it go ahead, just giving a fair warning.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As an Avid Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 player, I picked this game up because I had always thought an XCOM shooter game would be way cool. I was not dissapointed. BUT, it's imperative that you know that going into it, this is not so much an XCOM game as it is a shooter Stylized to be LIKE XCOM. Also it's in the 60s because why not. The story was alright, and explains how it *could* be part of the new XCOM universe, but honestly if you're looking for story driven games, there's much better out there (and if you're not, you can essentialy skip through the entire story part by just mashing the skip button and always choosing the lefternmost response). Listening to your squadmates talk gives a humerous aspect to the game, and although I've seen many complaints about it I had very few problems with the squadmate AI on my own run through the game. A few times they would find weird paths to do what I ordered them, or get stuck on a wall for a few seconds, but no serious problems. The gameplay is interesting enough that I could see myself replaying it eventually. Very fun, but a pretty short game (get it on sale unless you REALLY want it). All in all, a very fun time and worth the price.I'd also like to mention, I played this game entirely with a USB ported XBOX-360 controller, NOT a keyboard and mouse. I've heard terrible things about how the game handles with those, so be forwarned you might have to rebind some stuff to get a good control scheme on Keyboards.			",85,17,0,21,26,0,14

												I really wanted to like this game. And to a certain extend I even did. But first things first.If you consider whether to buy this game or not, the first thing you need to know is that it is not really X-Com. While the other games like Enemy Unknown are turn-based strategy games, this is a squad based shooter. Which is completely fine to me, you just need to know that beforehand.Coming to this game, the performance was actually pretty solid, slight performance issues and framerate droppings here and there, nothing to worry about. Graphically it's okay, not amazing, but I like the artstyle and they got the look right.Storywise it plays it safe I guess, nothing really shocking happened up to the point I got with this game, but I can't say anything about the ending.Which leads me to my main problem with this game: The mechanics. I like the fact that you can pause the game and issue commands, which your teammates will usually react to. Sometimes you will have to instruct them multiple times because they just sit there doing nothing. But again, this didn't happen too often.What did happen frequently however was that my squadmates ran out of cover and got shot down or didn't take cover to begin with. This will result in untimely deaths and is especially annoying if your soldiers were on a high level.That said, I didn't have a problem with soldiers running out. What really got me to stop playing was a game breaking bug, with which the game wouldn't load the floor of the room you need to go in. You just enter the room and a cutscene is about to start, but you just fall through the nonexistent floor and die while multiple death sounds play on top of each other.I tried reloading checkpoints, playing the whole mission again, re-installing the game, nothing changed. So I can't finish the game. GG			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When trying to run I would stick to every piece cover I got close to. (run cover and valt are all the same key). I tried I really did. 3hrs in and Its not worth the pain in my hands.

												I'm not very far into this yet and already I have tons of problems with it--problems that have nothing to do with X-Com loyalty. I'm not even that experienced with traditional X-Com. My problems stem from this being a very problematically designed tactical shooter with a story and writing that just doesn't add up...or make sense...or make me feel anything. First off lets talk mechanics. As a tactical shooter, this game does at least try to bring more complexity to the genre, but that complexity is undermined by a control system that feels very loose and innacurate (I'm talking about aiming and shooting here). In addition to that, the AI of your companions leaves much to be desired.  Even when you are giving them orders regularly and changing their positions often, you will find that they are generally inneffective and frustrating to work with. I'm sure that they improve some as they level, but I doubt even then that it will totally solve how chaotically and unpredictably they behave.As for the story, it is about as mediocre as they come. Neither the writing nor the cinematic presentation are very good at all. Often the cinematography and dialog are so bad that I have no idea what is happening. The result is a game that feels like it is coming apart at the seems. The presentation is so sloppy and disjointed that the only way anyone could possibly enjoy it is by not paying attention to it and filling in the blanks with their own imagination.This game should have had it all for me. I am huge fan of retro science fiction worlds and X-Files-esque conspiracy laden story telling. Despite that, I can only express dissatisfaction with this game as a product. It is simply a broken, unpolished, cash-in by a company that should know better at this point. For shame 2K. For shame.If you're just looking for a tactical shooter with a decent story, try Spec Ops: The Line instead. That game has an incredibly satisfying cinematic atmosphere, despite its tactical mechanics being simpler and more familiar. If you're looking for a good retro sci-fi game with aliens and government agents and all that stuff...well, tell me when you find one because I'd love to play it.Who I'd recommend this for:Virtually no one. This is one of those games that is only for people who have decided to like it before they ever even played it. If you're into the surfaces of the game world and have a lot of patience for poor mechanics, you might have a good time. If you're someone who is simply interested in playing bad games (and I say that earnestly because I do think there is nobility in that, especially for designers) you might want to give it a try as well, but I wouldn't pay full price if that's the case. Hell, I wouldn't even pay half price. I bought this game on sale for $15, and I wish I had waited until they were chuckin' it away for $5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Was hoping for Mass Effect gameplay. . .  got something that tries to be it but is too hung-up on special damage types vs. special enemies to work well - especially as sometimes you are out of the damage type you need for X enemy and just have to get it done by banging your head against the wall. The story is one of those things where they provide so much exposition about your back story that the audience has figured it all out before the reveal. Love the art style but the game was mostly a disappointment.			",226,50,4,63,15,3,47

												It's an XCOM game, alright. At least more than Enforcer ever was. Battles can get hectic, so staying in cover and ordering your teammates do the work for you is vital. But that's what XCOM is all about: hiding in bushes and commanding people to their death. And every death hurts you deep inside, even if not as much as in Enemy Unknown, but still. You just get fond to your teammates.Only thing missing are the redshirds you send to suicide runs to flush out stinky aliens from their holes, but two squad mates are enough, as witnessed by many other 3rd Person Shooters. Any more teammates just would make the battles even more cluttered.Was it worth it? To me: yes!  With a mindblowing scifi plot, where gameplay mechanics were well integrated, and 60's themed environments I can recommend it. Last level especially is something beautiful.			",99,4,1,19,10,0,30

												I enjoyed the game but it felt a bit short. If given the choice rent it because there is no replayability. Better for console than PC. It could've been much more than it was. I really like the 1960's style and this was enough for me but looking back at the game a few weeks later I can't remember anyone's name or most events including most major plot points. Imagine 1960's noir meets sci fi aliens taking it self way to seriously. The gameplay was a pretty average squad based cover shooter. Fun but nothing that other people haven't done better in other squad combat games. It's so much like Mass Effect but does nothing to distinguish itself in anyway.It's an Xcom game in name only.

The mouse is just better for snipper weapons. The only part that annoyed me a bit was your HQs, how you had to good around checking if there was anything new, took to much time. Wish the campaign was long or if there were more DLCs. The DLC Hangar 6 is worth the purchase, very cool, it's all about combat till the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have 168 hrs in XCOM EU/EW. I wanted ""The Bureau"" to be good, but it isn't. As of writing this, I've only played 45 min of ""The Bureau"" and might not play any more. Pros:-Technically in the XCom universe. If you like XCom, this might be a plus for you.-Has a squadmate command mode like Mass Effect. You might like this, I didn't think it was fun the way it is here.-Controller support is always appreciated.-No bugs in my short playtime so far. -Checks all the boxes of generic AAA story shooters. It is in fact a video game.Cons:-The shooting gameplay is just bad, movement is sluggish.-Controls are very awkward. A to sprint, RB to roll? Why? -Story so far is extremely boring. -Level design is super generic. -You can only hold 2 weapons for some reason, although more would be better. :( I suspect they did this just to copy CoD and Halo. After playing Borderlands, 4 weapons is a must in any shooter for me.-Main character is a boring 35 year old white male who sounds like a chronic smoker who thinks he's batman. This is still prevalent why?-Framerate is smoothed, no option to disable.-Game feels un-creative overall.If you lower your standards somewhat you might enjoy this. Part of me wonders if this is just a cashgrab or just AAA homogenization problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Absolutely Boring!I rolled this game when using a random steam game selector because I don't play any of the games I buy and this is one of the ones I rolled but I simply cannot finish it as I seem to have become a real sleep walker. I'm halfway through the game and all I picked up is that we got to stop the aliens. I don't know or care about the characters at all and I see no reason to continue this time sink.UpdateI decided to finish it and while I still don't think it is a good game the last two missions it picked up a bit. Unfortunately as soon as the game started to get interesting it ended.			",271,46,3,37,22,2,33

												This game is the combination of Gears of War style gameplay with Call of Duty type presentation and XCOM:Enemy Uknown writing. That is to say it's mediocre and cliched game in all senses of the word. It is literally the amalgamation of all the bad design choices of those games blended together and sprayed with Mass Effect-ish dialogue wheels that  are redundant and pointless in a boring♥♥♥♥♥story like this. I've played this game for about 4 hours on commander difficulty (which is the highest setting) and I've died like once, and I'm only average at 3rd person shooters. That'll give you an idea of the ""tactical challenge"" this game poses. And  lack of challenge takes away the fun of the xcom franchise. This game cost me like 5 bucks on the steam sale and it's not worth even that price, in fact, it's not worth being played for free, because it's a dull, uninspired game with mediocre gameplay and cliched, unoriginal plot. It's somewhat sad seeing as how this game could have been fun if it wasn't just so serious all the time. Early in the game, you find an audiolag of a German scientist that looks back on his involvement in Nazi experiments and berates them for being inhumane and wrong. All done in a serious tone. Right before you interrogate a green space man tied to a chair to spill his alien beans. Nice transition there, game.TL;DR, this is ""Baby's first 3rd-person shooter"", so unless you've never played this type of game before, I suggest you skip it because you've seen it all before and you've played it bettter before.

												I really enjoyed The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. This game is Great, but it would be better if this game have Co-Op mode.The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a science fiction video game in the X-COM series, developed by 2K Marin and released by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.The Bureau is a third-person shooter with an emphasis on squad-based tactics. The player controls the agent William Carter and commands two additional agents in each mission. Carter has his own unique abilities, but other agents are divided into the Commando, Engineer, Support, and Recon classes. By entering ""Battle Focus Mode"", which slows time significantly, the player can order their agents to move to strategic positions and activate class-specific abilities. Agents have customizable outfits, weapons, equipment and abilities. As in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, soldiers will suffer from permanent death and if Carter is unable to revive agents who have taken too much damage, they will die (variable difficulty levels also determine whether or not it is possible for downed agents to become battle-ready when revived, or if replacement agents will appear during a mission).

It no hard gameplay the like like give order is really simple but what i don't really like it that evry of you men look like super soldier whit super power from no where.

												First and foremost this game is a shame and a loss of real potential. Sadly, and arguably prematurely, my rage got the best of me and I quit the game in the middle of saving the professor at the university. First off, the terrible cutscenes, despite people arguing in favour of them and saying it only looks so ugly because of the purposeful grain effect; they are actually ugly because they are console port level badly encoded and low res. 720p for a videogame cutscene in this day and age is just mindboggling.The game itself is rather polished, I Experienced no bugs at all during the gameplay; however it still manages to feel like a beta. Small things, such as system shock-esque recordings found everywhere are a great way to add depth were it not for the fact that they are always in the same room as key characters; as such you can never hear the recordings over the repeated bleeting of ""HEY CARTER!"" ""CARTER OVER HERE"" ""CARTER WE NEED TO TALK"". The voice work itself is decent and gives a real sense that some of these characters have been through some♥♥♥♥♥♥as well as the writing being good enough to make me disappointed in my not wanting to play further. However there are some glaring core gameplay issues that are only highlighted by the game being well-optimised. Despite being a game where tactics are key the mode that allows you to control your units doesnt actually stop combat to allow you time to give orders but only slows it down, with each character having 5 orders to choose from this is rarely enough time to make a plan of action before your squadmates are being shot to pieces. To add insult to injury the squadmate AI is abysmal, they stand in direct fire way too long and within seconds can lose their entire health bar, they often avoid grenade damage by choosing to run headfirst into groups of 6+ enemies, they repeatedly ignore the regoup command and will often find some creative but painful route through the map (always leading to 6+ enemies) and finally and most upsetting of all there is no order/action to take cover. I can see looking at the skills how they may become better with ranking up, however at the rate at which they rank up you will spend 2/3 of this game babysitting the AI. This game reminded me of those awful missions that have always cropped up in FPS's over the years where you have to rescue and escort some sub-seasponge level intelligence character through a field of flying metal and blood and they would spend half the mission standing in direct fire when they shouldnt or repeatedly walking into walls. Well buckle up homestuck because in The Bureau that's the core mechanic.			",301,62,0,38,35,3,41

												Despite the large amount of negative reviews that surround this game, It really is a fantastic game. The story is gripping, the shooting is fun, and commanding troops in the field is a delight. The graphics are spot-on and really give a neat feeling of 30's and modern combined. My only gripe about the game would be the fact that it lags every now and again, but patches in the future should fix this.

												The entire time I was playing, I kept thinking ""This is a lot like Mass Effect, but where everything's a biit better"".The gameplay is ME's style down to a tee, but more involved and teammate-based. But not so much that it could really be called ""Strategic"". But it's a bit better.The grapics are pretty much ME but a bit better.The story's... well, it's pretty plain, but it's still a bit better than ME's crappy B-movie one.The characters are pretty plain, but still a bit better than ME's (save, like, two). Voice acting isn't as good though.It's a bit more creative than ME, but not as much as XCOM's.Overall, it's rather fun. If you liked ME... then you're not me, so I don't know how well this advice holds up. But the gameplay's certainly more fun anyway.Oh, fair warning: it was hyped as a kind of prequel to XCOM, but really it's more like an alternate universe thing. Not that the story contradicts XCOM's, but simply because they don't have any sort of bearing on each other. And it's certainly not a strategy-type game, that's for sure!...oh, and the Codebreakers DLC sux.			",1099,436,34,132,114,11,221

The battle focus combat system begs to be experienced if you have ever played a squad based third person shooter that has frustrated you with incompetent computer controlled squad mates. Everything that happens on the battlefield is orchestrated by you and as such if you fail, that failure falls on you. Few games give you this much control.			",451,81,8,35,16,3,39

I can't speak much for the game because I didn't play through enough, but I found it to be a relative snooze fest.

												I do not recommend this game to XCOM fans. Sure it has some appeal to it but in general it is pretty boring. The plot is rather messed up and overall gameplay resembles Fahrenheit in terms of mystic, Half-Life in terms of tech and sci-fi, also some Ghostbusters for general gameplay. But it doesn't cut it as an XCOM game. Wait till it's at least 50% off and then get it if you're really curious. Otherwise I suggest you skip on this one. Sadly.			",643,206,14,104,45,4,129

												Trochu méně známá hra, která mě překvapila slušným grafickým zpracováním, přestože hra jede na nenáročném Unreal Enginu a svým důkladně promyšleným příběhem. Samozřejmě hra má i svá negativa, jako například občas zbytečně dlouhé a únavné konverzace a cut-scény, nebo občas až idiotické chování umělé inteligence vašich spolubojovníků, kteří vás občas neposlechnou.

												My evaluation could be influenced by the fact I am playing it in 3D Vision 2 (thanks to Helixmod) but this game is one of the best cover shooter I have ever played. I won't talk about X-COM series because I don't know much but I think both atmosphere, story, dialogues and action are really above standard even if not excellent. So I will definetely give a good rating here.			",897,385,40,130,124,12,193

												The game starts with a blurry pre-rendered cinematic to set up the premise. Then you see your character, Mr. Average White Male. Mr. AWM get a knock on the door from some woman. This woman asks for your briefcase then shoots Mr. AWM. Mr. AWM then (generically) gets back up after being shot and stands there pointing a gun at the lady (who is now possed by what was inside the briefcase) telling her to ""back away from the case"" even though this person JUST SHOT HIM. Of course he doesn't shoot her and she attacks him. -FADE TO BLACK-. Mr. AWM then wakes up hours later to find the woman burnt to a crisp and his wounds magically healed. It's at this time that you can finally play the game, but not really. You have to run through an empty building, walking past dead bodies. Right when you get to the end of a hallway, you're then CINEMATICALLY ATTACKED BY SPACESHIPS and have to find cover. As the tutorial prompts flash on your screen, you're forced to learn how to move between cover as the windows CINEMATICALLY get destroyed. Cue you walking past more dead bodies while Mr. AWM talks to himself about how horrible it all is. Eventually you walk outside and some cars in the street get CINEMATICALLY DESTROYED BY SPACESHIPS flying by and you're forced to learn how to mantle over cover. Finally you come across enemies you can shoot, and your character sits there talking to himself about how to ""remain calm and take the shot"" even though you're already blasting alien noggins with no problem. After your first battle you meet up with another white guy who looks exactly like you, and he tells you to talk to Command by picking up a radio. Then you are stripped of your ability to run and shoot while you walk to the next CINEMATIC MOMENT talking to Command. Screw this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I almost feel like I have to defend this game because it has taken a beating in some circles.  It is not pure X-COM...it is more like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of XCOM and Mass Effect.  I really enjoyed it - and while it took awhile to get used to, I enjoyed the third-person combat aspects as well.I didn't really dig running around the base doing story stuff - mostly because I feel compelled to check the whole base after every mission for changes or new background info or side-quest-things (some of which led me to bonus minor operations.)   I *did* enjoy the combat, the pacing of the game during missions, and the scaling up of both weapons and enemies.There are some minor flaky/buggy type things, but nothing that was a pain or gamebreaking.The single most annoying thing for how I play is the lack of a save feature.  I need to be able to save when I want and then leave - since the game is auto-save only, I had to resort to checkpoint checking...but you don't know how long until your next checkpoint, and you have to pull up the ""Load Game"" menu to determine how long since your *last* checkpoint.  When missions can seriously run 30-60 minutes, and you can spend significant time between missions in the base running around for no good reason - the lack of a save system really hurt the game, in my opinion.  The autosave is robust, and the checkpoints are fairly frequent - but it did not substitute for the standard ""save game"" function for my needs.All in all - if you like the XCOM world and enjoy conspiracy theories and cold war-era backgrounds - this can be a great game for you.  If you aren't into either - you'll find an above average game with some minor flaws.  What you won't find is something near the caliber of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, or other similarly-priced $50 AAA games.Enjoyable and entertaining: YesWorth the time taken to play: YesWorth the money to buy at full price: Probably not.Do I regret my purchase dollars or playtime: Definitely not.All told, I got this game for around $15 - so I was very happy with my purchase.  I would not buy it at $50, but I would buy at $25-30 or lower.For interesting additional background info on the troubled development of this game since it was conceived and pitched in 2006 - I recommend this article from Polygon: http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/19/4614410/xcom-the-bureau-development-2006-2013 .

												This is not a great game, just an almost good third person shooter with covers and idiot allies. Think of Gears of War in XCOM setting with stupid AI teammates whom you have to micromanage all the time.Playing it on Commander (the highest difficulty) now, and the squad mates running into enemy grenades (or not able to run away from them) is the most frustrating thing. I have to micro manage those idiots and run away manually each time an alien throws a nade, and that's really annoying.Another game breaker is that squad members just cannot stay behind the cover. They try to attack enemies and get shot in the face. And while you can run away from grenades, can't really do anything with this thing. There should've been agressive/passive behavior for allies and also simple commands like hold ground, stay in cover, etc. As it is, The Bureau is really bad in this regard.However, the game becomes easier as agents get new abilities and you get accustomed to controls. On the lower difficulty settings you can even make mistakes and still win.Overall, you can totally buy the game on sale just to walk the corridors of XCOM base and shoot aliens with plasma and laser weapons. But don't expect too much.			",291,110,2,36,13,2,29

												I had hope for this game, the reviews had not been overwhelmingly positive but I thought maybe it would be a rough diamond.Alas, I really can't recommend this game, even if it was on sale for a couple of quid.The problems:- The story is terrible. Wait, no. It's not so much the story itself, the idea of alien invasion is obviously a solid trope that the XCOM theory thrives on. But it's handled in such a ham-fisted and clunky way. The 1960's is a brilliant setting for a game like this, but they just never make the most of it.- The main character. Another Scotch-soaked haunted soul with a shocking past... *yawn*.- The voice acting (and facial animation) is pretty poor.- The combat is bought wholesale from the Mass Effect series but it seems like they only played Mass Effect 1 (where they hadn't really perfected it yet). It tries to cram a lot of the tactical elements from XCOM: Enemy Unknown in a real-time experience, again it's clumsy as hell.- It really doesn't run all that well, I'm way above the recommended settings and there are certain parts of the environment that make the framerate tank.It's disasppointing because I really think this is so close to being an enjoyable game but it just misses the mark in every single department.

												TL;DR: Unless you're a big fan of the setting and it's discounted, don't bother, it's just too frustrating.As someone who didn't play the ""real"" XCOM games, I really liked the general idea of this spinoff as well as the setting and artstyle and did not care that this is no turn-based strategy game. However, even as a strategic cover shooter, I cannot recommend this game (not for the full price at least). 1) It runs like sh*t as it has insane framerate drops regularly for no apparent reason, making it unplayable (dropping in and out of the pause menu helps for a couple of seconds, no idea why).2) The AI is way too stubborn, remaining far behind your position, making most of your teammate's abilities worthless because the enemies are too far away from them. Command every step manually or they die regularly.3) Controlling this game is a mess. You want your teammate to throw a mine over a waist-high obstacle? Nah, try finding a way around. Throwing a mine to a lower floor? Impossible, unless you find stairs leading down. It's just frustrating trying to use abilities while the game tries everything to prevent you from it.

The first third-person real-time RPG shooter XCOM game, and damn it's f*cking amazing!Set in th early 60's, the characters are very defined, the storyline is amazing and the gameplay is outstanding!The beginning is a little confusing at first, especially the controls, but you get used to them very quickly. The story is long but never gets old, you and your custom squad gains EXP, level up bonuses and new guns. There's a lot of alien bosses and just when you think the game's over, it's not and throws you back in!I highly recommend you get all the DLC for this game, the Light Plasma Pistol is the most OP (over-powered) gun in the game (aquired after beating 'The Doctor' mission), but even on normal (squaddie) mode it's f*cking useful because this game is VERY challenging! The other DLC is extra missions that show before & during the invasion.If you like shooting games, you'll love this! It's like Resident Evil, with Aliens, and actually done right with fun gameplay (f*ck you sh*tcom!)10/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												Imagine Mass Effect, but bad, an awkward cover system, dull characters, not very engaging story, even the menus are annoyingthen take that...............and put it in the 60'sSeriously. Whose idea is it to switch running off in parts of the game....................I have no interest in looking at your glum buildings, it's the friggin' 60's..............yuck.Anyway. Not very good. I didnt pay much for it.  I'll just pretend this didnt happen. ",151,2,0,5,1,0,2
