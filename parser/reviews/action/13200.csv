AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Unreal 2: The Awakening Original Release: 2003 Genre Tags: FPS; Action; Sci-Fi My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Nostalgia chasers REVIEWI personally was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed Unreal II: The Awakening. There is actually a decent sci-fi narrative in there; albeit one that is a bit cliché. And the characters actually have personalities that manage to be mildly interesting. Mix that in with classic Unreal FPS gameplay and you get a pretty enjoyable experience.The narrative will escort you from mission to mission (level to level), as you explore various worlds in the vastness of space to accomplish your goals.  In between each mission you return to your spaceship where you can interact (mildly) with your crew and arrange your armament for the next mission.  Having conversations with your crew allows you to gather background information and expands on some of the lore aspects.  In this way, there are some parallels with the early Mass Effect games.The different missions will take you to diverse environments with various objectives, but the core gameplay doesn’t evolve much throughout the game. However you will be able to unlock new weapons and armaments as you progress, which allows you to keep things fresh as you finish up the campaign.One main complaint with Unreal II: The Awakening is that the movement speed is much slower than in other Unreal games. To be honest, it didn’t bother me that much. Luckily, if it does bother you, there is a way to increase the speed of the game using the console.  So it is true that Unreal II: The Awakening isn’t perfect, but I still really liked the overall experience quite a bit.  I think if you enjoy sci-fi FPS games with decent narratives, and need something new to play: this is a good game for you to consider.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Unreal 2 starts very real, introducing your character, an ex-marine that patrols space for the Terran Colonial Authority with his cozy little spaceship, a funny pilot and a hot female companion (oh and the techie that gives you a bunch of new guns and mods after each mission). The dialogue is fun and the graphics holp up very well but the gameplay is slow and the loading times ridiculous (maybe it has something to do with my system but playing on 'hard' means you will see more of the loading screen than the actual game even when returning to a quickload). LOADING-STANDBY-INITIALISING...The psychodelic intro is nothing like the game. It was probably hard to top the creepiness and sense of alienation you had in the original, as well as it's speed and agility.  Still, the game has enough variety in the settings (very different planets and climates) and the weapons (very cool stuff including a flamethrower, turrets, and even a spiderthrower) to make it worthwhile.

												One of the last of the old-fashioned 'second generation' of FPSs on PC has mature gameplay without the complexities of more modern titles. Like many shooters from 2002-04 (such as Doom 3), its perceived flaws were more a question of originality as we headed toward more complex games like Half-Life 2, something that console shooters of the day like 'Halo' were never tarnished with. This is all of course, nowadays irrelevant. Imaginatively pretty graphics, atmospherically slower pacing, and a story with characterisation ahead of its time blesses this game with somewhat alternative priorities. It's a lot of nostalgic fun, and a great purchase for especially those who aren't extraordinarily familiar with FPSs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unreal 2 was amongst the first games to use Unreal Engine 2, Epic's technology that for years rivalled with id software's own engine. Still, after the first Unreal we had to wait 5 years for this and 2003 was just a year before 2004, the year when a lot of big names appeared; each offering something new in terms of technology (Far Cry, Doom 3 and Half Life 2, just to name a few).Interestingly, the developer was Legend Entertainment, the guys behind the expansion pack of the first Unreal game (the company has since gone defunct) and it is a shame they could only come out with a generic shooter. While graphically the game was amazing it had little to do with Skaarj, the main antagonist species we fought so hard in the first episode. The story now is very different (but then again Quake 2 had nothing to do with Quake 1, right?); it revolves around an artifact our marine hero is set out to retrieve. Gameplay-wise Unreal 2 is quite exciting: with John we regularly return to his ship to converse with his companions who can prepare us for the next mission. This hub area has free roaming characteristics until the moment you commence your next mission which is very linear. We visit several planets; all with its own visual theme (we have deserts, snowy areas and even an alien spaceship here) just to  make the gameplay more interesting. Too bad that there are too many cutscenes (the generic dialogues make them boring after a while) and for some unknown reason the game only has very generic weapons. Where is the Flak Cannon we have grown to like? Here you have rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers - all too generic even with their alternative fire mode.The game offers a decent, 9-10 hour long campaign but not multiplayer. I understand Legend came out with an expansion just to add the missing feature to the game. Still, Unreal 2 is a mixed bag. Its unique weapons disappeared from the sequel and while the story was interesting there was not much to go on with the Skaarj. The voice actor for the main protagonist was a definite miscast.It runs well, though. There are some error messages upon launching the game but using Windows XP compatibility mode can solve all the problems. I am upvoting it mainly for sentimental reasons (after all, it was a good pastime before the new generation of FPS games were released in 2004) but perhaps you are better off with the Gold edition of the first game.

												Unreal was great; Unreal 2 less so. The game is packed with creative and imaginative environments spoiled by mediocre gameplay and a bargain-bin story. This is a sad example of what happens when people try to continue franchises that don't neccessarily need continuation. It also suffers from a lack of replayability and multiplayer, which is part of what made the franchise great, and subsequently part of what spoils this otherwise beautiful game. If you're looking for a high quality shooter that's held up over time, look elsewhere. However, if you can ignore the 'meh' qualities, it's certainly worth a few hours of your time.Pros+ Excellent Art Design+ Beautiful VisualsCons- Shallow, Dull Story- Unbalanced Gameplay- No MultiplayerRead my full review here: http://www.keengamer.com/article/14190_unreal-2-the-awakening-review ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game brought back childhood memories, and that may have been one of the main reasons I enjoyed it. This game is excellent (as long as we forgive voice acting), adding a variety of weapons each with their own unique alternative functions. The storyline is great.There is some cons, though. Your character moves unbearably slow, and you have to use cheats in order to accelerate him to a playable speed. There is a variety of enemies you will face, but the apparent main enemy you are supposed to be fighting is the Skaarj an they are there in very few missions. The replayability of the game is low, not to mention that you may become frustrated when you completely forgot to save (there is no autosaves) and then are forced to restart the mission.Ultimately, I loved the game. It was a throwback to the days when games were original and good, and ultimately gave me a shot back at the past.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was very exited about Unreal 2, i started it right away after i finished Unreal Gold (which was good af) and it just let me down with slow pace action, weird guns that i rarely used, tryharding to get interested in the side characters, boring levels, tons and tons of loading screens, not feeling like a unreal game at all, generic shooter, the most cheap and zzzz ""plot"" (if you can call it that) and finally the playtime (UG tooke me 20+ hrs to finish it with the ""Return to Napali"" exp and this one less than 10 hrs in the highest difficulty). It was an awful experience really, there where little moments that i really enjoy but man it was a Unreal game! How could it be this bad.

												NOTE: I am extremly biased in my opinion. Being that this was my first game I ever played. And have a deep love for it.Why is it that every game MUST break new ground in gameplay? Solid gameplay is solid gameplay, why must devolopers ""reinvent the wheel"" every time they produce a game? Do we expect novelty because of the high price we pay for games? Perhaps. Or do we expect more bang for our buck from larger developers? Whatever the case, Unreal II has a fine story, the graphics are simply extraordinary, and the gameplay is certainly on par with any game deserving of a 9 out of 10. Plus, I picked up a new copy for $2.75, it's a pretty sweet game on a 6800 Ultra for that price! Think I'll quit complaining and look for some extra levels for this bad boy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been an Unreal veteran since early 2000's. From playing every single Unreal/UT game, this actually takes #1 spot as the worst in the franchise, next to UT3, and here are the problems with this game: 1. Bugs. I've had crashes happen, and oh boy how this game doesn't like newer OSes. 2. Rushed developement. Seriously, this is a huge sin in Video Game developement. 3. No multiplayer...Well there is deathmatch mode, but you have to edit some files and such to enable it. Better off to just play UT2004.4. Nobody plays it. Seriously, I can't find any decent mods to play on this, except XMP, but I doubt I would even find a good server for that. 5. Movement speed...The Doom 3 guy can run faster than John, like come on now. It was so bad, I actually have to use ""setspeed 2"" cheat to play it. Better off to just stick with Unreal Gold. It's way better and plus the modding community for that is much larger than this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game doesn't invalidate the full Unreal collection, but before buying it, I would certainly make sure that it saves you money without U2, because you should not pay money for this game. Upon starting the game, you will be walking around, get very board with the slow walking speed, then hit Shift to speed up, only to discover that your slow waddle was actually your running speed when you start barely moving foreward. The running speed is unacceptably slow. Another reviewer, Resi, provided the following advice in their review:Access console using ~Type BeMyMonkeyType setspeed 2Whether this helps the game, I don't know. Your weapons are very weak and extremely difficult to aim. The reticle often seems to have a very loose association with how your bullets wil actually fly and this cupled with the accuracy problems and slow movement makes this a VERY frustrating game to play through. START ON EASY! I learned the hard way.Your efforts are rewarded with a story that is predictable from start to finish with no subtlety or spice to make the journy worth it. You fight through generic sci-fi facilities and planets, killing generic shooter enemies (aliens with guns, humans with guns, bugs) with the Skaarj enemies that made the original so memorable rare and watered down. For comparison, the original Unreal barely had a story, but it explained what was going on on Na Pali with such subtlety that you didn't care. It could be the story of a man trying to survive, or a freedom fighter, or something in the middle based only on your interpretation. Instead, we have a muguffin hunt in space. If you have it, try the cheats above. I will. If you don't, remember, DON'T PAY EXTRA FOR THIS GAME! There are so many good shooters on Steam, you shouldn't have to waste your time with this one.

It has almost nothing at all to do with the first, and has a completely different atmosphere and feel.  Some of the enemies and environments are pretty cool, but overall the execution comes off as pretty incompetent for a developer with this much experience.  A resounding ""meh.""  While it isn't all-out terrible, there are much, much better FPS games for the money.  If you dont mind the antiquated graphics, I'd recommend the origninal much more than this one.

I found this game to be an absolute blast, from the very first scene with a large tower and a massive expanse laid out before you, to the humor found in the characters aboard your own ship.  A dialogue system that reminded me of the Wing Commander games immediately won my heart, and it was still a beauty to look at, just like it's older brother.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember playing this when I was younger, and I didn't realise how incredibly generic the entire game is. It's in that awkward period of time where FPS games followed iconic predecessors like Half Life and Quake but did very little to differentiate themselves from it. The movement is slow and clunky, the enemies move erratically, the story is bland and the graphical themes aren't much to write home about in 2003. A huge departure from the original Unreal. The weapon selection is pretty good, however some of them are plagued with slow projectiles and short ranges.Unless you're playing for nostalgia's sake, I wouldn't recommend it. Use your time playing the original or Unreal Tournament instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not Recommended! If you loved the original Unreal this is not the game for you. The environments are linear to the point of being boring. The majority of the game you fight other humans intead of aliens (I found this far less interesting). The gunplay doesn't feel satisfying but the flamethrower flames surprisingly still look good. The story is boring and muddled, only the immediate ending is remotely interesting but then its over. Having a ship and a crew should have been cool, but the developers never fully realized it. The main character's voice acting is the worst in the industry, how he continues to find work I'll never know. If you're looking for an Unreal experience, avoid this game and replay the first!

												I love unreal.Love it to death.After Quake and Doom, this was one of my first FPS experiences.And Unreal (tournament) and 2004 was my first full FPS experience.This game however, is garbage when compared to any of them.It lacks any sort of multiplayer, the character movement is not anything like other unreal games, in fact it feels like you're walking around with cement shoes when compared to any of them.The guns just don't feel right, the graphics seem bubbly and strange compared to other unreal titles.Which is odd because this was made by Epic games.Unreal is a superior single player experience, and a classic FPS single player style game.Unreal 2004 is a superior multiplayer and tournament shooter.I owned this game as a physical copy, and I don't even remember buying it on steam, it must of been part of a game pack or something.Either way, don't waste your money, and don't let epic pawn this off on you in some bundle.It is literally the worst unreal game there has been, including the console ports.

What I liked about the game	Very impressive level design, you get to visit different planets. My favourite planet (chapter) in the game was Acheron; it's not really a planet, its one big giant organism. The game has aged very well in terms of graphics and the skyboxes look amazing as well. 	A great arsenal of weapons to use, especially the last weapon you get to use which creates black holes.	The game has a hub which is the spaceship, so every time you finish a mission you go back to the spaceship. You also get to interact with the spaceship crew via dialog choices. 	 Interesting characters like Aida.	 Awesome training section. 	Smart A.I, which makes the game a challenge. What I disliked or was disappointed with 	The game had much more potential, especially with the characters, the dialog wasn't particularly good. The antagonist didn't come across as a threat and was boring. The story was almost non-existent; it felt like it was rushed. 	The boss fights were too easy. 	The levels were too short and so was the game. 	The maps had much more potential; it would have been nice if the player was able to drive vehicles, especially in the larger maps	Bugs and glitches. When using the elevator the player sometimes fell through it. Some of the enemies bugged out. There was a sound bug were the player kept repeating the word ""Jesus"". 	Some of the weapons looked a bit naff, like the sniper rifle. 	No flashlight, some areas are hard to see. ConclusionNot a bad game, but it had much more potential. I recommend you buy this game at a discount.  75/100 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game to play if you have an itch for sci-fi shooters. Not a long game, probably 6-8 hours, so definitely get it on sale. Solid all around with a few really cool and unique missions and weapons. I have a few complaints, but overall the game makes up for them.The movement speed in this game is insufferably slow (slower than Halo), and there is no sprint ability. To rememdy this, you can bring up the console with the ~ key and type in ""setspeed 2"". This will double your movement speed and make this game feel much more like the original Unreal and UT2004. You may consider this cheating, but the maps in the game are simply too big for how slowly you move. It really comes down to if you want to spend the game walking really slowly toward your next objective, or actually playing the game and enjoying the combat.My main complaint is how weapons switching works. Weapons are bound to your number keys, 1-5. But there are more than 5 weapons in the game so they decided to bind two or even three weapons to the same key, forcing you to press a key multiple times to access certain weapons. It really breaks the flow of the game and I wish they did it some other way. There is not even the option to use all 10 numbers keys. Story is so-so, but nobody plays these games for the story. The main gist is that you have to go to different planets to collect 7 ancient mysterious artifacts of power. The bad guys want them too and are trying to stop you at every turn. The crew on your ship have interesting personalities and backstories of their own which  give the game a little more personality, but it's nothing special.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some things to keep in mind.Unreal II was NOT developed by Epic. It was developed by Legend, who is now kaput.This is not really a sequel to Unreal in any way, shape or form. You can't really compare the two - in fact, if this was called ANYTHING else it would be a blessing. Sort of like Far Cry 2, in that it also has nothing to do with the first game of the series, and if anything marks a sort of spin-off point.So, Unreal II.What can I say? It's awesome, really it is, I'm still struggling with the fact that people have actually said anything except 'it's great'. I mean, back in the day, I thought it was great, and so did the critics, and now all of a sudden people are badmouthing it. Hmm.I don't think half the reviews for this game have been fair, to be honest. There's nothing technically wrong with this game, and there's plenty of fun to be had with it - the weapons are just so cool, I mean you have an unlimited inventory system, which is nice to start with, but you get a gun, that shoots spiders. SPIDERS. That's awesome no matter which way you look at it.The enemies in this game are really cool too, most humanoids will flop over into a ragdoll (which was pretty neat for the time) and you can walk over that corpse to sap some of the power left in their power-armor and add it to yours. Instead of like, dropping a medkit or something, you straight up sap whatever life was left in them. That's also awesome.The AI design is absolutely perfect, agile heavily-armored melee warrior-caste aliens will sprint up to you, dodging left and right, reflecting your bullets while shooting back at you, closing in on you and strafing at close range to dodge your attacks. Mindless trash mobs will gang up on you and straight charge into you aggressively.There is some really great level design here too. You really get a sense that the devs kind of mapped out everything in their heads... the ship itself that your character, John Dalton lives on with his crew does certainly seem like the interior matches the exterior in terms of size, shape.And the graphics? The graphics are awesome too. Not everything has as much detail as games released today, but sometimes they come pretty damn close. The lip-syncing for instance is also really good. Legend did a certain kind of thing with this game... all of the big things tend to have less detail, so that small things and character models can have much more detail.Know what else does this? Metal Gear Solid does this. If you look at a space floppy disk or whatever in Unreal II, you can actually make out all the lettering on it. Maybe not because it;s important, but the higher resolution on the smaller objects of the game help immersion greatly, because your brain can fill in all the blanks on big, less detailed textures, but it's harder when you're dealing with text. This game gets around that wonderfully.So, the character you play as in this game... in a sort of compensation for being a walking tank - a dude in power armor - you're not that fast. Not as fast as running in Unreal Tournament, but that's okay, this isn't a UT game after all. Whether you like that sort of gameplay or not, it's quite fair I think. Especially since, you really shouldn't be comparing this to Unreal or UT99. This is an Unreal Engine game, but I don't know if you should really consider it an Unreal series game.I mean, I don't really feel like I'm biased here. I don't. There's just so much passion that went into this game, so much love and dedication, and I feel like the developers really tried their hardest to make the best game they could... we might not quite have the multiplayer that we were promised, but honestly, I'm fine with that. I think Unreal II is a great game, and apparently in 2017 it's a highly underrated game.Back in the day, it wasn't just about making a quick buck. It was about making games. So I give you Unreal II. Enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's... decent. It isn't arena style combat like the UT games, but it is a bit of a mix between the original Unreal and the Tournaments. The graphics look nice for it's time, but obviously don't look great today. The guns are kind of cool, and there are a few challenging and fun to fight enemies. Really, it's just hard to say anything is majorly wrong with the game, but there isn't much they did super well. The guns are kind of cool, and if you played Oblivion, the main character's voice should sound VERY familiar. The biggest flaw with the game is probably the story, it starts off so slow I don't have any urge to play for it. The characters are neat, but I wish I could interact with them more. If you want a good old shooter to waste some time, this game won't dissapoint. If you want the next big hit arena shooter, you're going to want to pass. It's hard to describe this game at all, watch some videos of it. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
