												I didn’t really know what to expect with Diamond Dan. For whatever reason, this game always caught my eye whenever it became discounted during the big steam sales. So I finally picked it up. Lo and behold, the game isn’t terrible. It’s not even half bad. It may be one of the uglier ducklings of the bunch, but underneath a lacking appearance is a surprisingly entertaining puzzle-lite platformer.Each level is comprised of a cubic tower, itself filled with constantly shifting cubes that you must traverse to reach the bottom. You have the option of two playable characters, the first being able to move nearby blocks, whilst the other can outright destroy them at the expense of losing the ability to double-jump. While the beginning levels contain little challenge, further levels become longer, and introduce new types of traps that become increasingly difficult to avoid, both due to your own incompetence and slow transitioning speed of the screen while you transfer between the different sides of each tower.The platforming itself is tight, and it’s satisfying leaping between booby trapped walls and floors. There is no time limit to each level, and your performance in each is based on how many jewels and coins you can collect, all of which add to your end score. Activating and narrowly escaping traps goes towards earning a score multiplier, though aside from leaderboard and achievement junkies, there’s no real incentive to pursue higher scores beyond personal gratification. However, there are higher difficulties, and beating each earns you a shinier medal, so that provides some longevity for those who enjoy a challenge.I’ve actually enjoyed what I’ve played of DD. Visually, it can be pretty unappealing, especially the character models, though the in-game aesthetic looks alright, if a bit dated. One thing I am fond of is the menu; it’s all set up at a desk, with each option being one of a series of items lying on it. Your view follows your cursor, so it’s almost like you’re actually sitting at the desk, and it’s neat to see things added to it after you complete each level. It’s a nice touch, and it adds a bit of charm to the experience.Diamond Dan is surprisingly alright, given its budget price and lack of fanfare. It may be lacking visually, but the gameplay is tight and even challenging in later levels and on higher difficulties. It’s not terribly long, and can likely be beaten in several short hours, either on a lazy afternoon, or as a break between larger adventures. I wouldn’t call it a diamond in the rough, but after a few strokes from a shirt sleeve, even this jewel shows off a modest gleam.			",2355,890,81,284,269,36,336

												Diamond Dan is a puzzle platformer based more on quick reflexes than logic.  You must descend towers of ever-shifting blocks to find a map at the bottom and escape.  Sounds simple, but you can be crushed or thrown from the tower, and many of the blocks contain traps such as water or spike pits, projectiles, or enemies living inside the walls who will pull you to your death. Checkpoints are created by opening shortcuts with keys.Traps can be triggered without harming yourself, if you do it quickly, and doing so rewards you by increasing your multiplier, which adds to the value of any treasure you pick up. Your score at the end of the level is then multiplied based on the difficulty you're playing on.  Difficulty affects density of traps and how quickly the blocks shift (it can get insane) and can be changed at will for any level.You can play as Dan (pushes blocks) or Ann (shatters blocks) on any level and there are separate leaderboards for each.  Friend and global leaderboards and tons of achievements.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												Oh boy. That was quite a time ago when I've completed this game. It was fun. And you know what makes it fun? Achievements! Yeah, I stress it. Achievements make this game. No, for sure it is as fun as it seems - you dig down through the temples, you loot treasures and try not to be killed. Fast action (on later levels), good graphics (IMHO) and music. But the raisin in a pie is Achievement section. How many times should I write ""achievements"" word? :D You hunt for multipliers, you climb down without getting any block destroyed. It doesn't make sense writing all this stuff. Just try it yourself.			",1413,465,27,201,113,14,227

												A prime example of when an indie game shines in the less is more style... And for some odd reason this reminds me of Montezuma's Revenge... And the funny part is, these two games are different...Does this warrant a purchase? Most definitely... Try it you won’t be disappointed.			",197,62,4,24,1,3,11

												I've played almost 40 hours in 3 days. This game is very addictive. And I don't usually like games of this genre at all. Achievements are challenging, but achievable in the long run. Only one stupid achievement: Have three friends who have played this game. But that's not why I'm writing this review. I swear.			",112,141,0,14,15,1,11

												I realize that it is one of my favourite games on Steam. I didn't play it as much as some other games, but I think they made something timeless. I love the pace, the gameplay, the traps, the fact that every tower is randomly generated. It's the kind of game you could play anytime when you got no idea what to play else. It is very enjoyable to any kind of player I think, as there are 4 difficulty modes (easy is a strall if you just want to play it cool, normal gives you a fluid pace yet asks the player to stay alert, hard adds tension and adrenaline, and nightmare is for masochistics but stays fun despite being unfair sometimes, thanks to the checkpoints). I think what I like the most is that the gameplay is very simple (move, jump, push, use), but as the blocs of the tower are always moving and changing, the playground is modified every couple of seconds and it forces the player to be watchful. This transforms the game into something that is not only a puzzle game, but also an action/platformer game, and if everything is ruled by simple mechanics, all things piled together makes for something complex and satisfactory for the player.

												Simple yet challenging little game suitable for everyone!The game is quite repetitive but luckly aint too long, so finishing it wont take too much time!Achievements play a huge role in the game aswell as there are many tricky challenges to complete!The controls are comfortable and the visuals are pretty nice for a small game like that, getting all them achievements can be hard but after the end it feels rewarding.

												画面看上去挺傻，买了之后也一直没有动，最近开始玩上却发现游戏本身真的相当不错。游戏本身并没有多少Puzzle成分，主要考验的是反应和操控，由于最后的分数影响到成就，所以还比较讲究一命过关，因为每死一次都会扣分。坑爹的分数加倍系统就要求玩家想要得高分就一定要尽可能多的主动去触发陷阱并且不受伤害。男女主角技能不同，个人感觉女主角的技能使游戏会更容易些。总的来说游戏很值得一试的。			",434,99,17,35,23,7,45

												Nice little platform game. The girl's special ability is much more useful and some later level reminded me of Rick Dangerous (in the 'I have to remember all those traps' way), but overall it's very entertaining to play. The achievements range from starting the game for the first time to completing one of the harder level without dying or triggering any traps, which adds to the replay value.A little gem that is worth a few hours of your time.

												A interesting little game I guess, not too much to say about it as I got it with a bunch of other games for cheap. The blocks constantly move around, some are trapped and others give out gems or coins, though I've yet to find out what to use them for besides scores.I'd only recommend this if you just want a simple game with no complex story or gameplay, just something to pass the time.

												This was a fun game. Got it during a huge Steam sale, but there's a lot of content for $10. It took me about 4-5 hours to beat on medium difficulty. The game involves reaching the bottom of the cave or whatever it is while collecting treasure and avoiding different traps. You traverse square blocks that move around. Basically, it was fun to play while I had no internet. Not a great game, but if you want something different than shooting everything that moves, I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It looks like it'd be just like Spelunky, but it isn't -- it's a very different affair, but in the later levels I won't deny it gets as tought as Spelunky does. Very enjoyable game and it's in an Indie pack so it's a good deal. Buy it, you crazy peoples!			",565,260,11,121,74,5,145
