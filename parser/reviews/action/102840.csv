												Sequels are a funny thing. When a game is good-but-not-quite-great, we see the smallest solutions to itty bitty flaws, a few things that could have been spectacular given just a little more spit-shined development time. Yet those few tiny tweaks typically aren't enough to regenerate interest, never mind entertain for hours on end, when a sequel turns up. It' almost as if that game had its chance, and now we expect more, more, more.Shank 2 doesn't reinvent itself in the slightest, which is why, more than most sequels, it's difficult not to compare it to the original. Developer Klei used past criticisms to patch its pants and glue its building blocks together. It shuffles its pieces around, finds better places for them to fit, and defies the idea that overhauling a flawed experience is absolutely necessary.The result is, of course, a better 2D brawler, the kind most wished it would have been the first time around -- and it'll absolutely turn your Shank crank again.Shank 2 addresses flaws Klei is acutely aware of, so it practically shouts about how much better it is now than it used to be. Main character Shank dodges with an effortless flick of the right stick, which is a massive step up from the clunky trigger/stick combo from the first game.Attacking and healing aren't tied to the same button as they were previously. Where the animation system used to inhibit Shank, it now enables him: He moves faster, pounces farther and higher, and can switch between weapons mid-combo without a split-second delay signing his death certificate. In addition, exclamation marks above enemies' heads act as an instant-death counter-kill indicator, which is massively helpful for plucking particularly troublesome guys from a group. Also, disarming and executing dudes is quick enough not to break your rhythm, but slow enough to glorify the grossness of kicking a baseball bat down someone's throat. Uninterrupted murder is a beautiful blend of graceful fluidity and harsh ferocity, and few melee-centric action games achieve this kind of big-combo bliss.The combat is improved for more than basic input reasons, too. Enemies attack in different ways from various places -- dudes chuck grenades from across the screen, careful shooters take precise pistol aim from above, and maniacal machine-gunners fire bursts in your general direction. Instant-kill pits make short work of bad guys (and you) too, and throwing switches to crush five guys beneath a shipping container is sickening fun. Each encounter is an unpredictable puzzle where evasion, aggression, and an impressive array of acrobatics earn you a personal accomplishment greater than any leaderboard high score.Juggling and switching from your quick-attack shanks to a heavy sledgehammer to the shotgun aren't just cool-looking tactics -- they're completely necessary to surviving. By comparison, the first game is slow, unsatisfying, and cumbersome. (Really, you can never go back.) Shank 2 is demanding, and in a 2D action game so reliant on player precision, these simple tweaks make your life a hell of a lot easier.Even the most difficult problems in Shank 2 have easy solutions. More importantly, its harshest conditions can't come close to the maddening challenge of its predecessor. This is perhaps the best step forward -- the first Shank had some ridiculously difficult spots. In Shank 2, you'll only bash your head against the occasional brick wall as long as you let it stand. When shotgun blasts or the scythe aren't doing enough damage to certain characters, swapping to the revolver or chainsaw is usually enough to take 'em down. Main character Shank no longer switches weapons on the fly during a level, though, and must instead trade gear between deaths. It's small inconvenience, but knowing weapon properties -- bonus damage against fat enemies or a knock-back effect, for instance -- and changing your strategy accordingly is the key to powering through tougher sections. Boss battles are a particularly great example of these and the rest of Shank's greatest design elements coming together. As bosses are meant to be, they're the final exam for everything you've learned along the way -- if you didn't pick up on and make use of something new and important, you're going to have a tough time with their interesting patterns and brutal attacks.Co-op would have made the campaign a cakewalk, which is perhaps the reason it's single-player only this time around. Shank 2 trades the first title's local cooperative campaign for wave-based online multiplayer. It's both a trade-up and a trade-down. Clobbering coordinated bombers before they blow up supply caches for 30 waves involves all the single-player's best Shank-isms -- two players use the terrific combat, mount weapons, and set off traps to eviscerate and burn bad guys -- and requires serious skill. Dying doubles your ally's duties, plus they're responsible for reviving you, so bring a coordinated comrade or suffer the consequences.Earning cash for kills to buy mini-guns, turrets, decoys, and, uh, a wild boar gives you a reason to seek out incoming enemies as well, rather than just let your buddy take care of the worst situations. There's an alluring draw to replaying the three maps with new characters, too -- each has his or her own statistics, like health bonuses, item discounts, or damage modifiers, and each match plays out differently based on how you experiment with various pairs. Survival Mode feels thrown in out of obligation rather than inspiration, yet it still brings enough new to the table that it'll melt away an hour in an instant.Survival Mode is probably where most will spend the majority of their time -- Shank 2 is only a couple hours long, and there's little incentive to replay the campaign. Granted, the single-player is flashy, gorgeous, and where the coolest stuff happens, like escaping giant boulders and buzz-saws, fighting through a burning village, or exploring a massive boat with a bunch of diverging paths. Survival Mode is missing distinctive qualities to call its own, so it exists if you feel shortchanged but is inessential if you'd rather move onto the next great game in your library.If there's one major change in Shank 2, it's the tone. Thematically, Shank was absurd. The game was dark and violent, which didn't quite fit in with the Luchadores, strippers, guys in gimp masks occupying each arena. Shank 2 is about martial law, facist oppression, and endangered family. It doesn't do anything to capitalize on this stuff, which is a shame -- the cinematics are still goofy, profane, and senseless, and some of the bosses are a bit out of left field, visually. The grim approach a nice touch to the gameplay, anyway, and fits into the grand scheme of making Shank 2 feel much more in line with itself.			",1078,456,28,115,149,13,174

												Shank 2 is a cheap game in every way, its hard, and occasionaly unfair. Its hard for me to recommend it. But still, I cant be unfair just because I've lost my nerves playing it. When you make it work it offers decent fun, interesting cartoon-network-like design, and some nice music.Before you start, however, you better be playing this on the controller. Don't you even dare to play this on the mouse and keyboard, because you'll be cursing the day when you were born. I had to because my controller was working in one part of the day, and stopped in another (I dont have problems with other games). With the mouse and keyboard you are controlling your movement on the keyboard (also throwing grenades/molotovs/knives), and attacking with the mouse. The problem is that your character is following mouse cursor, so he attacks and shoots in the way where the pointer is, and if you don't pay attention you will swing/shoot/throw grenade in the wrong direction.Another problem with controlls is that they are going nuts in co-op mode after you call-in menu window on ""esc"" and close it, or Steam overlay on ""shift+tab"". Your character is dodging instead of moving (or even completelly stopping), using heavy instead of light attacks,... The only way to fix this is to press ""esc"" again and then close menu window.Boss battles are epic, especially the last two, that is - if you know how to dance... Just as with all other bosses in the game early fight is relatively easy. When their health comes near the first half you are getting an opportunity to perform some special attack that trigers a cutscene. Afterwards 5#!t hits the fan; since they are considerably larger than your character you can be damn sure they are going to exploit that in every possible way: they are going to grab you and squeeze like a lemon, throw you around like a rock, burn you, slice you in pieces, call their minions to help them, and generaly just make your life as miserable as they can.By accomplishing certain tasks in the game you will unlock other characters with their own bonuses, and you can also use them in the co-op survival mode. You can play it alone or with the friend, and you have to survive 30 waves of enemies. With their elimination you are getting gold which you can spend in the shop (items are unlocking progressively), on healing, decoys, turrets, all of those will come in handy vs bosses (and zombies too).I also have to say that playing hard mode of this game (no checkpoints in levels, once you die you have to start all over again) reminded me on the past when I have played, as a kid, NES games and throwed my controllers in anger....

Shank 2 is a 2D side-scrolling action beat 'em up published by the hated Electronic Arts.The developers, however, are known for making great games such as ""Mark of The Ninja"" and ""Don't Starve"". You play as Shank. No, You do not play as a knife. (Shank - Prison slang for a homemade knife) Shank is the name of our fearless protagonist.As Shank you can unlock and use various weapons that fall into two categories: Melee and ranged.You can dual-wield pistols, blast multiple enemies with a shotgun or strike fear into the hearts of your enemies with a chainsaw.There are also sections where you get your hands on a minigun and oh god is it fun to just let it rip and watch the massacre take place in front of your very eyes.Shank is relentless and knows no mercy.You can rack up combo-chains by launching your enemies into the air, shooting them and just being creative by using your surrounding enviroment such as holes for an example.You can also pick up explosives such as grenades and molotov cocktails. The gameplay is faster and more responsive than in the previous title making Shank 2 a bit more enjoyable. The only thing bad about the game and what also makes it worse than the previous title is that there is no co-op campaign anymore. Instead of that we get a new two-player survival mode tho. The survival mode can be played and beat playing solo as well. Survival mode offers various challenges and unlockable skins that you can use in both modes: campaign and survival.To be fair then co-op would have made the campaign a bit too easy in this title so it's hardly a con but it's still less content for us since, well, co-op is still optional. I've played through the campaign 1.5 times but i would play through it again if it would have co-op in it.The gameplay is followed by epic music and cool cartoon/comic styled cutscenes that suit the gameplay well and really add to the overall atmosphere of the game.Let's narrow it down, shall we?Pros:+Fast, smooth and brutal gameplay+Just the right amount of gore in both gameplay and cutscenes+Awesome music that fits the game perfectly at all times+Well done voice acting and animations+Unlockables that keep you playing the game +A whole new mode: SurvivalCons:-No co-op campaignOverall Shank 2 is an improvement9/10 - Shank 2 is a must have for every beat 'em up and/or side-scrolling fan.

												I very much enjoyed Shank and was really looking forward to playing Shank 2. I was very much disappointed.What I liked* The help system. It's location specific, it can give you hints if you die in some particular location or in a boss fight. During the game play there are some tips how to perform combos. Very nice.* Usable objects in the scene.* Throwing people around for crowd control.What went wrongLet's talk gameplay:* Some new moves compared to Shank 1. Too many moves. The game is fast, you will have problems to remember all of that in the heat of the moment.* Blocking is gone, dodging is now on the *second* thumbstick. You need to shuffle your hands constantly. Insane.* Enemies no longer wait if you grab someone. It's more realistic, but it's definitely less fun. It's much harder to do spectacle killing now, making the game less enjoyable.* The fighting system is now based on counter attacks. A nice idea, but unusable when there are multiple enemies nearby, because during your counter-attack animation the other enemies are slashing you down. Suboptimal.* The Shank character is now smaller in most of the screen, making it harder to see what you or your enemies are doing and performing combos correctly.* The story... in Shank 1, it was simple, but it matched the theme. In Shank 2, it's total nonsense.* There are several completely different environments. That sounds nice in theory, but they seem to be arbitrarily chosen without any connection. Some of those environments are so special effects heavy, that you'll have problems to see just about anything important on the screen.* The game is freaking hard. Much harder than Shank 1, and we're talking about normal (the lowest) difficulty here. Health potions are almost non-existent. After you kill a whole screen of enemies and you're almost dead, you'd expect a treat in the form of a health potion for your effort. Instead, you'll get a second whole screen of enemies. And then third. And after that maybe a very small health potion.* If you die, you respawn a screen or two back, which is OK. But in this game, you die a lot. And it breaks the immersion. If I received a health potion, I would still have the feeling that it's me who's fighting there in the game, and I'm really trying hard to survive. Instead, the game decides not to give you any health potions, overload you with enemies, kill you, and then respawn you a screen back with full health. Similar effect? Not at all. The more you die, the more you not care about what's happening on the screen, because there's no motivation. You'll respawn anyway, so what.* The boss fights are weird. On one hand, you don't need to rely on grabbing the opponents in the right moment anymore, because you cause a decent damage to them even with your regular weapons. That's fine. On the other hand, the most effective strategy is usually roll under their attacks and shoot them from afar, over and over and over again, until the boss is dead. Which is boring and tiring.And also some technical aspects:* The configured the gamepad buttons in an insane way, half of the buttons were on a completely different place than it was supposed to me. (Shank 1 was completely OK)* There are bugs in the gamepad configure screen and it's practically impossible to reconfigure it, if you don't search the webs on how to workaround the problems.* The game performance is considerably worse than in Shank 1.

												Shank 2 stays safely in the bounds of a typical side-scrolling action title. It never takes any chances but delivers an overall solid beat ‘em up. Inconsistent difficulty, nonexistent story and a lack of gameplay variety hold Shank 2 back, but those looking for a better playing experience from Shank’s last outing might want to give the sequel a try.

												Pros* Great gameplay, tight controls.* Tons of enemy and weapon variety.* Really satisfying combat, very meaty, natural and robust.* Really hard, start in normal difficulty.Cons* Checkpoints are few and far between, it's very frustrating to have to replay the last 20 minutes because you died near the end of the level. Sometimes the only checkpoint in a level is just before you get to the boss.* The game is cruel, if you die it gimps you by removing two ammo from your explosive weapons (you have three in total). It sucks because it often means you have to kill the boss without the often much needed help from grenades/mines/molotov, especially in hard mode.			",91,17,2,8,6,0,9

												Shank was one of the best games I've ever played. The combat was intense, the controls were fluid like water, the music pumped your adrenaline and even the storyline was engaging. Everything about it was amazing. Shank 2, on the other hand, is a shining example of exactly what you should not do with a sequel. It was as though they took everything that made the first one great and said, ""let's do the opposite of that!"" The combat is frustrating, the controls are different and clusmy, the music is repetative and the storyline ranges from cliche to cheeky to downright bizarre. They even changed Shank's voice! He sounds like a putz now. I don't understand how a developer can ♥♥♥♥ up their own game so thoroughly.			",375,36,0,23,9,4,37

 “When you're pushed, killing is as easy as breathing.” Shank 2 represents a solid 2-D brawler game with good fighting animations, mixing the grittiness of graphic novels with a cartoonish look. Compared with its predecessor the combat feels more fluid, and the difficulty has been increased. Especially the boss battles and co-op levels are more challenging.On the other hand, the storytelling in Shank 2 is rather weak. It remains questionable why the developers did not continue the entertaining storyline from the first instalment.

												Alright so you can definitely tell that this developer has matured since Shank 1. The animations are more fluid, the music and gameplay are better. I think its about the same length as the first game. It's also slightly harder.The enemies and situations are more varied, requiring different styles and moves to finish each level. The boss battles are also more varied and nicer to play. One problem I have is that the story doesnt seem to connect at all to the first one, I dont even know what the hell is happening between both games. Oh well whatever.Overall I think its a great game. Especially with the addition of the survival mode, that adds extra replay value. This can also be played local or online.			",1229,376,57,122,119,15,131

												Shank 2 is one of those games that seems to think the best way to make a sequel sell is to take everything that made the original great and throw it out the window. The boss fights are awful, the weapons aren't nearly as fun to use, the enemies aren't as fun to fight- but really, the worst thing is the controls.Original shank: move, weapon, weapon, weapon, jump, block.Shank 2: those, plus dodge roll, sprint, and counter.Shank 2 seems to think that for a good sequel, you need to add a bunch of gimmicky crap.All a sequel needs is a fresh coat of paint. Exhibit A: Portal 2.I think the best way to put it is this:It's rather liked getting bopped on the head once ($9.99), given five cookies (Shank,) then bopped on the head again ($9.99), and promptly kicked in the shins (Shank 2.)Don't get kicked in the shins.Keep your ten dollars.Go buy Subway sandwiches for yourself and a friend.It's valid sustenance, you'll develop social skills, and you won't repeatedly pound your head against a terrible for a bad decision. Assuming you don't add mayonnaise.Shank 2's Final Score: 5.75/10Letter Grade: FVerdict: Worse than mayonnaise.Mayonnaise's Final score: 6.0/10Letter Grade: D-Verdict: At least some people like mayonnaise.

												Shank 2 is not a thing to remember for long, but the things it brings are undoubtedly bloody, crazy, weird and, best of all, entertaining like the first game. Although it's a slightly crippled remake of Shank, it's still good, but the gameplay just seems icky when compared to its superior predecessor.

												You ever seen a film you thought was really special and then the sequel comes along wanting to be bigger and better, and completely loses all the charm of the original? That's this, unfortunately. I wanted to like this game more. I really did. And let me be clear; this is not a terrible game by any means, and if you enjoy beat-em ups, you'll probably enjoy this. That said, if you loved Shank 1, this is a sequel that pales in comparison to its predecessor, to the point that I can't recommend it. What's Improved-Visuals are great, with some improvements over the previous edition.-The addition of interactable scenery and weapons are a nice touch that add a fair amount to the game.-No apparent censorship in the steam edition requiring tinkering on the player's end to restore the content like in the first game.-The one button input for picking up healing items is generally easier and less finnicky.- Decent enemy variety.- Collectibles offer an element of exploration now, though the rest of the game's design hinders this.What's Not Improved/What's Questionable-The dodge mechanic is now mapped to the right joystick, which requires some rather awkward hand positioning at times relative to the original Shank. I found it less intuitive and clunkier overall, though your mileage may vary.-In some ways the level design flaws of the previous game are even more apparent here. Sometimes lethality won't be apparent to you beforehand, which can be aggravating given the new consequences for death (loss of grenades and picked up weapons).  There's less wall climbing/running, so you won't be getting as much of that parkour/Prince of Persia feel.  Scene transitions are absolutely the enemy, and it encourages a sort of trepidation that runs counter to the pacing the game wants.  It's impossible to tell when the game will arbitrarily prevent you from going backward, thereby cutting you off from healing items and the newly-added point orbs and collectibles.  Further, the yellow point orbs will frequently drift offscreen while you are locked on a combat screen, and given that they fade away in a few seconds, will ultimately be lost through no fault of the player.  Also, more than once for me, cutscenes triggered near healing items, causing them to be missed due to forced scene changes.-Aiming projectiles is still frustratingly inexact sometimes.-While the scenery weapons offer some nice variety, the overall selection of standard weaponry in the campaign is smaller now, and the Loadout System prevents you from fluidly switching between weapons on the fly as you could in the first game.-Checkpoints are far fewer and do not persist between sessions. Got frustrated on a boss and quit? Be ready to do the whole level over.-Explosives now cap at three, and every time you die (be it your fault or poor level design -- rest assured both will happen), you lose some automatically. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it may be offputting for fans of the original.- Bosses, in addition to lacking the character of their predecessors, aren't as puzzle-oriented as they were in the previous game. They're not bad for what they are, but now they feel like bosses in every other game.-Story and presentation probably suffer the most. Yes, the visuals are nice, but gone is the grindhouse/kung fu revenge flick vibe in favor of a more scattershot presentation. Shank 1 felt unique. Sadly, this does not. There's no overall solid theme or feel this time. Whereas the previous story was a simple but well told revenge flick which revealed more as you went (moreso before the developers came back and cut content, causing plot holes) with clear and familiar film archetypes, what we have now is a weird Rambo-inspired mess where you will have literally no idea who any of these characters are, why you should care, or what's going on unless you read the bios in the main menu. It's the sort of tell-don't-show thing you'll find a dozens of other games.   The story in the previous game added quite a bit to the experience and, despite being simple, was tighter and better told than in most games, but that restraint is gone now. Here, the story in this game does absolutely nothing and gives you no reason for investment. If that seems like a weird nitpick for a beat-em-up, know that I only mention it because Shank 1 did it so well. In keeping with this loss of uniqueness, Shank's new voice, while perfectly servicable, now sounds like every other growly video game protagonist, something which, given the character's lack of motivation this time, doesn't help things.To conclude, this game, while not terrible by any means despite the above, is sadly a quintessential example of a sequel that, in trying to be bigger and better, loses a lot of the charm of the original and winds up taking a few steps backward.

												Do you wanna gut your way through a variety of foes continuously with your shank until they drop to the floor?Or Would you prefer to juggle them in the air with your machete?No?...Well then how about shredding them to bits with your chainsaw?Still not satisfied? Ok, lets throw a handgun or two into the mix?Nawww...What you really want is a shotgun, right?And maybe a grenade to go with your molotove cocktail?If you still aint smiling at the thought of all this, well, then...you my friend dont know what a REAL game is...Shank 2 is an awesomely fun, yet challenging game; a veritable mesh of some of the more old-school platforming experiences mixed with the new. And if the campaign aint enough for you, and you have a friend that has some free time, then crank up the Survival mode and try and protect yo stash together against countless waves of enemies...and uh...zombies from time to time. Watch as you quickly lose track of time being sucked in by the thrill and enjoyment :DOh...and I forgot to mention that there is also a female character, complete with her own set of weapons and arsenal too?Yeah, thats right, and she's hawt...so go and spend that $9.99 you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Cause there aint many games out there that deliver the same punch as this one for such a low price. Peace :D ",179,14,0,23,8,0,38

												Shank 2 is a pretty gruesome and awesome 2D side scrolling hack and slash beat 'em up action adventure game.At first it felt pretty basic gameplay with your weapons as a pair of shanks,a gun and a heavy weapon which were sometimes overpowering in normal mode,but in hard difficulty the enemies were smart and thier was a large variety of them.A good indie game but the best and most enjoyable part of the game was it's survival mode!You are gonna absolutely enjoy it with a buddy and it is quite challenging.Just make sure you get a partner for survival because their is no proper matchmaking.

												Like the sequel Shank 2 is a cheesy 2D platformer & beat'em up game that plays in Mexico. It has it's own graphic style. There's a little bit gore and brutal scenes especially on the boss kills. You start with 3 different weapon classes, melee = chainsaw (yeah!) double pistols (akimbo style, you can fly during shooting in the air because of recoil wtf?) and 2 daggers to pounce on enemies. Somehow the movements and controls are a little bit clunky. There are still lags even on high end systems.They added lately some MP gamemode Survival which means you have to survive in a certain map with applicable traps & buy equipment mode 30 waves. There are even zombie waves. Strangely if you play over internet it gets at some point dissynchronized. So if you are protecting your armory piles some Goonies can blastup another one than on your teammate map. That's unacceptable and makes it either incredible hard to survive 30 waves.Good is that you can unlock many new charcters. My favourite is Sunshine dressed like the girl from KillBill with a longsword and desert eagles. The main game suffers from repetive enemies and a quite flat boring story.Though you can do some counterattacks the gameplay hasn't really changed. The hard mode still exists. So you can play story mode at least twice ...			",1640,665,58,135,164,17,216

												Don't expect a deep plot. This time Shank guides you through eight episodes of brainless action: no effort in enhancing the game experience, the controls are good only if played with a controller.The violence level is so off-the-charts to the point it will put a smile on your face...As long as you don't fall asleep while playing.A survival mode - with an offline/online two player option - is the only thing added from the previous title, it's also easier in comparison to the original Shank.In short: it's a brief and dull game. Play it only if a crazy amount of gore, beefy guys and explosions doesn't grind your gears (the cutscenes are somewhat enjoyable).Machete anyone?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it is immediately noticeable that Shank 2 ups the ante in every which way.  It is more fast-paced than its predecessor, it is more violent - once again the bosses get the goriest executions. Gameplay-wise not much has changed - perhaps now there's more emphasis on countering enemy moves (a small, red exclamation mark indicates an incoming attack). Also, I decided to keep the sledgehammer and bid farewell to the chainsaw.We can now throw molotov cocktails and use mines as traps. One particular thing I liked is the way the game wants us to use the environment against enemies. Cars can be dropped in the garage, hanging sharks can be used to slap enemies at the docks and there are several places where machines can be turned on to lay waste to the oncoming hordes of the militia.Oh, the militia: don't expect a great story here, either. Shank just wants to go home but after the fall of Cesar a so-called General Magnus took control with the use of his soldiers. Since Shank's mentor is captured by the enemy, once again he becomes enraged and we can see his revenge story through just like we did the last time.Although there are fewer levels than in its predecessor these look more varied and the drawing is excellent just as it was the last time. I particularly like those scenes where the foreground is deliberately barely lit so we only see the shadows / silhouettes of Shank and his enemies. Levels end in boss battles and as always they are pretty challenging. At one point we control Corina, Shank's aid, who seems to be faster, more acrobatic, but weaker. Also, her scythe has a better range than Shank's chainsaw.Shank 2 continues to be a very good side-scroller, brawler game. There's a greater variety of enemies and with countering / evading there's more maneuverability here. The camera now shows a smaller Shank - this more zoomed-out approach helps with the flow of the combat and makes this action-packed game heaps of fun.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Shank 2 delightfully polishes the mechanics featured in the original Shank faithfully, but suffers from poor anti-frustration features.Checkpoints are within acceptable range in easy mode, but are incredibly scarce in hard mode. This may feel like a step-up from the original Shank, which has absolutely no checkpoints in its own hard mode, but the enemy toughness and firepower have been massively beefed up to compensate, which will make you doubt your sanity, time and time again in the same impassible first half of the level.This also means that no matter how well you do just before triggering the next checkpoint, a single poorly timed jump into a fire or into a stun-locking mob of giants will send you way back where you all started, with little room for error and health points few and far between. If you're lucky, you may find yourself at the mercy of a couple bandits brandishing automatic rifles, spraying dozens of bullets to distract you from that mob surrounding you that has already drained half your health.Oh, the bosses. How will I begin?As if the levels weren't hard enough, the boss fights are fully integrated into the levels themselves, at the very end. Which means if you exit the level to take a well deserved break at the brink of the boss fight, you can doubt your sanity once again by having to complete the level all over again!Much has to be to said about the insanely reliable health draining moves the bosses are eager to spam, but this is not the time to tell spoilers, it may be best to let everybody to learn it the hard way.But in spite of all these, there's plenty of fun to be found in the game's built-in ""survival"" mode. Given the game's modest playerbase however, you may struggle to find anybody playing it at any given time. Though, the option to play the mode alone is available, at the dire cost of being alone, as the game doesn't make up for the absence of another player.The unlockable playable characters are a nice fit, though I have yet to snatch exactly all of them, as one is reserved for those who (surprise!) survive the survival mode. Wish me luck.As mentioned way before, the game mechanics are true and faithful to the original title, with new moves and gimmicks to  spice up the gameplay.As far as recommending (or not) the game is concerned, this has been a tough one. While it is rife with frustrating features and merciless mobs, it has a pretty good survival game mode to make up for it, and with sheer determination and will, the levels... Can certainly be overcome.This has been brought to you by Commissar Maverick. And until next time, farewell.			",25,1,1,0,1,0,7

												Interestingly enough, I ended up picking up Shank 2 before the original. Don't ask why, I honestly don't remember other than it was somewhat of an impulse buy as I loved the demo. If you've played the original Shank, you know what you're getting into. If you haven't, Shank is a grind house style 2D action game where you shoot, slash, and sometimes shank your way through waves of enemies. The artwork is all 2D in a hand drawn style and looks beautiful. Excellent character animations (especially death animations) really bring the game to life. While the original Shank was relatively bare bones in terms of level presentation Shank 2 has a lot going on in these levels. It's not exactly Rayman Origins but it does look pretty great.In terms of game play this is a huge step up from the original. There is a much better counter system, the grab system is a little more robust, and the game actually encourages you to try different weapons as there are far more enemy types in this game compared to the original. In the original, I made it through the entire game using the starter weapons, which is not how Shank 2 plays. Shank 2's levels are longer, more challenging, and require you to really think about your load out before each mission as you can't change on the fly like in the original Shank. Whereas in the original Shank the game was divided into bite sized levels (which helps a ton when attempting hard mode by the way), Shank 2's levels are fuller, longer, and always feature a boss battle at the end. While most bosses are actually quite more challenging than the original Shank there are a few that are pretty cheap and winning takes more luck than skill. Fortunately, once you get to a boss you have a checkpoint (even on hard mode) so you really get a chance to learn what you are doing wrong and how to overcome the enemy.As far as controls go, however, I can't recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. I never even attempted it but as with most 2D, side scrolling games a controller is almost necessary for success. Fortunately, if you have a controller, the game controls beautifully. Actions are very responsive which helps when dealing with swarms.In addition to the main story mode (which has two difficulties that don't stack with achievements) there is an online co-op survival mode. This is a welcome addition as the original Shank only had local co-op (which was fun, if a bit easy). This mode, however, is VERY difficult. There are a number of different stages and you are dealing with almost every type of enemy in the game. It takes practice, but with another player it's doable. Regarding achievements there are far more than the first Shank (almost twice as many). Most of these are kill grinds with different weapons or level specific actions in addition to difficulty modes as well. The survival mode achievements are tough, but definitely possible if you have someone else. Trying it solo is not recommended.Although I hadn't played the original Shank until after the sequel I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The visual style is amazing, the game play is fun and challenging, and even the soundtrack is pretty great. I would highly recommend playing the original Shank (even if it is an inferior game overall) as it will get you used to the play style. Even though it's not as good as the sequel it's still definitely worth playing and if you have a friend and two controllers, you can do the co-op campaign which is short and easy but still fun with two people).I highly recommend Shank 2 to any action fans out there. The action is fast, fun, and extremely violent. There are a wide variety of enemies to fight (most requiring different strategies or weapon load outs) and some great boss battles.8.5/10			",130,11,3,10,1,0,13

												I want to recommend this game I really do, however the controls are awful, range of motion is cardinal directional and the responsivness of said awful controls is even worse. I don't mind that fact that it's tough hell I like tough games, when it's the game that's challenging. I don't like a moderately challenging game that is made hard by it's horrific controls. The original Shank was great, the controls were all there and made sense. This one however... using the thumbstick to dodge, why? OK they removed block that's ok with me, but that block button was how you initiated a dodge, so now they muddied up the game play by forcing you to have to pretty much play with your right thumb over the stick to dodge at a moments notice, which 90% of the time will fail horribly or not even respond. I will still give a pro and con list so you might use this review to help you out.Pros:-The animation in this is much nicer and smoother-Same violent slash fest as the first one-Editable load out pre-mission/player's death (there will be deaths)Cons:-Responsivness? What's that? -Lacks intuitive controls.-After the time I spent it still feels like I'm playing the same stage.-360 degree world? No we only have North South East and West in this world thank you very much!As for KLEI check out their other games, they really are a great company, I loved the original Shank, and Mark of the Ninja was superb. I haven't played Don't Starve, but that looks pretty interesting as well. They also have another game in the works, just look them up I don't work for their advertising department so I'll leave that to them to give other details. So in short I don't recommend this game, but honestly if you loved the first one still give it a shot, the controls might not bother you as much as they did me. I only wrote this to give people and idea of what to expect. If worse comes to worse; download the demo. Take Care.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is in a lot of ways better than Shank 1. There are a lot less ""cheap"" deaths, although a lot of the enemies themselves pull some pretty cheap/unblockable moves. The result is that most deaths in this game feel a lot more justified than in Shank 1. The original game's controls were dumb enough - it required 12 buttons to perform all actions, completely ridiculous for a fighting game with such a shallow combat system. This one is even worse, with 14 buttons required. They added a dedicated ""pick up/use"" button, and added 2 (!) dodge buttons. These add absolutely nothing to the gameplay, but make it so that you have to map a couple controls to the right analog stick... really really stupid. Do you want your dodges to require you to move your thumb from attack/jump controls? Probably not.They mostly got rid of the QTE type boss fights from Shank 1. Boss fights in this one involve shooting your guns A LOT, maybe 300-500 hits kills a boss. They feel more like Mega Man bossfights than fighting game boss fights. When EVERY boss gets to half health, you can grapple to trigger a short cinematic.Presentation wise, this game is quite a few notches below Shank 1. What little story there was there is pretty much eliminated here. Cutscenes are quite poor quality, and some of them look like they were hand drawn, scanned to 720p and then stretched poorly to 1920x1200. The game takes place in south or central america, but all voice actors sound like they're white game developers from Seattle. The drop in quality makes me think the budget for this must have been a step down from Shank 1.Due to less cheap deaths, I'd say this game is better than Shank 1 by a hair, but still pretty poor. The controls are stupid and overly complicated for such a simple game, the combat system is still pretty much button mash with the occasional jump out of the way, and the presentation is almost non-existent.I WILL recommend Mark of the Ninja, don't be scared off of it because of this, but by the same token, don't by Shank thinking it'll be the same quality as MotN.

												This game is great. You run around, brutally dismembering the minions of the end boss, Magnus, through the use of your shanks, your heavy weapons (machetes, chainsaw, and sledge), ranged weapons (throwing knives, shotgun, and dual handguns), and explosives (grenades, molotovs, and landmines). The combat itself, regardless of weapon, is also immersive.Also, you will die. A LOT.In addition to the campaign, there's a survival mode where you need to work alone or with a partner to survive 30 waves of enemies by both not dying (a quite obvious aspect) and protecting three points on a small map from bombers, who put timed explosives on these points. There are many characters to unlock, including Shank's outfit from the first game.This is an excellent game for those who like side-scrolling games.			",160,11,0,8,6,3,13

												Shank 2 is a game I managed to play alittle bit while it was on free weekend, an I have got to say its pretty enjoyable. The Shank games are a blend of hack and slash, platformer and arcade beat'em up. You fight trough the story with a variety of weapons trying to chain together the longest combo you can. Shank 2 has more weapons and tools to use in combat than the first game including things like pipes, baseball bats, mines and even Molotov cocktails. The gameplay itself is pretty much the same as Shank, but everything feels far more refined and the combat ""works"" better. Overall I wish I could have put more details in my review, but I only got to play Shank 2 around 2 hours before the free weekend was up. I would recommend it to sidescroller, beat'em up, or hack and slash fans based on what I did manage to play.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												This is a fun game as well, finished the 1st game a couple of days ago, gotta say this sequal adds for the Combat and follows the story, it plays well with a gamepad, used a X360 controller, also works with a K&M, but you might not be comfortable K&M.I found no matchs online, its ok, asI played it a while back, and it was fun. If you have a friend to play the game with, i suggest you play MP. It supports both local and online MP.  So you can play MP localy with K&M + Controller.			",98,12,0,7,6,0,27

												Pretty much the same game as the first with different weapons. The story, like the first, is rather dull and doesn't really make you care about any of the characters. On the plus side they varied the enemies up a bit more and the stages are more creative. Co-op is a nice addition but doesn't add enough to make me care.Pros:- Gorgeous Graphics with very appropriate hit boxes for the most part- Variety of characters and weaponsCons:- SAME GAME! Seriously, it's the same game. If you didn't absolutely 100% LOVE the first one, don't get this.- Boring Story- No reason to use anything other than the chainsaw and knives (other weapons don't have alternative benefits)			",444,93,7,66,59,3,55

												It's a nice throwback to old-school brawler games, with great looking cartoon graphics. Unfortunately the gameplay gets repetitive fast, and the difficulty is not designed well, random points in levels will get extremely hard, with the rest being relatively easy, even the boss difficulty varies. Gets old fast when you have to retry certain areas a few times. It might just be me, but I play simple cheap games like this to kick back and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ not for a ""challenge"" because I'm a ""hardcore gamer"".			",148,62,6,8,10,1,24

												Shank 2 is 10X better than the original Shank. With improved gameplay and proper PC controls I can recommend Shank 2, unlike the first one. This game is just as short as the original clocking in ~3 hours, however there is an added survival mode to add some replayability. Most of the game is pretty mindless bashing and shooting up enemies where you actually feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ however there are couple of frustrating parts. Hint: There's a part when a rocket launcher shoots at you, you can shoot down the rockets, and when you fight a certain doctor use the shotgun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's very similar to Shank 1 except that they added new mechanics in the combat gameplay.The only thing con about this game is that it's short.

												A great sequel to the first Shank installment, which is also pretty good.I love the visual style and the animations in this game, its definitely one of most entertaining platformers i've played. The length of the game is also good, controls are solid and easy to learn.Survival mode can be really fun, too bad i could not find anyone to play online. I should have played this back when it was released, but oh well. :/The only thing this game lacks is online and local co-op for the Campaign, which could have been a great addition to the game, but still. I highly recommend both games if you still haven't played it.The first Shank did have local co-op, i don't know why they removed it.Also, try Mark Of The Ninja, another epic platformer from the same creatorsScore: 8,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shank 2 is a great sequel and in my opinion, better than the first game in basically every way. The visuals are definitely an improvement over the first game, and one of the very first things I noticed was the larger variety in locations you visited. The first game suffered a bit from repetitive areas that didn't change very much, but in 2 you're always fighting in a different area from level to level which is a nice addition. Another improvement is the weapon variety. You still have the signature weapons Shank uses in the first game, but there is a lot more to choose from this time around, and also you're able to pick up quite a few weapons that the enemies drop for a limited amount of uses until they break and they usually do fairly good damage. You can also change weapon loadouts in the middle of playing which is extremely useful, especially when you're on a boss fight and you don't have the optimal weapons equipped to do the most amount of damage.Everything else in the game is quite similar with not much change. There are quite a few boss fights which are all fun and some are fairly challenging, especially when other enemies come out to join the fight. My only complaint of the game would probably be the length. It seems to be shorter than the first game, but it could be because I didn't die as often as I did in the first game. It's an action packed few hours, but it's a minor gripe. I didn't get to the play the multiplayer section of the game, but it would definitely add more replay value to make up for the shorter single player campaign.Overall, definitely worth the money if you're into the genre.

												For ""previously, on Shank"" check my ""review"" of Shank. I must say I was abit afraid of what would come from the second one of the franchise but I enjoyed it alot more than the first one. There's collectibles that provide background story about severall characters and some achievements that upon completing grant you new characters to play, there's also 1 or 2 missions in the campaign that let you play as other character other than Shank. There's alot more of combo and attack variety in this one and there's also a bunch of weapons that you can pick along with some throwables like tires and boxes, not to mention that if you didn't enjoyed using grenades in the first one, now you can use either molotovs or land mines. The story is a bit meh if you ask me, but you'll have to go and play it yourself if you want to know more about it. If you enjoy some co-op fun there's also the online survival mode in which you can play with a friend, it's a standard wave based mode but you also have to protect some objectives and eventually there's a shop between waves in which you can buy turrets, alcohol (which works as a medkit) and some other stuff I don't recall. If you enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy this one.			",1393,387,26,190,117,15,203

												Fast, bloody and hard beat-em-up sequel of Shank. Basically, it has the same gameplay as the first game with some tweaks like dodging system.The most (and I would say the only) significant difference from the original game is the difficulty. Encounters are longer and tougher, but there are more interactive environment elements like turrets to help you. Health/damage balance was improved to make your life harder and shorter. And there is no more trigger hunting on bosses. Only pure skill of dodging their attack patterns may help to defeat them. So, even normal mode became a very good challenge.Anyway, it's great example of modern beat-em-up game.			",35,10,0,6,1,0,1

												Klei disappointed me with Shank, so I didn't purchase its sequel until it was part of a bundle.  Thankfully, Shank 2 improves in nearly every aspect from the original, resulting in some good, mindless platforming action.  This game is much different than the type of platformer that requires thinking and precision (a la Giana Sisters or Rayman), and instead focuses on combat, dodging and counters.  While I still prefer the thoughtful gameplay of the aforementioned platformers, or even Klei's other game Mark of the Ninja, I enjoyed my time with Shank 2 and loved experimenting with different skill sets and weapons.  The story was laughable but inoffensive... for the most part, and the visuals matched the nonsense going on in the story.			",687,272,23,99,56,7,113

												Shank 2 is a improvement over the previous title besides the fact that the mouse move your aim, wich basically change the gameplay completly over the first one, if that is also a improvement, well, opinions differ and each person should make is own, personally, i think its worst that the first game and taint the end result to me.This is the typical side-scrolling action title. It never takes any chances but delivers an overall solid beat ‘em up, a more  inconsistent difficulty that the first game, nonexistent story (wich surprised me to say at least) and a lack of gameplay variety that hold Shank 2 back if we compare with other games similar to this one, but those looking for playing the new experience from Shank’s last outing might want to give the sequel a try, since it still is a good overall experience.

												OK, to be honest, they added simple nothing with this game and I can say first one was better than Shank 2 in almost every way. Story was terrible for me. It's all about going after someone called ""Helena"" which we know almost nothing about her. Well, he raised Shank and some other guys from Rebellion that's all we know but we don't know why he goes after her. Apart from the story, they added some things like counter attack, using dropped weapons from enemies etc. They also messed up controls. Blocking is gone and you can only dodge now with the right analog stick. The old blocking button is pounce now and you can pounce fat enemies too. They added more epic soundtracks and animations but I still prefer first one's animations. They also added ""Survival Mode"" and you can play online co-op, too. We couldn't because of annoying connection problems. Long story short, buy it if you really want to play Shank 2.			",565,97,17,41,29,3,31

												I never play the first Shank, regardless, I don't feel I'm missing anything playing the second installment. In terms of story, Shank goes around making bad people go away by asking them nicely with blades, guns, and a chainsaw. The gameplay is fun and looks great in terms of style if you like the cartoon-comic look. You run around performing combos, grabs, and exchange blows with three weapon types with various weapons. There is a great feeling a versatility when fighting and its fun to be creative and make custom combos.My biggest gripe with this game is it's difficulty. I'm not one to devalue a game because its hard but damn this game feels difficult in some places for no reason. Wether it is a large abundance of projectile/heavy enemies attacking you at once, small health (or enemies that do a ton of damage), the game will have you contastly reseting until the one time you get mad/lucky enough to push through to the next screen.... only to run into the same situation.There is a local/online co op survival mode where you take on hordes of enemies as long as you can. I find this mode my favorite, aside from playing it with a friend, it doesn't feel as nearly ridiculous when a second person is carving mayhem alongside you. Overall despite it's frustration level, it is still a solid game I wouldn't pass up on  a sale.			",83,12,0,28,1,0,5

												Shank 2 is a spiritual journey. I can't say that a whole lot of video games had made me cry, but Shank 2 is one of the few that managed to pluck all the right emotional strings. This is what they mean when they talk about ""emotional games"", ""focus on storytelling"", ""superb character development"", ""a tour-de-force"". I fell in love with the shakespearian dialogue, the witty comebacks of the sidekick -- which serve the purpose of, like Sancho Panza in Cervantes' masterpiece, Don Quixote, giving the player a stark contrast to the grim, serious, philosophical nature and theme of this game, and ultimately remind the players of our own humanity. Planescape: Torment doesn't hold a candle to Shank 2.Every one who likes amazingly-written stories, top-notch gameplay and are willing to have a game touch their hearts in a way no other game has done before owe themselves a go at Shank 2. You won't regret it. Also, this is Steam, people buy games just because they feel like it.			",20,3,0,1,1,0,0

												""Shank is back!""From this words a new chapter of Shank's story has begun. After his revenge, Robert ""Shank"" Torres returns to his homeland, to orphan house, where he was raised. But there are new threat. A military force called ""Militia"" takes over everything what's left from destroyed narcotic cartels. Murder and kidnapping is spreading across the land. And now Shank wants to take care about this problem by his own style.The fighting system was completely remastered. Becomes more comfortable, more dynamic. New weapons and a large number of pickup weapons from baseball bat to various Miniguns and Grenade Launchers. 10/10Plot is nice, but not so breathtaking as Shank 1. 9/10Music and Sound - of course it's great. Music is epic, no doubt. 10/10Graphics - more gore and blood)) 10/10Cooperative in Shank 1 was showed by extra campaign. Shank 2 have a new mode for single and coop - Survival. Can you defend yourself and important ammo from enemies?I have to say. It's a great comic-styled, dynamic and bloody slasher. 10/10			",59,10,2,0,1,0,3

												Shank 1 was better. Shank 2 has more bells and whistles but feels watered down. Basically, has a change in art, gameplay and controls that not everyone will like. (and a lot of people dont.) I think voice acting also is worse here.When I played I always had the feeling that the game was targeted towards much more... younger players than Shank 1. Its difficult to backup this up with an argument though, but it's like the whole game has sunken. To make the whole game worse but to add a mini game where you have to defend against waves of thugs. Why?And those constant hints... oh god""press ... to grab ...""""this is water, dont go there. its wet. fish lives there.""etc.			",121,5,0,6,2,0,6

												I thought the first Shank games was ok, nothing unique but it was still a solid beat em up that had the controls feel right and good boss battles and average gameplay, forgettable story tho. THIS GAME however, the gameplay tweaks they made were awful. no more blocking which is a HUGE problem because the dodge roll you get is slow and almost useless when there is 3 or more enemies spread out on the screen cause the animation takes too long. good luck jumping out of the way cause that's very slow too. Enemies can cheap shot you during your counter attack animation or special attacks during boss battles. the enemies can hit you mid throw and just stop the move halfway through the animation. What attacks you can and can't counter are very inconsistant There is no way of knowing which attack can be countered or dodged until its to late or you've fought the specific enemy before. even though they were making tweaks and trying to make the game a bit more different then the first, the game just would have been so much better if they just copied the first ones gameplay completely. the only things i liked were the additional character extra weapons. story still sucked. 4/10			",332,35,17,26,10,1,30

												This game has an intriguing story, nice graphics and fun boss fights. BUT, its really in bad taste when it comes to a Klei game. The controls are wobbly and the gameplay is the same basic gimmick. Dodge and counter-attack. If it wasn't for the constant waves of enemies you have to fight, it would be a much duller game. As for replay value, it serves no purpose in going back, unless you're  an achievement hunter. There would be no way of going back to this game aside from playing survival mode with your friends. Which gets pretty lame after the first few rounds.Would not recommend if it wasn't on sale. 4/10			",109,24,0,4,8,3,11

												In Shank (1) you could only shank one guy, thus why it was just called ""Shank"", singular. It was a good fight and I enjoyed shanking that guy, but I always felt as if more could be done with the concept. It seems that I was not alone.In Shank 2 you can can shank two different people for a total of two shanks. That's *twice* the number of shanks that you got to perform in the first game, which is a significant improvement if you're the number crunching type (and I am). I know that they say that quantity should be subservient to quality (i.e. was Aliens better than Alien just because it added an ""s"" to the title? I'll leave that for you to decide, but the answer is yes), but for my money I'd rather get to enjoy shanking two different guys over just shanking one*, and I think both the developers and you will agree.Shank 2 delivers.*It's possible to replay the game on two higher difficulties, giving you a total of *six* possible shanks. I don't know why you're still reading this and not clicking the buy button so you can start shanking the first guy already.			",117,1,2,9,3,0,3

												If you liked the first Shank game, be wary of this sequal. While the core of the game is the same, what they added is not enough to make up for the subtractions.The controls seem to be a little nicer with the ability to stop combos and such, but the ramped up difficulty on ""Normal"" can cancel out that ability as it seems there is always a new wave of enemies (always including a ranged mob) that will knock you out of the combo. Boss fights, as well boss fights. We all know the jump, dodge, attack and repeat nature but this time they liked to add in atleast 2 more random baddies to the equation. It's bad enough I need to jump, duck, dodge and roll and then attack the boss but adding more random crap in to the experiance doesn't make it ""hard"", it makes it tedious.If your looking for the sidescroller, try the original Shank or Mark of the Ninja, both a much more enjoyable experiance.

												If you liked Shank 1, you gotta buy Shank 2. People often talk about the commands, I see no problem with them, of course they are more complicated, but you can rebind the keys, also, the most complex commands let you do more complex attacks, tricks and such, not to mention its another challenge to be added to the game, it isn't hard, but still very entertaining, the graphics are amazing, now heading to the Story. Most people say the story sucks, in fact, it does not, if you pay attention to the storyline, tips hidden in the levels themselves and the secrets(called rebel intel)you can know much better about the story, and it isn't a bad one, you can acctually understand what happened, what is going on and why. There are games with better storylines, but this one isn't a bad one, its just a matter of perception. You can unlock new characters that have an utility instead of just reskins. The weapons and Multiplayer mode are also very nice, I recommend that game.			",278,73,3,7,8,2,19

												A heavily under-rated sidescrolling action platformer. Its similar to the first Shank, although more complex. The combat system has changed a little, new weapons, new moves. Lots of welcome new additions to story mode, a co-op survival mode, everything that made the first game great plus loads more. Definately recommended.			",1920,829,74,198,246,21,315

												While it keeps most of the mechanics of Shank, Shank 2 is ruined by the need to carefully block opponents instead of building awesome combos like in its predecessor. This not only messes with the fluidity of the game, but spoils most of the fun as well. It's a shame too, because it could be a very promising title. Would not recommend unless you are very much into defence driven action. If not, the first Shank will keep you more than satisfied.			",218,129,2,37,18,2,33

												If you ever played the first Shank, then you pretty much know what to expect from this sequel. It improves on some of the frustrations the first one had, but unfortunately not all. First of all there are more weapons included in this Shank adventure, which makes killing more fun overall. Second, they have included counter-attacks, meaning you can press a button when a red exclamation mark appears above your enemy. It looks cool in motion and works really well. On to the stuff that isn't quite alright... it's short. But I don't see that as a downside. When you finish the game (about 4 hours) you've probably seen it all. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, thankfully.And then we have the difficulty. One moment it's easy as I-don't-know-what, and the other moment (which can be seconds later) the difficulty ramps up making it practically unplayable. It's a good game nonetheless, and if you love beat 'em ups you'll love this one as well, I'm sure.[Rating: 73/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												More of the first really, a high octain mash-em-up of a game. The story in this one is more like Collatoral damage of Taken 2 where you should know not to mess with someone who just tore your troops apart like mere tissue paper and killed one of your generals in a horrific way.Really, Shank was just fine, drinking booze on the bus and if you left him alone nothing would happen. To quote spoony: ""But oh no. You had to come down and shake his ♥♥♥♥ing tree and now he's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and going to come after you"" which is the basic plot of the story, plus for a single level you get to be a different character and switing weapons is done in a in-game menu whilst paused which is so much easier.Only real downside is I feel sick that it had to be related to EA. Eitherway, if you liked the first you'll love this and if you didn't like the first. Well, things have improved and controls are less confusing and better made for PC use but generally I'd say only buy if on a sale.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												Shank 2 is definitely an improvement over its predecessor. Gameplay feels tight, combat is more fluid and dynamic, while boss fights are no longer cause for frustration. The game is quite challenging, even unfairly so in certain moments, but a changed strategy or loadout should help your endeavors.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

												Its a hand drawn 2-D sidescrolling shooter, it doesnt try to be anything it isnt, the story is simply a backdrop to you smacking people with chainsaws, machetes, and sledgehammers. It wont win an emmy, but the art and combat system should (though be warned, it is build for a controller, its not impossible to use a mouse and keyboard by any means, but its also not as easy) Shank and the other playable character (only playable in one campain mission, but is accessible as a coop partner) have a good number of nice, hand drawn outfits, which sounds simple but every single animation had to be redrawn for them to have these, so i think thats fairly impressive. The story consists of 8 levels, it is fairly short and as said in the summary, isnt emmy material but it gives you an excuse to hurt the bad guys. Shank has 3 melee weapons, 3 ranged weapons, and alot of outfits. The coop character has 2 melee and 2 ranged The gameplay is best described as a twitch beat em up, you will have to dodge and click buttons at the right times and with some precision in order to look like a badass and not get hit. Its hard to learn but once you do manage to get the rhythm down, you feel like a badass with animations that seem to be built for those times when you stab a guy, throw him into another before leaping over them with a shotgun. Get it on sale if you like twitch-beat em up style games!			",243,24,0,11,10,2,5

												It's the same game, only marginally worse. Here's some beat-em-ups I would like to see instead:- An Edward Gorey-style beat-em-up where a young Tim Burton travels in time to the future to assassinate Present Tim Burton (Johnny Depp is the final boss)- An adaptation of Edward Abbey's Fire on the Mountain where the grandfather puts on a gi and goes to town on encroaching government agents- Drunk Fights: A two-player game using the Euphoria physics engine where two incredibly drunk people fight each other in a bar (special characters like Charles Bukowski are either DLC or unlockables)- Christmas Drunk Fights: see above, except it takes place in a shopping mall- Sudden Ninja Attack: Like The Sims, but there's NINJAS that you have to kill with your superior reflexes			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Note: Skip straight to the bottom after Pros and Cons for tl;dr.Note 2: I also have not played the first game. This review examines the game from its story as a standalone.Note 3: I also have no one to play co-op with. This review excludes the co-op part.Pros:- Responsive combat- If you have a controller, use it. It feels excellent.Cons:- Typical story, replace damsel with older damsel. Also the story makes me cringe. But that may be just me.- Relatively short game if you play on normal- Combos? What combos? Maybe I'm just bad at this game, I dunno :(Shank 2 is a game that is not for the story-driven. As a guy who loves story-driven games, this is a game that just... what? That's not a story man. Shank 2's story doesn't feel like a story - it feels like filler for the game's mechanics, which are solid; not revolutionary, but solid.It's hard not to keep a negative tone about this game because I didn't really enjoy it; I was soon playing it for the sake of ""finishing"" the campaign. However, the game's combat is very solid (that's a third) and it felt great to play with a controller. Sometimes the combat makes me feel as though the situation was out of my control, but those moments are few and far between, and it was actually me not being alert most times. Overall, I don't really recommend this game, but for reasons that may not ring with you. If you like playing a game purely as an excuse to whack baddies, this is OK. But for people who are story-driven and like a good campaign, stay away.TL;DR: Get this game for an excuse to whack some baddies; platforming combat is good here. Stay away if you like good stories and a long game, regardless of the gameplay.			",211,81,7,31,32,3,38

												Despite the fact that I absolutely loved Shank 1, I have to give negative review. Trust me, I tried. Emulating gamepad,changing controls for over 30 min. First of all controls are absolute garbage, you'll find dodging only to te left side and different control bugs gamebreaking. Because of that fact I wasn't even able to win first level of the game. Because of that I can't really review different aspects of the game. You are probably thinking ""Well gamepad maybe is broken, but what about keyboard?"". Who would like to play fighting game on keyboard? It's bugged in the same anyway. All in all if you are planning on buying this game I'll have to persuade you not to. I had 2 attempts on playing this. First one was right after I managed to beat Shank 1 on hard difficulty. Decided to go with the flow and I got gifted this. Now after few years I thought to give this game one more shot. Like said before, fighting over controls then with enemies. Great way to ruin the series. I'll probably buy Shank 3 but at least I hope they'll fix controls issue.			",128,16,2,10,4,2,5

TL;DRThis game is significantly more enjoyable with a controller. If you do not have one handy, I'd give this game a hard pass.Mangled FingersFor a beat-em-up that requires tight controls, someone should've really raised an issue with the god awful keyboard controls. I do not understand why they would have 3 key functions all bound to the Shift key. Dodging, Strong Attack, and Pounce, all rely on having the Shift key pressed. So if you're trying to dodge, and follow with a strong attack, then pounce a third enemy, you're gonna have a bad time.BreakdownHonestly, I don't think I got through enough of the game to give my usual Pros vs. Cons section here. However, I will say that the game is difficult, but for the wrong reasons. Early on there's a section with a meat grinder that you're supposed to throw enemies into, a very easy section by all standards, but I was having issues because I would consistently pounce or roll or fly into the meat grinders due to the shoddy keyboard controls.

Smooth but tedious action gameFirst of all, Shank is a Overcoming the Monster hack and slash game.Shank chased the emenies in different scenes and beat bosses. The emenies is monotonous, which didn't have various type. Besides, Shank didn't have skill system but have equipments system. Howerver, the equipments are also less choice in the game.I think the most interesting part of the game is the survive mode, which offer many charactors with various talent. If you like the survive action game, maybe you could consider this game.   ",11,5,0,1,0,0,1

												After playing few hours, completing some missions (not so much, in fact), I made my little idea of this game.I don't like it.Why? Because it's very repetitive, the musics are the same for the whole game, and that's very annoying to play with that dümb music playing and playing again. But, nevermind the music, you can turn it off (Of course you can, if not, I would be god damn dead right now), let's talk about the gameplay itself. You play Shunk, or whatever, and you cut people. That's all ! You cut people with knifes and machetes again and again ! Enemies are all the same, checkpoint is a forbidden word in this game, bosses are just boring and wasting your time, etc. But at least it's pretty decent when you look at the graphics, yeah, it's all drawn-by-hand, and it looks awesome ! It ""looks"" awesome. Looks.Ups : - Nice graphics- In the first hours, it's still fun to switch between Knifes, Machetes, Guns, etc., it makes the first levels a little more exciting- You don't need a PC from the NASA to make it work, and that's a good point if your PC is cheap.- A little coop mode, didn't test it yet. (I need to find someone who likes this game first...)Downs : - Musics are... BLEH.- Too repetitive- Enemies are all the same- Bosses are full of bugs, and seriously not interresting- The story. I don't understand anything about this ""conflict"" or whatever. You maybe need to play the 1st game before playing this one.I do not recommand it, but I cannot spit on it, I had fun on this game !

												Shank 2 is the bomb, quite literally. It’s an action packed title, filled to the brim with tons of gratification, a beautiful outline, tight controls and great replay value. Cynics can argue that it doesn’t offer a ton more than the first game, but it’s still just as appealing as it ever was, now with more stuff.  Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			",54,27,0,8,7,0,7

TL;DRThis game is significantly more enjoyable with a controller. If you do not have one handy, I'd give this game a hard pass.Mangled FingersFor a beat-em-up that requires tight controls, someone should've really raised an issue with the god awful keyboard controls. I do not understand why they would have 3 key functions all bound to the Shift key. Dodging, Strong Attack, and Pounce, all rely on having the Shift key pressed. So if you're trying to dodge, and follow with a strong attack, then pounce a third enemy, you're gonna have a bad time.BreakdownHonestly, I don't think I got through enough of the game to give my usual Pros vs. Cons section here. However, I will say that the game is difficult, but for the wrong reasons. Early on there's a section with a meat grinder that you're supposed to throw enemies into, a very easy section by all standards, but I was having issues because I would consistently pounce or roll or fly into the meat grinders due to the shoddy keyboard controls.

YouTube™ Video: BLOODY AS F#CK! | SHANK 2 | PC/OSX Gameplay 

			Views: 40		

			The fan-favorite 2D brawler is back as ex-mob hit man Shank returns to action in Shank 2. With those closest to him under attack, Shank is once again forced on the offensive.		

I took a random chance on this game since I love 2D beat-em-ups & fast paced gameplay. Salt & sanctuary was a gamechanger for me & ever since then I have to get my 2D fix. Shank 2 is my first entry into the series but I have to admit it was entertaining. My PS4 Controller had some troubles mapping to the right buttons (mainly dodge roll left/right with analog) but it could also be that I mapped it wrong or the game just works better with STEAM/XBOX controller. It ran super well on my 2013 macbook pro 16gb ram 2.3ghz laptop & the sounds were good as well. If you're looking for a decent 2D shooter/Beat-em-up then get Shank 2, especially since the price dropped when I got it! (under 3 dollars is worth it!)  ",32,10,1,2,3,0,0

												Campaign is 3 hours long (well Shank 1 wasn't long either). Although there are some unlockables, most of them are grind based. Fighting is well done, but boss fights are just simple fights with evading. Shank 1 had some strategy and tactics in boss fights. Based on this, I would say Shank 1 is better game and this one shouldn't be bought (story isn't even that interesting) without discount. And no one plays co-op.			",204,56,7,31,22,3,36

												This game should have been called Shank 2:The Real Chuck Norris simulator. After the events of first game Shank returns to his home village which he finds outruned by bad guys. And so another epic adventure begins for Shank. Shank 2 is a 2d side-scroller beat'em up game where you can kick some butt and break sculls of your enemies. Devastating arsenal of weapons including pistols chainsaws and ending with brutal sledgehammers. Game also introduces new 2 player coop survival mode which is actually fun and challenging. Awesome bosses fights, numerous goons to kill in different ways, and cool comic style landscapes. So everything is great here and it's full of badass-ery even though game is short but it's worth it low price. One of the best downloadeable games of 2012.			",365,12,2,16,14,1,17

												It’s just more of the same, I thought the first game was just an average side scrolling beat em up and I gave it a negative review. This is also another average beat em up, it doesn’t really feel like they tried to do anything to progress the series aside from very minor gameplay tweaks. Story is again very basic and even more uninteresting than it was in the first game. Only play it if you really enjoyed the first one. 5/10 (Average)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												Shank is back and hes more dangerous then ever. Shank starts a few years after the first game. Hes on his way to see hes orphanage keeper but to find out shes taken away by army people. So Shank joins the resistance to fight against the army and get her back. This game is way better then the first one and is down right awesome. The game has tight controls which work smooth. The combat stay almost the same. You have new guns to youre arsenal like Molotovs, mines, throwing knive, sledgehammers and a bunch of weapons that youre fallen enemys drop. The game has some awesome boss fights which to get pretty epic and the cutscenes are awesome to look at because the art style is still amazing. The game is also hard as nails and some parts do get annoying. Also the survival mode is pretty fun. In it you play as a charecter of your choice and you have to protect three supply boxes while people try to destroy them. Overall the games is fun as hell and you really need to check out the whole franschie and i hope Klei make part 3 soon i give this game a 8.5/10			",905,350,32,94,59,7,85

												- The game is frustratingly hard. Most people (including me) died severa times in 1ST LEVEL! and it is worse from there on.- There is no strategy to learn, just repeating every frustrating level and boss until one time you luckily wount die.- Dont look for Easy difficulty setting - there isn't any.- The control scheme is a mess on both keyboard and controller.Dont buy !

But I had nothing but contempt for Shank 2 and its endless mindless button mashing! My hatred for this game has become an inside joke with my friends. Don't talk to me about SHANK 2!!!It's actually the reason I didn't try Mark of the Ninja for so long. But I must say that the latter turned out to be a fantastic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately, not good. The devs changed the control scheme from the original and in the process, completely broke the game's dodging mechanic (by moving it from a trigger button to the right stick). In the original, gameplay consisted of dancing through crowds of enemies, shooting and stabbing and murdering as you go. In this installment, it's just frustrating because the controls are busted and can't be customised.			",222,52,5,19,13,0,15

												I'd say it's pretty fun, some hate the new control scheme and while it takes some time of getting used to it seems like a much easier game than its predecessor. Another downside is the lack of any kind of co-op campaign like in the first Shank. The Survival mode is great but I was looking forward to beating up guys and progressing through a story, no matter how much it resembled a B or C movie. Also, as far as the story goes, it's a bit less engaging and coherent than in Shank.			",233,36,16,11,7,2,21

												If you've never played the original Shank, then I suppose Shank 2 is as good a place to start as any. Events in the past game are barely referenced to, if at all. So how well does Shank 2 fare against its predecessor?To begin, the first Shank wasn't a remarkable game. Even with its short single player campaign, the plot was weak and the gameplay repetitive. Shank 2, with its superb art, suffers a similar fate but with an even weaker story and more uninspired foes.Gameplay-wise, Shank 2 tries hard to be diverse. There is a large variety of actions and attacks at your disposal and in moments of high intensity, it's all too easy to get buttons mixed up, resulting in eventual death.To encourage replayability, Shank 2 boasts a leaderboard that tracks player scores built up by combos and items collected. Additionally, there are a dozen or so alternative skins unlocked by completing achievements. If you're not interested in those, then one playthrough may be enough.Grade: C			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												This game takes he repetiveness to 11 and removed the multiplayer game, which I found added to the original's experience. I feel the tower defence excuse for multiplayer didn't do it for me. Also, the boss fights are less unique, wih only 2 or remarkable boss fights out of 8 levels.There are things to like in this game. The combat is more fluid , and there is an extra character. But I think the original is better. This seems more like an "" Advenures of Shank"" or Shank 1.5 then a full on sequel. if you didn't like the original, then you would HATE this game.  You could do worse if you decide to get it. Worth a shot if you like beat em ups.			",174,21,0,30,7,0,16

												I ♥♥♥♥ing loved Shank. I’m putting that out there up front. I loved every minute of playing it. It was really really hard. It’s been a while since I’ve played a game like that. Now, when I say “really really hard,” I don’t mean impossible. Super Meat Boy is impossible. I mean really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenging. Shank is by no means a perfect game, but it’s so much fun. Even if you aren’t a fan of beat-‘em-ups, I still recommend giving Shank 2 a shot.We’re going to pretend like I know what happened in the original Shank. Right? Right. What’s research?Shank 2 is, as previously stated, a beat-‘em-up game in which you play as (appropriately) Shank. Shank is a member of a rebel group who is defying the warlord, General Magnus. Magnus and his militia have taken over the government, essentially throwing the entire system out of whack. The militia is tearing the cities the government controls apart, taking in slave labor, burning entire villages, the whole shebang. For a game whose story is completely unimportant, Shank has a considerable amount of thought put into it. I mean, don’t get me wrong, the story is a tired tale that’s been done a million times over, but it sets up an excellent backstory for Shank.Shank’s mentor, Elena, has been captured by the militia. Not only does she mean to world to Shank, but she also is the leader of the alliance group. It’s up to Shank and his partner Corina to save Elena and take down Magnus once and for all.The first thing you can note about Shank is that he is BADASS. He uses a flipping chainsaw and shotgun to take out hordes of enemies, cranes, superhumans, and airplanes. His weapons actually range from machetes to molotovs. Yeah, how flipping cool is that? Unfortunately, Shank isn’t a relatable character in the slightest. I know that the game wasn’t going for an emotional tale, but what’s the point in having a backstory at all when you can’t feel any emotions toward the characters? Shank, and even Corina, to an extent, were too Gears of War-like for me to actually care about why I was killing all of these deranged lunatics.Putting the stupid characterization aside for a moment, I’d like to discuss the flashback I was continuously having during my playthrough. There was a game made for the SNES called Blackthorne. Maybe you have heard of it. In, a badass character runs around shooting a shotgun to save prisoners, etc. I haven’t personally played the game, so I can’t attest to how good it is, but I’ve seen in played and learned about it. There are so many callbacks to Blackthorne that it isn’t even funny.Let me give you some examples. Blackthorne’s signature move was shooting with a shotgun… one handed and backwards. Guess what Shank can do? Of course, there is the obvious saving prisoners from the bad guys… I could go on, but I think you get the picture. Before you go calling Shank and Blackthorne the same game, though, recognize that Blackthorne was actually a cinematic platformer. This is a genre that isn’t really touched on as much nowadays, with the exception of the recent re-release of Flashback. My point is, whether they meant to or not, the developers of Shank made Blackthorne cool again.Before we dive into the gameplay, let’s talk about the art of the game. The animations are all very comic-book-like, which I’ve always been a fan of. The animations are simple and cartoony for such a violent game, but this is hardly detrimental. What isn’t the best part of the game is the music which is… bland. Sure, it sounds epic… at first… and then it gets repetitive and fades into the background. There isn’t anything wrong with it, per say, but it isn’t as good as I would like it to be.Shank is hard. I know I’ve said that a lot, but I’m trying to ingrain this into your mind. There are two modes of the story: Normal and Hard modes. Normal mode is doable, but Hard is… ♥♥♥♥ing hard. In Normal mode, you get plenty of health powerups, checkpoints, infinite lives, etc. In hard mode, you get very few powerups, next to no checkpoints, and infinite lives. To give you a quick perspective, I beat Normal in about four hours, give or take. I have yet to get past the third level in Hard.Some of the better things about Shank are his weapons. You see, there are a variety of weapons, like I said earlier. Each weapon has a different amount of damage, speed, and some variation of stun. You will be able to find which weapons work best for you as you play the game. You don’t unlock all of the weapons until the last few levels, and by this point you’ve probably already figured out what you wanted. For instance, my lineup was the Chainsaw, the Shotgun, and the Grenades.I like that the game balances out the weapons. You have a real chance to figure out which weapons are best for your playstyle. If you’re like me, you like to deal with one problem at a time. This is where the Chainsaw and the Shotgun came in handy. If you like to take on lots of enemies at once, you may find that the Pistols and Machetes work better for you. Even when it seems like a weapon is unbalanced, you’ll find that it has a certain ability, like leaving enemies burning in your wake. The weapons are arguably the best part about the game.The gameplay is pretty straightforward. It’s almost, but not quite, button mashing. The enemies range quite a bit in size and power, so some weapons will work better on them than others. For example, when I was in close quarters with several enemies, I’d end up flailing about and murdering all of them with my Shotgun. If I needed to clear the field and make space, I’d use the Chainsaw. You’ll find that just using one will not work. You’ll need to chain combos together to help you take down the multitudes of enemies.Speaking of multitudes of enemies, there are quite a bit of them. These basic enemies range from swordsmen, to female ninjas, to guys with pistols, to guys with machine guns, to guys with axes, to midget bomber, to gigantic ♥♥♥♥ing cretins… There are so many. Each level may or may not present you with different enemies. Occasionally, this could just mean the same enemy reskinned, but some levels do include zone-specific enemies.The best enemies are the bosses. And there are not as many as I would like. The levels in Shank only end up being about 20-30 minutes long apiece, and there are only eight levels. This does mean there is variety in bosses, but there aren’t enough. For such a BA guy, you’d think he’d constantly be taking on guys three or four times his size.That being said, the bosses are awesome and also not. Each one of the focuses on a different aspect. For example, there is a psychic boss, and there’s fire boss, and there’s a strength boss. Each of these bosses seem perfectly fit for their levels. Alternatively, there are minibosses in some stages. For example, the crane I mentioned earlier. It has been a long time since I’ve had this much rage towards a boss in a game… You can’t hit the crane unless you’re using your gun. The crane repeatedly tries to smash you with a boat that takes up a third of the screen while guys with pistols try to take you out from a mile away. It’s tough. But I beat it. I can’t get past in on the Hard mode, but I got in Normal.The bosses are not awesome in some parts… Mostly because they all use the same tactics. To a degree. They have a predetermined moveset that consists of maybe five moves at the most. Once you take out about a third of their health, they all call backup. It’s the same thing every battle. On top of that, once you figure out the movesets of each boss, they aren’t that hard to beat. Hell, even the final battle against Magnum I beat on my second try. For a game that can be as challenging as Shank, the bosses aren’t hard enough.......read more of this review at http://theoblivianstudios.com/post/62088773680/review-shank-2 ",89,37,3,12,9,1,17

Also has a co-op survival mode that seems cool if you like that sort of thing.  The art style and violence are both over the top and a lot of fun!			",733,177,23,71,37,7,90

												Shank 2 is a great followup to the original boasting good action and a fun amount of fighting. The story and theme is set more around a tropical place as Shank tries to help overthrow the corrupt mafia with some help from others. The cutscenes usually boast more amounts of action and bloody gore than dialogue fromo the first, fitting for a good action movie. The fighting mechanics have also been beefed up with a more robust system enabling longer combos and more launchers along with new weapons along with some returning ones. Visually the game looks as great as the first with its animated style along with a great backing soundtrack. With an action movie charm, Shank 2 is great for players of the first or those wanting a fun beat em up experience.			",106,20,5,4,5,2,24

												This game has a very cartoony art style and I like that, the style is very similar to that of 'Mark of the Ninja' (by the same people) which i loved. However, this game just wasn't dynamic, if I had played this before mark of the ninja I probably would have viewed this more highly, but when i was playing it it just felt like a less interesting version of mark of the ninja. That said the game is still good and deserves a look. 7/10.			",212,27,3,31,17,0,32

												Avoid this one, it's inferior to the first game in every way. Weapon loadout is more restricted, the difficulty ramp up is enourmous (even on Normal), and it doesn't have a co-op mode (IMO the most fun way to play the first one). Even the story is much worse: the first one is pure Robert Rodríguez/Tarantino, while this one has zombies, cannibals and other supernatural elements. A real letdown, because the first Shank is a great game.			",340,115,6,45,18,2,46

												Great game,very entertaining but it would need some improvement : I first played with the keyboard and mouse and it s not manageable so switch to a controller,it s better but still messy in my opinion.The second annoying thing is the lack of saves, once you start a level you have to finish it! If you quit for any reason you have to start all over again.It can be quite frustrating if you want to play a quick game.Concerning the storyline, i mostly skipped it all  as I think this kind of game are not about the story but about the hack'n'slash.So the fact that the story is poor is not really a problem !Overall it s still a really fun game!

												This is essentally the same game as Shank and comes with all of the same flaws, plus a few more.Mainly, that the game just isn't very challenging and has been severely dumbed down for the casual market compared to old school beat 'em ups like Streets of Rage. Giving you infinite lives and checkpoints takes all of the fun out of this type of game. If nothing else at least offer an option to set limited lives and continues while retaining an ""infinite lives"" option for casual players who are just playing it through for the ""story"".Speaking of story, it also took a turn for the worse. While the original Shank's revenge plot was at least interesting enough to care about, the plot in this game is just generic ""B-movie"" fare and makes no mention of the characters from the original at all. The settings are also a lot less diverse and interesting, boiling down to dark dismal jungle and industrial environments which are a lot less nice to look at. The added in-game voice acting is also unnecessary and for the most part downright cheesy.Essentially the game retains the same flaws with little in the way of improvement, and a few additions that make the gameplay worse: *Easy, short campaign, little to no replay value with the only unlockables being alternate costumes and character bios that add nothing to the gameplay*Poorer controls than in the original (having to use seperate buttons to dodge left and right)*A survival mode which had potentional but is multiplayer only (and with no one playing it online this mode is only accessable if you have a real-life buddy to play with)I really can't recommend this except to casual gamers who typically play Facebook or Zynga games (and even then, the strong language and gore will probably be a turn-off to the type of people who play Farmville or Candy Crush Saga).

												Beaten in 3 hours on Normal, with quite a bit of frustration along the way, mostly due to the combat mechanics and a couple bad checkpoints. Here are the main things that made the experience frustrating for me:- Awkward combat and controls. Even by the end of the game, I never felt like I could control Shank's movement as precisely as I wanted, and half the time he and the enemies just bounced around the screen as we desperately tried to hit and dodge eachother's moves. It's just really clunky and silly looking a lot of the time. I would have liked more precision in the movement.- Too much dodging. If you try to fight stuff straight up, you'll die over and over and over. Dodge is controlled by the right joystick, and you have to hover over it constantly and use it every time an enemy flashes yellow, charges, fires a projectile, leaps at you, etc. When you have 7 enemies on screen charging back and forth in different patterns, firing waves of bullets, and cleaving at you it's just incredibly annoying that the key to winning is to dodge dodge dodge dodge. I'd have preferred more straight up combat where I could fight something without watching 6 other things and constantly being interrupted.- Difficulty spikes in weird places. I spent half an hour (1/6 of total play time!) on a single turret section that was preceded by a long easy section with no checkpoint. Every time I died I had to re-do the easy section to get back. I got stuck on a boss earlier in the game for half an hour, yet beat the final boss on the first try without even knowing his attack patterns.All in all, it's not a bad game. The controls and style of combat just really annoyed me. I'm glad I finished it though and there is a sense of satisfaction you get from beating the difficult parts. The cutscenes and story are groanworthy, but clearly that was their intention. I just found it all very forgettable, whereas Mark of the Ninja was just a fantastic experience with a great ending. If you're choosing between the two, I'd definitely go for the latter.			",54,8,1,2,1,0,6

While I am disappointed that the co-op campaign of the first game was replaced with a mere wave survival mode in this one, the single player campaign delivers the same sort of experience as the first, a beer-soaked, white-knuckle, bullet-riddled rampage through a grindhouse version of South America, and that's nothing to complain about. I would best describe Shank 2 as a 2D ""Stylish Action Game"", a term that never really caught on, since people think God of War invented this style of gameplay when, really, Devil May Cry did it first- and better. To be fair, the Shanks are closer in style to God of War, and though there is a combo grading system in the game you can get by perfectly well by mashing the buttons until you have smeared your enemies into the pavement. Shank 2 delivers fast, brutal action, varied weapons and cinematic boss battles, and despite the short length of the game it is excellently paced and good fun to play throughout. I hope this is not the last we have seen of our headbanded hero and his messy adventures.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

Ultimately the controls are clunky and frustrating, the dodge roll is pointless, enemies do too much damage, and bosses make for pointless tedius frustration.

												While I liked the first Shank I had problems even playing the second game for the cards. The whole combat system is overhauled making it frustrating to play. They removed blocking and replaced it with dodging and countering. Dodging is put on the right stick which takes to long too reach when you are having your thumb on the attack buttons. The countering is done with the same button as you grab with. The problem with this system is that it works really bad when facing large groups of enemies. You will die a lot because of that. They also put more focus on the story which is really bad. A simpler story but acceptable story like the first one worked much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Klei Entertainment did not disappoint with Shank 2. Inspired by Grindhouse flicks (from what I've read) Shank 2 places you in the shoes of Shank. I don't really know much about Shank since I didn't play the first game but I will give my 2 cents on the story and gameplay.Story:The story is kind of weak. Shank goes to his hometown to see his mother figure Helena. In between the 2 games a new military government has taken over and they are bad dudes/dudettes. Shank only starts fighting them because one of them makes him mad. After that he just mellows out on some booze before he goes to see Helena. The military sets the town on fire while he is drinking. When he attempts to get to Helena he sees her along with other villagers being hauled away by the military. So begins Shank's quest to save his mama.You don't need to know much about Shank except that he is a cool dude. It would've been nice if he smiled or cracked a joke or did not sound like an old man in the restroom when he got hurt but that is just my opinion. You can also play as Corina, Shank's foster sister, in a level along with the multiplayer. She is a determined rebel member who is probably not a drunk. But you don't get to know her much either.Gameplay:The gameplay is excellent. You have a light attack, heavy attack, bombs, and guns. You can juggle people around using the light attacks. You can also pick up weapons on the road that are super powerful but only have a few uses like a bat, a pipe, an IV pole, and a sink. There is also a dodge mechanic which works really well. You can dodge at any point in your attacks. The dodge function will cancel out your attack so you won’t get hit because you are in the middle of one. There are also environmental traps you can activate to kill your enemies. There are a variety of enemies that will keep the game fresh. You have quick grenade throwers, regular dudes, fat dudes that laugh like Scooby Doo, and heavy dudes that go ""hoo rah!"" when they do a spin attack. Each game has a boss as well.If you like beat em ups then this is a game you will not want to miss. A coop survival mode (I have not played) will add replay value and there are also leaderboards, a hard mode, and intel to collect. Getting achievements also unlocks skins.Buy it!

												Awesome game, i enjoyed the first one very much, so it was a no brainer to get this one. Visually it looks better, the art style is still the same as the first but more refined. The single player campaign is cool, but not very long. In my opinion the single player was just enough, because the Survival mode co-op is tonnes of fun. Highly recommended and if you get it during a steam sale then its a win, win. Make Shank 3!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the original Shank. It's a fun brawler with a good story with over-the-top♥♥♥♥♥kicking.Shank 2 improves the gameplay in some areas and downgrades it in others, but the main problem with this game is the story.Pros:-The dodge button was a welcome addition-Adds more fun ways to dismember people, like throwing them in the air and shooting/slicing them-Forward attacks involve more charging forwardCons:-A bit too tutorial-heavy-There are way too many enemies to defeat. It makes the game not fun and more of a grindfest.-The story is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ In the first game, the story was straightforward. Shank=good guy. Everyone else=bad guy. You kill bad guy. Also some backstory, but mostly that.In Shank 2, you rescue your mentor/girlfriend and it's pretty dark and gritty. No. The story in Shank should just be him going around and killing things. I don't want to deal with moral choice in Shank. I just want to dismember people.Also, Shank apparently has a daughter? This is wrong for a couple reasons. One, Shank is a terrible role model. He runs around getting drunk and killing people. Why should he care if he has a daughter? Two, Shank is such a badass that giving him a moral compass takes away a lot of that. It's like giving the Terminator a family.Conclusion:Shank 2 is more of a gritty grindfest than the over-the-top popcorn action game that the original Shank was. If you prefer a more complex story, then buy this game. I personally think that the story should complement the gameplay, and the original story did that a lot better. In Shank 2, the story and the gameplay don't match, and it detracts from the experience.			",165,20,1,15,11,2,11

I have really been enjoying these side scroller games alot as I enjoyed Ninja Scroll just as much.  This one was a lot less on the stealth and much more on the action.  As an 80's kid who grew up on kick @ss action movies like Rambo this one was right up my alley!			",154,22,4,12,14,2,16

												Shank 2 is an old school beat-em-up of the sort I thought were obsolete. It turns out, I was exactly right. Shank offers nothing new or interesting in terms of that genre, yet is demanding, repetitive, and consequently tedious. There’s also a surprising amount of sexism and racism to boot.

												This game has a very cartoony art style and I like that, the style is very similar to that of 'Mark of the Ninja' (by the same people) which i loved. However, this game just wasn't dynamic, if I had played this before mark of the ninja I probably would have viewed this more highly, but when i was playing it it just felt like a less interesting version of mark of the ninja. That said the game is still good and deserves a look. 7/10.			",212,27,3,31,17,0,32

												Official thumbs up. It's a hark to days of yore like Goldenaxe and Gauntlet. Everything is super over the top but none of it feels corney or stupid. Bosses are actually hard, and doing a level with no deaths is a noticeable bragging right, even on normal difficulty. Controls are very fluent and reactive, with a large selection of weapons to pick up and a core set of 9 that provide alot of variety.The mouse controls are iffy, and I feel they get in the way, but it's the only reliable way to use the ranged weapons. If the cursor was more visible or the mouse more reactive this game would be a 9. 8 so far.			",588,104,15,99,59,3,78

												The center of the first amusement stays in place, obviously - on the off chance that it ain't broke, don't settle it, correct? - however Shank 2 is the epitome of excellent change on a little scale. Designer Klei was forceful about smoothing rougher edges, and the minor changes in Shank 2 have a noteworthy effect. It's a more responsive, speedier activity title that gets rid of the accursing side of its stunning liveliness. This is a smooth brawler with ravishing display, and its devotion to nailing its additional opportunity makes it one of the best activity amusements in late memory.			",102,15,1,14,2,0,4

												For the sale price. I reccommend both games and especially shank 2. The first game is a short and sweet brawler that can be beaten in 2 1/2 hours. Shank 2 just improves on everything the first game struggled with, making for a fun hack n' slash platformer that was actually quite challenging. Despite unlimited lives and generous checkpoints, you really have to be on top of your game to really stand a chance. Also, don't forget a controller. Highly reccommended especially for steam sale price.			",59,0,0,2,3,0,2

												I borderline hate this game. After about 30 minutes, I was so frustrated and unhappy with my experience, I almost uninstalled it and hid it from my library. I was too stubborn to do that and ended up beating the whopping 2.5 hour campaign, though I'd hesitate to say I actually enjoyed any of it. Thank god I got it in a Humble Bundle.My biggest problem was the difficulty. It's a bit too hard for my liking right off the bat, then ramps things up a bit more each level... until you get the shotgun and the game becomes ""mash shoot to win"". I mean, I guess I should thank the developers for making it so utterly overpowered or I probably would never have beaten the game. Unfortunately, the plot isn't much better. It's your standard ""retired hero gets thrown into the middle of a conflict and defeats the big bad"" affair. The first game (which I also didn't really care for) had a much more interesting plot, but that's more thanks to Quinten Tarantino due to it basically being a poor man's Kill Bill.All that being said, I can see how some others may find enjoyment in this title. If you like hard-as-nails beat-'em-ups with copious amounts of gore, then this is for you. I guess I'm just too soft these days.			",195,62,3,24,7,2,9

There might have been a few babies who say its too hard but its really just a good challenge. you pick up new weapons to use over and over and even change shanks looks in campain, or play survival multiplayer.there is gore and language.

												I have not played shank 1A really competent brawler with quite sophisticated fighting mechanics that might be slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but feels really satiesfying once you've mastered it. Tight and fair controls - It is mostly your own fault when things go bad. I recommend a controlled for a better experience even though keyboard and mouse works well. Great art style and animation, similar to other klei titles. Perhaps a bit too bloody for my taste but it fits the theme. It is animated in a cartoony style but perhaps not the best game for the yonger audience due to gore and violence. The story is otherwise completely forgetable. You have two fighters that you get to play through the story. They vary slightly in play-style are based on the same mechanics. What matters more is what weapon-load you choose - I spent quite a lot of time on a certain bosses until I realized I could do much better with different weapons. Bosses are otherwise just right and are easily beaten once you've figured out what patterns they have and what weapons work best.Campaign mode is just right timewise, and then you can unlock outfits for the two characters and also play survival mode.Probably one of the better brawlers I have tried.

												Shank 2 is a beat em up sequel of Shank from the developer Klei who makes Mark of The Ninja. like Mark of The Ninja, Shank 2 has a really good animations and presentation. the humor, cutscenes and the gameplay really makes this game so enjoyable to play. the combinations of melee attacks, heavy attacks and range weapons are really good that it makes the players free to experiment with a combo that works best in certain situation. Shank 2 is a fast-paced game but it also has some slow motions that works well, it makes the players rest a little from its fast-paced world and come back again. Shank 2 successfully blends beat em up with strategy because if you play just to keep attacking, you'll end up dead. Shank 2 is a really hard game which forces the players to plan a quick strategy for successfull attacks. Shank 2's story is a combination of violence and humor. some times it's really violent and some times it's funny but Shank successfully combine both aspects to be a good game. unfortunately, Shank 2 has a very short length of Story Campaign and it doesn't really do well in telling the characters and what's happening in its world.nevertheless Shank 2 is an enjoyable game with very good gameplay, good animations and presentations. it just doesn't really have longer length and story.7.5/10			",34,16,0,4,3,0,1

												Shank 2 is a huge improvement on the underlying gameplay for the series. Whereas the original amounts to a pretty imitation of the oldschool brawler games, Shank 2 is better in all aspects (+new coop survival) and stands on its own as a worthy entry for this genre. Dear Esther may be more artsy but this is the better game for the same amount of money.  You wouldn't go wrong paying 15 for this even, in fact that's what they should've charged!

												If Kratos was made in the modern times, this is what he'd look like in Shank 2. Shank 2 is one of the many games I bought during my first Steam Summer Sale and I didn't want the games I bought to collect virtual dust, so Shank 2 was one of the first games I played. And from the moment I played it, I was glad that I gave this game a try. From the art style to the fighting game like combo system, this game is fast-paced and awesome to play. From the many times that I've died playing Shank 2 was because I made silly noobish mistake such as not dodging quick enough but once I got the ryhthm of how the game played, I died less during my first playthrough. Some levels in this game requires fast reflexes for the enemies because the multiple of enemies and how fast some of them move can be overwhelming because many can come from different directions and can be somewhat difficult to dodge the attacks.My only issue with the game is that there's another character that you play in the game called Corina but you only play as her in one mission of the story and never play as her again. Also the final boss is surprisingly easy. From the other boss in this game I died probably more than 5 times because it took a while to get their patterns down but for the final boss I only died once and learn his patterns easily beating him the second time. Playing Shank 2 was such an awesome experience for me that during my first playthrough, I had to stop myself from trying to 100% this game playing it the first time lol XD. But when I play through this game a second time, I'll definitely try to collect every unlockable costumes and achivements in this game.Like I said earlier, if your looking for a fast paced game and a fan of beat em ups, I strongly reccomend giving Shank 2 a try and I hope you have a awesome time playing it as will. :D			",132,12,1,6,1,1,6

												Shank thought he could relax after killing the assassins responsible for killing his wife, but he was wrong.Now some of his friends in Latin America are now in danger of being killed by a ruthless dictator and his maniacal henchmen, including a mad doctor, and he once more must take up arms and kill countless goons to save not only his friends but also an entire country from being plunged into a dictatorship where even more civilians could possibly die.Run, jump, gun and mutilate your way through the various levels before the final showdown with the dictator himself.Do you have what it takes to guide Shank through the madness?

												Already own this game on the PS3, bought it again on PC. As epic as it was on PS3. And as hard :)Yes, you could prbably finish the game in under 3 hours on Normal mode, but it'll probably take you 7 hours minimum on Hard mode. Even though it is a simple, short 2D side-scroller game, it is still loads of fun, and you can put in tons of hours into it, especially wiht the Survivial Mode. Survival is best with 2 players, but it is still fun playing solo. The only downside to the game is the fact that you can no longer block incoming attacks anymore, and that you can now only dodge attacks. This isn't a deal breaker, but it is something that I personally think hurts the gameplay a bit. But otherwise, this is a must own for any Indie game fan, and those who don't like indie games shoudl really try this amazing game out!			",61,4,1,0,2,0,2

												Story mode isn't particularly long, but gameplay is extremely fast-paced and fun. Lots of weapon variety and endless replay value in survival mode. Local multiplayer in survival mode is particularly entertaining.			",92,3,3,3,4,0,1
