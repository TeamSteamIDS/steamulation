TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Max Payne 2: Fall of Max Payne is the sequel to the critically acclaimed and award winning 2001 game, Max Payne. Max Payne 2 is a Third-Person action shooter developed by Remedy Entertainment which was acquired by Rockstar Games whose notable works include the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise.Once again the player steps into the shoes of Max Payne, a New York City Detective who, after the events of the first game, went on a downward spiral both in career and personal life, struggling with the death of his family and his newly formed Pain Killer addiction (the direct result of the pain killers taken by the player in the first game to regenerate lost health). While Max is investigating a series of murders and assassinations, Max encounters Mona Sax, a textbook femme fatale who was presumed dead from the first game. Follow Max and Mona's adventure through New York City and discover a conspiracy behind a Mob War between two rival Mafia groups and a deadly team of hitmen called 'The Cleaners' in this film noir love story.PROS:+ Significant and highly noticeable improvements on the graphics, animation and texture quality from the first title+ Better sounds, voice acting and sound track+ Improvements on the innovative Bullet Time game mechanic+ Great locations and level design which goes well with the better graphical fidelity+ Graphic Novel style cutscenes are back and with better delivery+ Expanded weapon variety+ Mission variety+ Challenging Difficulty levels (the game provides a good challenge on any difficulty setting)+ Adaptive difficulty if the player is on Easy Mode. (AI gets toned down and pain killers heal more if the player dies too much on Easy Mode.)+ Magnificent story that surpasses even the first game+ World is ALIVE and more immersive.CONS:- VERY Short (I personally completed it within 5-6 hours)OTHER NOTE:- Replayability: - Linear storytelling is FINE, its a good way to tell a narrative story in a directed pace but Linearity does sacrifice replayability at degree because, after finishing the story, there is little reason to play through it a second time around. Like a good action movie, it's best to be played again after some time has passed. (Copy Pasted from my Max Payne 1 Review)CONCLUSION:I rarely call something a 'MASTERPIECE' but after playing through the whole game, twice (once on my Xbox back in 2005, once again on my PC 2013), and sitting here writing this review, I cannot find any more CONs aside from the short story. Contrast this to the PROS I listed, I can easily say we have an almost perfect action game. Max Payne 2 blends perfectly the immersive storytelling of a good action movie, and the dynamic adrenaline pumping gameplay of a video game.MUST BUY and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for both new and old fans a like. I do, however, not recommend you buy this game solo but instead, BUY the MAX PAYNE BUNDLE which includes the Original Max Payne and Max Payne 2. At $15, this is a game worth your time and money.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a direct sequel to Remedy Entertainment's critically acclaimed 2001 third-person shooter Max Payne and picks up after the events of its predecessor. The game could be best described as noir-style love story, in contrast to the first that was more of a film noir revenge tale.NYPD detective Max Payne is once again the primary protagonist, although a few very interesting segments sees you play as his love interest, Mona Sax. Max Payne 2 borrows a lot from the original and there are enough hints and references to the previous game which helps keep the narrative interesting and fresh for old-timers.Max Payne 2 is, in many ways, a huge improvement over Max Payne 1. Gone is that constipated look  replaced instead with full 3-D modeled faces. The game also sees an immense graphical upgrade with excellent usage of the Havok 2.0 physics engine. Game characters are more detailed while environment objects, including enemies, tumble and fall very realistically.Gameplay is largely the same with a few refinements to combat. Bullet Time sees an upgrade allowing you to dodge bullets and reload quickly, with a cool whirling animation to go alongside it. This results in a higher body count but also makes gun-play segments a whole lot less challenging. Level designs are, once again, brilliant with mission locales ranging from warehouses, mansions, hospitals and clubs to constructions sites. And the enemy AI is, on a whole, pretty decent although in a few instances they end up killing themselves with their own grenade. The plot is riveting with almost non-stop action throughout. The storyline unfolds in much the same fashion as the original. The usage of graphic novel comics complete with melodramatic over-the-top dialogue sucks you into the game's environment. If anything, the writing is more polished this time around with lots of witty and philosophical quotes thrown into the mix. The story focuses too much upon the love-story angle though which tends to get a bit jarring towards the end. In comparison, the original Max Payne's story, although slightly rough around the edges, was more dark, grittier and compelling than its sequel. For a game that is over twelve years old, Max Payne 2 still holds remarkably well today. It overshadows the original in many aspects while also introducing a few cool mechanics of its own. Simplified mechanics make for interesting combat segments making Max Payne 2 one of the very best third-person shooters ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most emotional games on steam. On the outside, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne looks like a generic shooter with a cool mechanic. But when you start to play and dig into the lore of Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne you just feel like crying. 10/10 without a doubt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne might have started it all, but Max Payne 2 perfected it. Of all three entries this one is my favourite. I loved it enough that when it came on Steam I ended up rebuying the damn thing despite owning a rather beautiful physical copy beforehand.The story is knit so tight and full of noir that whatever comes after feels like they are trying to hard. Max Payne also defines adult emo to such an amazing level that one is tempted to start cutting one's wrist while desperately trying to find the adult equivalent of Linkin Park. That is of course easily remedied by the awesome and moody track that plays in background as you weave through the dark New York city trying to find closure to all the demons that live in Max's head.It may have aged, and it doesn't offer the same high fidelity as its modern counterparts, but when you get to the nitty gritty, Max Payne 2 is one of the finest shooter in the market.If only Max Payne 3 could have followed in its footsteps.

												One of the most interesting aspects of Max Payne 2 was how much it expanded upon MP1, but also how different a game it was in general.While both games borrow from old detective stories and graphic novels. Max Payne 2 is moreso inspired by romance stories. The main character is portrayed far more realistically, as a depressed lonely individual who has gotten everything he wanted at the end of the last game. And then a girl from his past re-enters his life and thrusts him on another adventure into the night. I wouldn't say the story was perfect, it is a little short and doesn't have the same mythological basis as the first. But it does it's job and I respect Remedy for attempting to do something different.The gameplay was greatly improved, with a true physics engine and reworked AI. The maps were also made a lot larger and the action a lot more upscale. With friendly AI and a survival mode referred to as ""Dead Man Walking"". Max Payne 2 was a great way to finish Remedy's involvement with the franchise, and is truly a smashing successor to the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is a classic game, just like the first game. The gameplay is really simple: shoot your way through the levels, using your ability to slow down the time. With or without mods, this game still stands out and never gets old. Even if you've played Max Payne 3, you should love MP2.JUST FREAKING PLAY IT FOR ALL THAT IS HOLY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A vastly superior game to the already promising original. This game refines in all the right ways, tells a great story and feels great to play. Even by today's standards. It might still be the best implementation of bullet time in a game. It also ditches some of the more clunky aspects of the original - leading to it being more timeless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2, like its predecessor here on Steam, requires that you run it in compatability mode, Windows ME/2000 (I'm currently on Windows 8.1 64-bit and it ran perfectly fine in compatability mode).The actual game is pretty fun, and it has a couple interesting dialogues - more so than the predecessor. The overall plot feels a bit lame if you compare it to the first game, but it has a lot of redeeming moments, and the gameplay and graphics have both been finetuned a lot since the first game, which makes it very enjoyable. It is definitely worth a play if you haven't played it before. As many classics, however, you have to keep in mind that the game is set in a different era of gaming, and that the gameplay isn't the same standard as it is today.If you plan on playing Max Payne 3, you will definitely want to pick this one and the first one up as well.

												-----DISCLAIMER FOR WIN8/WIN8.1/WIN10 USERS------I had several Problems with this game on Windows 10, but after some research, it runs fine on Windows 10.1. Run in Compatibility mode (Windows XP)2. Rename the install Folder to smth without spaces like: ""MaxPayne2""3. Then in your steamapps folder find appmanifest_12150 and edit the install dir line to match your renamed folder (you might have to close Steam to do this or restart Steam)4. Disable Steam Overlay for this game5. Make sure everything stays the same after Steam restart -> sometimes Steam changes stuff backAfter this steps (and propably 2 Hours looking throug forums -> which is why i decided to post this review) it runs great.-----GAMEPLAY-------The game itself is a masterpiece, equaly in storytelling as well as in gameplay.-I really enjoy the fact that you die very quickly, especially on harder difficulties, which makes this game challening.-The developers designed the gun fights to be realistic -> Bullet to the head enemy dies (same for you) -> no real bosses like in the first game.-This game is really skill rewarding and the more you play it the easier it will get, to a point at which you switch fluently through bullet time, bullet time jumps and real time shooting.-Great arsenal of weapons -> all feel and play different-Overall it's a great fast paced third person shooter, that gets better everytime you play it.-----STORY-------Great Story (dont want to spoiler anything) but if you are into the story I would recommend playing Max Payne 1 first.-I recommend finishing it on hardest difficulty for a suprise ending;)-NOIR comic strips to tell the story is just AWESOME-Funny dialogs between enemys-----SOUND------Awesome music -> gives me goosebumps everytime I'm in the main menu-Good weapon sounds -> you can tell weapons apart just by hearing them shoot (helps to decide how to fight)-Good voiceacting -> Max's voice is super badass-----GRAPHICS------This game still looks amazing for it's age and still has some graphical parts that even newer games can't get right (talking about mirrors -> just try it yourself and you know what i mean;) )-Overall this game aged amazingly well.-Nightmare levels and NOIRE comics have an oustanding artwork.-----CONCLUSION-----Easily one of the best games ever madePlayed this gem in my youth and finished it several times on various difficulties.Was so happy to find it on Steam :)Finished it 4 times as I'm writing this review right now and as you can tell from my playtime it is a rather short game (at least after you finished it several times :P)In my opinion everybody should have played this game and it is a must have in every STEAM library10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter that feels like a noir graphic novel.I enjoyed Max Payne 2 like I was watching the season 2 of a TV series: One episode leading to another. The protagonist is a cop that lost his wife and son, then is framed and hunted as a murderer. Anyone who experienced the pain of loving and losing can identify with this. He tries to keep his sanity and kill the demons inside his head. This time, he is not in it for vengeance. Now it’s for “love”, but ultimately to find his “true self”.To me it was not an action game with casual narrative moments, but a narrative with casual action moments.Positive points+ Great story.+ Slow motion.Negative points- Too much shooting.

												Taking a step forward deep into the chaotic endless black desert of insanity.Max Payne 2 eventhough it stands on common ground it really has many differences from its predecessor. Something that made the hard core fans of the first game not like it too much at first.However for me Max Payne 2 really stands out of the library and into my golden list of masterpieces and on the throne with the rest of my most fav titles ever.The game has obvious graphical advancements engine-wise, physics-wise, texture-wise and gameplay-wise.The environmental design stays along the lines of the same dark concept the first game was in and goes deep in the underground paths of life of a world filled with corruption.The design and overall direction gets you straight into the mood of a romance/mafia-drama with strong storytelling elements, incredible naration and amazing voice acting.The character models are completelly different from the first game. I really really loved Timothy Gibbs for Max and Kathy Tong for Mona.Also the gameplay is really smooth, easier to survive compared to the first game mechanism-wise, smarter AI, better slo-mo bullettime feature, better gun design and scripting.What impressed me most about this game is the movie-like quality of the naration and the perfectly scripted quotes in it.The game feels like a dramatic movie that sucks you down to its darkness which bewitches you to not wanna get out.Transforming the line into a blur to what's black or white, what's good or bad, what's life or death, the unique experience of following Max Payne through the events of the game leaved me beyond satisfied.The game also supports mods, and there are tons out there, which increases its replayability value.Glad to have played this game for once more and totally recommending and urging you all who haven't, to buy this asap and play it now. Especially if you are into action/mafia genre games with a strong taste of Noir Drama.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I begin? Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne is a fantastic experience from start to end. Especially if you have the Cinema 2.0 Mod which I used in my playthrough of the game. (The Mod really enhances the experience). Storywise this game is interesting, compelling, and tells a dark tale of Max Payne. Max lost his wife and kid in the previous game and in this one he loses even more (I'm not going to spoil it). The story is told not through cutscenes like in modern games but through something like out of a Graphic Novel. The game is told through 3 Acts all having about 6 to 8 Chapters.Gameplay wise this game has it perfected. It's an old school shooter. It's fun, fast, and can be difficult at times (Except in the last chapter where there is practically painkillers around every damn corner) and Bullet Time is a fantastic feature which allows you to slow down time and shoot in slow-mo just like in an action movie (You can even dodge and jump forward in Slow-Mo). There is also a lot of guns (Even a Minigun) but you lose them in certian chapters and have to collect them again. You do all of this in Third Person which makes it even cooler seen Max dodge bullets and shoot punks.Graphics still hold up today. This game looks great and very little loading screens (only when you get to a new chapter) and character models looks great. It's not any Next-Gen Graphics but it's great vanilla and looks even better with Graphical Mods you can download.Do I recommend this game? Yes. It's a great game.Should you buy it right now or wait for a sale? Buy it now if you have the cash unless you're really tight on money then wait for a sale.Heres the Download link to the mod I used in my playthrough: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cinemaRating: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

“Like all the bad things in my life,it started with the death of a woman.”Criminally underrated and an often unrecognised milestone for the third-person shooter and gaming as a whole, Max Payne was quite the contrast to everything that had preceded it. While gritty and dark level design was apparent in the likes of Quake, Fallout and Thief, the concept of film noir had yet to be truly tested within the format of a video game. During a time in which the first-person shooter reigned supreme and the so-called “golden age” neared its end, a small Finnish studio decided to try something bold and new.Enter Remedy Entertainment and the landmark that is Max Payne.Armed with a turned-up leather jacket, a weapon in each hand and a tonne of pills, you return as everyone’s favourite anti-hero detective and are unleashed once again upon the filthy underbelly of New York City. Caught within the throes of a rapidly deteriorating gang war and still gripped by grief of his young family’s death, your journey to break the cycle of crime will only lead Max further into the darkness and confrontation he has tried to avoid for so long. As both friend and foe make their play from the shadows and the stakes continue to be raised however, how far you are willing to push both the man and the city towards redemption is no longer for you to decide. Prepare for unforeseen consequences.  Best described as the equivalent of AC/DC’s Hells Bells, the core gameplay of the Max Payne series is some of the best yet seen in a shooter and, without a doubt, as stylish as the influences it wears so well. From leaping through the air with specks of debris trailing in your path as you clear out a room of enemies, to running and gunning your way through an entire building of psyched-up addicts, ‘satisfying’ doesn’t even begin to capture how incredible the mayhem is to experience. John Woo would be proud.With their only prior release in the form of a charming little DOS-based racer called Death Rally, the low-budget origins of Remedy’s classic continues to demonstrate just how inspired and creative a small team can be. Depicting such a dreary and seemingly hopeless world that often veers from poetic self-reflection to the downright comical is a testament to the love put into crafting the world and the developer’s skill as a whole.The series’ iconic cutscenes, (once home to Remedy’s friends and even Sam Lake himself), have taken more of a backseat this time around, favouring in-game rendering for most of the set pieces on offer. Admittedly, the transition between the two can be more jarring than usual when the graphic novel style is forced to cover through implication what the engine is unable to handle, but visually the game has held up admirably after all these years. Thanks to the higher production value, MP2 certainly isn’t bland and being transported into the depths of a dream sequence and Max’s tortured mind will quickly remind you of this, if the brilliantly moody soundtrack and fluid animation hasn't done so already.“Max, we gotta stop meeting like this.”Alongside the character of the city itself, Mona Sax is definitely the standout, with her well established femme fatale dynamic with Max carrying over from the first game. The excellent performances by Timothy Gibbs, Kathy Tong, James McCaffrey and Wendy Hoopes respectively deliver the top-notch voice acting alongside the equally stellar cast of both the new and returning characters. (Who could forget  or Lords and Ladies?)As one of the most fascinating and tragic relationships in gaming, the ultimately fatal attraction between the two characters is incredibly well-written, with such nuance stealing the show. Here’s looking at you, kid.The few complaints that I could make generally come down to uneven difficulty and some hilarious physics moments, but these are mostly negligible. The changes to bullet time might be considered sacrilege by some, but electing for a more fast-paced than methodical approach hasn't hurt combat in the slightest, with the sheer power of the many weapons on offer providing some of the best action of its time. MP2 is still quite short, but the clear and concise direction that it takes throughout redeems the amount of hours, particularly if you throw in some mods or a 'Dead on Arrival' run too. “I had a dream of my wife. She was dead. But it was all right.”Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a remarkable achievement in nearly all aspects of its design and a worthy follow-up to the original, even more so when compared to the countless pale imitations or lifeless big budget titles that have emerged since. As masters of their craft, Remedy have more than fulfilled the series' goal of translating film noir alongside the impressive technical action and produced an enduring icon of the gaming industry.While not exactly a “joy” to experience, wake yourself up from the American Dream and embrace one of the best third-person shooters ever made. Thumbs up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 came out eleven years ago so it seems odd to do a review of it. I'm sure that not exactly very many of you are going to be swayed to buy the game or anything like that. Yet I still want to recommend an absolutely fantastic mod that caught my eye for the game and I have been playing through. Payne Evolution takes a classic game and makes it even better by refining it with some of the features and improvements of Max Payne 3. Every gun is replaced by a new variant from Max Payne 3, new dialogue is is introduced when Max picks up painkillers (""I was self-medicating, like a good American"") and the MP3 bullet time effects are introduced. New sounds are added for so many things, of especially good quality being the new weapon sound effects. It really is a wholesale improvement on what was already an amazing game. Here is a link to the mod: http://www.moddb.com/mods/payne-evolutionI was surprised by just how much fun I had with the classic film-noir love story. The game holds up really well too in terms of aging. The revolutionary at the time physics and environmental interactivity is still really impressive. The level design is something else (it's really refreshing to have this big wide open level design to explore, in stark comparison to the heavily scripted nature of modern games) and the characterisation is strong. Like Max, you find yourself falling in love with Mona and hating Vlad just as much as he does. The dialogue is top-notch, with Max's brooding and dark outlook on life feeling a lot more original and fleshed out than Max Payne 3's lines. The comic book style presentation feels really unique too, a fine example of not so heavy-handed storytelling. The game at times made me miss some of the traits I associate with games in the days of yore, truth be told. The original game's excellence is further enhanced with the the brilliance of the Payne Evolution mod. Hell, if anything can vindicate that then probably the best moment is when the mod maker took inspiration (well, blatantly copied really) the song for for the final sequence of Max Payne 3, which is incredibly haunting and well fitting, and added it to the final sequence of Max Payne 2. If anything, it fits even better.

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is an action story driven game, created by Remedy Entertainment (Creators of Quantum Break and Alan Wake) and published by Rockstar Games. This game has a serious, dark noire and comic strip storyline feel which is the strongest aspect about Max Payne franchise, it's similar concept to Watchmen movie. The game sets after the predecessor's (Max Payne) timeline, causing Max Payne became a hard-boiled criminal. The graphics has been outdated in today's standards. The gameplay seems to be unique back in the day. Max Payne's franchise are known for a signature mechanic, ""Bullet Time"". Bullet time slows down time and pick off all targets with ease. There are some technical flaws about this game, the platform level design is frustrating me because I tried to jump from gap to gap and the character jumps vertically than leaping it but thank god you can use the dive animation to get another ledge. They don't have sort of objective marker because I don't know where I am supposed to go, so I have to back track the route once I have a key or easily get lost.+ Pros+ Dark, intriguing and plot-twist storyline with comic strip and noire feel+ Characters are interesting with excellent voice acting+ Bullet time+ Checkpoints or manual save system are generous+ More arsenals to kill with- Cons- Latest DirectX drivers are not supported.- Easy to get lost when trying to find a path, so backtrack is recommended like I do- Graphics are outdated in today's standardsFor this game's review, I recommend this game if you want to try it or one of those gamers who loves storytelling like myself. This is one of my favourite franchise to play because of the storyline and the bullet time. But I was really sad that this game is no longer supported with later DirectX drivers. This game doesn't disappoint outside technical issues. The final score is 9 out of 10, a solid recommendation. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Max Payne 2: The Fall Of Max Payne			* 8/10A direct sequel for the tragedy of Max Payne.Back as a cop once again thanks to Senator Alfred Woden's influence, Max is following a case about a criminal gang disguised as cleaners. This new epsode will take us to old places, old friends and will uncover some dirty secrets. Gameplay follows the first max payne, a 3rd person view action with bullet time, and the story is told by Max with comic pages, as already happened before. One again the game is divided in 3 acts with chapters preceded by some prologue dream sessions.The dark noir atmosphere is always strong, with urban ambiences, old known locations such as the RagnaRock, and other new locations. Now levels are more articulated, details rich and filled with Sam Lake... I mean side stories disguised as Sam La... I mean, TV series. This might sound dumb or useless, but creating a world in a world helps in making it more real and credible.The engine is an improved and updated version of Max Payne's MaxFX, so now, besides a general graphic update, we can have real 3d face expressions in place of the old 2d flat faces. Too bad they're way less expressive now. Now the story isn't being told with comics alone but there are more scenes in-game, especially action scenes rendered and studied with a great direction as usual.Truth be told everything in this chapter is well done and studied, the story, plot twists, engine and gameplay. The problem is it doesn't innovate much the game as much as expected, as we'll mostly see characters and places from the previous title, and facts in the story will essentially be the same, or follow the same structure established in the first title. The only innovation lies in the fact we won't be playing as Max in a bunch of chapters, where we'll move a characters moving along with Max and catching up with him.Considering the age of this game it might give some minor troubles when you launch it, mainly incompatibilities with modern OSs (Such as Windows 10), which can be easily solved with compatibility mode. Another issue could be with integrated GPUs, it recognized my laptop's intel GPU but not my nVidia GPU. Luckily my Intel GPU was performing enough to handle MP2 maxed out at 90 FPS or more, so I didn't even had to try to force it to run with my nVidia.+++PROs+++ SEQUEL. A sequel of the first game worth its title, with the same good aspects such as bullet time, good plot, comics, updated engine and a great direction for cutscenes.---CONs--- SEQUEL. Unfortunately this sequel brings quality without innovation as gameplay and even the story, despite being well written and with plot twists, seems like a repeated formula from the first title. MINOR COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. The age of the game brings some minor compatibility issues such as forced windowed game, or unrecognized GPUs. Luckily none of them represent a serious issue and can be easily solved to play smoothly.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""When entertainment turns into a surreal reflection of your life, you're a lucky man if you can laugh at the joke. Luck and I weren't on speaking terms."" - Max Payne Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne - a noir love story.The ingredients list, the texture, the flavour, even the ending. What you get couldn't be more written on the tin if it tried. Which is both its selling point and its main detractor. As a game, it's excellent. The pacing is seamless, the mechanics responsive, the direction flawless. Where the first game gave you a tenuous dripfeed of bullettime, the sequel drowns you in it - each encounter usually ending in an invincible assault on wolves rendered sitting ducks as the sands of time become a suggestion and not a command - where even the default pistols quickly down the single enemy type, putting enough bullets in brains to say you're sharpening lead.On top of the quickly-recharging ""I Win"" meter, you have your spammable bullet-time dodge that doesn't use meter, but is balanced by the recovery frames meaning that you will die using it. It doesn't get used often.Weapons themselves are bog-standard. Pistols, rifles, shotguns, just about everything you could expect. It's never in danger of getting too inventive. A trait that plagues the game. The noir love story is fine, it's okay, it drives the game. But this was the sequel to Max Payne, the meta-deconstruction deliberate trainwreck that balanced insanity with quotable lines. Just about everything memorable about Max Payne 2's setting, details and dialogue is a direct reference to the permanent constipated grimace writing of the first game. It brings its own comparatively muted flavour to the table - you have optional TV shows that parody the game itself, along with a slurry of easter eggs and interactable objects. But every vestige of interest is shunted to the side like an unwanted child, a quality applicable to much of The Fall of Max Payne.""As surely as the bullet rips through the victim's flesh, organ and bone, it shatters the image of the man who presses the trigger."" - Max Payne The OST is fantastic, but only spikes up when it feels like it and tends to feel totally out of place, a trippy mix of tunes blasting while you're idly checking dead bodies for painkillers. The periods of calm between the firefights, where you're just wandering around interacting with stuff, don't wear out their welcome (especially compared to some of these recent games that slow you down to a crawl to compensate for that being their sole gameplay) but honestly there's not enough of them compared to the samey-looking construction rooms full of goons they're happy to throw at you.On the flipside, there's no real bossfights either. The one at the end is a physics puzzle. Combine the two and you have a game where neither the climactic moments nor the downtime manage to satisfy.There's a couple of points that are straight improvement over the first game. Especially in regards to compatibility - these days, Max Payne 1 is a bit of a chore to get running. Max Payne 2 looks better, runs better, and works straight out of the box. It's even compatible with the Steam Overlay, you don't see that often with games from the same era. Even difficulty-wise it's an absolute improvement - while the first game was all about abusing the coded accuracy drop while roll-strafing, the sequel lets you handle enemies with a whole lot more grace and style.Even if it does tend to come down to ""whoever lands a shot first wins"". Get used to savescumming if your reflexes are as bad as mine.Max Payne 2 is a great game worth playing. A noir love story that rides on the adrenaline-bloodlines of New York. Even if it does lose quite a bit of the magic from the first.""I had a dream of my wife.She was dead.But it was alright."" ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My Personal Score: 3/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: none experienced during playthroughsMax Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne improves on everything which made the first game great and even surpasses it in some aspects. The gameplay isn't as awkward as before thanks to improved hitboxes and bullet trajectories, a sense of realism surrounds the game because of physics simulations like ragdoll effects, and the identity of the series has been given a new facelift thanks to higher production values. Overall, an excellent action game that's worthy of the Max Payne name and fans will be happy with this installment. However, if you're new to the series or have only played the Rockstar-made entry, you won't get as much from this game and everything will just look like a confusing mess. Max Payne 2 is a story-centric game and it builds on what fans and players of the first game already knows. This time around, the true intentions of the first game's major players are shown and reveals a new side to them, making them more believable rather than being a one-sided cliche of a character. The story focuses on Max after the events of the first title as he reflects on his past choices and how he copes up with the decisions that he's made. I highly suggest that new players play the first game or watch a recap video because without knowledge of the characters' background and the events leading up to this game, the story becomes much less impactful and you won't get much out of it because of its focus on the cast rather than plot.Improvements that I've noticed:1. Better voice actors than the first game and their performances are consistent except for some select moments.2. The new soundtrack is great, especially ""Late Goodbye"" by Poets of The Fall which is featured prominently in the game.3. Still linear but bigger levels with the inclusion of optional explorable rooms make it seem less so.4. Very serious story with comedic undertones. Sam Lake and Remedy somehow managed to make the virtual enemies that you're killing appear human in nature rather than just fodder that blocks your way. They laugh, they share jokes and share experiences with their friends, they also play the piano real good - very small details delivered in a very funny way but it still makes a lot of difference for the personal story that they're presenting to the player.And there you have it.

												""The Fall of Max Payne"". Funny, I don't remember there ever being a ""Rise of Max Payne"". These games are about a man who lost everything, there was never a rise...was there? Sometime in-between completing Max Payne 1 and the sequel, I finally watched John Woo's The Killer. While a classic in its own right due to the intense shoot-outs, I was especially impressed by its usage of tragedy. Ah Jong is an assassin, but he has morals and a sense of honor. Early on in the film, he accidentally blinds Jennie - a nightclub singer - during a hired hit. Thus, he takes on one last job. The reward would be used for Jennie's vision-saving operation. However, Jong is betrayed by his superiors. (SPOILERS)Over the course of the movie, Ah Jong befriends and eventually partners with Inspector Li Ying. Before the climatic battle, Jong asks Ying to promise that if/when he dies, his corneas be used to save Jennie's eyesight. So even if worst came to worst, Jennie could hopefully return to a normal life.  Unfortunately, in the last minutes of the movie, he's shot in the eyes by the villain. Before Jong succumbs to his wounds, he can hear Jennie's cries. Due to their blindness, neither of them can find one another, despite being just a few feet apart. Not only does Jong die, but his noble sacrifice is denied. Everything he worked (and killed) for over the course of the movie was for naught. Although Ying survives, he has lost good friends, and becomes disillusioned with the concept of justice. Shortly after starting a new game in Max Payne 1, you're treated to the horrifying deaths of Max's wife and child. As time passes, he is framed for murder, wipes out half the criminal underworld, and develops an addiction to painkillers. However, if you've played through the game, then you can recall the final lines: ""Woden grinned smugly. It was the grin of a winner. That made two of us."" Max Payne is a winner. He succeeded in his mission of vengeance. For us, the audience, that's a satisfying end. So in its own way, Max Payne 1 chronicled the rise, so now we must witness the fall. Tragedy isn't just when a person dies, it's also when their hopes, dreams, and emotions are extinguished.All that said, there is a lot of joy to be found in Max Payne 2. It's a twisted game, one that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. This sense of humor keeps the game from coming off as overly dour. It feels especially rewarding to fans of the first title, because they'll pick up on all of the references. It's the kind of humor that fits the tone of the story. It's dark and depressing, but it also has a very distinct noir quality to it. Everything is interconnected, and you get the sense that Max might just be a small part of a much larger story. The ""TV shows"" that can be seen in various points of the game are a reflection of this. MP2 is a little shorter than its predecessor, but there's more imagery to absorb in every scene.As for the actual videogame, I believe the combat mechanics are a marked improvement over the first entry. The concept hasn't changed much. You run through every level shooting all of the bad guys. Where this game differs is it showcases a bit more nuance, and a higher level of confidence. One of the first notable changes is that Max takes less damage. This brings it more in-line with the John Woo movies, where good guys shrug off bullets. A couple shot-gun blasts are still usually enough to bring Max from very healthy to dead, but occasional stray shots don't take large chunks of life either. This change gives Remedy a little more freedom when designing encounters. They're more involved, and there tends to be more memorable situations. Max Payne 1 was compelling enough even when combat was just ""room full of thugs"". The sequel changes things up, and it works very well. I don't even hate the escort missions, well...maybe I still hate them a little. These sections run parallel with some interesting and amusing ideas, so I guess I'll let them slide.While I'm not sure if I can attribute this to experience with the prequel, or actual changes, the ""bullet-time"" system also feels substantially better. When Max slows everything down, his heightened reflexes really come into their own. It's really fun running into an area, triggering the bullet-time, and wasting everyone. The first enemy is still flying through the air from Max's shotgun blast as he kills two more men in rapid succession. Occurences such as this are always welcome. Max also pulls off some sweet reloads while in bullet-time. One other minor but welcome change is that when diving and shooting, Max can continue firing while lying on the ground, until his clip is empty. This game uses Havok physics, but the enemies are properly weighted. This makes it so that kills carry some semblance of realism to them, but the few times where enemies soar, or get knocked around in massive explosions, are still very amusing.On the surface, MP2 comes off as the easier game, but it's balanced out by more thoughtful encounters and harrowing situations. There's a bit more creativity to throw around, and hopefully it keeps players from hitting F5/F9 so much (no guarantees though). Unlike the first game, there is a distinct lack of ""boss enemies"" aka ""thugs who take a lot more bullets to kill"". I consider this another positive. Also, just when you really think you've got it down, there are still more difficulties and extra modes to explore. Don't forget to look for the minor details, like people complaining when you stand in-front of them, while they're trying to watch TV.Basically, if you played through the first Max Payne, you're required to check out the sequel. It's a phenomenal game, and features some of the best third-person shooting action around. The story is fantastic as well, and MP2's usage of various interactive elements really sells the ""games-as-art"" idea. Oh and don't forget the wide-screen fix.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi! so, first of all, I just want to say sorry for my english, tho I really want to give my opinion about this game. ITS EXCELENT. This must be one of the best games I ever playd in my entire life. It might not have the best graphics, but it sure have a very good, sad and dramatic story that makes you have so much feelings for the good and for the bad in the entire game. its sure short, I have to admit... the first game took me like 2 hrs to finish and the the second around 3 hrs... but together those were 5 hrs of being around drama all the time and just concentrate in getting closer and closer to figgur out who is Max Payne, his personality and his life story.... about the gameplay, ITS FREAKING AWESOME! The movement in this game, the skills of the main character and everything is just perfect. being abale to play with almost every kind of weapon you can think about and do some cool tricks with the character, one of them is just make the time slower and you can hear only your heart beats and bullets droping to the ground after you shot... which is very very cool! I dont think I can add anything else... I kind of clear my opinion about this game. so go a head and buy it on the next sale.. trust me, you want to play this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was almost morning, waking up from the American Dream. We are willing to suffer, to die for the things we care about. For love, for the right choices, Because of her, I had solved the case. My case. All of it. Story Two years after the events of the previous game, Max Payne is a NYPD detective. Senator Alfred Wooden has kept his promise, and released Max from his history of violence. Max got back to working for the NYPD to keep himself busy in life. After a series of events, Max investigates a group of contract killers called: The Cleaners. Mona Sax, who was presumed dead, is under investigation for killing Senator Gates, a member of ""The Inner Circle"" from the previous game. The leader of the Russian mob, and Max's old friend Vladimir Lem, finds himself in a heavy mob war with Vinnie Gognitti. Max is determined to find out about the unexpected return from Max's love interest Mona Sax, and who The Cleaners are working for, and what they want. Gameplay Max Payne 2 plays very similar to its first installment. The new and polished bullet-time is back, and better than ever. The animations of the bullet-time just look better, and the bullet-time diving won't lower your stamina bar. The game has like its previous installment 3 parts, each with seven to nine chapters. Next to playing Max, you'll also play as Mona Sax for a few chapters, making the characters bond together even better. There are more guns to choose from, and are in my opinion far more fun to use. Conclusion Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is in my opinion a better game than Max Payne 1. It has one of the best game stories I've ever played, and it takes a few nice twists and turns. The gameplay is amazing and fun to play, and still plays a lot like Max Payne 1. That being said, the only bit of negativity I have for the game, is that it's really short. An average gamer completes the game in six or seven hours. But the story fits perfectly in this time span, nothing needs to be added or left out. But a little bit more time to walk around and shoot is never a bad thing. Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a phenomenal game, nothing more I can say about it. 9.5/10  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game. The gameplay and graphics have been improved greatly from the first entry, however the story is not quite as good. Still good, but not great. I would say that these (Max Payne 1 & 2) are required gaming and absolutely a must-play before Max Payne 3. Who doesn't love bullet-time?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is such a perfect sequel that I almost find it difficult to recommend it without playing May Payne 1 directly before it. Both games offer complete stories, but Remedy has filled the game with details that link back to the first game in such a way that the two games feel like one single package. Max Payne 2 improves arguably every aspect of the game, bringing the graphics to more modern standards and refining the gameplay by making Max more responsive and improving his bullet time abilities. If you're only going to play one game in the series I would break my vow of playing every series in order and say to go with this one because it's just such a great game, but even if you can't get into Max Payne 1's older gameplay it's worth seeing it through just to be able to appreciate this game even a little bit more.

												Max Payne 2 offers pretty much identical gameplay to the first one. Graphics are better, but nothing to gawk over. At first glance it turned out to be more of a been there, done that type of game. It really doesn't offer anything new or innovative over the original. The one interesting piece was the tie in of a second character and being able to play certain events from the eyes of both. But it did feel a little awkward not playing as Max Payne the whole way.Like the first game, the AI is overly difficult, even on easy, which kills much of the enjoyment. Precise aim combined with unbelievable reaction times and pre-firing around corners. QuickSave is pretty much your best friend. Overall, I didn't hate it, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the first one either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favourite game on steam :) It's one of those nostalgic old games you really want in your old games collection, I myself have such games as Gta 3, Max Payne , NOLF, Mafia , Reservoir Dogs, True Crime , State of Emergency, Scarface and maany many others in my ""Nostalgic old games collection"" Yes its a teeny tiny little collection of those games I used to play years ago and they got this weird nostalgic feel to them when I got to play them again. This is one of those games. It really makes me want to watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S. again for some reason that I do not know... Same with GTA 3... Really odd... Probably just because of New York :D (Yes Liberty City seems like New York to me.)Anyway the game is great, it has some  awesome voice acting, great conversations between NPCs (Some are pretty hilarious) The death animations/Body physics in the game are pretty cool for such an old game. It has a pretty decent story also and it has a lot of replayability in my opinion that is ;)9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is the sequel to the first Max Payne game (One of the best PC games of it's time).Max Payne 2 is truly an improvment over the first one.Max is back as the titular character and so are the voices.This time he is working for the NYPD and investigating murders where Mona Sax (read fatal attraction) makes an appearence and all hell breaks loose which isn't surprising for our guy Max, after all he has a knack for finding trouble.The iconic bullet time is back with elan, it is done with much more panache and feels tight as ever.The gameplay is just top notch, gunfights feel solid and and the game nails the definite thumping sound for each weapon.Max Payne 2 is the successor to one of the best PC games of it's decade and yet it improves on it.You cant ask for much more, grab Max Payne 1 and 2 instead of 3 (piece of turd) for the real Max Payne experience.

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a third-person action shooter made by Rockstar Games, the developers of Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Bully and many more. You follow the story of Max Payne, a former DEA agent for the New York City Police Department who has trouble keeping up with his life. You will need to fight trough loads of enemies using many available weapons and skills such as slow motion. The game features 3 difficulties; Detective - Enemies and health spawns adapt you, Hard Boiled - Enemies are harder and painkillers spawn rarely, Dead On Arrival - Same as Hard Boiled but with limited saves. There are also 2 bonus difficulties; New York Minute where you need to complete the level as fast as possible and Dead Man Walking where you fight enemies in arena until you die. The game takes around 8 hours to beat depending on what difficulty you took. I really recommend buying this game, you can get it for 2.49€ or for 2.99€ in a great Max Payne 1+2 pack on sale. ═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS Pros:Fun | You will want to replay this game sooner or laterAwesome Game Mechanics | Side jumping and slow-mo make this game even better, the fact that you can do things actors do in one of those action movies makes me redo levels just so I can experience that againAddicting Soundtrack | This game has one of the best soundtracks, Main Theme is my personal favorite.Cons:Fullscreen doesn't work on Windows 7 and later | You can fix this by opening task manager, setting it to More Details, using a dropdown arrow on Max Payne process, selecting the process and using option Maximize. If that doesn't work Google is your friend.Confusing Story | I played the game few times and I still can't catch the story which really frustrates me.Dumb AI | NPCs will often fail to do simple tasks or they will just run in gunfire by themselves═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING This game is for everyone that likes action shooters. I rate the game 8/10, would accidentally slow-mo myself from a building again! ═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												Max Payne 2 The Fall of Max Payne is one of those games that people hate and love. On the one hand you have the multitudes who proclaim that it's noir style is completely groundbreaking and that the storytelling stands in a league of it's own. On the other hand you have the many who say that it's nothing more than hype and that at it's core Max Payne 2 is nothing more than an average shooter enticing the wannabe artsy gamers with a pseudo-deep story and pretty cinematic. You can never tell who's right in an argument like this, both sides will provide equal parts well-thought counterpoints and nonsensical fanatical rantings.Me, I really liked it. Sure the story is not as great as some proclaim but it's not the giant pile of lice infested feces that others call it. And yeah it's not 1930's French movie either but lets be honest, whether you like those kind of movies or not they'd never work as a game, the pacing is completely different.What saves the game for me is the simple fact that the gameplay is nice and solid. The shooting is fast and meaty and the slow motion gimmick that the original Max Payne brought forth to the masses still works well enough that it doesn't bother me as much as it does in other games. Now there is a mechanic that got overused in later games.There is a reason Max Payne is a name many gamers know. Beyond the story, the pretentious artsy cut scenes and all the posturing is some good and solid gameplay, and that's hard to ignore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I installed MP2 right after I finished the first game and must say, although MP1 is cool as hell, it looks like a demo version.MP2 is polished in every way and the gameplay is more fluid and enjoyable than in the previous installment and lost nothing of his charm. The graphics are still pretty nice and you can even make them better by plenty of mods available.After so many years this game is still a must for all 3rd person action oriented players.

Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max PayneI lied to myself that it was over. I was still alive, my loved ones were still dead. It wasn't over.General OverviewFiring a gun is a binary choice. You either pull the trigger or you don't... Max Payne has been taken by the police and is about to face charges for his killing spree. However, he is cleared of all charges, thanks to his relationship with a very influential member of society, Senator Alfred Woden. A few years have passed, and Max has returned to work for the NYPD as a homicide detective. During a routine murder investigation he finds himself face-to-face with the fugitive Mona Sax, a woman he thought was dead. Max and Mona team up to solve the answers to Max's past that left his wife and child dead.My Own ViewsAn incredible leap in gameplay and graphics just 1 year after the release of the first game. The story does not dissapoint. Starting off with the cleaners and finding out Mona is alive (Its not a spoiler its on the game description) dealings with the inner circle and Alfred Woden. Meeting people from the first game, Vladimir Lem & Vinnie Gognitti. Leading up to a massive climax, dark and gritty as in the first.This time the gunplay and bullet time is far superior and you get to play as Mona as well. Certain missions you play both in alternating sequence to get to the goal.James McCaffrey reprises his role as Max and the superb poetic and dark monolougue continues.One other point about this game. It basically introduced the world to Poet's of the fall with their song Late Goodbye. If you like your Scandinavian rock/metal (I do \m/) check these guys out for some lighter rock. Late goodbye can be heard throughout the game from a janitor humming as he cleans, to a cleaner playing it on a grand piano right before (most people blow him up with a grenade) and of course the final credits.One of my favourite PC shooters of all time.Freerider-DaveThe past is a gaping hole. You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it. But it's like looking down into the grave of your love. Or kissing the mouth of a gun, a bullet trembling in its dark nest, ready to blow your head off. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those kind of rare games that ""I keep coming back"", one of the key elements of this game is immersion, every level and its attention to detail is amazing, although the level design is most of times a straight line it never gets boring. I think the core of this game is just absorbing every element of the story of this psychology thriller, like a simple tour in a heavy gritty mind of a man. That funhouse level is a perfect example that illustrates this, we simple run through this crazy madhouse fictionally inspired by a fictional tvshow inside the game, these elements try to be realistic in a way that they affect the character and complement the complexity of that fictional Noir York City. I come back to this game not because of the shooting or bullet time but because of the nightmarish feel it always leave me, the characters we interact with always seem crazy, strange and distant. The TVshows always feel like a omen of bad things to come or a satire of Max's life. Technically the physics were pretty good for it's time and the game was released with tools from the developer, something rare nowadays, so there are plenty of mods out there even total conversions. Lots of game interaction, sound design, music, everything, everything in this game was polished and worked. Great game should be preserved! culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant!

												One of the best 3rd person games to have emerged out of the 2000s.  The plot, acting, characters, voice acting and gameplay mechanics are amazing to play even a decade later.The flim noir feel to this game coupled with the hammy lines and gritty New York scene make the plot memorable and enjoyable. The landscapes, sounds, soundtrack, layout and even odd and slightly macabre portraits of the cut outs in the game make for an overally gloomy, moody and atmospheric game. The bullet-time mechanics make this a pleasure to play as you hammer away with your twin deagles in bullet-time mode.What's also really enjoyable are the game's idiosyncrasies: the Lords and Ladies television show that everyone watches with its overly hammy and campy acting; the strung out junkies and hookers who decide to join you only to last several minutes; or the old ladies who toss you a spare shotgun from their living room closet.The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and haunting with that repeating cello and accompanying orchestra. The first Max Payne introduced the gamer to bullet-time mechanics along with an equally gritty plot copuled with Max's foray into his drug-addled dreamscapes while looking for his family's killers.In the sequel, the graphics have been updated along with a continuation of the plot. I love what Remedy has done with both games. With the third Max Payne, you are granted access to way better graphics, thanks to Rockstar, but frankly the plot paled in comparison with the previous two releases.They don't make games like these anymore...10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a lot of fun playing this game, but I found it a bit disappointing after the first one TBH. Maybe it's cuz I'm older now, but the story doesn't appeal to me at all. It feels to me as if they tried very hard to capture the mood of the first (succesful) game, but kind of failed. The story feels less deep, less dramatic and not as complex as the first game.I do recommend this game, because the gameplay is just fantastic, the bullet time is better than in the first game and I just love feeling overpowered and shooting loads of bad guys in cool action sequences.Story: 6/10Gameplay: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is a solid sequel to the original Max Payne (which I highly suggest you play if you haven’t yet had the opportunity). Unlike the original however, this version is totally playable in its current state without any modifications. Back in 2003 I felt the story fell flat in comparison to the first game but on my most recent playthroughs I’ve really come to appreciate its place in the Max Payne universe. Even if you’re not into the story, pretty much all the mechanics are noticeably improved from the original while still maintaining the classic Max Payne feel. At this point the game is over a decade old so it isn’t the most beautiful thing to look at, but it’s still a great shooter with a deep story and fun, rewarding gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is... A Deserving Sequel to the Original!I reviewed the first game and I mentioned that due to the structure of the game it really doesn't age too badly. This title is the same, its aged like a fine whiskey and plays like a charm. The shooting is tighter, the locations are bigger and the bullet time is executed perfectly. The story is strong, and this is key point. Remedy did a fantastic job with MP1 by creating a dark world of mystery burdened with mafia style shootouts, and this game really comes through and supports that by bringing back the characters and filling them out further. The killer question, is it worth a purchase? Yes. Pick it up for less than £5 and you've got a steal. It came out in an era where single player games had to be long to do well, and although it picked up criticism for being too short, its a breath of fresh air compared to some current day releases.NotesNo Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Controller Support.

												It's hard to believe that Max Payne 2 came out over seven years ago. This remains one of the best third person action games ever. The first one was also good but BRUTALLY difficult at points, and Max's hilariously constipated face made for great times, but part 2--pardon the pun--remedies whatever flaws the first one had. Aside from a graphical upgrade, they changed the bullet-time mechanics to basically be Cyborg 009's acceleration mode. As one of the first games to use Havok physics aka ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics"" in conjunction with ragdoll effects, the gunfights always looked and felt unique.The other great thing about Max Payne 2 that hasn't really been explored since is the ongoing meta-narratives explored by overhearing radio broadcasts and television. A lot of it is referential to the first game, but several of the tales serve as ""Shadow Play Girls"" / ""Tales of the Black Freighter""-esque parallels to existing developments.PS: beat it on Hardest and the ending's a bit different...

Classic! Epic atmosphere of noir story.One of first games I've ever played on PC. I played it couple times already. I even played PS2 version.In my opinion, it's way better than MP1 (which I played after MP2).The only bad side of the game is that you need to apply couple fixes by yourself to make game run properly... and difficulty not unlocked from start (but I think there is cheat/workaround for that).+ epic gameplay+ good stylish 2003 graphics+ amazing film-like experience+ Bullet Time!+ level design+ it's not stiff like modern games :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story worse than the first Max Payne, MP1 ended hinting that plans for MP2 where already thought up so I expected the story to go on solidly after MP1 seemingly completely ended it..... it was not so, the story feels like there was nothing meant to come after 1, returning characters with rediculous new turns. Gameplay is improved a lot though, so it has that going for it, easier (you can take more damage) and ragdoll physics for the enemies make it much more playable and fun to play.Still only manual saves which like the first every so often leads to frustration.(also horrendous endboss battle, both for understanding what the game wants you to do and what you actually have to do, very unsatisfying)Overall I dont find it an all that great product: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MAX PAYNE 2:A FILM NOIR LOVE STORYOne of the most beautiful, engrossing, atmospheric and entertaining games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.Max Payne 2 is the story of a long and dark night in which the tortured Max Payne struggles to find the answers to the questions he's been asking himself ever since his family was murdered, leaving a stream of bodies and bullets in his wake. Encapsulated by the love he feels for the mysterious Mona Sax, Max finds himself fighting for justice alongside a criminal; struggling to find the light in a world of darkness and pain.Gameplay is a frantic and elegant ballet of gunfire, carving a path through a storm of enemies in a variety of urban environments, exposing you to the dark side of New York City and other unique locations in a fantastically detailed manner.Use your instincts to make it through insanely fast firefights and vanquish your foes through a huge arsenal.All the while, Max Payne details the sorrows, the doubts, the fears that he has and the bizzare and saddening nature of his life and the realities shared by so many people - impeccably noir and exquisitely dark dialogue leaves you with lines that will stun you the moment you hear them.Max Payne 2 is completely and utterly brilliant.Cheap as chips and worth playing over and over again.TL;DR - Address Unknown is the best show ever.

												When it comes to a game based on running and guning, many games give you a character who's happy to kill.  Max Payne, on the other hand, wants it to stop.  With a dark story, you play as a detective who runs from their past, trying to avoid it at all costs, and ends up with no choice but to face it.  You fallow a character hounted by his past, and tries to put it behind him with painkillers.If you are looking for a game with a dark theme, and interasting order of events, and a character like no other, this is a game for you.  I enjoyed the fact that the seconed game picked up from where the first game left off.  All around a dark and well put together story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many times in MP1 you'll run around without any music in the background. MP2 not only offers more of it but also its soundtrack pretty much suits any situation perfectly, always. MP2 also changed Max Payne's theme slightly, in my opinion this is the best version of it. The story this time is larger, epic. And its presentation is better than in MP1 if you can even believe that. The comics look much better with professional actors this time around, in MP1 Remedy had to work with what they've got, which I think you've noticed with many goofy looking faces which could be distracting in some parts. Now with bigger budget they have managed to create something truly amazing. Nothing seems weird or odd anymore, Max Payne's smirk also has been removed replaced with a ._. face . I promise you, you will get teary eyed or even cry at the ending. It is that powerful. Meanwhile MP1's story was about revenge, MP2 is about love. MP2 counties to also go deeper into Payne's psyche. Nightmares return and they're not frustrating as before, they are not as creepy, but their presentation is much superior.Throughout the game you can interact with your surroundings, watch TV shows which are still frames, true. But their stories are still strangely engaging or just interesting and it is fun to watch them. You've got♥♥♥♥♥♥Justice for example, a parody of MP1's story and Max Payne's character in general.

It's so cool! You'll kill a dude and he'll fly away and then and then Max will do this cool spinning thing and the game follows it OH MY GOD IT'S SOO GOOOD!....Let me elaborate.Bullet time and shoot-dodge return and there are slight tweaks to them.Bullet-time now works in a slightly different way, when you start it up the bullet-time it doesn’t seem to slow down as much as it did in the MP1, that is until you kill an enemy. Each time you kill an enemy with Bullet-Time the game slows down more. And when you are forced to reload Max does this spinning move which looks really awesome and doesn't leave you to harm for so long, the move reloads your weapon very quickly. Shoot-dodge has been unchanged for the most part, now the shoot-dodge just doesn't take any bullet time away from you, but you can get harmed and even die while you're performing it. You're no longer invincible as you were in the first game.There are more weapons too and they all feel better to use.The game's difficulty is much more balanced; there are no frustrating cheap deaths which you might have experienced in the first game.When you complete the game you get ""Dead Man Walking mode"" it's a mode where you are putted into a map from campaign, your quest is to stand and fight as long as you can until you die, you can try to beat your time-limit, it is quite fun and addicting and if you enjoy the gunplay as much as I do it's amazing.The game is on a shorter side, shorter than the first game actually.

												Gameplay-wise Max Payne 2 is just more of the same from Max Payne 1. In fact, anything I have to say in this review is more of the same. I didn't notice any kind of upgrades with regards to enemy AI, all my previous gripes still apply. I still like the story though, the noir continues unabated from the first. The one thing I have to add is that by the end of this game Payne's story arc gets full closure. I'll be moving on to the next installment after this but I'm interested to see what it could be about because #2 ends neatly for all concerned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Expands upon the original in nearly every way. Intense, fun, and sometimes touching. 9/10+Looks quite good for a game from 2003+Just as well written as the first+Another set of great vocal performances+The scenes in the funhouse are really cool!+The villain, yet again, feels underdeveloped+The 2nd game has its own, unique, slow-mo mechanic where you move at normal speed, but with every kill you get, time slows more and more for the enemies and the enviroment. I personally like this quite a bit more than 1/3's more traditional slow mo.+A great central romance that is shown just as much though gameplay as in diologue.+A perfect ending (despite the shoddy boss that preceded it)-The first level set in the Ragranok club from the first game was nice, but it starts to feel cheap when you take a level design that was already recycled, and use it ANOTHER TIME!-The scenes when you play as Mona feel unneccisary-The game is a bit on the short side, I beat it in about 4 hours, and I am dreadful at it.(Steam only shows me as having an hour or so in game, in reality I have about 4. I mostly played through this while my internet was down)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is the kick♥♥♥♥♥sequel that continues the story from the original game. The graphics and physics engine have been upgraded and polished which leads to very satisfying action gameplay. The game continues the bullet-time feature which leads to some awesome gunfights and allows you to land those precise headshots. The story is a good as ever and the story telling remains the same as a graphic novel. If you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy the second game even more. The length of the story is about the same as the orignal game, around 7-8 hours - I wish the game was longer because it's just too good!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting sequel that had a more dramatic tone than its predecessor. Many people dislike it due to that but the game is still heavy with action-packed sequences, therefore, I believe there is no need to downgrade this one.Mona, the girl Max encounters, becomes an essential part of the story and you can control her in a few levels. Max has not changed a lot - bullet time is still important and is very useful to complete the levels. This game was a milestone in video gaming at that time - I believe it was one of the first games utilising the Havok engine; seeing how the eliminated enemies fall down and hitting objects was jaw dropping in 2004.I do not know why Valve did not upload more pictures or a couple of gameplay videos. You should check some on YouTube then you can easily make up your mind to pick this one up if it receives a discount. It certainly aged a lot so playing it after the 3rd episode might turn you away, still, I recommend giving it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More enjoyable than Max Payne 1. Shorter, but sweeter. More room for failure, a couple hits doesn't mean you need to spam painkillers or quick load, and you're able to fire off more rounds in bullet time and can continue firing on your stomach after bullet time ends, meaning there's no awkward second of having to stand up while the enemy is still pointing guns at you. I really enjoyed the graphic novel and noir themes to this game, and the dark humor was what gave life to this bleak world.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great sequel!Takes the badly aging dog that is MP1 and improves on it in every way. It feels better, controls better, aiming is vaguely accurate (an improvement for sure!), guns feel more satisfying, and the levels are that much more detailed and significantly larger and more varied.Only down side is its over in 5 or so hrs. While there are harder settings to unlock, I cant see myself doing another playthrough considering the size of my backlog.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is a direct sequel to the original and picks up after the events of that game. Max, now a detective and wearier than ever of the world, once again has his hands full as he finds himself hopelessly attached to the lovely Mona Sax, a murder suspect and part of a bigger plot that ties in to Max's own dark past. There are tons of references and parallels to the original story. Fans will undoubtedly be pleased by some of the nudging and winking, though someone starting off with Max Payne 2 would probably feel rather left out, despite the presence of an optional cutscene that summarizes what happened leading up to Max Payne 2. Still, this is a surprisingly complex narrative for a game, irrespective of the genre.The storyline unfolds in much the same fashion as the original. It uses some very slick, graphic novel-style storyboards--complete with melodramatic dialogue straight out of a pulp detective novel--and good voice-over to go with it. These graphic novel sequences are unmistakably similar to those of the first game, though they are, in some cases, even more artistic this time around. Max Payne 2 certainly isn't lacking in its presentation. Even the game's special edition DVD-style packaging is slick, and all of the game's between-level loading screens and graphic novel sequences are impressive-looking and often very cool. The plot itself features a number of twists but is rather convoluted the first go-round. Play through the game a second time (perhaps on the higher difficulty setting that's unlocked after you finish it the first time) and you'll likely get a much clearer sense of what's happening.

												The game features an excellent story line that might as well have been used in a film noir. All of the main characters of the first instalment (except of course those who died) are back and there are a lot of nice cut sequences (which can get annoying if you have to reload too often). Also the game elements are a lot more varied, you meet people in the street, and they will give you a hand in the level. And then there’s the story line, quite possibly the best part of the game, its deep, and it really makes you think. Every element has been well thought out, the only two criticism are the very short game, and the fact that the level design is slightly too linear, there’s only one way through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game! I absolutely adore the love story of this game, it worked so nicely and it was... a masterpiece. This game was fantastic and improved on Max Payne 1 in ABSOLUTELY every way! While it was shorter than Max Payne 1, clocking in at around 6 hours, (while MP1 was around 10 hours) I still thoroughly loved my experience and finished it in 1 day. Gunplay is very fun, and the story goes really really deep, but not as ""Illuminati"" deep as Max Payne 1. Graphics have aged very well, the soundtrack was good for the most part, and it was QUITE the experience, I can tell you that! A blast to play through, and a solid run for your money. Get it!

												Slicker and smoother than the first game, it polishes off a lot of the rough edges while telling a new and equally brutal story just as dramatic as the previous one. The shooting feels excellent and cinematic in a way that many modern games still fail to replicate, It's still as fundamentally simple as the previous one, involving lots of bad guys, guns, ammo, and painkillers, but it has a little more heart and a little less frustration than before. Max is as appealing of a haunted protagonist as ever, and somehow even more badass in this one, and the overall story is pulpy, dramatic deliciousness for someone who eats up this kind of style. It also has some impressive mod support! Worth checking out for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This goes quite cheap when a sale comes through, and while it may not have the stylized ""experience"" for slow-down effects that many newer games have, it still maintains one of the most glorified renditions of it as a feature catalyst.  That being the ""arcadey"" presence and experience you can get from playing almost all of it. The story telling is phenomenal - was and still is some of the best character development, art style, plot mechanization, and acting that could be asked for in a game.  As true to form as it can be, it never shys from the brutality, edge, misfortune, or emotional futility - wherein you hope for the best and expect the inevitable worst - that one could ask for in a ""noir"" experience.Again, the real treat that sets MP2 off as one of the most important games of modern years is the intensity that can come from it once you allow yourself to get absorbed in this ""world"" - in the mind of the characters and the empathy of their emotions and actions.  The drive to experience the rest of their story to the end, to start a level and never let go of that 'W' key, as your finger rolls the wheel and you swap through some of the best real-world labeled guns you could want, firing off 10,000 rounds in the drive to ""help"" the protaganist, the anti-hero, leave every last connection to his pain in a broken bloody heap behind him.Max Payne 1 may have changed the experience and what to expect from a shooter, but Max Payne 2 revolutionized it, finished the picture, and framed it on the wall in the Museum of Gaming forever after.

												Max Payne 2 has aged.  But it's aged well.  Despite being linear, Max Payne 2 is not scripted.  This really makes the game feel unique, even in the modern generation of gaming where everything boils down to QTE's and scripted set pieces that make the game feel more like a movie.But Max Payne 2 doesn't have this problem.  Every kill you make feels like it came from you, not the game forcing it upon you with a cinematic or a QTE.  The shooting is solid as hell, and the visuals have even held up decently despite the game's age.  Gameplay wise it's a standard third person shooter, but it incoroporates flawelessly a bullet-time system that hasn't been matched to this day.  If you don't already own a copy of Max Payne 2, you should do yourself a favor and get one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then go to the folder for the game and right click for properties on MaxPayne2.exe and set compatability to Windows98/ME. This should fix the problem.On to my review, I played this when I was 3 on the PS2 and now that it is on PC with much better graphics I can only like this game more. From the soundtrack to the story to the gameplay this game is the full package. And max doesn't look like a 40 yr old man in Hawaii in this game. *cough* Max Payne 3 *cough*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Damn this game is good! I played Max Payne 1 as wel and it's awesome that there are so much references to that in this game. ""Is this the Payne residence?""First of all I'd like to say the gameplay and shootouts are so smooth, bullettime makes this one of the best third person shooters ever. You dodge, jump and bullettime through the chapters while enjoying an awesome film-noir atmosphere.The story may be a bit average (especially when you haven't played the first one which I wouldn't recommend) but it has some awesome moments and makes you want to know what will happen. The surreal dream fragments are also fun to play inbetween the massive number of shootouts. When playing this game I actually got a bit sad that Rockstar wasn't able to pull this level of awesomeness of in Max Payne 3, so I'd suggest you play the first and second because the film noir vibe makes them the awesome games they are.

PROS:+ bullet time+ epic noir story+ nice variety of weapons+ atmosphere of rainy New York+ couple levels playing as Mona+ nightmare levels+ soundtrackCONS:- some strangely designed fights (including the final boss fight)- relatively shorter game time than the first Max PayneComment:The epic noir-themed bullet-time shooter that started the Max Payne series for me. The gameplay is good, no, it's REALLY good. But that is not why I fell in love with this game....it was the story, the beautiful dark bitter story about a man that loses everything. It grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go until it was done. I played this years ago (before Max Payne) so don't let the gametime above fool you, I was hooked on this game. After completing it I had to go get it's predecessor. I pirated both games. Now after over a decade I bought them because even now I still fondly remember how I used to play this series. If you haven't yet, go play them, it's a fantastic gaming experience...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is amazing. It is a huge improvement over the first Max Payne in nearly every way. One of my favorite, and most important, changes is that Max Payne himself no longer looks like he's smelling a rank fart. He looks like a human. The other characters also look like humans, rather than video game models wearing human faces. The bullet time is infinitely more useful as it replenishes faster and it gets a boost when you kill someone. The dodge-shooting also works better as it will let you keep firing from the ground, and doesn't immediately jump up and break the action until you stop firing.The story is a lot more cohesive, and more interesting. It's not just a dude killing everyone in his way to get to the person who killed his wife and daughter. There are different motives and they change, and the characters change. The game is short as hell, but so was the first Max Payne, and with less frustration.Max Payne 2 is a better game than the original and, for all intents and purposes, you shouldn't feel compelled to play through the first Max Payne before you play this one. It is a truly great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I couldn't remember the last time I decided to review a game. Maybe a little while ago, maybe a long time ago. As a result, I got a little rusty, so I decided to make the entire review for this game a generic monlouge to kill time. I opened up Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, a critically acclaimed masterpiece as they call it. When I booted up the game, the menu showed an option to explain the plot of the original game to newcomers. Although I owned the original game I thought it was a nice touch and it will let said newcomers in easier. Like last game I expected it to be dark, and I was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right. Max is a man that goes through many hardships, like in this game he falls in love, becomes addicted to painkillers, among others including the trauma he endured in the original game. I won't spoil the plot for you, but let me tell you- it's not pretty. However, although the story's good, this may not mean the gameplay's neccesarily good. I mindlessly took some painkillers and gave it a go. What I found was a deep combat system, filled with multiple weapons all used in different circumstances, a neat little bullet time feature that changed the core gameplay, and challenging level design. It seems to me that's a pretty good game. I look off into the dark, murky night lit by the lights of New York, away from the soft glow of my laptop screen. I decided that this game was extremley high quality, and would reccomend it to anyone. I go back onto my laptop and type like an ant. I feel good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the best Max Payne in the series, almost every aspect of this game is nothing short of amazing. It improves upon the original a hell of a lot, making it feel almost like a completely different game, and it is. It's one of those games where the developers really put a lot of time and effort into all the different details, and it shows. The writing is actually really really good, with a ton of memorable quotes both dramatic and hilarious. The graphics, while dated, still don't look bad at all and show a good sense of style, especially the comic book cutscenes. Plus the ragdoll physics are just as hilarious and fun now as they were when it first came out. The voice acting, sound effects, and soundtrack are all well done, with this game showing one of the first songs to be released by Poets of the Fall. The story is dark and dramatic, yet the sense of humor through the game keeps it from being too overwhelming and even more interesting. Plus it is told in a way that both well paced and keeps the gameplay fun. A good story that is told well is pretty rare in games, especially one with as much action as this.If there are any issues with the game, 1 would be that there is in fact an escort mission. As far as escort missions go, the setup is actually pretty hilarious, but has the same annoyances most escort missions do, though at least the target is smart enough to take cover. There is also another section that blends escort mission and sniping mission, though thankfully that is far less annoying and actually does change up the gameplay in this instance. The other issue is the game is a bit repetitive. The mission variety is great, but the actual shooting gameplay throughout the entire game remains the same. You get to shoot, use slow motion or a slow motion dive... and take painkillers. There are some dream sequences but none of them really add any variety to the actual gameplay, they serve more like interactive cutscenes. Thankfully the game isn't long enough to where it ever gets boring. If you enjoy slow motion action, third person shooters, or dark stories that are told well, I highly recommend getting this game. It's suprisingly really funny yet really dramatic and engaging, and the gameplay is some of the best third person shooter action out there. One of my personal favorites, a fantastic game especially for the price these days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also the characters facial model looks alot better than the facial models of the characters on Max Payne. The story of this game is still true to its origins but in a love situation (Max+Mona 4ever <3). Anyways I definitely recommend this game to any gamer who is into constant action shooting and awesome slow motion gunfights! :DPlot: 10/10Characters: 10/10Action: 20/10Facial Models: 100/10 :D (Because I don't have to die in laughter looking at a constipated face!

												Max Payne 2 seems to be the only max payne game that works for me with no issues, as MP1 has known sound issues with the sound file format not being properly modernized for modern computers and MP3 has social club log in problemsBut that aside the game is a blast and fun to go back to.The funniest part though is that it seems like he emphasis in this game is the Physics, not unlike HL2 while the 3rd's is the ingame cutscenes and the motion capture.rathter than the gameplay and keeping a consistant noir feeling to it like this game and the first one had, hence why the third one seemed to be a game that had max payne in it, but not a true max payne game in the urban fantasy/pulp noir ways of the first two.it must be noted there seems to be a weird technical glitch with the final level's interior, like when you go into a room with wood panneling and the panneling has disapeared and your just seeing this weird white light blur.

												This is my #5 favorite video game of all time. Unlike the first game, which is clearly a joke, it's possible to take this noir completely  seriously - and I recommend that you do. This game is a world that feels exactly as bad as you've ever felt, and I feel was the first game to ever really nail bullet time gameplay. Like any truly great film, it can be experienced again and again for new nuances and insights. I can't recommend this game highly enough. I bought it on Steam just so I would never lose it if the discs were lost or broken.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS:+ bullet time+ epic noir story+ nice variety of weapons+ atmosphere of rainy New York+ couple levels playing as Mona+ nightmare levels+ soundtrackCONS:- some strangely designed fights (including the final boss fight)- relatively shorter game time than the first Max PayneComment:The epic noir-themed bullet-time shooter that started the Max Payne series for me. The gameplay is good, no, it's REALLY good. But that is not why I fell in love with this game....it was the story, the beautiful dark bitter story about a man that loses everything. It grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go until it was done. I played this years ago (before Max Payne) so don't let the gametime above fool you, I was hooked on this game. After completing it I had to go get it's predecessor. I pirated both games. Now after over a decade I bought them because even now I still fondly remember how I used to play this series. If you haven't yet, go play them, it's a fantastic gaming experience...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 seems to be the only max payne game that works for me with no issues, as MP1 has known sound issues with the sound file format not being properly modernized for modern computers and MP3 has social club log in problemsBut that aside the game is a blast and fun to go back to.The funniest part though is that it seems like he emphasis in this game is the Physics, not unlike HL2 while the 3rd's is the ingame cutscenes and the motion capture.rathter than the gameplay and keeping a consistant noir feeling to it like this game and the first one had, hence why the third one seemed to be a game that had max payne in it, but not a true max payne game in the urban fantasy/pulp noir ways of the first two.it must be noted there seems to be a weird technical glitch with the final level's interior, like when you go into a room with wood panneling and the panneling has disapeared and your just seeing this weird white light blur.

												Max Payne 2 is more of the same, and that's not really a bad thing.  If you're not familiar with the game series, it's a third person shooter with bullet time effects and a noir style story.  There are slight improvements over the first game, such as being able to equip grenades / molotovs as a ""secondary weapon"" instead of having to switch from a gun to use them.  The graphics are much easier on the eyes too.  Probably the most novel part of MP2 is the levels where you have to work alongside or play as Max's love interest / femme fatale, Mona Sax.  It's interesting to play through the same timespan from both characters' point of view.  The story is fairly predictable, and the gunplay is fun as always.  The writers have played it safe with a formula that works (with a few tweaks), and as a result have made another solid game in the series.  Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid third person shooter that tells a great story and features one of the most memorable romance-plots in video game history. I played through this game straight from 7 PM to 4 AM without stopping to do anything. It's very immersive and utterly compelling. If I had played this back in 2003 my mind would have been blown. Literally. Like, it seriously might've been a medical emergency. The graphics are outstanding for a 2003 title and the cinematic action is very well executed, it featured a romance-themed plot that wasn't (and really still isn't) seen often in video games. Remedy is just a fine developer in general, they put a lot of detail into their games both plot and design wise. If you like this game I recommend playing Alan Wake (same developer), it's very similiar in many ways though horror-themed instead of action-romance. TL;DR: Probably the only game I've ever been compelled to finish in one sitting. Immersive, engaging and satisfying. Though I did have to set compatability to Win98 (i'm using Win7).

												The Fall of Max Payne is one of those games that has pitch perfect writing. Sam Lake is a god amongst video game writers. What it comes down to is Max's inner monologues that subdue the player into escaping reality and entering the stark world of Max Payne.Taking place two years after the events of the first masterpiece, Max Payne has been reinstated into the NYPD and is on the case of a group of hitmen that dress up as a cleaning crew. Max follows their trail while uncovering a conspiracy involving the Inner Circle, corrupt politicians, and dirty cops. Mona Sax reemerges early in the game, surviving her apparent death after getting shot in the head in the first one. She's on the run from the police but works with Max as they have similar goals. The fall of Max Payne is that he falls in love with Mona Sax, he can't bring himself to turn her in or fight her; which makes the game a film noir love story (as stated on the iconic cover art).The gameplay is very similar to the first one, why fix something that isn't broken, right? But the graphics are substantially better, Max's face doesn't look like a distorted Sam Lake and the models are certainly more polyganyl. The nightmare scenes are easier but still kinda crazy. And the music, the music is SO good. I would at times just pause the game and let the music play in the menu while getting some water or pop.Outstanding9.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Once I had finished the original Max Payne on PS2 and found out my friend had the sequel, 'Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne.' I remember playing it and feeling for the characters once again. I thought that the bullet time had been greatly improved with its speed reloads and updated physics and animation and felt that the game also had a great story.I picked this up in the Max Payne bundle during the 2015-16 Christmas holidays for a small price.Has performance issues on Windows 7 and up which can be easily fixed through modding or playing around the in files of the game folder.Would highly recommend only if you have finished the original.I'd pick up Max Payne 3 as well (isn't included in the bundle) and give it a try. Although the gameplay and storylines are very different, the keeps the same overall style of game but with improved features but also removes some features making it more of a challenge. (Example being limited to 3 guns)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is the second game in the Max Payne trilogy developed by Remedy Entertainment, the same people behind the Alan Wake game and published by none other than Rockstar Games, makers of such games as Bully, Manhunt, L.A. Noire and the Grand Theft Auto seriesThe story continues right after Max Payne, I won't spoil anything from either the previous game or this sequel's story, however the story is action packed to the brim, just the same as Max PayneThankfully Max Payne 2 ran much better than Max Payne, however, you will need a widescreen modification for widescreen monitors, but on the whole, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne ran much better than Max Payne, obviously Max Payne was developed much more before Max Payne 2 so it is understandableThe graphics, for what they were at the time have aged pretty well. The environments are well designed and the attention to detail is really there, and the character models too have been greatly improvedThe music and sound effects are good and the voice acting is good too. However, the game does suffer with volume level issues, sometimes the voice actors sound loud then at some points they sound low. Sometimes the cutscenes volume is good and at some points I can't hear a thing and have to riase the volume from my speakers to hear what they are saying, this is due to it being an old game so I don't blame the game per sei. Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as Max PayneThe cutscenes are told through a mixture of a form of a graphic novel and in-game custcenes and although Max Payne did suffer with the graphic novel custcenes (see Max Payne review for more details), they have been greatly improved in the sequelThe gameplay is a mixed bag. The famous bullet time is fun and will save you a lot of health as Max Payne dies easily, even on medium and easy difficulty. And the game is hard, you will die constantly, so much so, that I had to replay the game from medium difficulty to easy difficulty and still the game was hardYou will die constantly, and this is where my main complaint comes in. There is no auto save! If you get shot and die, you will reset to the latest save you or the game has done which is normally in the beginning of a chapter, so if you did not save manually (either by pressing F5 or by saving in the main menu), then expect to be teleported back to the latest save either you or the game did for you. This can be extremely annoying!However, Max Payne 2 is a fantastic sequel to the trilogy and I can't wait to play Rockstar's take in; Max Payne 3Max Payne 2 runs very well on modern systems, just be sure to download a mod that makes the game playable on widescreen monitors and you should be fine! Just be wary of the game's difficulty at some points... RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 offers you to good storyline , graphics ,physics (this game released in 2003 and it is still looks fine ) and amazing noir york atmosphere. Max Payne's nightmares and bullet time make this game more unique. Max Payne's feelings real and dramatic so that you are understand the purpose and actions of the max . Comic book style is so impactful in the storyline ( imo it makes the game more dramatic and more noir). Game is little bit short but details in the story make this part more tolerable and you might want to end this game again because hardest difficulty offers you the different ending.

												A much better PC port than Max Pyne 1, not needing any special mods to get running on Windows 7. The visuals themselves hold up really well still and the graphic novel story telling is better than ever. If you liked the first Max Payne or wanting to revist the series from 3, than this is a great game still.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne was genius for its time. Max Payne 2 is, in my opinion, genius for ALL TIME. The gameplay feels smoother and more action packed than the original, the story is also much more emotional and unlike the first i actually felt for the characters. While the first was certainly a good game it left me feeling unfufilled. Max Payne 2 leaves me with absolute satisfaction, in fact its ending was so good id rather they hadn't made max payne 3, which wasn't terrible but didnt have the same amount of detail and DID have much less superior writing.

It's story telling is out of this world and you won't see anything like it elsewhere. Rockstar tried to replicate it for the third installment but they missed the spot. This game is unforgiving and it is challenging together with its great gameplay.Get this game together with the first one. Sit back and get engulfed by the story telling.

												Have you not played this game already? If not, then you should... I would love to tell you to buy this and Max Payne 1, yet the first game has a sound bug. So here we are, with this classic. Despite the fact that you should avoid the first game because of a terrible port, I am happy to write that this one works! And not only does it work, it shines like it did when I first played it.The Fall of Max Payne is one of the greatest love stories ever told in gaming. It is just pure class, with a very well written script and some awesome voice acting. The gameplay is aged, yes! But this game is still so much fun to play. If you ever loved this back when it came out, there is no reason you won't enjoy it all over again. I always rated the first one just as much as the second, but this time around, despite the port being crap for the first game, this one really shows how great it is and was when first released.One hell of a game, story and memory.Now I could keep writing or playing. I'll keep playing. Enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To start off, if you have not played the original Max Payne than a good majority of the plot will not make any sense to you so I recommend that you play the first one before this one. This game is significantly shorter than the original, but that does not mean it is not as good. I consider this to be a worthy successor to the original in every way. The plot adds to what was left off in the original and then some. The game is just as violent and action packed as the first. Before you buy this though I suggest you prepare yourself to have to make some minor adjustments in the games files becuase this game is old and does not run well on newer systems, but it does work.

												The second titles in any series are usualy said to be worse than their predecessors. Max Payne 2 is a clear proof that it is not quite true.Noir atmosphere, brutal and hectic action, and even a love plot which you may have never expected in game like this, but it suits it just perfectly. Another legendary game brought to you by Remedy.For emotional sensitive people it's recommended to unlock Death On Arrival difficulty as soon as possible, the end of story would be less painful than.

												I played this back when it was first released but couldn't remember much about it so I decided to replay it.  It still holds up surprisingly well for being an older game.  The gunplay feels good (with better hit detection than the original Max Payne), the graphics are improved, and it seems to take itself a little more seriously by dropping all the goofy cartoon faces that Max Payne would make in the original (there's even an audio clip in the game where they kind of make fun of themselves for doing that).  The same old comic-style noir cut scenes are still here and as good as ever.  The story seemed a little less interesting this time and was more about Max chasing Mona Sax around and shooting up all kinds of baddies in the process.  There's a tag team section where Mona covers Max with a sniper rifle while he traverses a construction yard that is probably the pinnacle of the game's ingenuity.  The ""All Ghillied Up"" mission in Call of Duty 4 gets a lot of praise for this idea but Max Payne 2 really thought of it first even if they didn't execute it quite as stylistically.  Lots of interesting locales though and the way you defeat the final boss was a means of thinking outside the box before it was cool to make games that think outside the box.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2 is so far the best Max Payne in the series: It is technolocially more advanced than the first one and it doesn't take itself as seriously as the third one. For such a low low price, I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys 3rd person shooters with strong story. The story of Max Payne 2 is nothing special: a detective who plays by his own rules and has nothing to lose has to undercover another conspiracy against him and the people of NYC.Very serious stuff but what makes this story-line bearable compared to the 3rd ones whinetastic borefest is that everything around our main characters (enemies, tv-shows and other npcs) are not taking themselfs seriously.for example: The tv-shows we see throughout the game are recapping the story in a extremely corny way and the enemies are bumbling doofuses. The gameplay is somewhat showing its age: combat usually happens withing 10 meter radius.This is partly because weapons have randomized spread but mostly because the maps are VERY small on todays standards (altough back in the PS2 era they were AMAZING).The main positive of the randomized spread is that cutscenes are something pure comical gold (for example the scene where the police-chief Bravura gets shot multible times he sometimes won't get hit once but he still gets bullet-holes in his chest)An addiditon to the absurdity of gun-fights is the early ragdoll-physics that cause bodies to fly all over the place (this is especially funny dring the ""dramatic slowmo"" scenes that pop up in specific parts of the game)My advice?Go to slowmo (or ""bullet-time"" as the game calls it) when enemies appear (preferably after they have spouted their funny dialoge), get within touching distance and start sircle strafing: nothing can survive that.This migth be a cheap tactic but so is the game: enemies are way accurate than you and there is more of 'em.Then again: you can heal yourself and use basic tactics against an enemy that mostly just runs at you.Only negative that I can really point out is that when you do the John Woo style jump, Max will stand up immediately after releasing the shoot-button (no matter how amny enemies are aiming him down) and you can't fire during the stand-up animation but this can be countered by using basic tactics.The guns that the game offers you are mostly pea-shooters but the game ie VERY generous with its ammo so it evens out in the end (exept the shotguns which all suck nards).In conclusion: This game does show it's age but it is still a solid game experience with goor replayability.It was good in 2003 and it still holds up in 2016.

												Why bother when it won't run in Win 10 64 bit.  I loved this game when it initially came out but it won't run through steam and the work arounds should not be needed. And the files some folks recommend for making it work with Steam and Win 100 are not available from the Dropbox links.  I will use my oolder box that still has Windows 7 on it and see if it will run there. Very disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A thrilling conclusion to the events set up in Max Payne, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a rollercoaster ride of intrigue and murder. Sam Lake is a god of videogame writing, and it shows here as plot twists and betrayals abound and leave you wondering if it ever really was black and white.The gunplay is stellar, but special note must be given to the bullet-time and shootdodge mechanics of MP2. In MP1, you could only slow down time when you dodged, which was a good but flawed mechanic. In MP2, you can use bullettime without dodging (though shootdodge remains a viable option) and every kill you make while in the slowed timescale refills your bullettime meter a small function. If you're quick and skillful, you can keep it up for a long time.Overall, I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of noir, good storytelling, great gunplay and/or the first game.10/10 Bullets			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne- 1 из лучших игр от Rokstar, как мне кажется.    В те времена выпускать такой шедевр многого стоило.    Ясное дело, что люди нового поколоения не увидят всю прелесть этой игры, но мы-люди старого поколония, любящие по сей день игры 2000-2005 годов, гордимся этим, что в то время, было очень круто.    В данной части у нас есть возможность познакомиться с самими главным героем, нажав на определенный зоголовок в главном меню.    Также мы можем поиграть в разные режимы, например, ""выживание на время"", где будут появляться каждым разом враги, а ваша задача их убивать.    У вас есть возможность сыграть сюжетные задания на время. Когда-то давно было классно соревноватся на время с друзьями.    Но самое главное, конечно же сам сюжет, сюжет восхитителен, прекрасен, словами даже нельзя описать, насколько он мне понравился. Всего вас ожидает 3 главы, где будет пролог и по 6-7 подглав, где в каждой будет чудесные, небольшие видеоролики с хорошей озвучкой и актерской игрой, а также небольшие комиксы, где играет восхитительная музыка на заднем плане, а также присутствует озвучка. Комикс очень красиво нарисовали и детализировали его.    В данной игре нету уровней сложности, что, мне кажется, очень хорошо.    Огромное количество разного оружия.    Интересные и запоминающие личности, которые будут встречаться в ходе игры.    Красиво проработаная графика, приятно на нее смотреть.    Неплохая и грустная концовка игры с прекрасным сопровождением.    Конечно есть моменты, которые не понятны, например, куда надо стрелять, чтобы уничтожить главного ""Босса"".    Также, во время сюжетки, был момент, что нашему главному персонажу, попали в голову, но он остался жив, не понятно.Всем советую покупать!!    Игра заслуживает 10 из 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a nice sequel. In comparison with it's predecessor, it has more storyline and immersion. Tragedy and conflict strike your feelings quite strong when you least expect.New weapons, new outfit and sometimes even new perspectives.The enemies are softer than in the first one, but it does compensate with more non-fighting scenes (dream/nightmare states), which unplug you a bit from the combat trance.The voice acting combined with the clever picked (noir-like) lines give a great ambiance to the whole plot and are really fitting to the character.

												Max payne 2 is a Nior style crime action game that is extremely fun to play. The game itself is a major improvement to Max payne 1 by adding physics and better graphics although i found this one to be a little too short and i don't know if its just me but it takes a ridiculous amount of time for the launcher to start (1-2 minutes). But do i recommend this game? The answer is yes because despite its flaws it still is a great game even until today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much much better than the first. The movement is a lot smoother and the shots actually affect enemies where you shoot them. For example, if you hit a goon in the head, he WILL die, unlike in the first Max Payne game. There's also a lot more guns and you no longer have to switch weapons to throw a grenade/molotov. Hell, you can even melee. The game also has you play as Mona Sax, letting you see what her role was while Max does his thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And I thought the first Max Payne was depressing as hell. This is probably the best of the trilogy. The noir theme got darker and more realistic, and we see Max, instead of walking out on a high note for avenging his loved ones, we see him lose another he began to love and spiral into the depths of a depression that seemed impossible to escape. A gritty end to an amazingly well-done game, even if it did make me feel rather upset and hollow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though at point the game is very frustrating, I love it to bits, the epic moments it can create by player controlled slow-motion and dive shots create beautiful gameplay and creates a suspense for the player, wish the health was slightly buffed, the pain killer drop rates were higher and that body armor was a possibility. Highly recommend this game to a wide variety of players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is hard to recomend this game at the full price of 10 dollars because of it's short lenghth and poor story compared to the first game's story. If you are wondering what this game has to offer compared to the first one the only real changes are that the guns are more balanced and you feel like you need to conserve ammo for certain guns more. If you want to know what I think about Max Payne as a game just check out my review of the first one.Get this one on sale. It is about half as long as Max Payne with only slightly better gameplay, graphics, and artwork.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent Game. Just finished it a few mins ago and I don't think I have been this satisfied with a game in a long time. I understand that some people want less cutscenes and more action but I felt that the story was solid and was brought out through the cutscenes. The game does feel a little short because it took me approx 5 hours to finish which isn't bad. I don't think enough people took the time to explore the levels and find all the little touches that make this game one of the best. Graphics are very impressive for its time and the sound is outstanding,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The interactive gun sound design is excellent.  But here is the fork in the road - If you want to play a shooter for the sake of shooting, you'll like it; if you want to play a Max Payne game, I doubt you will like it.  Story-wise, it feels like a bad dream and in that respect, it works very well - it truly feels like a bad dream where all of it makes sense in how it all plays out, but it makes NO sense upon waking up in retrospect.  Double-edged sword for me, don't know how else to explain it without saying ""I liked it but I didn't like it.""  As a functioning game, good job.  As a Max Payne game, I was underwhelmed unfortunately.Original Max Payne holds true, play that one for an EXCELLENT story with the same satisfying gameplay caliber.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Medicore game overall. Disaster comparing to the first Max Payne. Graphics are ok and visuals overall are good. Music is alright and the sounds too. I like how they added a new addition to bullet time where if the player is continuously shooting while falling, he/she will remain on the ground untill he/she is finished shooting. Gameplay overall is good.Story is crap, lacks any depth, recycled material and typical old friend is now enemy BS. Little to NO CHALLENGE what so ever, you are spammed with ammo and health here and there. Hardest difficulty is a joke. If you have ALOT of free time and a big fan of Max Payne 1, you can give this a go so you'll know how bad of a game this is and you didn't miss anything. Did i mention thtat he main character gets a complete face switch and voice acting? F LAME BS, its not Max Payne anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Won't even run!I bought all 3 Max Paynes in a sale bundle, Ive tried to get them to work for several hours each but cannot figure out the problem. When I press play to try and run the game, nothing will show up. When I press play again, it will say that the same application is already running even though there is no tab for the game that appears to be ""open"" and when I go into the task manager, the application shows as a background process. Have I been scammed? I think so. I also wrote a reveiw on Max Payne 3, stating that the game did end up running but anther problem occured preventing me from playing the game at all.I do NOT reccomend this game due to the chance of crashing or not even running.-This is a copy of my review of Max Payne, due to the same exact problem, I had no means in re-writing the report again-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only a clarification before all - MaxPayne, the original one from 2001 was a far superior product. Max Payne 2 recycled everything strong about it . Lacking though the doomsday gloom of the 90's occult gothic. Though often unnamed - that's what added the spice to the tragedy. Instead it attempts to portray that tragedy replayed as Max tries to overcome it.  The story of this game seems rather a rehash of the previous levels with new skins, physics, weapons and so on.What is left of Noir, is buried under the monotonous (in the bad sense of the word) interiors. Build sites, endless apartment halls, streets and only by the end some sort of a palace with many awkward and glitchy moments. The strongest sequences are the beggining one, another one with the Police HQ... and that's all I remember memorable. I never understood why Max Payne 2 was good because the romance was weak, the antagonist was a joke and... overall it's just like making Die Hard 2 after Die Hard 1.But how silly, insulting the cliffhanger comes around. What were they thinking? The game might be worth it for one playthrough to see if you enjoy the new ""autumn"" setting contrary to the winter ""Ragnarok"" of the first game.It attempts to show a relationship [Spoilers!!!]  revived  of the first game (and does so poorly in my opinion). In fact, even the ending seems like a repetition of the first game's marvelous conclusion of an epic, whereas here - it seems as if I already played this somewhere... Stereotypes and old characters are back. Yet I would prefer them to remain in the dust as they unfolded, much, much more mysteriously and enigmatically in the previous game yet again. Only for action fans.Cannot find a reason for someone to play this except if you're preparing to take head on the whole trilogy.This is the worst of the 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT BOTHER TO BUY THIS GAME. It does not seem to actually be set up to run on modern systems. The amount of adjustments necessary to make it even load is ridiculous. Check out "" https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200148586-Problems-with-Max-Payne-1-2-in-Vista-Windows-7-and-Windows-8 "" if you don't believe me. My PC may actually need to be restarted to run on a single core everytime I want to play the game? I didn't try it, because I don't care if it works. It should be listed as not compatable with a multi-core system. Be aware before making the purchase. If I knew it would be this much of a hassle I wouldn't have bought it, even on sale.

												I change my opinion about this. This is a bad game ! The fantastic mood of the first game is totally lost in the sequel ! Gameplay boring from the first minute. I feel emptyness and pointless gunfight from the start even that is the weakest part of of the serie ( and much worse in the two ). Polished graphics don't save the title, while the bad rag-doll, bone, character animation still exist. If you love the first one and not a blind fanatic of the serie, just walk away, it destroys everything the first built ......original post:I never have a tiket to the hype-train of max payne. I think these games are one of the most over-rated / hyped title in the computer game history right after the halo serie. Don't misundertund me, max payne  is a good game with professional story-telling, atmosphere / mood what makes it unique feeling to play with it. On the other side, the first one is ugly like hell ! :) Caracter models very unpolished, animation is bad, gunfight very basic except the fantastic bullet time ! The second looks better but the game mechanics is the same or worse if it's possible at all . Btw, these are good games in overall but nothing more or less !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I never managed to get into it and even finish it and I'm saddened to say it will probably never even happen. I do look forward to Max Payne 3 though; I just hope it remains true to the first one and manages to do some new things as well. Fingers crossed.[Rating: 76/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I usually don't write reviews, much less a ""not recommended"" one, but this one has been eating at me a long time.  I know people generally read the first couple of lines and move on, but I wanted to do this, if only for me because I'm just another opinionated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the internet.Before I begin, let me clarify:Max Payne 1 was the bestMax Payne 3 was alright, but not as good as MP1also: SPOILER WARNINGSOkay, where to begin?  When I first played MP2, it was a Max Payne marathon session, so I had just finished the first game (again) and wanted to finish the second one (which I had not yet played) before I played Max Payne 3.Now, when people talk about the series, MP3 especially, they always mention how the story was mediocre especially when compared to the first two games.  Granted, it wasn't much, the lack of noire was sorely missed and when compared to the FIRST game, yes, it is particularly weak.  However, I am completely baffled when people say how good MP2's story was and how it was better than MP3.  No.  Just ... no.The flimsy story for this game (spoiler warning) is simply thus:Take every character who didn't die in the first game and kill them off.There you go.  That's it.  That's the whole 3-4 hour game right there, and the story abruptly ends when the bad guy, former ""friend"" Vlad who decides to kill you because they couldn't think of anybody else to do it and because he's Russian so why not, is killed.  The entire story, in a nutshell, is: ""... and everybody died, the end.""  If anything, this game is what paved the way for MP3 to have no connection to the first game's grim, atmosphereic noir setting simply by destroying any way to connect a third game to the first or second game.  And to anyone who wants to talk about how ""gritty and noir"" the story is, let me remind you that Vinnie Cogniti (or however it's spelled) puts on a ♥♥♥♥ing mascot outfit his arch rival gave him only to find out it's a bomb.  You're then tasked with saving his defenseless♥♥♥♥♥for a level so that in the next cutscene (an actual cutscene, not a graphic novel panel like in the first) he can get blown up anyway.  Whoop-dee-♥♥♥♥ing-doo.So what do you do in this game?  Well, you run around and shoot people with a screwy version of bullet-time (when you activate it, time doesn't really slow down and only does the more people you kill, so if you've got a sliver of health and want to have those extra split seconds to take out a big group, like in the first game, you're in for a surprise.) occasionally triggering a graphic novel scene like in the first game, but those only come like once a CHAPTER.  And while in first game you could watch all those bits and it would tell a semi-cohesive story, in this they only come around long enough to say ""HEY LOOK, SEE?  THIS IS JUST LIKE THE FIRST GAME!  LOOK AT THI-Oop, nevermind, it's over, back to game.""  That's really all the noir is in this game: a coating, something to fool you into thinking it's a noir story like in the first.  Oh, and there's the really ""FUN"" bit where you have to protect someone whil using a sniper rifle, because trying to keep an NPC alive from a mile away is always great.In the four or so hours it will take to beat the game, you'll get to do such things as watch cutscenes, kill guys with goofy ragdoll physics (which is actually pretty fun, don't get me wrong), go to the Ragnarok again (how original), visit the same Fun-House level three ♥♥♥♥ing times (with slightly changed layout) based on Valkyr V (see guys? this is just like the first game!) and along the way, Max will meet a variety of characters from the first game before they are subsequently killed as well as a paltry handful of new characters who get killed off to.  Oh, and if you played the first game, Mona (who got kinda killed but possibly wasn't killed or whatever) apparently survived and will be your love interest through the game until she dies at the end.  And as I said, the big bad guy is Vlad, who it turns out, in a huge case of the devs going ""What things can we take from the first game and cram into here and retcon the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of, used to be in the same group as Alfred Woden, who he kills, then he kills Mona (she undied so she could re-die), then you kill him, then Max has a tiny necrophilia scene and then it just ends.  Max Payne accomplishes nothing, rescues no one, learns nothing except that people near him usually end up dead pretty fast (which I kinda thought was also part of MP1's story).  Oh, and if you thought the characters in MP3 were pretty unlikeable and had no connection to Max, then I re-invite you to play this game again and really take a good, long hard thought about it.If you hated Max Payne 3's departure from noire and the things that made the first game so incredible, you can give a big round of applause to this game right here.  After playing it, there really isn't any ground left move forward from.  The only thing a sequel could have done is go far, far away from where the first two games took place and do something ""fresh"" with the franchise and, basically, just find some completely new ground to tread on.So, in short, it's a functional game that goes nowhere, has no point, brings nothing new to the table and only does the ""Noir"" bit because it has to (and believe me, they only begrudgingly come out every now and again because it's in their contract claus) and, having never played it before, I beat it in a couple of hours in one sitting.  This game offers nothing and delivers nothing.  You're better off just playing the first game because that one actually is a good story, or if you really have to have ragdolls flopping around, get the third because of dem physics.

												The game itself is still a great classic. MP2 is one of my favorite games of all time.Unfortunately, it doesn't run on Windows 8 without forcing your computer to run on a single core and needing to reboot every time you want to play the game.The steam release isn't recommended due to the ridiculous workaround needed to get it to run on a modern computer.

												I played the original Max Payne years ago on the original CD version (I've never touched my Steam copy).  It was a straightforward third person shooter whose graphics weren't all that great even in its own time.  Its real strengths were its story (an offering of over-the-top noir detective grit with themes from Norse mythology) and its use of ""bullet time"", which took advantage of the popularity of the contemporary Matrix films.The gameplay is not much different in this sequel.  It is still a linear third-person shooter with similar graphics and the occasional surreal nightmare level.  The cutscenes look the same and it remains in the noir genre.  However, the story is not nearly as interesting and abandons the interesting thematic choices of the original.  Since that was the main strength of the original, I don't think this one is worth your time at this point.  Just move on to part 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Toys with more philosophical ideas and highlights the more surreal sequences that occured occassionaly in the first installment, but never really brings anything interesting to the franchise when it comes to gameplay and story. Payne does become a more fleshed out character though, which elevates the material a bit more. Repetitive setpieces with the addition of excessive handholding drag this down even more. Average, even when it's at its best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is the sequel (obviously) to Max Payne going back to its original way to tell its story, gameplay and slightly improved graphics. Same as before you get to kill hundreds of enemies using the weapons at your disposal with some small sequences where you play as Mona, Max's GF/waifu in this story. The story has some supermegaultrawumboamazing unexpected plot twists that we all could expect. Pros- Improved gameplay, story (still lackluster).Cons- Story (as I wrote: supermegaultrawumboamazing), waves upon waves upon waves of faceless baddies to eliminate with bullet time.IMHO: 4/10 SHYAMALAN STYLE PLOTWIST!!! meh...

												I haven't played a single second of this game, but if it's anything like the first I'm assuming it's a giant, heaping, steaming pile of rotten rat feces, baking in the hot sun, drenched in dog♥♥♥♥♥♥  The Max Payne series is the most overrated trash to ever grace the gaming landscape.Why the ♥♥♥♥ did they even make a sequel?  To continue the ""compelling"" story of killing generic mafia goons?  So dark, so deep, so tense, the story of Max Payne is.  I don't even have to play this to tell you to avoid it at all costs.  The first problem with this game lies within the name itself, ""The Fall of Max Payne.""  Pardon me, but, isn't that the first game?  Must be fun to beat a dead horse.The thing is, you are reading Max Payne 2 reviews because you enjoyed the first game and you want more.  This is where you ♥♥♥♥ed up.  Shame on you, you tasteless ♥♥♥♥.  The same people who enjoy Max Payne are people who put ketchup on their hot dogs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 3 thousand26four, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very large sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yessss... Max Payne 2!!! Don't let my hours played fool you, It's about the 8th time I started playing it which should tell you enough. I'm very passionate about this game cause it's a true piece of art. Yes I said it, like its precursor it's very noticable that the developing team has had tons of fun and heart while making these games (unlike part 3 which rockstar F***'ed in my opinion). The fact alone that they tried to figure out the right style for the game, to make it all come together. The comics that tell you parts of the story in between, the great voice actors (GREAT!!.. VOICE!!.. ACTORS!!), the music, the long story which even ingame has carefully selected cinematic cutscenes..For the love of God if you never played this just buy the freakin' game already, even if it's not on sale!Besides all this Max Payne 2 was an innovating game bringing slow-motion bullettime to your pc, and it's a gem that can hold its name proudly between other timeless games. Now if you'd excuse me, I got a Max Payne mural to make in my bedroom (no it's not Max in sexy underwear). Oh, and make sure you watch the tv series in the game. There are many worlds inside this world. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shorter than the first game in the series, but far better in gameplay. This could be used as example of ultimate action game 10 years ago and maybe even now. Max Payne is one the best heroes in video game history, noir story excells in its narrative and presentation too. Plus you can play as Mona Sax as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a sequel to the previous. The story is connected, but you can play this without playing the first and not being lost in the middle of its story. I only found a ""let down"" with it: being shorter than the first Max Payne.But despite being shorter, this game has a good ""replay value"": you unlock 3 new difficulties when you finish the game for the first time, and it has mod support too.The biggest challenge to most of buyers is to make this game run in modern systems like Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 for example. Well, the solution which work for me was the one described in THIS DISCUSSION (just click here).And if you encounter some problems with the wide screen like stretching the image, you can use this fix from THIS SITE (just click here)[thirteenag.github.io].And don't use Anti Aliasing. Disable it in the config window launched by the game. If you want it, force it in your graphic card panel, or it may make the game crash at the cut scenes.My rating: 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. In just 2 years Remedy was able to make a sequel that made the combat even more engaging, have the dream sequences feel even more ominous, have more depth into it's main character and have some great development in-general. The atmosphere of the world is so thick you can shoot bullets through it. This game also acts as a staple of ""past generation game design"" with some solutions to problems being left for you to figure it out and some non-linear paths to events of the gameplay just from the player mucking about or listening to NPCs. One moment has Payne going through an apartment complex with a couple civillians that can tag along with you, helping you out in gunfights and even giving you cover when you reach a certain point. Or you can simply shoot them right away, there's no penalty for it. As long as you have a gun in your had at the time you can shoot anyone and everyone you like. There's simple touches to the gameplay that don't do much other than making Payne look even cooler (slo-mo reloading). Another one of these is TV, yes you can just sit back (stand) and watch some telly. Being honest, I spent 10 minutes watching different things on the TV until it started repeating, damn. One of the things on the TV leads into the great and not very obvious or in your face symbolism. 2 of the recurring shows on the TV give some nice symbolism to the events of the story at the moment that you watch it, or into Payne's own mindset. Sometimes even teasing future events yet to happen. And by the last level you can watch both series finale's. It's this great dream-like state that the game has that I particularly loved and that the games use to great effect. There's some nice cameo's that, if you're paying attention, you'll notice right away as well. A few points give you control of a second character for story purposes, and it's a little weird when you discover that she has the same bullet-time abilities as Payne. Just like the last one, Max's VA is just brilliant at his lines. While everyone else is either ""eergh"", okay or inconsistant with  their performance. Unlike the last one the game works like a charm, with absolutely no bugs or technical problems. By the end the game's world feels just as lonely and cold as Payne is feeling from what's happened during the game, the way the story unravels is great and some moment are pretty heavy *-*. Unfortuately it doesn't have the visual scope of the original and a lot of the locations you are in are just the same places you were in the last game. There are a couple great set pieces though that allow opportunities for the level design to be more creative and one being a theme park of sorts for one of the TV shows in the game, which is mainly for the psychological themes to kick in. But that unfortunately get old by the 2nd and 3rd visit there. You should already be playing/ have finished this if you enjoyed the first one, and the ending gives some great mystery to where Max's life is going to head to next. I ONLY wish it was longer.                                                                                             9/10 :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Max Payne 2 follows up right where you left in Max Payne and just kicks it up another notch to give you a sweet storyline and awesome gameplay. Take all that and add some pretty much flawless Bullet-time action and you got yourself an almost perfect game.It comes with several difficulties and a Survival mode (kinda)  for seemingly endless pleasure. Friends of a good shooter won't regret playing Max Payne 2. Just do yourself a favor and don't play the atrocity that is Max Payne 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very entertaining game. It's very short, can be beaten in under 6 hours. The story is interesting enough to keep you involved and moves fast enough to where you will never get bored. The combat is the best part of the game. You can enter ""bullet time"" where everything slows down around you and you can feel like a total badass. There is little replay value, I have no interest in playing it over again anytime soon, but if you can get this on sale, it is well worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Max Payne 1 & 2 are the greatest TPS games ever.  I play MP2 every year or two out of nostalgia.  The game still holds-up.  The weapons and combat are absolutely fantastic and are equaled by the story and voice acting.  Nothing else at the time (in FPS/TPS games anyway) made as much of an effort to present a great story.  Notable mention also goes to the fantastic score led by a solo cellist who is also a member of the cello metal group Apocalyptica.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												♥♥♥♥ SPEAKING OF THE WRITING TALENT BEHIND MAX PAYNE HERE'S A GAME THEY WROTEMAX PAYNE 2MAX ♥♥♥♥ING PAYNEOverall if you're only gonna play one game in the series I'd recommend the first Max Payne over this but this is a worthy sequel to the first game. It plays like a proper run-and-gun game eXCEPT YOU GET TO GO BULLET-TIME AND BE REALLY COOL AND MAKE IMPOSSIBLE ODDS VERY MANAGEABLE The writing is what I love the most, though (a smidge over the run-and-gun). because it's NOIR and they know how to do noir. I can't say much about the story without giving it away but just think noir with a protagonist that survives over-the-top odds (so basically noir adapted to a run-and-gun game). Very solid game. Remains one of my favorite game series to this day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not my favorite entry in the Max Payne franchise, Max Payne 2 is still an excellent, though short game. The gameplay is inherently the same as the first title, though there are several changes to the trademark bullet time mechanic. For one thing, it can be used basically in every fight. As Max kills more enemies, time slows down even more, which also you to reload faster, in an appropriatly cinematic fashion. The visuals are also essentially the same as the first game, with the welcome addition of ragdoll physics- blowing random thugs away is much more satifying. The storytelling is again similar, with the comic book style cutscenes overlayed with Max's familiar deadpan. To me, the story is the best part of the game. It ties in closely to the original game and features many of the same characters. Without going into to much detail, there are many twists across the game's 5 to 6 hour length. The relationship between Max and Mona is especially good, though I wish the sequences where you play as her stood out a bit more, as she plays exactly the same as Max. Sam Lake's writing is solid and I would say a tad better than the first game, several of Max's quips are very poetic and the ending of the game left me thinking.All in all, I would recomend this game to any Max Payne fan, though I urge anyone to check of the first game before playing this one!
