												In 2001, I was a junior in high school, and as one, was completely blown away by GTA III. The music, the size of the game, the overall gloomy rainy atmosphere - it was right up my alley. And now, 15 years later, I look back and realized that nothing has changed and that this game still remains one of my favorites. I think it's safe to say that it influenced my life quite a lot - I learned to drive while playing it; I was learning English at the time and the game helped a lot; my music tastes were influenced by the radio stations. And when I was feeling blue, like I did a lot when in high school, I could escape in this approximation of the reality across the ocean. Sure, these days with newer games like GTA IV and V, the graphics are better, the plot is more twisted, guns are more abundant and the music is newer/different. I do like the newer games as well, so can't say they are worse than GTA III. But this one is the one that started the 3D Grand Theft Auto Experience, just like Black Sabbath started heavy metal. So, I'm not sure that what I wrote here qualifies as a review, because I like everything, but here it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game opened so many doors, so many eyes.  I think players new to the GTA franchise would probably be better served with one of the newer titles, but for someone like me who played this game when it first came out, and plenty more after that, this game is a well-remembered old friend.  I have been known to sit in an idle vehicle in some quiet corner of the city, just listening to the talk radio station in the rain.  Memorable characters and challenging quests with dated graphics, but still enjoyable and most certainly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the first PC/Console cross platform games that I can remember and I'll be honest... it was great to finally getting around to actually playing it.I never had a PS2 as a child, or an amazing PC to play and experience GTA III when it was first released over 10 years ago. Instead like the pauper child I was, I had to go around a friend's house and 'play' the game. You might be surprised to find out that when I say 'Play' I actually mean mess about, such as the innocence of youth. So visiting the game 10 years later, as an older, wiser, sillier man with the hindsight of GTA IV's version of Liberty City has been a great experience. There's actually a really good story within GTA III, something that I never appreciated or cared for back when playing at a friend's house (all I wanted to do was steal cars and shoot people). The story that is complimented well by some pretty fun missions and voice acting with one voice stealing the show - there aren't many games out there with Japanese American Accents with a strong double lisp. In general GTA III has aged well, which I don't always find from those first wave of 3D games ~2000ish. The soundtrack has held up well, and it's nice to visit the early days of Lazlow on Chatterbox, and I'm sure some of the stations have even been remastered .Graphically the game looks pretty solid even if I did have a few issues, but I think that was more my fault than the games (I had installed the Xbox Mod). There is a generally known 'issue' with the Steam gtaIII.exe file which can be resolved with an easy to install TXD file on the official forums and Steam forums (it'll fix the dark coloured cars).The one criticism I might have would be an improvement to the camera controls, but I can forgive the lack of control (and the frustration that can sometimes be caused). This issue really comes to head during the gun battles, which at times can be awkward to aim due to a general lack of free aim mode.GTA III might not be as vast or as epic as GTA V, but it captures the reality and craziness that I suspect GTA IV was attempting to offer. The blend of comedy within the serious tones and themes works well, most of which coming across in the now trademark radio stations, but also within Liberty City.There are a ton of easy to miss signs and shops that hold double meaning and spoof popular icons and culture (most of which still relevant today). So while there aren't any real random encounters in GTA III, it's still worthwhile exploring Liberty City as the Sandbox Nature can still reward you with a few laughs due to ad-lib citizen remarks, billboards, shops, and funky AI.In short...GTA III is a blast from the past that's still well worth checking out, especially if it's cheap during on the Steam Sales. As long as you realise this game is over 10 years old, and can appreciate the early attempts of a sandbox game I think you'll enjoy it. If nothing else it's nice to see the genesis of what we know as modern GTA.Check the Steam Forums/Rockstar Forums for the fix for the Steam version before you play, and enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another game that I am a more than a decade late playing...Grand Theft Auto 3 was released in mid 2002; and is actually the fifth game in the GTA series, however this game was the one which changed the franchise into the series we know today. The game is set in the fictional city of Liberty City, which is actually loosely based on New York City. You play the role of a bank robber named Claude, and you become entrapped in a world of gangsters and corruption very quickly.  This was the first GTA game to change from the topdown view of the previous titles and move to a third person view - which combined the a new third-person and driving experience in a new game engine. In GTA III we have the main story line, in which you can pick and choose which missions to complete for certain characters. Many of the missions are not mandatoy to move the story forward however. You can carry out smaller side activities such as being a taxi for the night, or hijacking an ambulance resucing people and dropping them off at the hospital.The graphics are dated but it is over ten years old, what were you expecting? You can get graphically enhancing community made mods to increase the fidelity a bit too. I personally really like these dated looking graphics.GTA III will challenge you at points; more so that you will probably end up dying quite a bit. Some missions require a lot of shooting and evading police, while others involve a little bit of parkour and trying not to just kill yourself in a stupid manner. The re-spawn system is very good in GTA though; you loose all your weapons as well as having to pay a fee for the hospital having to patch you up. As you can see, I have over a hundred hours in GTA III, this is through having multiple playthroughs, as well as completing the game 100% on a number of occasions; however this past week I did a full playthrough of the story and a couple of the side activities and this took me almost twelve hours to complete. There is a ton more content to play in that playthrough too, so you can easily get about fifteen plus hours out of one playthrough of GTA III if you desire. Oddly enough I had no real game breaking technical issues with GTA III, the only one I did find is it is not recommended to play this game with more than one monitor activated at a time, as your mouse will sometimes wander out of the game window and you will end up minimizing your game all the time. To be honest though; just the one issue on a ten year old game is pretty good going if you ask me. In conclusion, GTA III is a land mark in gaming history; it is the game which revolutionized the GTA series, sparked media controversy, and most of all, gave us one of the best games in history. Most will have already completed this game; however if you haven't - I strongly advise you dust your copy off and give it a weekend of your time to play. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's still sit in that territory of old games where you instantly die from falling in water you werent any where near and those kinds of bugs. I suggest installing RealGTA if you're going to play this. It's helps immensely graphically speaking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And my first 3D GTA too.It's kind of GTA2, but in 3D, it's enjoyable for what it is but it's not aged so well and this can lead to some frustration. However is still totally playable and it's surely a classic. Worth checking if you want to learn a bit of open-world history, but I still prefer GTA2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic game. Love it or hate it, this changed gaming. So nice i can still enjoy this title, my very old PS2 is on life support. lol. I have a 360 controller, and just like the store page says, it's not fully supported. You can't turn around! The left analog stick works fine, but the right one which is used to turn, doesn't. So the partial control support is pretty useless because it's unplayable without the ability to turn. But there is an easy fix located in the ""Guides"" section on steam.

												GTA III, a game created by Rockstar North (Edinburgh, Scotland), which was released in October 2001 for the PS2, and later ported to PC in May 2002.Now, i am sure that everybody are familiar with concept of GTA games, so i will cut to the chase.It was the first game in the series to use a 3D engine. The game itself was based in a fictional place called Liberty City, which supposedly resembles New York. Thanks to the engine, the city is dynamic, having a 24 hour day cycle and weather changes.StoryDuring the game you will be playing as Claude, a mute protagonist. You get betrayed during a bank robbery by your girlfriend, which ends up with you getting caught by the cops. You escape and you seek out revenge.At first you will be working for the Mafia, helping them out with a rival family and the Triads. Then, after them betraying you, you start working for the Yakuza (Japanese). Eventually, you do get revenge on your girlfriend, who is a member of the Colombian Cartel. But to do that, you trigger a war between the Yakuza and Cartel.By the end of the game, 5 out of 7 gangs total, will be hostile towards you - attacking you on sight. This can become extremely annoying, considering that some gangs have shotguns which can blow up your car in 2 shots. For comparison, by the end of the game in GTA Vice City, you had only 1 gang that would be hostile towards you, and while in GTA San Andreas, you could completely wipe off all other gangs.I also feel that Rockstar didn't care much about the story, cause in this game your protagonist pretty much backstubs everyone to get his revenge, which is why so many gangs will be against you.Comparison to other GTAsUnlike other GTAs, majority of the game involves using cars: chasing someone. make someone's car burn by ramming it. racing. racing while passing through checkpoints under a time limit. trying to get to a destination under a time limit. trying not to damage the car while under a time limit. racing with a boat. find ""insert car"" and bring it to the garage. get to a destination while being chased by cops/gangs.In all honesty, there been like ~ 5 missions that involve genuine shootouts, and i sort of understand why. All GTA 3 era games were harsh, but the thing that set GTA 3 apart from the others, was that you weren't able to crouch. In other GTA's starting with Vice City, you could crouch behind any cover. Most objects would fully cover your buddy when crouched, and when you start shooting, your character will rise a bit above his cover.The other thing that this game is missing, is a map. Only the minimap is present, but you can never view the whole map. The city is broken down into 3 islands, and each time you reach a new one, the game will show you the icons for Pay'n'Spray, Ammunation, but only for the first few missions, then they are gone. So if you are gonna play it, you better memorize the necessary locations.Also, you can't shoot tires or break windows of a car. You can't even damage a car with a baseball bat. These features started appearing in Vice City.ContentIt is fairly low on content compared to other GTAs.Amount of cars[gta.wikia.com] 4 sport cars. 4 ""2 door"" cars. 4 ""4 door"" cars. 3 jeeps. the rest are taxis, ambulances, police cars etc, or generic vans.There are no motorcycles or fly-able vehicles.Amounts of songs in the radio - 8 radio channels, each having about 6 songs on average. Compared to say Vice City, which would have 15 songs per channel, that's pretty low. Also, majority of the music isn't very popular. In fact, if you start searching for most of them, you will only see them under GTA 3 logos. Not that they were bad or anything, but clearly it shows that they had budget problems.Also, unlike other GTAs, there is only 1 weapon per tier.PC PortThe PC port itself is quite bad. Mouse issues. FPS limited to 30 fps.I suggest using SilentPatch. It fixes most of these issues, but unfortunately, if you die or get caught by the police, the game will crush. I hope you all do remember that during the GTA 3 era, we didn't have quick saves and only way to save was to go to the hideout.Do i recommend it?Well, if you are interested in the story, then you may buy it, cause all GTA 3 era games are connected. Chronologically, plot wise, the games are set this way:1986 - Vice City1992 - San Andreas2001 - GTA IIIOr in case you wanted to see how much the series has evolved (like me), then you can get it as well. This game has quite an impressive lift bridge.Or maybe you would prefer to play it in top down view? This is the last GTA that allowed you to set your camera view to top down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those in trouble in getting the game running  (like me and others)  :**no menu visible**no 16/9 full screen mode**low resolutions**car can not drive backwardsIt took me some time in browsing forums, but it comes to this in a nutshell.Salvation is found in these two mods :1) SilentPatchIII 1.1 Build 52) SP DDraw for GTA III/VC Build 4 -->unpack and install them in your steam folder 'GTA3' and game will run like a charm on windows 10.Bravo to the modders,  bad points for Rock Star.And last but not least, this setting is also required in the menu :Options - Display - Frame limiter - 'on'When it is set on  'off', the car physics are weird, even some cars can not drive backwards.You are ready to step into vintage gaming and playing the game that is the founding 3D-father toall later sequels of GTA and games like Mafia, Just Cause, Saint Rows, Saboteur (not on steam) and yes, even assassin's creed.

												The very first time GTA went 3rd person and it was AWESOME.The game is a legend. For the first time you can do everything a GTA had to offer while living it inside the game and not above it.The main character was not voiced yet at that time, but the game is still awesome, with a crazy story twist of events and weird-funny characters.Although roaming sandbox games existed before this title, this one certaily was the very best 3rd person full 3D graphics sandbox game at the time.I was glad to had the chance to play this from start to end and if you ever get the chance to start a GTA marathon, you won't be any disappointed!Totally recommended!

												This game isn't so bad and many core gamers find this game awesome as you can do almost anything to commit crimes, but watch out for Police and your heat level. As most of the players know the GTA series, the only thing with GTA3 is the crude ""PS2-like"" GFX, as it was originally released for PS2 in 2001 but the disappointing part for the PS2 version is the lack of compatibility for the later revision model of the PS3 and PS4. The Steam version however may contain some GFX colour errors when you play in-game like the vehicles with a distinctive yellow glow; plus your saves from the PC Retail Version - that if you choose to transfer into the Steam Version may corrupt it.Overall this game is enjoyable, and it's generally for over 18s only, plus it does contain some racist stunts and footage: like the Italian Mafia going into Mob Wars with the Chinese Triads. And if you proceed after going into Mob Wars with the Triads and siding with the Diablos, then your chances of survival in the city will be reduced, due to the mobsters trying to take revenge against YOU! So, if you do want to make a 100% complete stats, then I recommend you stay away from other jobs except Luigi's. Because those Taxi/Police and Fire Engine jobs will be impossible if the mobsters start severely opposing you. And don't fail and save when you play on those ""Kill Frenzy/Ramage"" missions as those are a 1-way ticket.Speaking of 1-way tickets: If you approach near Mission ""Bomb Da Base - Act II"", then be aware of Luigi's, Joey's and Toni's jobs, because if you not finished them all, you will never get the 100% completion. Same goes when you reach Staunton Island if you not finished the Jobs from Kenji when you get Donald Love's Jobs. And when you get a Mission from Shoreside Vale, except the PayPhone from Southside Hoods, DON'T buy anymore weapons. Trust me you need the cash for the final showdown.Now I believe this game appears to be the only game in the GTA 3D series onwards that don't reduce your Criminal Rating stats, so you can cause some cheating mayhem as you want. But don't use them for the newer versions of GTA as those Stats will be ruined.One final thing, you can download some fixes like the Long Distance enhancement and some of Silent's DirectDraw fixes for this game. Try it! It should be safe:http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=686http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=779 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto III is one of the most revolutionary games ever made, it changed the video game landscape forever, so let's get into it.We play as Claude, a young bank robber who is trying to make it in Liberty City. After a bank heist his girlfriend Catalina shoots Claude and leaves him for dead. After a prison break Claude escapes and so begins his quest for revenge towards Catalina.The gameplay is pretty identical to every other GTA game, but I'll explain if you want to know. The game is a sandbox title where you are free to explore at your own pace, you can travel by foot, by car or by boat. No air travel just yet. It's fun driving around and seeing the sights in Liberty City.The gameplay is very stiff for this title. The driving is very hard to control and requires a lot of time getting used to it, but once you're used to it, it's not big of a problem. The game also has a mission structure and every mission requires to do a lot of different stuff, ranging from racing, to hitman missions and a lot more stuff. A lot of the missions can be fun, but a lot of them are incredibly difficult and here is the biggest problem with the game.Now don't get me wrong, when a game is challenging that is not bad, but when it's so hard it's next to the point of being unfair is not good. GTA Vice City and San Andreas has a good mixture of difficulty where the missions where possible no matter what. GTA 3 however is incredibly difficult due to the very confusing objective placements and really punishing missions where a few good placed shots could blow up your car.The soundtrack is also really lackluster. Every radio station only has 4 songs each ( at least from what I remember). But a lot of the songs are good, so I won't go too harsh on it.The story is really great, while not the best thing of all time, it helps to push you to the conclusion and it really satisfies you after the end credits start rolling.While playing, I had zero issues with the game. No crashes, no game breaking bugs. Apart from minor AI glitches, I had no problems.The game took me 13 hours to finish, after you're done, you also have races and packages you can collect all over Liberty City.Overall GTA 3 is a good game, but it has not aged well since 2001. It's a revolutionary game and I won't deny the impact it had on the world of gaming, but I highly suggest players to buy either Vice City or San Andreas.Final Rating:6/10 - Worth Purchasing on SaleIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Every legend begins somewhere, and Grand Theft Auto III is the game that laid the foundation not only for the entire GTA series as we know it today, but in many ways for the entire open-world sandbox structure of games that continue to enjoy popularity.  It's been said that this game pales in comparison to the games that would come later in the 'GTA III trilogy', namely Vice City and San Andreas.  While it's true that those games further refined and expanded upon the GTA experience in important ways, the essential building blocks for those changes were created here in GTA III.I've trumped up the historical importance of the game a bit but the question remains as to whether the gameplay in GTA III has held up, especially in relation to the later iterations in the series.  Thankfully I can answer that with a resounding, ""Yes!""  So let's talk about some of the things that make this game tick.  First and foremost, we have the story.  In GTA III Rockstar was pinning down some of the aspects that would come to be regarded as the Rockstar style of storytelling.  The story here is basically a love letter to latter day crimeland movies like Goodfellas, Heat, Donnie Brasco, Reservoir Dogs, and the like.  In this capacity all the requisite pieces are in play, including the Italian mafia, Japanese yakuza, Chinese triads, as well a healthy assortment of street level thugs.  You are a mute protagonist (who we would later know as Claude thanks to GTA: San Andreas), making a name for himself on the back of jobs from all these various criminal factions.  Naturally there are betrayals, double-crosses, hits and feints between all of these organizations, and Rockstar handles its authorial pen deftly enough to keep the story moving at a good pace.  The whole story has the tone and feel of a pulp crime movie you might see as part of a matinee crime movie marathon; nothing of great substance, but a whole lot of fun nevertheless.In GTA III we also see the beginnings of Rockstar's tendency to include well-known actors performing voice work in their games.  Here we have Michael Madsen, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Rappaport, Debi Mazar, Kyle MacLachlan, and gangster movie legend Frank Vincent all playing supporting roles in the game.  The caliber of voice acting in this game really does some great things for the conveyance of the story.  In the hands of lesser actors, certain aspects of this story might have come off as laughably cringe-worthy.  As it is we are treated to voice work performed by old pros, particularly where crime drama is concerned.Here we are also treated to the first GTA game to include an absolutely killer soundtrack complete with genre specific radio stations, distinct DJs for each radio station, and some great licensed music.  It had been quite a few years since I played this game, and these tunes (as well as spoken dialog) really filled me with a sense of nostalgia.  In truth it's the radio stations that give this game its comedic timing and fantastically dark sense of humor.  As an added bonus, the PC port of this game allows you create a custom playlist of mp3s which can be imported into the game.  I really had a great time importing my own tunes into the game.  Once you do so, the 'MP3 Player' becomes selectable in any vehicle just like a normal radio station which plays your tracks on random repeat.  Let me tell you that you haven't lived until you've gone on a drive-by rampage with Electric Wizard's Funeralopolis blaring from the sound system of your Patriot.  >=DThe gameplay mechanics are admittedly somewhat long in the tooth at this point, but even still they are pretty darned enjoyable.  The drifty, somewhat floaty driving mechanics that are a hallmark of 3D GTA games make their debut here.  At first the driving might seem a slightly off, being that I don't know of any other driving game that handles quite like the GTA games.  The handling is a bit loose, but once you get that part dialed in it's a real blast.  Of course the looseness of vehicle handling depends a lot on what vehicle you're in at any given time.  It does need to be said that there are no motorcycles in GTA III, which for me is perhaps one aspect of the later games that I missed the most here.  There are also no helicopters, and only one (notoriously difficult to control) aircraft.  That said, the variety of vehicles available here is suited well to the game, and I feel that the slightly limited selection of vehicles can be forgiven being that we are talking about the first GTAs first foray into full 3D.This was my first play though of the Steam PC port of GTA III, and I will say that I found some relatively minor issues with the port.  First and foremost, the aiming mechanics were … problematic for me in this version.  In the 'Classic Control' scheme, the relatively responsive nature of the auto-targeting feature found in the console version of the game just doesn't carry over very well in the PC version.  It fails to reliably switch between targets, and in many cases it fails to find any targets at all (despite the fact that said targets are in the process of filling you with lead).  Furthermore, when you're using the Classic Control scheme the right thumb stick puts you in first person look perspective rather than adjusting the 3rd person camera as one might expect.  Others may have had a slightly different experience with Classic Mode controls, but for me the combination of the above factors made this option a non-starter.  The 'Standard Control' scheme makes some marked improvements to the above, but in this case you're stuck strictly with free aiming.  I tend to prefer keyboard & mouse controls for games that require free aiming, and indeed given that strafing features prominently into the Standard Control scheme in GTA III, one might assume that KB+M is what the developers had in mind here … except that KB+M makes driving nearly impossible (although not entirely impossible as I do know at least one person that beat this game entirely with KB+M).  Using the Standard Control scheme, I ultimately ended up ruling in favor of using a controller to better facilitate driving, although I did find a helpful mod that made this option a bit more feasible.  The GInput mod allows you to fully utilize an Xinput device in GTA III which makes using a controller in the game a bit more palatable, and has the added benefit of additional customizable settings.  It even swaps out correct button icons for onscreen prompts.  So there's that.On my (Nvidia-based) gaming rig there were also a couple of graphical glitches present in this port.  Most noticeably I encountered the 'dark vehicles' glitch, in which all the vehicles appear to have a much darker tint than they should.  For this issue I applied a second light weight user-made patch to the game which resolved the issue promptly.  If you find yourself with the same problem, this fix is probably worth your time as well.At the end of the day, the question is whether or not this game is still worth your time.  Given the popularity (and occasional notoriety) enjoyed by the GTA series, you probably already know whether the source material is your cup of tea.  Dark comedy, violence, and debauchery abound!  If you're already a fan of the series, or if you're looking to get into the 3D era of GTA games at the ground floor, I would say that this game still holds a lot of enjoyment even today.  It had been a number of years since I last played this game and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected I would especially given the historical perspective of subsequent GTA games.  This old jalopy has still got some life in 'er yet!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is the landmark game that made the jump shift to 3D back in 2001. Before that, previous GTA games where in 2D top down perspective.As the series progressed, none could have achieved without the stepping stone of this game. Even thou the controls are very clunky, story is very plain, and outdated gameplay compared to the recent entries.Still a very great game to this day!7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is well regarded as a pioneer in the third person sandbox game genre. It can be compared to other genre defining games like Wolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 before it. The core foundation that GTA3 rests it's hat on is simplicity. It has a very simple premise, after being betrayed during a robbery you set out for revenge in Liberty City. The story is full of mostly entertaining characters and mostly fun missions. That simplicity works double for the gameplay.GTA3 introduced and perfected a gameplay loop that the franchise has still kept for the most part. There's a set of story missions you undergo inorder to unlock further parts of the game and see what happens next in the story. Alternatively you can ignore the story and explore the city at your leasure. While doing sidequests like driving a taxi cab or looking for hidden collectables. This core gameplay loop of missions, sidequests, collectables with a freely explorable open world wasn't a common thing at the time, and it blew people away with how impressive the whole experience was. At the same time though because there have been so many games based off it, it occasionally feels like it lacks an identity compared to the glut of sandbox games that came after it. This is fundamentally the base game that all future sandbox games jumped off from. It's a game I like to go back to every so often to remind myself where it all started. And to remind myself that Rockstar set the bar pretty high from the start and just kept going from there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing all the other GTA games in the series, I never really got too far into the game back on the PS2, so I recently bought it again on here to complete it.The game's performance is perfect and the visuals despite being dated are still very nice to look at, especially when you download the Widescreen Mod, so I have been playing this in 1080p like a remaster. I also would reccomend the GInput mod, as it gives you 100% Xbox 360 controller functionality, and has made the game just as playable as the later games in the series. I would like to point out I am playing on Windows 10, without a hitch.Overall I recommend this game as the story is great and it is definitely worth another play just for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Windows 10 (and judging from forum posts, 7 and 8.1 also) users:Be aware that this game is old and will probably not run on your PC. Mine worked fine for a day, now it crashes immediately when I try to start it. Same for VC, by the way. To give you an overview of what I tried:- compatibility modes- running as admin- deleting gta.set- adding the game to DEP- Silentpatch- download ddraw.dll- deleting savegames- copying savegames to different User Files directory - reinstallingSooo... Be careful what you buy. I usually buy old games from a different platform that actually patches them to run on modern systems *shrug* sort of expected this here too.---If you got an old PC I 100% recommend this game. Played it as a kid and loved it, still do today. Kind of disappointed I can't continue playing :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And what about that soundtrack...unbelievable! The sequels were good, but the original started it off and will ALWAYS be a classic.This game was my favorite for a long time, and still is one of my favorites. Maybe it can't stand up to more recent releases of the GTA series, but for its time, best of the best. Anyone who misses this title should regret having lived his/her life.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GTA 3 - the cornerstone of the whole modern richness of open-world games, a must-to-play even still, after 14 years after release. You may ask, why it is still a must-play, when we have so many fine games of the same genre, with GTA V in the first place?As usual, the point is in the impact this game made on the whole gaming world and all around it.For example, when Ubisoft desired to make its own ""ala GTA"" product, they look namely on the GTA III as the base model. You can see the similarity with your own eyes: in the map, in the cars. Almost senseless vigilante Aiden Pierce is also not a big step from GTA3 protagonist Claude, even if he talks more, his behavior and usual activities are just about the same (except of ha-king, of course).Seriously, this game is not a history, it is fine to go even today. Camera and controls may be a bit tricky for start, but when you succeed with it - you'll get a nice trip into underground world, one of the best interpretations in the whole criminal stories cluster. It is just as playable now as any of GTA ""clones"", like Sleeping dogs, Watch dogs et cetera... but it is original.Well, for me this is one of those unforgettable things I'll carry in my life, with all tips, shortcuts and armor locations, which I remember, while not touching it for more than 10 years. But it is not about nostalgia. It is just a really strong stuff. Maybe not the best in line, maybe dated... But still pure and stout. Good taste. Solid 7.5 mark in my book, without any rebate for former experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Set in 2001 in a fictionalised version of New York, known as Liberty City. The protagonist of GTA III is Claude, who is mute. Rockstar Games said, ""His last name may or may not be Speed,"" as a reference to the protagonist of GTA 2, who was named Claude Speed.Grand Theft Auto III was the first game in the series to utilise the 3D Graphics and use the 3rd Person Perspective. It was also the first game in the series to have an indepth story. This is the game that made GTA popular and even more controversial than it already was resulting in censored versions being released in certain countries. If it wasn't for this game's success, Grand Theft Auto wouldn't be where it is at right now.Have put numerous hours into the PS2 and iOS/Android versions			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember playing GTA 2 on my Playstation and thinking: ""If only this game was in 3D, it would be perfect"". Soon enough Rockstar North (then known as DMA Design) delivered. It was truly revolutional, one that put open world genre to the map. Interesting dialogs and story that was inspired by many gangster movies and characters voiced by actors such as Joe Pantoliano and Michael Madsen surely left an impact in the gaming industry.Game was phenomenal when I played it for the first time, and didn't lose its charm when replaying it many years later. You can blindly follow missions and slowly unravel story or you can choose to do one of many side activities that are present. Driving taxi, chasing criminals in police car, save wounded as paramedic or putting out fires are all an option. If you feel like discovering every corner of the Liberty City (loosely based on New York City) - there are 100 hidden packages to find. Want to unleash some anger - find rampage tokens and try to kill certain number of people for a given time. You like cars and driving - you can search the city for a rare models and big payoff in the end when you collect all of them. While doing that you won't be bored, radio stations with 3.5 hours of material are there to make sure of that. Choosing between big music hits and talk radio stations will often be a hard decision. Dark humor is omnipresent and is surely one of the series trademarks.City is pretty small compared to ones in future instalments, but at the time it was more than enough. There is no map (except mini-map) and learning shortest route to some locations will be a must for certain missions. I always liked this aspect; no pausing all the time and carefully planning every turn. You play as silent protagonist and throughout game will encounter Italian Mafia, Yakuza and Colombian Cartel. Add to the mix corrupt police detective and weird multi-billionaire businessman and you have a full package. GTA 3 deservedly received many game of the year awards and started a trend which its sequels will continue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I could write just one word here and call it a day: REVOLUTIONARY.This game had mediocre graphics, iffy physics, uninspired storyline and it ran badly even on some powerful PCs. It was undeniably rushed, with a plethora of bugs popping up left and right. They didn't even bother to put a roof on most of the buildings, assuming no one will see it (they were wrong)... These are actual complaints frequently repeated back in the day.And yet, this game has redefined the term ""sandbox"" into what we know it as today. It didn't excel at any aspect... but it just made a darn good use of all what it had. It really felt like the most complete and realistic simulation of a gangster yet. Wreaking havoc has never been so satisfying before.At the time, the possibilities appeared endless. The city seemed huge beyond imagination, I could spend hours just driving around listening to the radio. There's nothing you couldn't do - you could have multiple apartments, save cars in a garage, fly a plane, drive a boat, annihilate surroundings with a tank, work as a cab driver, paramedic, firefighter or even a cop (!). Not to mention the map was filled up to the brim with collectibles and other minor secrets.Many people despised the dull and grim looks of the Liberty City. To me, it is fitting. Unlike many of the sequels, in this entry the city is dark and often shrouded in fog. This really makes for an distinctive atmosphere.Even though the graphics as a whole failed to impress, there were so many little quirks it really caught your attention. You could rip out car panels. Doors could open on impact (which would then flap around as you drove in the corners), and the protagonist would attempt to close them. Cars could spawn in several variants, for example as a cabriolet or hardtop. You could dismember pedestrians - a feature that was removed from the subsequent games. There were leaves and old newspapers floating around. Rockstar has also implemented a day and night cycle and various weather conditions, making the virtual world ever so immersive.The soundtrack is superb, it's definitely one of the things that made GTAIII so special. I love the fact that the radio stations were composed mostly from music produced specifically for this game. It's really a shame that Rockstar has dropped this approach in the newer games (aside from Liberty City Stories, which also featured a truly unique and memorable soundtrack).As with any GTA, this game doesn't take itself very seriously. The humour is spot on. I especially love the chat radio stations, they always end up talking about such nonsense crap it keeps me in stitches.If I had to pick one thing about this game that has aged the worst, it'd definitely be the plot and missions. The main storyline is just a typical ""betrayed man who seeks revenge"" scenario with little to no unexpected plottwists. The missions mostly revolve around transporting the item/person, collecting items, killing someone, driving from point A to point B... This was perfectly acceptable at the time, but now it feels barren. Even the big finale doesn't really stand out from the rest.Also, the main protagonist is completely silent. While I like that it makes him much more intriguing and mysterious (and some say this makes him easier to relate to), I really do feel like this was a wasted opportunity. Take a look at the sequels - characters like Tommy Vercetti, Carl Johnson, etc. are unforgettable. Claude just isn't.Any way you look at it, it's a classic, a truly groundbreaking title. For me, this is by far the most nostalgic entry in the series. No other game made a bigger impression on me and none ever will. To be honest though, Vice City improved on pretty much every aspect and if you've never played III before, I doubt you'd enjoy it today. But if you can stomach it not being as good as Vice City, it's definitely recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GTA III takes place in Liberty city, in the year of 2001, and we play as a silent bank robber named Claude, that was betrayed and shot by his girlfriend, and after escaping a prison transport, he wants revenge.+ it was a MASSIVE revolution in the open world games back in 2001, blew everyone's minds and shaped the industry to the open world era and the ""GTA clones"".+ First GTA ever to be fully 3D + Good graphics for the time (looks dated now, but tolerable)+ Great gameplay for the time+ Good arcade driving physics+ Rockstar's first try of a story for the GTA series, and even if it's not great like later games, it was a nice start, with charismatic characters and voice dialog+ The open world, now considered tiny, felt HUGE at the time+ Good selection of weapons+ Opponents can be dismembered by shots, something that is only possible in this game on the GTA series so far+ Iconic cars like the banshee, Infernus and the Stallion were born in this game+ There is a plane on the game, named ""dodo"" (a bird that couldn't fly), and it fits the name very well, since flying this thing is a challenge on its own. It's basically a minigame.+ Nice soundtrack (Flashback FM is the best radio station, with the whole scarface movie soundtrack)+ huge mod community- Missions get quite hard at the end and can be frustrating, because of the respawn system (the hardest 3d game of the series IMO)- You can't swim- Motorbikes, helicopters, and planes (proper planes) were not present yet- gets stretched visuals on widescreens (To fix this I recommend the widescreen Patch by ThirteenAG)- The shotgun and M16 are very OP, and can kill you ou blow up your car in a few shots (annoying on late game)- by the end of the game, mostly everyone hates you, and cruising the map in certain areas can be very dangerous and annoyingI also recommend the ""silent patch"", by silent, that fix many bugs of the gameOverall, this is a piece o video game history, a masterpiece of the early 2000's , a must have for GTA fans and fans of open world games in general			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game brings back memories. I played this game a good deal on the PlayStation 2 and it actually still holds up to this day, though it definitely shows its age with the visuals. Though nowadays I prefer the zaniness of the Saints Row games, GTA III still holds a special place in my heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personally, i think that GTA III is the weakest in the 3D universe, but it's still an awesome game. It only falls behind because the other GTA's improved on this one, but being the first 3D GTA, it was very impressive at the time and still today. The story is simple, being a mute guy that mostly just takes jobs from other Liberty City residents. Gameplay wise, the on-foot and shooting sections are a bit clunky, but it seems that Rockstar Games was aware of that, and most of the time you'll be driving, with simple but responsive gameplay. And the missions feel surprisingly varied, and aren't too hard with some exceptions. The music is good, but the soundtrack is a bit short. And of course, free roaming is as good as ever, especially while driving a tank! In the end, if this was the only GTA out there, it would stand the test of time for me, but the others put this on a bit on the shadows. But definitely a classic, especially because it's one of the roots for all sandbox games today.Note: Even if you don't like mods, there's 3 that i would probably recommend.1 - SilentPatch, an unofficial patch that fixes many bugs and issues.2 - Widescreen fix, for adjusting the image correctly for your widescreen.3 - GInput, if you want to play with a controller.

												Just finished the game for the first time in years. I've always played it on my PS2 when I was a kid, but never had the chance to actually beat it.GTA III is a fantastic game. It's one of the fathers of 3D open-world gaming. You can see elements of this game in current generation open world games, like GTA V or Watch Dogs 2. It plays a big role in videogame history, for sure.It has some limitations, but I think that's exactly what makes this game special and different from the other titles. For example, GTA III lacks a map - yeah, you just can't pause and open the map so you can mark and travel wherever you want to go. In order to go to an Ammu-Nation store, for example, you need to know your way to the store before going there, without the help of a map or a blip. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes, but I actually think that's lovely. In the last missions of the game you probably already know Liberty City better than your own real city and that is pretty much fantastic. The game lacks many basic functions that were later introduced in GTA San Andreas and other titles, but this doesn't turn the game into a bad game. Not even close. Its limitations create a unique and pretty nostalgic feeling.Also, it is locked on something like 25FPS. And no, you can't unlock it to 60FPS without breaking the whole game while doing it. If you disable the built-in frame limiter, the game simply goes nuts. Physics, cars, AI, pretty much everything breaks up. There's a simple and functional workaround for that, I'm writing it on the next part - so let's talk about its flaws.The PC version have some flaws when played out-of-the-box. Wide-screen resolutions are stretched 4:3 and man, it looks like♥♥♥♥♥ You need to patch it with a fan-made fix in order to play it in real 16:9 Widescreen, then it gets lovely.Also, PC textures are not very good. They're pretty much the same as the PS2 version and they're kinda ugly IMO. But there are patches fixing that without transforming or changing the game experience. The original XBox version of the game had way better lighting effects, textures and pretty much everything enhanced. There's a fan made patch that inserts these XBox upgraded assets into the game, too, so you can play the DEFINITIVE version of the game without modding it and changing the experience as a whole. It stays original and as a bonus, way more beautiful.Also, this mod also fixes the stupid framerate lock. It upgrades the 20FPS slow♥♥♥♥♥experience to a very smooth, beautiful 35FPS one. Yeah, I know you must be laughing at me right now, but trust me. I mean, please, trust me. This game is absolutely fantastic at a locked 35FPS, man. I really couldn't believe I was playing something so smooth at that framerate. Really, frame-pacing is ROCK SOLID and the smoothness is great. You can check how to enhance your game experience with this game on PCGamingWiki. They have a very good article just about these patches and fixes.To end this long, tiring review, I must repeat that GTA III is a AWESOME game. It's legendary and every videogame fan should play it because it plays a gigantic role in videogame history.It may not be as good as San Andreas or the modern ones like IV (which is the best, IMO), but it still packs a lot of nostalgia and a great experience. I truly recommend everyone to play it, because it is simple, PLAIN AWESOME.7/10, legendary game. I felt like I was in 2002 again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When this game came out it was revolutionary. Now, its age is very visible, especially in the graphics department. The missions can become repetetive and some aspects of the game are annoying. But I have found myself forgiving the game all of its flaws. It still is a very good open world game, and it does have its moments. Give it a chance, you might like it. And if you like it enough you will find yourself putting in 50+ hours in the effort to 100% complete it. Whatever you decide to play, have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It certainly hasn't aged all that gracefully, but damn if it hasn't left a still noticable impact on the gaming landscape as we know it. There's a lot that can be said about Grand Theft Auto III, from the initial media perception to how it shaped free roam and open world. But at this point why bother when I can ask the simple question; Is it a good game? Well sort of, as mentioned prior GTA III hasn't aged that well, although still tolerable it lacks many refinements brought by later franchise entries and you'd likely not play it as much as you would years ago upon release as more enjoyable games exist. However this is not to say the campaign itself isn't worth playing, it may not be as well written as the likes of IV or even VC but it has it's own charm ignoring obvious clichés and maybe you'll get something out of seeing how far GTA has come.

												Normal GTA gameplay, and still remarkably fun to return to. Shooting feels solid, and satisfying to use, and the keyboard controls work well, although drive-by shootings are very difficult to perform, requiring you to drive using WASD, look out the side of your car with E or Q and press the left mouse button to shoot, while trying not to crash. But since you can get round most of the occasions where you may need to drive-by by running over people, it isn't an overwhelming problem.Those used to the new GTA's may be upset with the lack of the ever fun motorbikes and aircraft in the game (the one plane, a Dodo, is almost impossible to get into sustained flight, which it isn't intended to do). But it makes up for this with a good story, a  great New York-style world made of three island, and a enjoyable selection of cars, vans, lorries, supercars and a tank.All in all, GTA III is worth a revisit, if only for a while and for it's story.

												I bought this along with GTA Vice City, San Andreas, GTA 4, and the DLC that comes with 4 for $15.After being super excited that this deal was real, I quickly purchased it. Then read the reviews, and got nervous.. A lot of people are having issues running it on Windows 10. I'm using Windows 10.. BUT, Before I even started the game I went to the program folder (steam/steamapps/common/GTA3), and right clicked the application, and clicked the compatibility tab, and had it run as Windows XP SP3.It works fine, and I've had fun playing it again. Can't wait to play the whole story, it's been so long!Must buy for anyone who shared awesome memories, and loved playing this!The only thing I have seen act weird was the menu. Sometimes the menu selections disappear. I just quit the game and tried again. Once I had to just blindly guess navigating through the menu. Small price to pay for someone like me, but I know some of ya'll dislike anything that isn't perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic Information:Genre: ActionDeveloper: Rockstar Games Publisher: Rockstar Games Release Date: 21 May, 2002Story:The game is set in the fictional city of Liberty City, which is actually loosely based on New York City. You play the role of a bank robber named Claude, and you become entrapped in a world of gangsters and corruption very quickly. This was the first GTA game to change from the topdown view of the previous titles and move to a third person view - which combined the a new third-person and driving experience in a new game engine. In GTA III we have the main story line, in which you can pick and choose which missions to complete for certain characters. Many of the missions are not mandatoy to move the story forward however. You can carry out smaller side activities such as being a taxi for the night, or hijacking an ambulance resucing people and dropping them off at the hospital.Design & Graphics:Graphics in GTA3. The characters look fantastic, the cars are all well modeled and break apart extremely nicely, and overall, the texture quality is quite nice.Controls:Normal GTA gameplay, and still remarkably fun to return to. Shooting feels solid, and satisfying to use, and the keyboard controls work well, although drive-by shootings are very difficult to perform, requiring you to drive using WASD, look out the side of your car with E or Q and press the left mouse button to shoot.Audio/Music:Grand Theft Auto III features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. As if the music itself weren't incredible, the voice acting is superb, and represents some of the best quality sound.Pros Amazing story. Awesome voice acting Great graphics. Cool in-game cheats. Cons Would have been awesome if it had a multiplayer. More weapons.  Planes that you could fly.  Score Rating  7.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto III is my favorite game of all time. It is so fun without mods, the story is amazing and the characters are great too. You are in Liberty City (Based on New York) and you work for many gangs and even the police. You start off getting betrayed by Catalina (ex-girlfriend),  and are left for dead. You and some others are in a police convoy and soon are stopped. You are stopped by a gang (the gang your ex-girlfriend is apart of) and they take an old man who comes into play later.When they were going towards the cop car, they dropped a bomb on the bridge. You and a man named 8ball take down the police and soon the explosion happens. You are left with a car and you drive to a safehouse. You change clothes and go to a man named Luigi. Luigi is a pimp and ask you to do very simple task. The first is to pick up a girl named Misty. You bring her back and you are then asked to kill a man with a bat, take his car and give it to Luigi. Then you do some simple driving task and kill some pimps. You meet Joey and you do task against the Forelli's. You also help out a man named Toni, steal a van and do a bank robbery. Tony makes you help him with his beef with the Triads. The triads start to attack on sight now and you do your best to destroy there busniess and kill important people in their gang. You soon meet the Don. Salvatore asked you to do some task with his wife Maria. She grows a liking to Claude. Salavatore has you destroy some Colombians (Catalinas Gang). You also kill a snitch who feeds them information and soon Maria tells Salvatore about an affair of her and Claude. They try to kill you but you escape on a boat into the second part of the game. You now work for the Yakuza. They ask you to deal with the mafia by killing people out to kill Claude and murder Salvatore. Soon you get to meet Ray, a cop, who also introduces you to Donald Love. Ray ask you to murder his ex-partner and to help out Phil Cassidy (a character in Vice City and Vice City Stories). Ray at some point leaves Liberty City and leaves you weapons and a bullet-proof Patriot. You are introduced to Donald by Ray. Donald Love has you murder Kenji (Asukas Brother) to help prices in real estate. He also has you do task to get a package and help the Old man that was taken in the beginning of the game. At some point Donald leaves with no notice.  During one of Donalds missions you encounter Catalina. She is with Miguel (part of the beginning heist) and she betrays him, soon Asuka intergrates him thinking he killed her brother. Asuka gives Claude missions to try and destroy the Cartel. On the last mission Asuka gives you she ask you to destory a plane and when you go back, you find her dead and a note that ask you ti bring a ransom to get back Maria. You bring the ransom and they try to kill you. You shoot down a chopper and save Maria after killing the Cartel members. The game is now finished. Mods can make this game live longer like updating graphics, adding more missions and whole new storylines.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recommended - with caveats.Controls: A major hurdle.  For a while I was prepared to give in and call the system broken.  After working through it, I eventually began to find a work around.  I spent most of the game using a 360 controller because, as the title implies, much of the game is spent inside vehicles and the mouse/keyboard vehicle control is dire.  However the combat controls are much easier with mouse/keyboard, where you have the option to point directly at a target and move the camera at will.  When using a controller, one has to rely on the faulty targetting system which will rarely aim at who you wanted it to and is in general quite clunky.  I could also find no option to turn off inverted y-axis aiming for the controller.  The upshot of all this was that if I was using a first-person weapon, I would have to grab the mouse to aim, and if a particularly challenging foot-based mission cropped up, I would have to change the control scheme entirely.  Workable, but flawed.Gameplay:  I thought this game was exceptionally well structured but first I should add that this is not a good sandbox by modern standards.  It was probably the archetype for the modern sandbox 'genre' but things have moved on a lot since then.  GTA III is just not able to compete with more recent games in terms of scale, scope or variety.  This does not mean however that the game cannot be enjoyed on its own terms.  One specific example from my experience was my initial frustration with the lack of any kind of overworld map - something that would be unthinkable in any modern-day open world game - but this merely led to me developing a more thorough knowledge of the city streets than possibly any other game I've played.  The areas are large enough to become immersed in, but never so large that you feel lost or overwhelmed and each street almost feels like it has its own unique personality of sorts, which aids navigability and adds to the charm of the experience.  If it had not been for the quality of the gameplay, I would not have had the patience to stick with the controls that I described in the previous paragraph.Story:  Behind a minimalistic mission-based story progression, there is actually quite an intriguing plot going on in the background.  Nothing particularly special, but more than I was expecting.  On a side note, I'm not sure if our protagonist is a soulless mercenary or just a bit dim, but either way he seems more than happy to go along with whatever maniacal schemes his employers hatch for him.Graphics:  This is not a pretty game.  I don't believe this to be particularly pertinent, but it's worth pointing out.  The best that can be said for them is that they are functional and I was able to tell what everything was.Sound:  Very good.  There is no background music in the game besides the intro and credits sequences, but the soundtrack to the game is provided by radio stations which can be accessed while in a vehicle.  These cater to a diverse selection of musical tastes, and most players will find at least two favourites which they will keep coming back to.  The scripts for the DJs has also been artfully written and it's clear a lot of effort went into creating a cohesive aural environment that acts as a reflection of the city you drive in.  This applies tenfold to the talk radio station, Chatterbox, which bears several repeat listenings.  The sound effects are also of top quality and you can get a feel of the car you have just entered merely by the sound of its engine revving. Overall, I do recommend this game to anyone with the patience to work around a poor control scheme and somewhat archaic design to see the unpolished gem that lies beneath them.  I do not think it still deserves the piles of praise that were heaped upon it on its initial release, but equally it is impossible to deny its merits, and the irrepressible charisma with which it flaunts them.

												A great open world game, inspired by the likes of the Godfather trilogy and Scarface. With the authentically recreated city of New York (Liberty City) to explore, a great soundtrack, fun gameplay and a dramatic plot, this game is a real classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GRAND THEFT AUTO IIIThose who know what Grand Theft Auto, you can not tell about all the virtues of the new game. Perhaps You are faced with one of the first parts of the GTA. Even if not experienced, then now must face, because, finally, came the long-awaited third part. All series game wonderful total violence and aggression. In the new part, gamers are given complete freedom of action. Now you can smash, crush, kill, use any means at hand. The city is teeming with police cars, crime bosses.You are a young offender, he found himself on the streets of liberty city. Yesterday You threw a friend. Anger boils inside, nobody wants to believe more. And then fate sends familiarity with well-known criminal authority, which sells explosives and engaged in other dark deeds. But, having worked with him a couple of dirty operations, you understand what it takes to start a business, and that working for a boss, it is hardly possible to achieve something in this life. After some deliberation You decide to go the private swimming, that is, to begin to do business on their own. In this way You will not be deprived by treachery, meanness, greed, and other human ""virtues"". But you chose this world this way, but because – ""I want to live – learn to spin"". The more that power is more than enough.Liberty city is a huge computer world. They can just enjoy wandering the streets and riding in cars – simply living in this world. And, of course, a lot of kinds of quests and missions will diversify the already entertaining life. I would like to give advice – do not use the descriptions and passages of play – the only way You will get the greatest pleasure from the gameplay. But if you get stuck at some point – you should refer to the passage, because banging my head against the wall is rarely interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game brings back memories. I played this game a good deal on the PlayStation 2 and it actually still holds up to this day, though it definitely shows its age with the visuals. Though nowadays I prefer the zaniness of the Saints Row games, GTA III still holds a special place in my heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that started it all! Humour is absent in this one and our protagonist does not say a word. I believe GTA became really good only from Vice City, still, if you'd like to see the first TPS version you can pick this one up if discounted. It certainly looks dated and a lot of features were missing (e.g. shooting out vehicle tires) that later on made the gameplay really good, still, it is a classic and there's nothing wrong with looking at where GTA came from.Even today it is nice to see that 10 years ago someone could make a game with a huge city full of side missions to complete. I suggest that those of you who love the GTA franchise pick this one up if discounted and spend at least two weekends to see where the series came from. And yes, I know this is out on smartphones along with Vice City, but I'd stick to the good-old keyboard and mouse combo instead of tapping a small screen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that started the phenomenon. There's a lot of fun to be had tearing through the city on  your own personal crime wave. Offensive, yes, but the game doesn't take itself seriously. It's fun precisely because you do stuff you would never do in real life. Arcade action. While fun, the game doesn't hold up well against modern open-world games. Some missions can be difficult, so be prepared to try and fail multiple times. Difficulty isn't a problem, though. I like a challenge. Poor controls on the PC, limited camera control, lack of in-game map, and overall fragility of your character/vehicles cause a lot of frustration. Half the time I feel like I'm fighting the game itself, rather than overcoming a challenge. The costs of failure is high, and you are more likely to just reload a previous save, meaning you'll need to visit your safe house to save between every mission. I may eventually finish this game, but I have to take it in doses. I'm hoping Vice City and San Andreas are less frustrating.About controls... I like to use keyboard/mouse on foot and an XBox 360 controller while driving. The game does support controllers, but it doesn't recognize all of the buttons. If you want to use a controller, save yourself some grief and spend an extra $10 on XPadder. It's still not great, but at least you'll be able to use all buttons. You'll need them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a big difference to GTA2. I missed a great intro movie but the new 3 dimensional world was just too great to be sad. The point of view of GTA2 is not playable because of bold black borders around the cars, but really soon I didn't missed the old charm.I played many great mods to keep the fun right after finishing the game at 100%. Although I played the missions multiple time.  Makes too much fun.I suggest to play the anniversary android version. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me just be clear: GTA 3 is an amazing game, I'd super recommend it; 9/10. But, DO NOT GET IT IN PC. At least not if you have a new computer. It's sad, but if you want to play it, get the PS2 version, because this version is broken due to lack of updating. Like I said, great game, jus buy somewhere else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am very biased and nostalgic about this game because i grew up with it. I bought it on steam just so i own another version of the game and to speedrun through it for the 100th time.Putting my biased opinion aside this game is nowhere near as good as vice city and san andreas. The story is not as good, the characters are not as memorable or interesting and the missions themselves are more varied and offer a lot more then gta 3.Vice city and san andreas are easily 10/10 games to me, even though i want to i can't logically give gta 3 a 10 because there is no denying that the others are better. Its also a very short game if you are just focusing on the missions there isn't much to do outside of missions anyway. It will obviously take you longer to beat on your first playthrough the later missions can be very frustrating and difficult to new players. 9/10 (Amazing)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play GTA 1 and 2 a lot and when in 2002 GTA 3 was released (for the PC) it was really cool to see GTA in 3D for the first time. One of the first things I enjoyed most in GTA 3 was cruising the city with my radio on. Exploring new parts of the city and finding new side missions.Pure nostalgic for veteran GTA players, but also fun for players who like classic open world action-adventures.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short version: 82%GTAIII offered excellent open world game play and map design with a plethora of interesting characters and a compelling story mode set in the underworld of an alternative New York. Too bad it didn’t age nearly as well as the next two games.Long version:When it came out, GTAIII was heralded as the first great step to a brand new era of Grand Theft Auto games. In retrospect, it is more of a mixture of new elements that later defined the series, and old ones left from the first three games. The location (Liberty City, an alternative New York), many characters, and things like the top-down driving camera, car crusher, bomb shop are all relics of the past, all forgotten in later instalments.They fit nicely alongside the new additions though, like third-person gameplay, the cinematic mission briefings, the new car physics, and the weapon handling system. These all made GTAIII not only accessible to a wider audience, but did so without dumbing down the game too much for the plebs.Exploration and running amok randomly were always part of GTA, and GTAIII is no exception. The return of the rampage challenges and the collectibles also support the free roam aspect, but the real strength lies in the missions. The loose collection of jobs is replaced by a massive storyline about a mute small-time gangster who has to work his way up in organised crime to take revenge on the woman who shot him in the back.The plot is grim, but the execution isn’t so. The series always had a hefty dose of dark humour and liked to satirise the consumer-oriented society. This is even more apparent here, where human lives have no meaning, and you may cause mayhem for the silliest of reasons.The gameplay and controls by today’s standards sadly lack a lot, and the engine isn’t really suited for post Windows XP systems. But if you ever want some GTA nostalgia, this is the best place to start.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good! Ran on Win7 Ultimate x64 SP1 fine. Though, if you have a multi-monitor setup like I do, you might run into a mouse problem where if you scroll to far to either the right or left or top or bottom, depending on your setup, your cursor will fly out of the game window and onto the desktop(on one of your other monitors) and then when you click the mouse button, the game minimizes which is annoying. Yes so it would appear that the game doesn't lock mouse cursor to the primary monitor or whichever monitor you're using to run the game in, in full-screen. To fix this, you can either disable all but the monitor you're using to play this in, in full-screen or use some sort of third-party patch/software that locks your mouse to a particular monitor until your game closes or whenever. Also there's a glitch if you set your fps cap to more than 30(and 30 is game default), you might instantly die whilst sprinting from a high surface to a lower ground surface. I was playing this with a 60 fps cap and was doing fine, except those rare instant death glitch. Any higher and the game gets pretty glitchy....so it would appear that the game was designed to be played at 30fps? idk. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The granddaddy of them all. I played this game back on the PS2, and repurchased the game for Steam so I could have it in perpetuity. All modern sandbox games owe everything to this series, and this game in particular.In case you've never been exposed to a sandbox game before, you effectively are dropped into a city which ""lives"" - you can go around to various contacts looking for missions to accomplish (usually involving driving and shooting), explore the city looking for sights and items to collect, or even accomplish random missions like running a taxi or putting out fires with a fire engine. This game marks what was effectively the first time this sort of freedom was in a 3D game.The game's story puts a low-down person fresh out of going to jail into a criminal underworld where he slowly climbs his way to the top to get revenge. I've played through this game multiple times and while it's ultimately the least of the trilogy, it is the giant whose shoulders the other two stands upon.I have not yet dabbled in the mod scene for this game, but searching around seems to imply there's a fairly healthy number of them to pick from, so if that's your thing, it's worth a look. At any rate, this is a classic which should be a part of anyone's collection. Very, very highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""no more ultra-violence in video games""ESRB came into every single home like a plaque, then rockstar took on the media with two of the most controversial video games to this day, that was manhunt and Grand theft auto three. GTA 3 is based on the work of R* and turned heads in so many crowds, it had such success that the media tried shutting down violence in the video game industry, unfortunetly Rockstar made one of the most successful games that forged a generation of veteran gamers, GTA 3 hold's a special place in my memories, where you can hijack the banshee from across 8 Ball's garage, put a series of gamebreaking cheats to turn this sandbox into the most exciting game for it's time.the GTA veterans will appreciate the trilogy over the recent installment of GTAV which was also a outstanding piece of work by R* games. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sure, its pretty old and the graphics arnt amazing, but the missions are fun, and who doesnt like driving around and blowing stuff up? (Not in reality of course). Buy this game, NOW!!!

												Great game, although one that didn't age as well as the others.Very basic compared to nowadays.-No jumping out of moving vehicles-No limb based damaged, headshot is as good as a body shot if it isn't a sniper.-Jumping and touching anything will cause you to flinch-No in game map-No blips for pay n spray or Ammunation after a certain point-Expresso 2 go is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Definately a classic, these are only things that came with being the first to pioneer this genre, which doesn't make it bad at all.

												""no more ultra-violence in video games""ESRB came into every single home like a plaque, then rockstar took on the media with two of the most controversial video games to this day, that was manhunt and Grand theft auto three. GTA 3 is based on the work of R* and turned heads in so many crowds, it had such success that the media tried shutting down violence in the video game industry, unfortunetly Rockstar made one of the most successful games that forged a generation of veteran gamers, GTA 3 hold's a special place in my memories, where you can hijack the banshee from across 8 Ball's garage, put a series of gamebreaking cheats to turn this sandbox into the most exciting game for it's time.the GTA veterans will appreciate the trilogy over the recent installment of GTAV which was also a outstanding piece of work by R* games. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												**SPOILERS BELOW** **DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME YET**GTA III is a really fun game, but I think there's a common misconception with the GTA series that I'd like to write about. This misconception is: In GTA you can do whatever you want. Any fan of the GTA series will tell you that there really isn't that much to do in GTA, because it's meant to be an arcade styled open world driving game. And this is pretty obvious in GTA III, the main character doesn't speak, which honestly... I've come to really prefer over some of the other characters in this series. GTA III didn't try to be this game where the map was meant to be explored. But it did reach out for things like an open world, and a story. I love this game because of the driving, and the fast paced missions, but I won't sit here and act like this game excels in anything other than the driving. The setting is pretty dull, and uninspired. The map was just really lifeless, and the radio station didn't help that at all. I ♥♥♥♥ing hated the radio station to death, except for lazlo's station which made me laugh uncontrollably. The story was absolutely flimsy as is the case in most GTA games. 1) two timed by your crew in a bank robbery2) broken out of prison3) in a city with no money but with a partner (8ball)who hooks you up with a connection to the mafia (it always seems to be the maifa)4) You work your way up in the mafia, and then they betray you, I forget why though.. Alot of betrayal in GTA.5) meet another gang in an unlocked part of the map (game basically restarts at this point)6) work your way up in that gang7) You do jobs for a bunch of shady people8) These shady people set up a gang war between your original crew who two timed you, and the crew you are two timing now.9) You do all the missions10)  Uhp, random girl is kidnapped.. I oughta go save her from my arch nemesis. I really had no idea Claude cared for revenge or justice until this point11) You end up killing all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the game12) game pretty much ends, except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay phone missionsThis game is a 7/10 in my opinion			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first thing you should know about GTA III is that it didn't age as well as other games, the later games are more polished (duh) gameplay and storywise.However as someone who hasen't played this game way back when, it's still really good. The Silent Patch for GTA III is needed to run on windows 10 to prevent alot of crashing, it also fixes many bugs and includes features originally not in the PC version. Native Widescreen support is poor, and skews your crosshair, but the widesreen patch fixes these issues. Remember to leave the frame limiter ON, it caps your game at 30 fps but its needed to not break the physics and prevent other bugs. Disable Trails if the ""motionblur"" is too much for you as well. The combat system is alright, armor, cover, and shooting first is a MUST to win firefights as the game gets pretty difficult, especially if you screw up. Remember to save often as well. However it's the atmosphere that really caputred me, from the inhouse-music on the radio stations taht are surprisingly good, to driving around Liberty City, getting shot at by gangs that have a pricetag on your head. Its a city torn apart by crime(one mission has the city in a blown-out turf war by two gangs), but that won't stop you from getting revenge.The story isn't as complex and well thoughtout as other games, but  the setup is really awesome, and there are great moments through out the story. You are a criminal named Claude (last name may or may not be Speed) who was just betrayed by your girlfriend, and left for dead during a bank robbery. When you were being transferd to prison, the prison van was intervented by the Columbian Cartel, who then blew up the bridge you were on after kidnapping a certain inmate who is important later in the story. There were only two survivors of the explosion, you and a fellow inmate nicknamed 8-Ball. You become hired muscle for almost all the gangs in Liberty City, you rob, kill, and run what were supposed to be simple errands gone horribly, horribly wrong to get revenge on your ex. The story is surpisingly intresting if not more basic than say GTA IV or V.Definatly worth a sale purchese, if not the full $10TLDR: Game is good, but not as polished as GTA V. Get The Silent Patch and Widescreen Patch for ALL 3D ERA GTA Games to prevent crashing and improve conmpatibility.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a good game. I really had a hard time doing some of the missions.The traffic and PED is tricky but working better as Vice City.I managed to complete the game in 16 hours and had a great time. The game had me both laughing and mad at times.It's a good, old school GTA game.It's just difficult that the pay'n spray icons are not displayed on the map.Nor are the ammu-nation locations or any locations of interest. Except for the missions.There is no map button, no way to see the map. Sometimes the game asks you to go to a certain location and you have no idea where that place might be.There is an annoying bridge sound you hear from afar when the bridge opens, pretty annoying.Pretty good game if you ask me. Worth the 10 bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[PROS]Ah where do i begin.. i first played this game when i was 10 or 11 cant really remember and oh boy did i have♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun with this game. GTA 3 at its time was a masterpiece that barely any other game can come close to and raised the standard for the future Grand Theft Autos. The story was quite interesting and i wont spoil anything but in this game you are going to experience rollercoaster of emotions and explore all gangs in liberty city and get to know their plans etc.. The music is exquisite ranging from 80s,Reggae,Techno and even ♥♥♥♥ing Classical music.. yes you can listen to Beethoven while you drive over helpless civilians. This game has alot of cultural refrences and easter eggs you can discover scattered throughout the Liberty City. All in all you get quite a good package here and to consider what sort of crap we are getting today this is pure GOLD.[CONS]However i was quite dissapointed that our main character was bland as ♥♥♥♥... he cannot speak and most of the time he nods like a little baby.Most of the cars are unstable as ♥♥♥♥ and little oversteer will result in you being on a roof and resulting in a big boom.NO ♥♥♥♥ING IN GAME MAP???? ...Had to use google pictures :(..A blast from the past 10/10 would play again.

												A great game that I had much fun with going back a few years on PS2. The controls are easy to get a grips with and for a price of £2.99 you can't go wrong. This game is all about the nostalgia of being back in Liberty City with 2002 graphics. But to be honest, graphics on these old GTA's never matter if you are a true GTA fan. The story line is as gripping as ever, also I reccommend once completed that you try out different cheat codes and mods to give a little more fun because once this game is completed it can be a little tedious to play. However, the game is an absoloute classic and goes down in my books as one of the best in it's era. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto III is the game that changed the gaming world for the better. It was a step in the right direction, this is the first full 3-D 3rd person grand theft auto game, that's right kids, this is the grand daddy of 3-D games!The game takes place in the dark Liberty City, you play as Claude, a mute,but badass, person out for revenge after you were dumped by your girlfriend and shot in the middle of a bank robbery by her.Now claude should do what the Aggalah ft. Sean Price song said: Keep Rising to the Top.The vehicles are great, each handles uniquely, An SUV may be brawny but slow and understeer like hell (or flip over like a landstalker) while a sports car may grip the road and move like a small rat but will easily get damaged. Rockstar games has put a lot of effort into this title. The game lacks features like bikes etc.. but vice city fills that need.The game's story is great, voice acting is good, gameplay is excellent. Soundtrack is top-notch, you'll find Scarface music, Pop and Rock music or 2000s Rap music.I recommend this game even today, it supports X360 controllers with a small mod. 10/10 would recommend!

												Great for a first GTA game in 3D. It was like GTA1 coming to life in 3D, it was excellent and never been done before. I think that's what made it so great.The engine was pretty terrible by the way; it used a filter that would require too much power. Thankfully it could be turned off, but it was still heavy on the CPU usage. Still, if you're looking for the best GTA game, try Vice City or GTA4 first.[Rating: 88/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto III, What a classic in my eyes. The story in this game is really good and enjoyable, but it is really short. The game has aged quite a bit in the graphics department , but it's still fun. If you plan on using a controller with this game, get ready to fight with the camera. The Music in this game is excellent, I find myself listening to these songs even after so many years. When installing the Steam port, I had a lot of problem with textures, but a simple patch fixed all that. I can't say Grand Theft Auto III is the best choice for someone looking for a first time GTA game. It's aged and story is really short. I would say pick up Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, or Grand Theft Auto IV for a first time GTA player. It's still a good game even so. 4/5 - Wonderful			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto is the definitive answer to all the critics of violence in video games. It simply smashes all those statements allowing you to kill anyone you see, destroy everything and have a good time too. It raised a lot of controversy that did nothing but help the sales, my guess is that it's the best card Rockstar has under their sleeve (and don't forget Jack Thompson). The series have seen a new life within 3D graphics, making Rockstar Games, become superstars. These days it's easy to see the faults of the game, but it's a very nice nostalgic feeling of returning to this world of crime and violence... Ah good days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic game that is definitely worth getting if you're yet to play it. While the 2001 rendition of Liberty City may not be as open as it's 2008 'remake', GTA III is a classic title that is definitely one of the most difficult in the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game that I had much fun with going back a few years on PS2. The controls are easy to get a grips with and for a price of £2.99 you can't go wrong. This game is all about the nostalgia of being back in Liberty City with 2002 graphics. But to be honest, graphics on these old GTA's never matter if you are a true GTA fan. The story line is as gripping as ever, also I reccommend once completed that you try out different cheat codes and mods to give a little more fun because once this game is completed it can be a little tedious to play. However, the game is an absoloute classic and goes down in my books as one of the best in it's era. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just beat the game for the first time, ironically the only 3D GTA game left for me to finish, but there's a first for everything, right?GTA III gave me a hard time sometimes, but in a good way. It's got a nice difficulty level to it which is never unfair to beat, but usually challenging. Storyline is alright, good enough for a 2001 third-person shooter. Gameplay works like a charm. It's running extremely stable on Windows 10, have not experienced a single game crash in 20 hours of playing - very nice! Final mission: rather simple, but satisfying enough, surely. Works for me.What I didn't like is the fact that GTA III does not have a complete built-in map, only the minimap on the radar, and how the game expects you to know your environment better than you usually would, such as having to find out where the tunnel from Staunton Island to Shoreside Vale is to be found - very tricky when having to escort a police officer in merely three minutes. But that's just that. Small things to criticize, nothing that would ruin a very, very neat game like GTA III for me personally. CAN recommend - especially if you're into rather simple gameplay, and like a good challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay gameplay (something between VC and SA), pretty nice graphics, but thats all. Story line for this game is -1/10, literally there is no story line. Random and nonsense movies before missions, main character who dont say a word in whole game and context... Yes, context is missing here totally. Just awfull comparing to San Andreas or Vice City. And music in all radio stations just wasnt for me, used my own playlist from PC what isnt good thing for game IMO. And yes, I know, this game is more like old GTA's - just for missions, but still I cant handle missing story line here. Just for missions and default GTA stuff this game will be ok i guess.

												This is an pretty decent game. The story and missions are fun and take some time to finish, and it forces the player to explore parts of the city to finish missions and find weapons. There were some difficult missions that frustrated me because either they weren't clear enough with the instructions or the timer was too short and it rushed the missions for me so I needed to find a walkthrough to finish. The cars in this game flips over really easily and you can't flip them upright no matter how hard you try so that might ruin some gameplay and missions for you especially if gangs and police are chasing you and ram your car over. With a silent protagonist and not alot to offer after finishing the main missions it's not worth coming back to. I never felt immersed like I did in San Andreas or GTA 5, the soundtrack wasn't that great but it did bring nostalgic memories back. I would recommend this game if it's on sale or if you're looking to play it again for nostalgic reasons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have a long history with this game. I would get home from school when I was 5 and ask my mother and father to play it. I played this game all the time. I have been playing this game for almost 12 years now, so this game is mostly nostalgia for me. The game is very basic in gameplay. The story is good, the characters are good. Only bad thing about this game, is it is very basic, but it was the first 3D GTA game to come out in 2001. Vice City, in my opinion, is better, but this game is more of a childhood game for me, more than Vice City.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't get me wrong, GTA III is an awesome game - arguably one of the very best GTA games ever made (the story is a helluva lot better than GTA V), but this Steam version is garbage. The game was made for Windows 95 and in typical Rockstar fashion, they continue to sell it unpatched despite it not running properly, or even at all, on modern systems. Even in compatibility mode, you're lucky if you can get it to work without crashing or freezing on every loading screen (which means every few minutes if you do the missions). Intro videos won't even play at all, because they're in a resolution too low to be supported by modern graphics cards and monitors.If you run Windows XP, you may be able to run this game, but otherwise I'd recommend to not bother wasting your money. Otherwise, GTA III is a great game. It was the first GTA game to depart from the top-down view and try for a more indepth story. It's of course old and looks old now, but it set a new standard in its day and was one of the very first open world games. Just don't support greedy developers who continue selling old games without bothering making sure they even work on current hardware (hell, they can't even be bothered to support GTA V, so not really a surprise).

												Played it for the first time ever, so it's a fresh look without nostalgia.Gameplay is solid, it's fun to drive around, sadly the world is small and dead and there's not much to do aside from the missions.Radio is horrible, with only one good music station (Flashback), two stations that have a couple good songs (Lips and Head) and an amazing Chatterbox with Lazlow. When I got tired from music I listened to him non stop. All other stations are worthless.Some characters have broken motivation for their actions. Plot is semi-non existent. It's told in little bits, just so that we can get the picture, but it fails at being a mosaic that we put together and ends up distant from the player. And the ending is anti-climactic.In the end it's not enough. Playtime is decent, it took me 18 hours to complete, with exploration, side missions and package retrieving. But the plot could've used some more depth. Characters could've been drawn out better. They appear and dissapear and slip out of the mind.It is a good game, but perhaps the worst GTA I've played.

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is the great transitioning of the old Grand Theft Auto formula into a fully realized open world gameplay. Grand Theft Auto 3 was developed and published by Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive.Grand Theft Auto 3 is revolutionary for bringing about the realization of a 3D open world game in the bustling mimicry of New York known as Liberty City. The possibilities in Grand Theft Auto 3 are truly up to you. Jack cars, drive off cliffs, start a massacre, jump off buildings and bridges, hook up with P rostitutes, work for crime syndicates...the least of what is possible in this game and it's sequels is entirely up to the persons choice, a relic of freedom in gaming.

												Ah, Grand Theft Auto III. Where do I begin? Hello again friends! Like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, I have been playing Grand Theft Auto III since its release date back in 2001. When this game was first released it was revolutionary! The first 3D Grand Theft Auto! Amazing, truly amazing. The storyline is excellent (♥♥♥♥ YOU, CATALINA!) and the soundtrack is actually not that bad (listen to Rise, MSX, Flashback FM, Head Radio and last but not least Double Cleff FM). The only downfall to this game was not including the beautiful and talented Misty into more missions. What a shame. Anyways, if you are sitting here reading this review contemplating whether or not to buy Grand Theft Auto III I say buy it RIGHT NOW. It is a classic. Also like Vice City, this game was made when Rockstar actually cared about gameplay more than appearance. So if that doesn't make you want to buy this game I don't know what will. Once again friends, I thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules and I sincerely hope that I have influenced your opinion on Grand Theft Auto III and your choice on games.Yours in gaming,Dubgame.

												Grand Theft Auto III, well, it's GTA. Anybody who has played Vice City, San Andreas, or any of the PSP games (Except Chinatown Wars of course. We do not speak of Chinatown Wars.) will basically have already played this game.You play as a convicted criminal, who's convoy was ambushed mid-transfer leading to his release, and ends up working for money. Fairly simplistic.You can go anywhere in the bits of Liberty City that you've unlocked, drive along to music running over pedestrians or cruising through the subway tunnels like a nerd with a wedgie, use weapons, blahdynlah.The game's definitely enjoyable, with quirky jokes and fun/dark/fun things to do, constantly. But I do have complaints as well.A lack of controller support is annoying, especially for those who first played GTA3 on the PS2/Xbox and want the same experience. The graphics aren't very good either, but I'll let it slip going by it's age. A lack of free camera movement in vehicles is hindering to say the least, and the fact that you can only run for a small amount of time before your character is 'tired', a sadly staple feature of the GTA games, is also less than ideal.Aside from this, all I can say is, it's GTA. You do some missions, get a fire truck, kill everybody, get in a cop chase, get killed/arrested then repeat the cycle. If that's your thing, then £6.99 won't burn too big a hole in your pockets.This game gets a 6.5/10. Good slab of entertainment there.Quote of the game: ""Hey Joey, I'm bored.

												This is a truly amazing game we have here. It may be a little dated and all but there are mods for that. This game has a great introduction introducing the main character (Claude Speed) and his friend (8-Ball) who comes into the story again much later. You start doing minor jobs as a driver for a pimp/club owner. Then you do jobs for the mafia from heisting a bank truck, to delivering a corpse to cover up a murder. Again the graphics and A-I may be a little dated but the initial freedom does certainly put a smile on your face. The game has two paths you can go on: progress through the story, or just explore. To start you probably want to explore to get used to it. I'd suggest stealing a taxi and doing the taxi oddjob, which after you complete 100 fares you unlock a special taxt called the Borgnine. The police chases are endless fun as they are in any GTA game. I grew up on this game so it may warp my vision of its age a bit with nostalgia but still it is a great game. It does lack in several elements that are key in GTA games today, such as the lack of a full map and not being able to rotate the camera around your vehicle in angles that aren't 90 degrees, and the aiming is a little off but you'll get used to it. There also other versions such as the PS2 version, Xbox, and mobile Android and iOS devices (these versions do not support cheats but are easily modded). I'd heavily suggest that you play the PS2 version first to get a feel for what your getting into. The main differences between the PC and the PS2 are that PS2 has an auto targeting system and the camera isn't consistantly behind the player. This version however has many pros, such as extra items on the map, customizeable skins, mods and many more things. Overall this game is worth the purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that invented sandbox gaming, and a powerful gaming series! Admittedly not very well done on the PC (very buggy, practically unplayable) but was AMAZING on the PS2. The game is visibly outdated by today's standards, but put yourself in the mindset of this games release day, and you will enjoy imminsely. For best effect, make sure vertical sync and frame lmiters are ON. If they are ON, you will see all cars as black due to a bug. But if they are OFF, especially on higher end PCs, the game will play in fast forward, and virtually every tiny little thing will take health from you (falling off the curb, etc). But aside from the cars looking weird, the game plays fine. Enjoy a classic!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the first GTA I ever played. It was part of what got me into gaming. So much fun can be had just rolling around in a car listening to the radio (great soundtracks!) and just generally adding to the game's debauchery.

I recommend this game for anyone looking for an open world sand box game to just generally have fun with music for hours on end. It's worth every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not as good as vice city or san andreas but it is the first one of the 3d universe and it inspired all open world games we have today.It has missions that can be really hard, gun play is also hard and iritating because you have no autoaim like console versions.so you better need to have a good mouse and some good aim to hit ennemies from long distances because you are dead in a second if people are shooting at you.Also i need to note something bad and that is......AI... The ai in this game is the most iritating and one of the only bad things about it.especially car ai, people drive like♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game and they keep crashing into you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros+Should run well on any computer that meets the requirements, and I haven't had any problems with the frame limiter off, unlike Vice City.+Radio stations are very good, but they are short (I don't think any of them last more than 40 minutes before looping).+Missions are fun.+Liberty City looks good and you can go for hours just driving around.+Support for mods and MP3 radio station.Cons-Not as much content as later GTA games, but that's kind of a no-brainer.-Story not really involving, with the prolouge cutscene being less than 30 seconds, and a mute protaganist.-By the end of the game, every gang will try to take you out whenever they see you, which makes exploring a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥OverallIt's still fun, but is quickly getting dated when looking at more recent GTAs and other open world games. You should really only buy it if you played it way back when on your PS2 or PC and you're looking for a trip down memory lane. As revolutionary as it was when it first came out, it simply doesn't hold up that well nowadays. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a truly amazing game we have here. It may be a little dated and all but there are mods for that. This game has a great introduction introducing the main character (Claude Speed) and his friend (8-Ball) who comes into the story again much later. You start doing minor jobs as a driver for a pimp/club owner. Then you do jobs for the mafia from heisting a bank truck, to delivering a corpse to cover up a murder. Again the graphics and A-I may be a little dated but the initial freedom does certainly put a smile on your face. The game has two paths you can go on: progress through the story, or just explore. To start you probably want to explore to get used to it. I'd suggest stealing a taxi and doing the taxi oddjob, which after you complete 100 fares you unlock a special taxt called the Borgnine. The police chases are endless fun as they are in any GTA game. I grew up on this game so it may warp my vision of its age a bit with nostalgia but still it is a great game. It does lack in several elements that are key in GTA games today, such as the lack of a full map and not being able to rotate the camera around your vehicle in angles that aren't 90 degrees, and the aiming is a little off but you'll get used to it. There also other versions such as the PS2 version, Xbox, and mobile Android and iOS devices (these versions do not support cheats but are easily modded). I'd heavily suggest that you play the PS2 version first to get a feel for what your getting into. The main differences between the PC and the PS2 are that PS2 has an auto targeting system and the camera isn't consistantly behind the player. This version however has many pros, such as extra items on the map, customizeable skins, mods and many more things. Overall this game is worth the purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that invented sandbox gaming, and a powerful gaming series! Admittedly not very well done on the PC (very buggy, practically unplayable) but was AMAZING on the PS2. The game is visibly outdated by today's standards, but put yourself in the mindset of this games release day, and you will enjoy imminsely. For best effect, make sure vertical sync and frame lmiters are ON. If they are ON, you will see all cars as black due to a bug. But if they are OFF, especially on higher end PCs, the game will play in fast forward, and virtually every tiny little thing will take health from you (falling off the curb, etc). But aside from the cars looking weird, the game plays fine. Enjoy a classic!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the game, this is where it all started. In 2001 Rockstar games released this title and made history and pretty much everyone has played this game and knows what's it about, but the question is - while being a ground breaking title more than 10 years ago, is it worth playing now and how it has aged ? So game looks pretty good, for the time and even now-days  the graphics feels tolerable. It features day & night cycles and dynamic weather. Environment is pretty huge and worth exploring, you'll find some hidden weapons, side missions etc.Voice acting is done pretty well, however recordings them selves are at pretty low quality, game has several radio stations with different styles of music and tracks, however I disliked pretty much every soundtrack, but maybe thats just me and for the time that music was actually pretty cool.Story is really generic, with you leveling up and making name for yourself in underground crime scene. Game had descent number and variety of missions, starting with some more simple and ending with some quite creative goals for the time, sometimes even involving whole map. It took me about 13 hours to complete the story and do about 40-60% of side stuff.One aspect where game have aged terribly is the game play it self. Car handling is good, but physics sometimes are just awkward and bizarre and sometimes slightest hit can make your car flip and spin like in first flat out game. Gun controls also are pretty weird, were you have to often aim at where bullets are going not where crosshair is pointed. Missions themselves are quite challenging and more than often i found myself replaying same missions more than 3 times in row. At the end i would recommend this game if you somehow missed this title, to see where sandbox genre has started. If you want to go and get some nostalgic feel than it's a mixed bag, with some things cool and fun to play while others just being aged and a bit frustrating. I guess at the time game was mind blowing and had earned a lot of 10/10s, but today for me game feel's like solid 7.0. Thanks for reading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The only problem with this game is, from my experience, it has terrible controller support. I am using the Logitch 710, basically a clone of a PS2 controller. For a game that was released on the PS2 I would expect its PC port to have a setting for the same controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you play this game as it was meant to be played - as a mission-based game, with the possibility of diversion - it's the best GTA by far, and one of the best games ever made.The cars are unstable and break apart quickly, and walking is not a viable option for more than a block, meaning that you will have to keep commiting crimes and attracting police attention. This ensures that the pacing will never bog down. The high difficulty of the latter missions is completely necessary to the game, as it brings out the greatest strengths of the open world genre - the player will often HAVE to get creative and find an alternative way to solve a mission, because the ""standard"" way is either too hard or outright impossible. Couple this with a ton of potential for utter chaos to occur, due to rather chaotic, ""loose"" mechanics, and you have possibly the greatest use of the free-roaming model ever.An utterly brilliant game. It's not perfect - it could be larger, the story could be a bit more complex, and the shooting could be a little better, but don't get Vice City or San Andreas over this. They're good, but this is, even after all these years, still the best free-roaming action game that we have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If the video games of the 1980's are remembered for Super Mario Bros and the 90's are remembered for Mortal Kombat and (sadly) Superman 64, the early 2000's will be remembered for Grand Theft Auto III. It introduced a truly non-linear concept onto gaming and emphasized choice and freedom over everything at the time. While it is mostly known for its violence and the fact you could have terribly animated car sex with a hooker, do not forget its godfather inspired storyline and quite frankly hilarious dialog. Nothing is more hilarious than hearing a police helicoptor pilot exclaim he's going to kill you when the co-pilot is going ""YOU CANT SAY THAT, ITS NOT IN THE BOOK!"". The controls are sluggish by todays standard and if you're wanting the definative GTA game on this engine it is San Andreas you should be looking at, but lets not forget the game that started all.Saints row is still a better game than GTAIV however, deal with it.

												Ahh GTA III, the freeroam game that set the standard and set off the media on a frenzy. Suggestive movements and moans when you recover health with a hooker in a car, sheer amount of violence and gore for the time, censored version in Australia to protect minors (though begs the question to why you would let them play in the first place), and one of many of Jack Thompson's ""blame the game"" defences.For the game itself, it's not that much of a farcry from GTA IV and I'm sure you can pick it up easily. If you haven't tried any sort of freeroam game, then GTA III is a decent game to start. I recommend picking up the ""Grand Theft Auto Complete"" pack if you don't have any games from the series, best if you get in during the holiday sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GTA III is back when Grand Theft Auto was still kind of brutal.  The dark atmosphere and the fact that the game is always during the nighttime is really unhelpful and just doesn't feel like it fits the ridiculous pretentions the GTA games in the past and in the future embodied.  GTA IV is certainly an improvement on the idea, but GTA III has enough good ideas that I can let it get away with it.  Everything is really dynamic, cars don't spin out like there's grease on the wheels, although there is a blighting lack of bikes, the narrative is solid and even though the BJ Blascowitz lookalike doesn't talk and therefore has no personality, there's nothing objectivly bad with it.  It's a fine and fair reminder of where all this began.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I chose to play this to go back to the start of the most recent installments of the franchise. I've played later titles such as San Andreas (which are i think overall better games) but having said that this is still good value for money if you don't already own it. The gameplay, graphics, size of the open world etc are of course more basic than later versions and there's the incredibly annoying downside of the character not being able to swim. Overall though there's still nothing quite as much fun as setting a gangster on fire while he's trying to kill you or doing an insane 400ft jump off a cliff. There's a reason this game got so much attention when it was released			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

GTA III has a immersive story that you follow, and along the way, wreak havok on Liberty City to your heart's content. With a varied range of weapons and vehicles, achieve your goals in any way you feel like it, or just explore what Liberty City has to offer. Time has not been so kind to the graphics of GTA III, and animations are a bit wonky and broken, but that doesn't detract from the fun that will be had during the whole game. On top of all this as well the game features fleshed out characters and stories than few games had achieved at the time, and a very memorable soundtrack.Replayability, unfortunately, is one of GTA III's shortcomings as there's not much to engage in after the main story has been passed, save for rather bland side missions, and blowing up Liberty City for the 100th time, there's not much after to look forward to. 8.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you play this game as it was meant to be played - as a mission-based game, with the possibility of diversion - it's the best GTA by far, and one of the best games ever made.The cars are unstable and break apart quickly, and walking is not a viable option for more than a block, meaning that you will have to keep commiting crimes and attracting police attention. This ensures that the pacing will never bog down. The high difficulty of the latter missions is completely necessary to the game, as it brings out the greatest strengths of the open world genre - the player will often HAVE to get creative and find an alternative way to solve a mission, because the ""standard"" way is either too hard or outright impossible. Couple this with a ton of potential for utter chaos to occur, due to rather chaotic, ""loose"" mechanics, and you have possibly the greatest use of the free-roaming model ever.An utterly brilliant game. It's not perfect - it could be larger, the story could be a bit more complex, and the shooting could be a little better, but don't get Vice City or San Andreas over this. They're good, but this is, even after all these years, still the best free-roaming action game that we have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If the video games of the 1980's are remembered for Super Mario Bros and the 90's are remembered for Mortal Kombat and (sadly) Superman 64, the early 2000's will be remembered for Grand Theft Auto III. It introduced a truly non-linear concept onto gaming and emphasized choice and freedom over everything at the time. While it is mostly known for its violence and the fact you could have terribly animated car sex with a hooker, do not forget its godfather inspired storyline and quite frankly hilarious dialog. Nothing is more hilarious than hearing a police helicoptor pilot exclaim he's going to kill you when the co-pilot is going ""YOU CANT SAY THAT, ITS NOT IN THE BOOK!"". The controls are sluggish by todays standard and if you're wanting the definative GTA game on this engine it is San Andreas you should be looking at, but lets not forget the game that started all.Saints row is still a better game than GTAIV however, deal with it.

At its time it was ground breaking: an open realistic world, fantastic sound track and voice acting,  cool characters and endless possibilites.You could just drive through the city listening to music, do crazy stunts, kill cops or play as a cop/ taxi driver etc. The only bad points are some clipping errors and the mediocre shooting system.Even to this day the game is very enjoyable if you don't mind dated graphics.

												Ahh GTA III, the freeroam game that set the standard and set off the media on a frenzy. Suggestive movements and moans when you recover health with a hooker in a car, sheer amount of violence and gore for the time, censored version in Australia to protect minors (though begs the question to why you would let them play in the first place), and one of many of Jack Thompson's ""blame the game"" defences.For the game itself, it's not that much of a farcry from GTA IV and I'm sure you can pick it up easily. If you haven't tried any sort of freeroam game, then GTA III is a decent game to start. I recommend picking up the ""Grand Theft Auto Complete"" pack if you don't have any games from the series, best if you get in during the holiday sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's a very good port and actually features some improvements over its console counterparts (FPS style aiming ftw).  It's always nice to give respect to the classics, and this is definitely one that gets sweeter with age.  There's something timeless about the rythm and cadence of exploring and completing missions in a game like this.  Something that the newer games have sadly lacked.  If you've got the inclination, get back to your roots sometime with this classic.  You'll probably have more fun than you think.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is silly - why they decided for a silent protagonist is beyond me, but the missions past the initial tutorials are generally good and fun (and lucky don't bring ""morality"" or ""film-like plots"" into it much). Very tough end game and not a great deal to do outside of missions but there is a lot of gameplay, and in spite of dated graphics it holds up remarkably well, with just about every modern GTA's gameplay mechanics in plain sight - something to mull over when contemplating any future ones since most of it has been done before.

												Okay, where do I start?Guess I'll begin with a personal opinion here. Personally I think this is the best GTA. At least it is my favorite. To me, it beats San Andreas and Vice City. And unlike GTA IV (or mabye even GTA V which I haven't played) it doesn't aim to be super realistic.And now, onto a proper review:Grand Theft Auto III has a dark and cold atmosphere, the story is quite interesting and throughout the game you make yourself more and more enemies (Triads, Mafia, Columbian Cartel). The dark atmopshere gets underlined by the amount of gangs cruising around Liberty City. The game itself is overly dark, Taxis are in a really dark tone of yellow, you can barely see colours of cars since they all seem almost black.Like I said, this game hasa really dark atmosphere, and this is what makes the game better than Vice City or San Andreas.Furthermore, this was the first ""3D"" GTA, so it was the beginning of a new era  the old top-down-camera is still available though). All in all, the game is really worth its money, you should definitely pick it up, maybe wait for it to go on sale to do so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a great and original concept, even though it has some downsides such as crashing opening video screens, terrible menu glitches in which it's invisible, poor FPS settings. For the actual game I think it's very repetitive, but what most people like about it is that it's an open world. Gameplay, graphics and the characters are neat and I love how the protagonist is silent. Joystick support is terrible, it does not feature auto aim nor does the joysticks work properly. Orginality and an open world environment is what makes this boat sail. I thought the story was fairly alright. imdbScore: 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, GTA III.It took me a while to ""discover"" this game. Sure I had seen it at the store and had even picked up the game to look at the artwork and screenshots but for some reason I never bought it. That is until a co-worker of mine, at the time, did a story on violence in video games. I worked at a TV News station at the time and the story was definately NOT pro game or pro GTA. After watching someone bring in their PS2 and played a bit so they could record some footage I was hooked and went and bought the game.GTA III is a sandbox game and very non-linear. Actually if you want to visit the rest of the areas in the game you do have to complete the threshold of missions to unlock those parts of the game but you can take your time and do other things in the mean time.Today the graphics look a bit dated but back in it's day the game was pretty cutting edge.  The controls were pretty easy to pick up though aiming the weapons needed some help. Driving the cars (which is the gist of the game) is straight forward too and all the cars have different capabilities. A sports car drives like a sports car while a truck drives like a truck.The game has plenty of controversies to be sure. One of them is the ability to pick up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to ""heal"" you.  After you are done with your tryst you can, though are not required to, kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get your money back. Critics lambast the game for the ability to do this but realistically the game presents you with a moral choice and it's up to you to do, or not do, bad things in the game.I do enjoy this game though it's harder for me to play it now then it was over 10 years ago. I tend to be the player who only wants to unlock stuff to explore and when I do I get bored with the missions.  I guess in reality, I never did finish the game. I unlocked the last island and did a number of quests but I spent most of my time driving around in cool sports cars and exploring the game world.This was a defining game and because of that it should be checked out. I have fond memories of my time spent in Liberty City.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that turned its back on the PC and became the must-have console game of its day returned gloriously triumphant as a sprawling lifelike city where you made your own way in an open world, feeling as if you could do anything you liked. Forget the glamour of violence and get into the real world: In an infamous series filled with commendable entries, GTAIII is the one to have if you want to live out your violent tendencies without the associated jail sentences. Truly a life-saver of a game! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game came out in 2001. By those standards, this game was golden. A full 3D city to drive around, shoot, and get into trouble. Set the standard for modern sandbox games. By today's standard it doesn't fare so well. Besides the main missions there isn't much to do, and it has very limited graphics for today. It also has issues with modern systems. Widescreen does not work so you'll need to turn that off to achieve 16:9 resolutions properly. I recommend it because this is a gem of video game history. I personally enjoy playing old games, but it requires a lot of patience. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is the great transitioning of the old Grand Theft Auto formula into a fully realized open world gameplay. Grand Theft Auto 3 was developed and published by Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive.Grand Theft Auto 3 is revolutionary for bringing about the realization of a 3D open world game in the bustling mimicry of New York known as Liberty City. The possibilities in Grand Theft Auto 3 are truly up to you. Jack cars, drive off cliffs, start a massacre, jump off buildings and bridges, hook up with P rostitutes, work for crime syndicates...the least of what is possible in this game and it's sequels is entirely up to the persons choice, a relic of freedom in gaming.

												i used to play this game back in the early 2000's and can always remeber starting the game over and over because at that time i was too young and could not afford a memory stick for my at the time Playstation 2, after not playing this for at least 10 years and playing it on pc for the first time i do feel like im back to being a young kid playing this, seeing some of the map and seeing how it has evolved into what is GTA IV i do see very humble beginnings with this game.the gameplay is quite clunky now that i have had more experiance in other games and after playing this one i do feel like we have come a long way in terms of technology.the story is still very bland and doesent seem to make in my mind much sense, would i still buy this game ?Yes i personally would but if you have never played this before and youve only just got into GTA at number 5 then you are going to be disappointed without a doubt, but for the nostalgia of this game and seeing where GTA started to grow is a must buy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first 3D entry!... it shows! Maybe it's because I lost my nostalgia goggles but while GTAIII is a solid game it's not neccesarilly a timeless game. I respect it for bulding the ground work that future enteries would build upon and for innfluencing practically every open world game to follow (Even if Driver technically did it first) and for successfully making the transition to 3D. That said if you really are in the mood for a retro GTA even Vice City holds up better but that has more to do with it being a more polished successor to GTA III than it does to do with anything else. Not to mention this version has a lot of Windows 98 related compatibilty issues that made my trip down memory lane quite brief and I don't think GTA III is good enough to justify me patching the hell out of it to get it working (fan made patches). I only reccomend it for people who lost their PS2 or Xbox copy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So, I recommend to launch in compatibility mode with Windows 98, as administrator and run at 640x480. I'm aware that is awful to run this game like that, but perhaps you will not be able to even launch it if you don't.It would be great if Rockstar could release like a HD patch supporting better resolutions, though.But, please, don't let that little problem convince you to not buying it.

												WAY TOO LONG, DIDN'T READ: It can be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get running well, some mods are basically a must, story is 'meh' Driving is good, the rest of the gameplay like shooting is okay, has a fair amount of stuff to keep you busy, radio and soundtrack are still very good, is an important game to go back and play if you haven't just bear in mind it's seriously old now and does have some f*****g stupid problems which will annoy at times.""Liberty City, USA.The worst place in america.""Yes, I will be recommending this game but please note the recommendation comes with some pretty hefty caveats, that is for as good as I believe this game still is, there is also some seriously flawed and outdated design and game mechanic aspects to it.Firstly it's basically required in my eyes to mod the game before playing, that is to get a vastly improved experience over say, the PS2 original at least which was the only way I'd ever played it for 10+ years prior, although I'm talking simple ""bring it up a bit more to modern standards"" mods, not game changing/breaking over the top s**t, the ""Silent patch"" and the XBOX version-PC conversion are probably the best two to go with.Although getting the game running properly at all with or without mods can be a bit of a bear, it took me literally an entire day to get it good 'n' proper with the mods.   :L The joys of running 14 year old software on modern OS's and whatnot.BUT if you manage to wrestle with all that and get it going it's still (mostly) worth playing.The story is preeety meh and basic, but then it's gonna be with a lead character who's seen so much♥♥♥♥♥♥that he's sworn to silence. ""Claude, baby, we're all in this together, we gotta be strong, tell each other what's wrong, you gotta open up budyy, YOU CAN'T JUST BUTTON IT UP CLAUDE!"" ahem, excuse me, moving on.So yeah, cut scenes, story and acting not exactly riveting but remember that this is a game from just after the turn of the century and should be given at least some slack for it.Gameplay however (again mostly) still stands up, well enough to still enjoy it anyway, driving is actually really well balanced and it's rather fun to blast around the city with the ""handbrake, just f*****g handbrake everything"" handling, only problem is the vehicles are very weak indeed and are guaranteed to spontaneously combust after just a few shunts and even fewer gun shots, like seriously few gun shots, like literally 2 shotgun hits and BOOM! Instant explosion and wasted, not great.Movement and shooting are generally acceptable, just so long as you're quite slow, careful and don't let enimies get behind you cos if you do then the outdated, awkwardness of the controls will rear it's ugly head...badly, as long as you keep on top of them you'll be fine little jimmy.Mission variety and general 'stuff' to do are pretty good actually, (yet again especially for a 15 year old game, back in 2001 it felt like you could do almost anything!) they managed to incorporate some reasonably interesting scenarios despite the extremely limited ways to interact with the world, then there's a number of side attractions, apart from the now GTA staple of simply running/driving around tearing everyone and everything 'a new one' there's a few races, GTA 1 esque phonebooth missions, police car, ambulance, fire engine and taxi challenges, a couple of off road driving challenges, hidden packages to find, (which actually have a useful reward) garages for collecting rare vehicles, stunt jumps, rampages, RC destruction and probably something else I've forgotten about, now that I think about it there's probably more 'side' content than main story content, a trend which would DEFINITELY continue as the series progressed.Now here comes some issues, ya know little things like LARGE PORTIONS OF THE MAP BECOMING STRICTLY OUT OF BOUNDS AREAS!! Thanks to the idiotic choice of giving all the gang members which you've upset, which is most of them by the later stages of the game by the way, some of the most powerful weapons in the game and terminator like scanning systems to pick you out and blow you to pieces in 2.5 seconds despite you zooming by at 110mph in a banshee.And then there's the four, five and six star wanted levels, it's...indescribable at times, it can truly feel like a glitch sometimes, it's just so much no, that's all that needs to be said on that matter.   >:(On a more positive note however, even when you're getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥ripped open at least you get to listen to the still great, eclectic mix of music, talkshows and adverts on the radio, GTA always nails the time period it's going for and III is no exception, it's basically become a time capsule to the late 90's/early 00's and it's still awesome, social commentary 'n all.Finally, I just think this is an important game to play, like games such as Super Mario Bros. and DOOM before it, it was a cultural and sales phenomenom and spawned countless 'clones' as everyone tried to jump on the bandwagon but at least in terms of impact and popularity no one ever really came close.

												Open-world classic that inspired dozens of clones and made Rockstar one of the most successful developers of all time.However, the PC port of this game was poor on release and it's aged like milk. I've made a list of problems and solutions I had while getting it running:Game launch crashesI had a lot of trouble getting this game to launch in Win10. I had to use both SilentPatch and the DDraw patch  found here[www.gtagarage.com] to get past the Unhandled Exception c0000005 error and crash after the intro movie. EDIT: These patches also fix a bug where menu text is either invisible or very faded.Physics tied to FPSThis is one of those old games where physics are tied to framerate. If you turn off the 30FPS limiter, car friction, jumping and running up stairs are totally broken. This is one of those things where someone at Rockstar could fix it in an afternoon but it's still broken after all these years. As far as I know, there's no mod or patch to fix this. You can limit the game to 60 with a graphics driver tool but the physics problems are still there.Broken HUDThe HUD doesn't scale well for widescreen. There's a ""widescreen"" option in the graphics menu but it doesn't work. You need to use a community fix  found here[thirteenag.github.io] to get the game to look as expected at resolutions like 1080p (or anything bigger than 1024x768).Dark CarsThe Steam version of the game has a bug where lighting doesn't affect cars if you're running it on a modern version of Windows. The SilentPatch I linked earlier fixes this bug, but the widescreen patch I linked breaks it again. The best way to fix this bug is adding  this mod[gtaforums.com].Controller inputGTA3 has decent support for DirectInput controls and that's good enough for me. There's plenty of people with Xinput controllers though. San Andreas recently got a patch to support them but GTA3 hasn't had that patch yet despite using the same engine.  Here[www.gtagarage.com] is a mod that adds support along with the correct HUD buttons.Y-axis sensitivity bugIf you change mouse sensitivity in game (which everyone would, since it's designed for monitors with like 8 DPI), it only changes the X sensitivity while leaving the Y axis to go wild.  Here[github.com] is a patch to fix that bug.Restore PS2 enhancementsThis one isn't a big issue (I don't use it) but this game was designed to take advantage of the PS2's hardware with stuff like real-time car reflections. They couldn't be bothered to port any of these enhancements to the PC version but there is a mod that restores PS2-like graphics to the game  here.[gtaforums.com] (Read the instructions though!)100% completion checklistIf you're a completionist, the in-game stats aren't useful at all. A member of the community made a 100% checklist that hooks the game (download here[www.dropbox.com]) and tells you what you still need to do if you're trying to complete the game 100%.No in-game mapAnother not-huge issue but something to keep in mind before playing. As  Rockstar support[support.rockstargames.com] points out, their huge game with 3 different islands has no in-game map, so you either have to memorise where everything is or follow their suggestion and print out a map like it's 1999. Intro skippingJust a final tip to top everything off, once you've got the game running you can delete the ""movies"" directory from the install folder and it'll no longer play the intro movies. A little nugget that will save you a few seconds after spending 20 minutes or more getting the game running.I do love this game but I can't honestly recommend GTA3 to anyone until they fix some of these issues.

It's definitely a must buy if you have never played GTA III before. Same goes for Vice City and San Andreas. Those three are forever the greatest of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: November 26, 2016
												Introduction: I find myself typing this review thinking more about the conceptualization of existence, than the anime itself. Above all, there are two standards I hold true for anime. There are anime that simply entertain for the sake of enjoyment, and there are anime that stretches the boundary of human imagination. Serial Experiments Lain falls in the latter category and for this reason Serial Experiments Lain stands out as a true classic. Serial Experiments Lain pushes the envelope of what the perceived notion of what can be done with television as a medium. The show doesn’t just provide entertainment; it provides insight, and profound views and beliefs about technology and the role it plays in society. With that said it's time to get on with the review.Story: Given that Lain’s story progression is very disjointed, if the execution were to be even off by the slightest, the show would have been ridden with plot holes. Lain however doesn’t need worry about plot and story in the same sense as other anime, but instead relies on the atmosphere and the characters to tell the story. What little plot Lain does have, the show works with it fabulously. Now some may argue that Lain is completely plot driven, but to each his own. Personally I believe that Lain strays as far as it can from bland episodic story telling, and in essence is similar to Citizen Kane in the aspect that the story has little to do with the show. Lain above all is a character study, and the plot only moves forward under the characters.Art: Despite the art being off center in terms of traditional anime, it hardly deters from the overall enjoyment of the series. It is important to note that the series actually benefits from the unique art style presented in Lain. Art is not a big pulling factor for Lain, so if you are a fan of high quality art, you may be in for a rough ride.Sound: The series relies on a minimalist approach to sound and music. Dialogue is sparse, but very profound. Sound effects are seldom used but with brevity, and has a lasting impact on the viewer. Once again, this lack of a quality that would normally be detrimental to an anime’s enjoyment, but becomes one of Lain’s strengths. The sound of the electricity running through power lines, the empty sound of Lain typing on her keyboard, and the scarce use of music. These are all memorable pieces of sound effects that adds to the overall impact of the show.Character: Now this is where Lain shines brightest. In a vast wasteland of mundane same-old, Lain sticks out as an anime that takes its characters to a level that most anime can only dream of achieving. The character of Lain is perhaps the most deep and relevant characters in anime today. To explain upon this point, one would have to watch the series and comprehend the various themes and motif’s on one’s own. But in order to be brief, Lain’s character can be summarized as ascending from human status, to near God like power through the prowess of the internet. Ahem, I mean, “The Wired.” It’s a simple concept and seems like it has been done before, giving credit to the argument, and it probably has. But the beauty here is the cast of side characters that surround Lain. Her sister, her father, mother, and friends, are all extremely deep characters, that although don’t appear to be, are actually extremely poignant in their own right.Enjoyment & Closing: If watched with an open mind, Lain will do more than simply entertain. It is truly revolutionary anime for its time, and the amount of depth in the show is utterly staggering. Never in my years of watching anime have I seen a show as thought provoking as Lain. If one were so inclined to contact me, we could talk for hours upon hours of the religious symbols, and religious references that run about the shows course. We could then change the subject to comparing Lain’s character to that of philosophy of the Jungian Shadow. We could converse and discover deeper and more universal meanings as time progressed. Lain is such a show that the viewer doesn’t just watch it. The viewer must be pushed to think, and who doesn’t want to do a bit a of thinking once in a while?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GTA 3 is a classic and I would love to recommed this game, but there is one problem, you might have a hard time getting the game to work on a modern PC. I get it, the game is old, but if Rockstar wants to take my money for the old game, then they should at least patch it to work on modern pc's. If you turn frame rate limit off, most likely you will run into problems. If you have transparency problems, download the file below and copy the content into your GTA III directory. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1IQhcL6aChua2U0dXZZb2lmOE0/view ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the real start to the modern day GTA franchise. Remastered from its birds eye view version, this game was a unique for its time. The controls are a bit finicky as the camera is automatic and makes it difficult to drive, however, after a few hours you do get used to it. A tip to people who want to use gamepads, you may wish to assign your buttons before you start playing as the controller support is very limited. the story is like any other GTA game, going to blips and talking to different mob bosses till you reach that final enemy. This game is particularly interesting after you play San Andreas as there a  lot of tie-ins with that  story. This games story is particularly short compared to other GTA games taking about 8-12 hours to complete for the average player. I would recommend this game for people who want to have the full franchise experience.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love GTA 3. It was a great game and still is.I don't recommend this game on steam because it is a terrible port and the controls are wonky. Also there are some pretty major graphical discrepancies between the PS2 version and the PC version. The PC version got a massive graphical downgrade compared to the PS2 version... I know it might be odd to some people in 2015 but PC gaming hardware back then (when the game was released) wasn't what it is today with the whole PC Master concept, back then PC gaming hardware was inferior to the consoles, so the developers downgraded the graphics and mechanics so that people's computers would not catch fire and blow up.So unless they go back fix the terrible controls, and add features they had previously removed in the PC version to accommodate the new hardware, I wouldn't recommend this version of the game to anyone.I recommend GTA 3, just not this steam version.

												This game is a great way to see GTA's beginnings.  It's a classic and reallly feels like it.  If you're coming from future GTA games like I am, you'll see how still-playable the game is.  It might look older, but gameplay wise and atmosphere wise its the same.  I recommend you listen to the chatterbox radio station for some laughs, it really adds a layer of quality to the game.In my older review i downvoted the game because it felt unplayable to me.  i've now figured out that you can lock on while shooting in these older GTA games, which I didn't know.  The standard PC control layout isn't very good, I highly recommend you install this directinput mod so you can use an Xbox or Playstation controller:http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272 As well as this game fix to make the  game less buggy:http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25368Both of these mods are free and easy to install, and will make your experience SO much better.If you're using a 360 controller like I am, RB is to lock on.  I'm sure you can lock on with pc controls in classic mode too, but I haven't tried that.  Happy Gaming!Old Review: It's really interesting to see how the 3-D open world GTA experience first started out.  However, the gameplay is extremely flawed and somehow manages to be harder than Dark Souls.  The controls are terrible and guns just dont work.  Watch this one on YouTube unless you're here for nostalgic reasons, or you'll just end up giving yourself a headache.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first GTA game made in 3D and it's living up to its name.This is the game that made every other GTA games what they are today.You play as Claude who got betrayed and shot by his girlfriend after a heist. Wounded but not dead, you find yourself arrested and transported to prison but you evade from your transport when the colombian cartel makes an attack on the patrol you are stuck into to help another prisonner to escape. You use this opportunity to beat a police officer, remove your handcuffs and evade from your transportation truck. You learn about 8-Ball and he helps you with his contacts.Roaming around Liberty City to do missions for the Mafia, the Yakuza and some independent names, you are thrown around to do the dirty jobs like the handyman you are.The map is huge and the game looks good when you think about the games that came out around the same years.It's in the veine of the GoldSrc Engine, Unreal Engine, id Tech 3 but with a big map made with free-roaming in mind. Driver 2 would be a better comparison. Restating that GTA3 was the first attempt from Rockstar to make a 3D game, They didn't miss their shot. There's a lot of things to do.The missions are non-linear, you always have the choice between a mission giver or another, there's the phone boot side-quests, you can do Taxi, Ambulance and Police missions when you get the specific car and you can always free-roam in Liberty City causing carnage for fun and giggles.The sound effects are great, you always feel like you're in a real city with the car sounds and pedestrians talking.A gunshot disturbs the peace of the moment when everyone start screaming and running.The game is immersive, you feel like you're there, walking/running around in Liberty City.There's enough weapons to have fun the entire game. There's not three different sets like in San Andreas but the game isn't that long either. Everything is well balanced for its size and for it's date of creation.The physic in the game is alright, not perfect but very good for what it needed to be.The driving physic is sometimes weird, you feel like in a pinball machine when you start hitting everything around but otherwise, handbrakes, quick turns and donuts can be done easily. Depending on the car you have, controlling it is never that much of a pain unless it's a really bad car which was obviously a choice from the devs. Bad cars roll badly.The shooting mecanics are archaic to say the least, it's kinda hard hard to deal with when you are in a fire fight, mostly when you are surrounded. The game was made to be unforgivable in some ways.When you try to play wisely, you get into cover and you try to step a little bit outside of your cover in a way that the AI doesn't really see you and then you shoot. ... or you try to stay in front of the enemies, hoping that you will kill everyone before you die. Good luck if they have decent weaponry. It's not impossible and it's still a lot of fun.You can only shoot and walk with the UZI or pistol, every big weapons are used as if you were a turret which is kind of annoying sometimes but the bullet effects are eye candy though. It's always fun to make your own justice anyway. I don't have a lot of negative to say about this game.Most negative points would come from a comparison with the futur games which wouldn't be fair at all.Every futur installments added stuff to what GTA3 was. GTA3 doesn't lack stuff, it's just the next games that are even better than what was this awesome game.There's obviously some glitches and bugs since it's a first attempt at a 3D game but nothing gamebreaking.A problem I had was that the game version I have was censored for whatever reason.I'm not from a country renowned to ban such games and I bought the game in the official Rockstar Pack with every other GTA games directly on Steam. The problem is well known though so yeah, there's not a lot of things more to say about his.To end this straight : GTA3 is a classic, it's a game that you must own if you understand what gaming is all about and if it's your kind of game to start with. Give it a try with an open mind! Feel the year 2001.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As soon I booted it up again after 14 years I still get the nostalgic feeling when I hear the intro. It's just one of those games I would put so many hours into and still wouldn't get bored of it. It's definitely a must buy if you have never played GTA III before. Same goes for Vice City and San Andreas. Those three are forever the greatest of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Playing with cheats/mods is really fun, the gta community has so much to offer in regards to mods/guides/cheats.Maybe the game  is not suitable for those who didn't play back in the day, it has not aged well. Big down side to the game is once you complete ""Sayonara Salvatore"" portland becomes annoying to drive around, both gangs start shooting you with uzi and shotguns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say GTA 3 is an amazing open world game despite a ton of glitches and bugs. The game is not very storydriven as many other games. Instead it's more focused on the adventure and action in the state of Libety City. You play as Claude, a man shot and left for dead by your girlfriend after a bank heist. You try to crawl back from the bottom of the criminal food chain in redemption for your girlfriend as you end up in a mafia war against the triads. The mafia then betrays you and are forced to go into hiding. There are some flaws with the game such as the El Burro racing mission. El Burro tells you he as a job oppurtunity for you and says you are getting alot of street cred. So then out of nowhere he says you have to race. No explanation, just race. And the whole race is just lag and frusration. Don't believe me, just try the game for yourself. Overall, the game is hella fun and deserves an 8/10!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recurring graphics glitch. A semi-opaque image of the menu persists in gameplay when reloading a saved game. Requires a hard reboot to fix. Difficult/impossible to change controller key bindings (some commands are not bound by default and the game would not let me assign them to a button). Refund requested after an hour of gameplay. Love the game, but this PC port is pretty much unplayable. What a shame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GTA 3 is a classic and I would love to recommed this game, but there is one problem, you might have a hard time getting the game to work on a modern PC. I get it, the game is old, but if Rockstar wants to take my money for the old game, then they should at least patch it to work on modern pc's. If you turn frame rate limit off, most likely you will run into problems. If you have transparency problems, download the file below and copy the content into your GTA III directory. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1IQhcL6aChua2U0dXZZb2lmOE0/view ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a great way to see GTA's beginnings.  It's a classic and reallly feels like it.  If you're coming from future GTA games like I am, you'll see how still-playable the game is.  It might look older, but gameplay wise and atmosphere wise its the same.  I recommend you listen to the chatterbox radio station for some laughs, it really adds a layer of quality to the game.In my older review i downvoted the game because it felt unplayable to me.  i've now figured out that you can lock on while shooting in these older GTA games, which I didn't know.  The standard PC control layout isn't very good, I highly recommend you install this directinput mod so you can use an Xbox or Playstation controller:http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272 As well as this game fix to make the  game less buggy:http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25368Both of these mods are free and easy to install, and will make your experience SO much better.If you're using a 360 controller like I am, RB is to lock on.  I'm sure you can lock on with pc controls in classic mode too, but I haven't tried that.  Happy Gaming!Old Review: It's really interesting to see how the 3-D open world GTA experience first started out.  However, the gameplay is extremely flawed and somehow manages to be harder than Dark Souls.  The controls are terrible and guns just dont work.  Watch this one on YouTube unless you're here for nostalgic reasons, or you'll just end up giving yourself a headache.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just bought this game a couple days ago, after what I've seen, here's what I have to say,PROS:-Nice graphics that still hold up today in my eyes-Nice radio stations with good music-The immersion is fantastic, Liberty City feels alive, it really does feel like a smaller version of NYC-The driving engine is rad, it feels nice with each car having its own feel and weight to it-Fantastic characters, they all feel like real people, none of them are stereotypicalCONS:-No motorcycles (but this doesn't really matter because this was the first 3D GTA game)-Our main character Claude does not say a single word, this leaves SO much room for character development, not even in GTA SA does Claude say word (but it does tell us he owned a service station in San Fierro and he used to live in San Andreas and ran away to Liberty City wiht Catalina)-The car's damage, it seems like they can be up in flames within seconds-getting out of a vehicle on it's side, sometimes i am still stuck in the vehicle (vans and trucks), the vehicle sets ablaze and Claude is stuck -If you buy this on steam you will see that all the cars are dark, I had to download a different .exe filethat's about it though a part from some annoyances I love the game! 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mob bosses need favors, crooked cops need help, the street gangs want you dead; so to compensate you'll have to rob, steal, and kill in order to stay alive, while using your resources to track down the woman who betrayed you and earn your rightful revenge. But that's all in a day's work in Rockstar Games' ambitious PS2 sequel, Grand Theft Auto III. Developed by DMA Design, GTA3 is the first installment of the series to utilize a fully three-dimensional living city with open environments and non-linear gameplay. Additional features include a cast of hundreds of different characters, more than 50 types of vehicles, three hours of professionally recorded music, and a huge array of deadly street weapons.

What I liked about the game	I have always enjoyed the concept of grand theft auto; driving around exploring the city, doing sub-missions, and doing main missions whenever you want to.	Some unforgettable missions.   	A story of revenge and making name for yourself, still worth playing for that.  	Top-notch voice acting and cut-scenes.	DISMEMBERMENT! You name it legs, arms and heads go flying. What I disliked or was disappointed with	Nothing really to spend your money on; except for weapons and there aren't that many weapons. There's no condos, no businesses and you can't change clothes. It's kind of pointless doing the sub-missions because you are mostly getting money from them and there's nothing to spend the money on and you get plenty of money from the main missions. There's no increase in health or armour, you can't become fireproof, and the taxi missions just get boring after a while, although I still recommend you do the import/export sub-mission.   	Every gang in the city is trying to kill you. Nearly every street you drive down, there's always someone shooting at you, no rest for the wicked. 	It's hard to see the details on the car because all the cars have a dark metallic colour.  	Protagonist isn't voice acted.	All of the missions take place outside; there are no missions which involve going inside. The only two places in the game were you can go inside of are Ammu-nation and your safe house garage.	The radio stations were meh. Flashback FM was probably my favourite.   Conclusion Still worth playing for the main missions; like I said top-notch voice acting and cut -scenes. A bit plain, but it was the first full 3d GTA; no more bird's eye view. 88/100 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good game first released ♥♥♥♥ing 14 years ago, as the first 3D one from the series.I'm the ""100% completion kind of guy"", and that's how I went on GTA III. Although this journey took a lot of effort, I had enough fun doing this. It gets pretty infuriating sometimes, like the Paramedic mission, but accomplishing nonsense and mafia style missions is what makes this and other GTA series titles so fun.Things that weren't so funny: getting the collectibles takes a lot of effort, and you can't do this without looking on a map/reading a walktrough. There's no clue (and I think it will be like this on any GTA title) ingame of where said collectibles are. If you wouldn't use a map, you would have to just guess where the hell 100 hidden packages are. As a counterpoint to this negative point, collectibles aren't obligatory, but they make up the trouble you had collecting them by giving you a lot of weapons in your hideout, which makes having weapons easy. The main character doesn't speak; you will get a hell out of money as you play the game, and you don't have anything to do with it. At the advanced stages of the game, even if you didn't collect the hidden packages to have weapons on your hideout, you'll have enough money to buy as many weapons as you want, paint as many cars as you want, and that's it! Nothing else to spend your abundant money.WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS? DO WE REALLY SHOOT MARIA AT THE END? IS SHE DEAD? A doubt that we'll have beyond the eternity. I don't know if I didn't actually realize how to aim properly, but from my experience, aiming at this game is frustrating.The pros are all the good points of any GTA title: open world;  killing people on the street;  mafia missions;  it's easy to drive cars; badass story; unique car jumps! Oh, the car jumps and stunts! GANGS!Although being old and the effort it takes, I had enough fun, so I recommend this game! See you on the streets of Liberty City!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that shaped open-world games and gave us a standard for future upcoming third person games.GameplayConsidering this game was their first 3D game, the controls are good. I mean it is smooth and responsive. Incredible how well it actually holds up. From a modern pespective the game is limited in terms of objectives. There is not a whole lot of things to do and the missions can be very frustrating at times because of the lack of checkpoints. The structure of missions is dated too. In retrospect the map is still feels big and it is quite impressive for its time. The characters lack personality, but for their first 3D game, it's not bad.GraphicsThe colors are very depressing to be honest. A lot of grey, and black and white. I only remember the game for its rain. It has aged pretty well and still perfectly playable. There is also a lot a texture popping, which was very common for its time. Despite all my complains the graphics is still amazing.SoundQuite amazing for it's time. The voice actors are very good. The most memomable thing must be the radio stations. You listen to them all the time. There is a lot of variation from DnB, opera, 80's music, raggae and hip hop. The songs are so good you can listen to them multiple times. The real charm is coming from the radio station hosts.VerdictI love to go back to GTA III now and then. It holds a lot of nostalgia value for me. Unfortunately, it never got its claws on me. It did in the later games. It is mostly the dull colors and forgettable story that holds me back. I still think GTA 3 is fun, if you can take your mind back to 2001.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holy freaking God, Grand Theft Auto III. My favorite thing about this game was driving on the sidewalk. Picking up hookers and watching the car bounce as your health meter filled back up? Then spattering them on the sidewalk, hopping out of your car and taking your money back, plus whatever else she might have made that night? Hours of childhood-ending fun!This friggin game is the reason I spent weekend after weekend at a friend’s house waiting my turn to see how long I could make my murderspree rampages last. After moving out of state, I managed to get my own PS2 and my very own copy of …Kingdom Hearts. That was the end of my GTA3 addiction until I saw the GTA collection on sale for 10 dollars. GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, GTA4 and its expansions all for 10 dollars. TOO BAD I FRIGGIN MISSED THE SALE. But seeing that sale, and the release of GTA5, made me want to go back through the not top-down GTA games. So I paid $10 for GTA3 and I only kind of regret it, because, seriously, why is this ten dollars? It’s a fourteen year old game that has to be modded to work with widescreen resolutions. The damn crosshair that you see on the screen isn’t even where you’re going to actually shoot. You can find the mod here on the community forums, and it’s an easy fix, but really. The UI doesn’t even scale to the resolution that you set in-game. It’s like Rockstar said, “Hey, it works enough, so, well, ♥♥♥♥ ‘em. Mods.”Before the real review, I think the most important thing to mention is that the system requirements don’t mention Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 8.1. It works for my Windows 7 Frankenstein-like machine, but as an indication of how seriously you should take that statement, Saints Row 2 ran like a champ for this computer. So, you know, if you buy this and you can’t get it to run, its right there on the store page. Same place as every other game on Steam.The out of the box controls for this game are terrible. Sprint is the right shift key. Movement is WASD, and sprint is set to the right shift key. Think about that for a moment. The go faster button. It’s on the other side of the keyboard, and unless you have ♥♥♥♥ing E.T. fingers you’re only going to be briskly jogging from the cops and enemy gangsters. Shooting things feels weird, even after fixing the crosshair with a mod. It feels like I have to really concentrate to properly spray a Chinese stereotype/gangster with my rifle.Driving is pretty good in this game. Different cars handle in different ways, and maybe, when you first install the game, they’ll all be painted dark colors! But it’s okay, because there’s a mod for that, too! You’ll have you shiny, hooker-squishing car in no time at all! You can’t move the camera with the mouse though. I really wish I could swing the camera around with the mouse instead of using Q and E to look left and right, respectively.The one thing I’ve noticed is how hard the game is. I have died a lot. Your guy is just a guy in this game. None of that bulletsponge crap here. You lose 10hp if you get punched, and you only have 100, unless you find armor somewhere, but even then if you get surrounded or find yourself in the open where you can’t funnel badguys towards you, you’re going to die quickly. I totally understand now why Young Me used cheats. But this makes for a challenge, and challenging games are satisfying games.And GTA3 is a satisfying game. Most of the missions in this game are presented in a “here’s whacha gotta do, now go do it” manner, letting you decide how to complete them. For example, one mission had me assassinating a gang boss. For the first assassination attempt, I waited outside the building in my car, intending to run into the guy’s car so much it would blow up. That worked poorly. My car was flipped over after the gangsters turned the tables and came after me, and since there’s no moving-car bail out in this game, I couldn’t get out in time before the car exploded. Round two consisted of me aiming a sniper rifle at the alleyway the boss would be coming out of. A bat-wielding rival gang member snuck up behind me and bashed my skull in. For the third attempt, I ended up standing on top of a car in a different, rival-free location, aiming at the same alleyway. This almost didn’t work out because some d-bag AI driver in a gray van decided to drive up on the sidewalk and slam into my car. I got into position only just in time to miss the first shot, then take the guy’s leg off, completing the mission. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ satisfaction, right there.GTA3’s graphics, in my opinion have held up pretty good. They don’t have a zillion polygons and there aren’t any bare boobs (which is good, because characters don’t have a zillion polygons), but the game looks pretty damn decent after all these years. You’ll never be wondering what something is, and you can actually read a pretty good amount of the street signs, which is how I managed to find my way between the first and second islands during Yakuza missions. Because there’s no map. You can’t pause and go, “Oh, there I am!”If you haven’t played GTA3 ever, then playing it now might be a strange experience, considering how much this genre has changed. I wouldn't say GTA3 is ""dated,"" but the things I’ve taken for granted in the Saints Row games and later GTA titles aren’t present in GTA3, and this sometimes ruins the experience, like simply not being able to rotate the camera while in a vehicle. After a while I've gotten used to the ""old ways,"" but you might not.If there’s anything truly worth the absolutely insane $10 price tag, it’s the soundtrack. Chatterbox has been the soundtrack to so many people being murdered on the sidewalk, and even though I’ve heard that station repeat itself over and over, I can still listen to Lazlow interview Fernando about New Beginnings (Cinco-cinco-cinco, nueve-dos, nueve-dos), or that karate hippy break his hand.Even with all the old-game, crap-port issues, I’m having all sorts of fun going back through this game that sucked up so much of my time and absolutely annihilated what innocence was left when it was released.

Ну и, конечно же, куча всевозможных квестов и заданий будут разнообразить и без того занимательную жизнь. Хотелось бы дать совет – не пользуйтесь описаниями и прохождениями игры – только так Вы получите наибольшее удовольствие от игрового процесса. Но если, все же застрянете на каком-то этапе – то стоит обратиться к прохождению, потому что биться головой о стену редко бывает интересно.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's Grand Theft Auto III. It's the one that started it all, and it's still just as fun as it was years ago. Of course, the graphics are outdated but at the end of the day, it is fun to steal a grandma's car, have a police chase through the streets, ramp off a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and land upside down and explode.

												I've played countless hours on GTA games, over a month on GTA V. But, were my love started from the series was gta 3. Even though I have GTA 1 I didn't play it at the time. My Mom and Dad got my Sister a Ps2 for Christmas in 2003. I went over my Uncles house for a bday party and saw him playing GTA 3. I was 5 years old and I started to play and my Dad watched me. I got in a ambulance at the hospital and started to drive great for my age. Little did my Dad know that I would spend $1,000+ on video games after that.This one game started my gaming career, and I would love to design one of these games for a daily job in the future. That's just my story, I would give this game a 9/10. Changed the GTA Series from arcade type game to 3D story action/shoot em up game. The fact that each game gives you a bigger free roam makes every GTA Game better. Can't say this any better but, this is my second favorite series in the whole world of Video Games. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the GTA series. From classics like Vice City and San Andreas to the famous GTA 5. I have no lesser respect for this game.

												I played the first two games when they came out. The second was pretty much identical to the first except for the ""loyalty"" system and has been largely forgotten but never mind. They were fun games, and whilst they weren't the first to let you be the bad guy, it was somewhat satisfying the way the city seemed to work around you to clear up your mess and try to restore the status quo. Unfortunately however I never actually finished either of them because there didn't seem to be much progression. Yes, you'd get a new map to play on every now and then, and some of the missions could be done in different orders, but there wasn't much personality. The missions were just a means to an end - namely collecting enough cash to move on to the next level.Ultimately I think they could have been largely forgotten in years to come, save for the ""controversy"" aspect.Then this gem came along. Rather than just moving the same games into a 3D environment, the game has been designed entirely from scratch. It might as well have been called something different for all the similarity it has to it's predecessors. Not only do we have full voice acting by many household names which flesh out the characters and add that much needed personality, but the city itself feels far more alive and real than ever before.Corners are no longer all at 90 degrees, there are literally hundreds of bonuses, secrets and extra missions you can do on the side whenever you want, you can backtrack at any point to visit previous areas of the game and see what's changed (although be careful of straying into the wrong neighbourhood if you've been upsetting people), full radio stations with a good selection of licensed music (and the ability to play your own MP3s on the PC version - nice touch), fully working public transit systems and a fascinating storyline of betrayal, loyalty and trust make this something that has to be played by everybody, no matter what your view on the violence aspect. Come on. Even if you don't want to complete the missions themselves you can spend hours just riding a taxi around town. Yes, this game even managed to make ""Crazy Taxi"" almost entirely redundant.Whilst many people could argue (and with good cause) that the later games in the series such as Vice City and 4 are better in nearly every way, for me this will always be my favourite simply because it was such a welcome surprise - were it not for 3 then GTA wouldn't be the multi-million dollar franchise it is today.

Хотелось бы дать совет – не пользуйтесь описаниями и прохождениями игры – только так Вы получите наибольшее удовольствие от игрового процесса.

												The game that shaped open-world games and gave us a standard for future upcoming third person games.GameplayConsidering this game was their first 3D game, the controls are good. I mean it is smooth and responsive. Incredible how well it actually holds up. From a modern pespective the game is limited in terms of objectives. There is not a whole lot of things to do and the missions can be very frustrating at times because of the lack of checkpoints. The structure of missions is dated too. In retrospect the map is still feels big and it is quite impressive for its time. The characters lack personality, but for their first 3D game, it's not bad.GraphicsThe colors are very depressing to be honest. A lot of grey, and black and white. I only remember the game for its rain. It has aged pretty well and still perfectly playable. There is also a lot a texture popping, which was very common for its time. Despite all my complains the graphics is still amazing.SoundQuite amazing for it's time. The voice actors are very good. The most memomable thing must be the radio stations. You listen to them all the time. There is a lot of variation from DnB, opera, 80's music, raggae and hip hop. The songs are so good you can listen to them multiple times. The real charm is coming from the radio station hosts.VerdictI love to go back to GTA III now and then. It holds a lot of nostalgia value for me. Unfortunately, it never got its claws on me. It did in the later games. It is mostly the dull colors and forgettable story that holds me back. I still think GTA 3 is fun, if you can take your mind back to 2001.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun for a while if you can find it cheap and put up with the dated, frustrating trial-and-error gameplay which is only going to get worse as the game ages. There's no real variety to the way in which missions can be approached--you have to try and die and restart multiple times to discover the way in which the game wants you to complete a mission.The mechanics are still relatively smooth and work well, save for some weapon gripes such as the grenades which can't be aimed accurately and only thrown blindly. The graphics and sound are dated but not terrible and the game's gritty atmosphere holds up.Certainly no longer as amazing as it once was, but it's a decent game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I fell in love with this game when I was in grammar school. Nothing more then just going around and killing people and causing all sorts of mayhem. Me and my friends use to just go around causing all hell and laughing about it. I still have my original copy for the ps2 along with all the others that ill never get rid of because its a classic. Its always fun to come back to this game and beating it has become so easy. I'm glad to now have a digital copy and i can play it at any time i decide to.

												Unplayable. Past versions of this game may have worked good on consoles, But this pc version has many faults.- Menu screens can dissappear so u dont know what your doing on menu- Mouse doesnt recognise games screen edge on dual monitors so when you turn mouse in game you end up seeing the mouse appear on 2nd monitor, and when u click (such as to fire gun) you end up clicking the other monitor and minimising game.You would think ROCKSTAR would have patched these two main issues. But 15 years and nothings been done, and the forums are filled with post about these two issues. If you own it try get a refund from steam, they shouldnt be allowed to sell faulty products.Definitely makes me not want to pay $80 for GTA V if they cant even release patches for minor issues in their well known game franchise.

												This game brings back some good memories from playing it with a friend,the city is called Liberty City,a parody of New York City,the city is a darker one,also the protagonist is a cool one even he is mute and never talks,also we can see him in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in 2 missions.His name is only called in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,Claude,also dont confuse him with Claude Speed,the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto 2,in which these 2 games are in different universe.The missions are very cool to do,also this game have something that other Grand Theft Auto games dont have,GORE,yup you heard,when you shoot someone with a M16 in leg or hand that part of his body is dissapear,note this only is in PC version i believe,also on Steam version is a bug that color of all vehicles are darker but this can be fixed i believe.Also the worst part for Grand Theft Auto 100% achievers like me is when you complete the game 100% you dont have anything in your advantage like 200 health instead of 100 like in Grand Theft Auto vice City.Just play this game,is fun.Final note:9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto III:Positives:+ The game's storyline is quite good, it follows the main character Claude as he works for the Mafia, Yakuza and other parties throughout Liberty City, while simulataneously seeking revenge against his ex-girlfriend for backstabbing him during a robbery.+ You feel a connection to all the central characters in the game and they're very intriguing.+ As with every Grand Theft Auto game, you have the ability to cause complete mayhem, using flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades, military grade assault rifles, pistols, shotguns and more. Great weapon choices.+ Side missions available and hidden packages/frenzy tasks to complete. Extra content there.+ Graphics are dated but for the time period (2001) they were amazing. This won't impact on your fun.+ Nice music on radio stations, adds to the enjoyment.Negatives:- Short game, takes around 20 hours to finish, side missions included. I'll admit i've finished the game multiple times in the past, so this could vary if you're new. But generally, it's short.Overall Score: 8/10Grand Theft Auto: III is a classic game which launched the GTA series into fully 3D environments, Memorable and fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finally got myself down to play this in 2011, believe it or not, and to my surprise it was still a blast. I consider this a RPG game, because you basically level up and do a lot of mini mission along the main one in an open world. This adds a classic flavor to any game.GTAIII is inferior in size to Vice City and San Andreas, but still a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cant even run the game.. When i try to run it says: ""Cannot find 640x480 video mode"" I tried changing settings in the game properties and changed resoloution and still not working. The reason i have 5 minutes on the game is because i left the message box on for a couple mins so i could write this review. Do not get on newer systems!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, I have no nostalgia for GTA: I've only even beaten GTA 5 and didn't even play GTA 4 until 2013. But I do know the significance of this game which is why I gave it a go.Short version: I love it on the PS2!Kinda long version:I couldn't play this game as it is on Steam. The control schemes are too wonky and rebinding them is way more difficult than it should be. I'm not completely new to PC gaming but I've only really been at it for a year or two, so maybe it's my own shortcomings. That said, the console version is way more managable as far as controls and movement, so much so that I stopped noticing how aged the game looks. If you're trying III, Vice City & San Andreas for the first time, I'd recommond a console version first. They're a pioneer of open-world sandbox games as we know them and there's a ton of great little details in every game. But if you're like me and grew up with a controller instead of a computer, this is one of those game where it makes a huge difference.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game on console, but the PC version is not a good experience. Unless you're a completionist or something, you're better off getting this on PlayStation or Xbox. The controls are off, it crashes, and the buttons on the menus begin to disappear after going through a few options. Grand Theft Auto III was something that changed the way we play games today, and this is an absolute abomination.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is well regarded as a pioneer in the third person sandbox game genre. It can be compared to other genre defining games like Wolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 before it. The core foundation that GTA3 rests it's hat on is simplicity. It has a very simple premise, after being betrayed during a robbery you set out for revenge in Liberty City. The story is full of mostly entertaining characters and mostly fun missions. That simplicity works double for the gameplay.GTA3 introduced and perfected a gameplay loop that the franchise has still kept for the most part. There's a set of story missions you undergo inorder to unlock further parts of the game and see what happens next in the story. Alternatively you can ignore the story and explore the city at your leasure. While doing sidequests like driving a taxi cab or looking for hidden collectables. This core gameplay loop of missions, sidequests, collectables with a freely explorable open world wasn't a common thing at the time, and it blew people away with how impressive the whole experience was. At the same time though because there have been so many games based off it, it occasionally feels like it lacks an identity compared to the glut of sandbox games that came after it. This is fundamentally the base game that all future sandbox games jumped off from. It's a game I like to go back to every so often to remind myself where it all started. And to remind myself that Rockstar set the bar pretty high from the start and just kept going from there. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know this is a game from 2002 but I found no joy out of this game. Yeah sure at first I was hyped to get backed to the days of when gta started its 3D universe but even then this game isnt that great for me. Its almost impossiblle to play the game with no cheats while not raging. I get used to getting back to games with old graphincs so this game diddnt bother me in the visual part but gameplay sucks. I wish the missions that were timed or I had to defend something never existed because those were hard as hell. Also you dont get a full map of the game so people like me have to memorize it as I go and sure that seems cool to not rely on a map but liberty city is a hell hole to get around with gangs always shooting at you and if you bump ingto a cop or even if they run into you your imidiantly ♥♥♥♥ed. The amount of hours I put into this game to beat it shows that after half of the game you get realy sick of it. If you want to play through all the games of gta I recommend this game for starting out but BE WARNED ranging is likely to accure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite glitchy as is (On Windows 10 at least, MacOS version is alright). I installed SilentPatch with DDraw (should fix the invisible menu glitch), GInput (for xbox controller  support), a widescreen fix patch, and reduced mouse sensitivity to the minimum. Now the game is playable. I hope that helps any Windows 10 users out there.Rockstars should consider uploading a remastered steam version for GTA classics that support Windows 10, widescreen monitors, and xbox controllers. Not worth the full price. Stick to the mobile version for now. Wait for Steam / Humble bundle sales and only buy as part of a discounted GTA collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My hours played:Xbox version: 500Playstation 2 version: 6400PC disc version: 15,330This is my favorite game of all time. This is the game that started free roam third person RPG games. The developers give you a choice to play as the silent protagionist, or to play as any pedestrain you want. Be you, be me, be free. Customize the texture of the protagionist, make him more you. Ride a train, steal a car, walk around, find secrets, find easter eggs, drown, try to jump the blown up bridges but fail, do whatever your heart desires. I may have 22,230 hours in this game, but I have my entire life of playing this beautiful game ahead of me. :)Warning: This version of the PC port has a few minor rendering errors causing cars to be dark, headlights to not shine, and pickups to not glow. To fix this; Download the ""silent patch"".GTA III states that; ""I will burn till' I can't burn no more, shine till' there's no shine no more, till' the Earth can't turn no more, I'm the king."" -GTA III ""Game Radio"" station			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic? Yes. But that is all it offers: Nostalgia. For those that are wishing to experience the first game of the 3D universe for the first time, I personally won't recommend it. It has aged badly and honestly, only those that have played it during its earlier days may enjoy it. Dated mechanics, repetitive and occasionally frustrating missions really made the game much more tedious than fun. The god-awful soundtrack doesn't do any justice either.Nutshell: If you are eager to go through the history of the grand theft auto franchise, go for it. Its not a bad game. But comparing to its sequels, it doesn't really hold up and its certainly because of its age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												sorted out initial screen resolution probs, but then found that my brilliant logitech controller (which works with every other pc/steam game that states 'controller support') doesn't seem to register - i see from reading on forums on steam and elsewhere that mods can be downloaded - but frankly i'm not happy to keep ♥♥♥♥ing around with this and potentially download something third party that harms my beautiful pc - so i can't recommend this!!

												It kills me having to downvote this game. GTA 3 was my second ever GTA game back in the day on the PS2 (I started with Vice City). GTA 3 is such a nastalgic game for me and that's why I decided to purchase it for PC. Unfortunatley this is one of the worst PC ports I have ever played. I would actually deem the game UNPLAYABLE. First, the menu is invisible. If you want to change graphics settings or play a differnt save from the main menu, too bad. Second, there's a glitch where every car in the game has a weird black shadow on them, you can't even see the cars. It's a sad and truly pathetic effort by Rockstar and it's♥♥♥♥♥♥poor of Steam to allow this game to be up for sale. Rockstar please fix. Until then DO NOT make a purchase with this game.

												GTA III is a great game for it's time. I highly encourage you to purchase this game to relive the memories of classic GTA, however, this is the WRONG platform to do so on. The PC version of GTA III is a broken console port teaming with compatibility issues. There is no stability in the frame-rate due to the designers screwing up and making the game render all geometry reguardless of weather it's visable or not. Grab a copy for the ps2/xbox so you'll actually be able to enjoy playing this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my personal opinon, I feel that Rockstar and Steam shouldn't have the right to sell such a broken product without even as little as a warning about how bad this version of the game is. And if you're running Windows 10 like I am? HA! Good luck...cause you're gonna need it. I got this game to run better by setting up a PS2 emulator for my PC and playing it that way. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY for an otherwise AMAZING experence.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 My Review of GTA 3 for PCNote: I'm a GTA fan and i'm gonna completely honest about thisPros: Interesting protagonist even though he can't talk Great Setting takes place in Liberty City Good Radio Station Great story (played from PS2) Good graphic for a 2002 game NostalgiaCons: No MAP Few marks in the map Clunky Combat No free-look when driving that makes even harder for playing it Kills people is hard when shooting Weird controls Driving is hardOriginally posted by Author itself: Overall Great game but bad port. If you want to bought this for PC consider getting your hand dirty with mods or buy VC/SA for Vanilla gameplay(Plain: no mods) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a terrible port of from what i've heard a great game. The instant I played the game and tried to skip the intro cutscene, the game crashes. Keep in mind that I have a windows 8 computer that can run 90% of my games at max settings with my Radeon R9 270X but it's just a case of a really bad PC port from Rockstar Studios. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC!!! ONLY GET IT ON THE CONSOLES OR AT LEAST THE DISC VERSION OF THE GAME FOR PC. DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM. EVEN WHEN IT GOES ON SALE, DON'T GET SUCKERED IN LIKE I DID WITH THE SALE. Shameful Display Rockstar. Shameful Display...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
