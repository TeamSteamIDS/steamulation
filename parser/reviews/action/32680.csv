												To me the Delta Force game's have always been a big part of my gaming life. It was the first FPS I played on PC and even though there are more choices out now then there was back then I still choose to play this game because it's just one of those games that once you get hooked you'll always come back for more.

Recommend for players who like classic quick death FPS  game(Few shoots would get player or enemy kill.).Not recommend for players who like an assortment types of enemy that players would only encounter ten loads of militias with AK-47 and RPG(and several crocodiles).

												i played dfbhd back in 2009-2010, this is the best game out their with so much history, found it here on steam it feels so good to be back on it once again, for those who dont know this game, their is a movie out you should see , ""black hawk down"" example of this game is a little like battlefield and ARMA, dfbhd was also game of the year in 2004. if you dont believe me that this game is so good, trust me buy it and see the servers. the servers are still running hott even in 2016, good amount of people still on, ever since 2003, now thats a sign of a good game. dfbhd has thousands of maps, in novalogic HQ you can download some of them aswell. why thousands of maps? because this game comes with a easy to use map editer where you can also place your own bot players, make your own mission or try your own map in the mutiplayer. Delta Force Gave me many good memorys i thank god i found it agian, make your own good memorys today and buy this game.			",235,32,11,35,27,3,12

												Delta Force has always been considered a ""light"" tactical shooter. Though it had realistic elements, it was never on a par with the likes of Rainbow 6, Swat 4 or Ghost Recon. It walked the line because tactical and action. Black Hawk down retains elements of the original, weapon loadouts, 1-3 hit kills, lean/crouch/prone, multiple stage objectives and large outdoor levels. Where it differs, is in an increased intensity, a consensus attempt to pump up the action.  Whereas in the originals you would pick off enemies at a distance, here it is largely close quarter combat  with an increased enemy count and tighter, linear scripting with added arcade elements in the form of health and ammo pickup's. Comparative to what became the standard - Call Of Duty, it still offers a larger amount of freedom. There are no chest high walls tightly funneling the player, no scripted sequences constantly removing control and no glowing objects obnoxiously directing the player. Though linear, with on-the-rails shooting sections, it still affords the player enough of a sandbox to make combat interesting, while remaining focused. It's a better implementation of a now redundant formula Call Of Duty so succefully popularized. Where the game stumbles is in it's implementation of difficulty. A dichotomy forms between it's realistic intentions and frantic arcade aspirations. The player is barraged with hundreds of enemies to shoot per a level, yet the die almost instantly. This leads to frustrating deaths thanks to a obtuse, bizarre save system.Instead of simply hitting an F5 key to save, the player is limited dependent on difficulty. Even on easy, the level length and difficulty isn't consistent, ending in multiple instantaneous deaths both at close range and at a distance requiring reload after reload. Arguably this intensifies the gameplay by removing save-scumming to skip through via trail and error, but it also creates frustration that potentially puts those without a strong disposition for tolerence off the game completely. I'd recommend playing on easy, if only for the extra save slots. Visually the pc version had aged reasonably considering it's age. The steam version however, as is the case with many games, is simply games with no thought of facilitating for the buyer. In my case, changing the graphical settings, at all, means an entire reinstall. The resolution without user made patches means no wide screen. Multilayer is also dead thanks to the insidious NovaWorld. It's a pity, the game is renowned for it's multiplayer, taking no effort to adapt to steam more than smacks of laziness, marring an otherwise excellent game. Sounds is acceptable though not as good as it could have been, typical rock and roll booming to signify you are the good guy kicking butt coupled with melodic Middle Easten themes to signify this is a bad troubled land. Voice acting largely consists of military jargon being spouted than any attempts character development, depending on your point of view, this is a good thing. The environmental effects do a good job of lighting up passive sequences with eruptions of firefights without ever reaching the obnoxious levels of Call Of Duty - your ear drums are safe. The game on a whole rather than a cohesive plot is segmented into selectable missions acting as bite sized experiences typical 10-20 minutes long. Whether you enjoy this is subjective, for myself, aside from Brothers In Arms, I've never found them effective enough to care, it's only ever bogged down the gameplay with unwanted narrative. Black Hawk down cuts to the core of the game immediately allowing for bite sized sessions without feeling obligated to consume the entire package.AI is hit and miss, sometimes the enemy can one hit kill the player from half a mile away, other cases multiple enemies will stand in front of the player looking blankly into space. Vital spots are non existent, vaguely hitting in the direction of an enemy is an instanous kill. Flashbangs can be useful in mitigating the hoards of enemies piled upon the player and sniping rather than close range weapons are preferable, it does the job, but is spotty at best. Your own team mates have commands but rather than the substance of Rainbow 6, it's novelty. Useless. The friendly AI operates on it's own, occasionally being helpful without the need for player input.The weapons lack the realistic oomph of something like Arma and he arcade slickness of Call Of Duty, sitting somewhere in-between the two, they are never satisfying as they should be. Again, they do the job.Mission structure itself is extremely good. The perfect balance between freedom and linearity. Jumping from an on the rails section, immediately to a maze of city streets, always in a changing state to keep the game engaging. It's well thought out and execution puts Call Of Duty's iron-grip handholding to shame. Overall, coming back to this I liked this game more than expected, given the bombardment of military shooters through the years I expected to drudge through it, instead I found an engaging experience with just the right amount freedom to stop monotony setting in. It's drop in drop out style of design is great for short gaming sessions. If you can tolerate it's flaws both within the game itself and it's lackluster treatment as a sold product, you'll find a rewarding and surprisingly fun experience, even if you are sick of military shooters.

												Another attempt by Novalogic to cash in on military popculture, this one went far better than Task Force Dagger did. It's on a brand new engine that eliminates the bug issues which plagued the previous generation of Delta Force games. While the combat is still very action-based, it's become much sharper, and the missions have returned to being based on realism - indeed, they are loosely based on actual events during the Somalia intervention, with the final string of them depicting the Battle of Mogadishu that is seen in Black Hawk Down. The expansion are also pretty good, showcasing an anti-drug operation in Columbia and an intervention during a revolution in Iran.			",236,81,1,37,22,2,51

												The Delta Force Series games are wonderfully done and well laid out. With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												Delta Force is an oldschool budget tactical shooter franchise and Black Hawk Down is the 6th installment. Team Sabre is a big expansion pack set in Colombia and Iran. The core gameplay stays the same, but the locations and the difficulty has increased.The Visuals.Same as in BHD. BHD has it's own engine and runs at DirectX8, 4:3 aspect ratio resolution. I managed to get it up to 1200p, it refused to go above. All widescreen solutions stretch / cut off the screen. Considering that it's budget titles made in 2003 the visuals are fine. Decent textures, fine poly count and nice drawing distance (like in every other DF title). Framerate is unlimited. Game is compatible with pretty much all Windows versions.Considering this is an expansion the mechanics and AI haven't been upgraded and are pretty much the same as in the main game. The only minor complaint is that some objectives are buggy and there are some minor friendly AI bugs.The Audio.Just like BHD Team Sabre offers nice background music and nice team dialogues.The Gameplay.With the expansion you get 5 missions set in Colombia and 6 missions set in Iran. Some new weapons have been added. Unlike in the main game these missions are way longer and more difficult (you get less saves too). The shortest mission is around 10 minutes and the longest one is half an hour+. Missions include village, airfield, jungle, island, oil rig, oil pipeline and even stronghold raids with various insertion methods. Some of these mission offer far more complex maps with lots of buildings and enemies which easily makes this far more interesting than the main campaign itself.If you liked Black Hawk Down then you'll most likely will like this expansion even more.

												Not really much to say, same as Black Hawk Down just except that regardless of clicking black hawk down, you will always play team sabre. Black Hawk Down and Team Sabre is actually the same, only difference is Team Sabre has more contents when purchasing Black Hawk Down. Such as new character you can play as, new story modes, and i believe new maps as well (i think). So get this alongside Black Hawk Down, they are both good and has same results.			",284,30,0,7,2,0,3

												The Battle of Mogadishu, more commonly referred to as Black Hawk Down or, locally, as the Day of the Rangers (Somali: Maalintii Rangers), was part of Operation Gothic Serpent and was fought on 3 and 4 October 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, between forces of the United States supported by UNOSOM II, and Somali militiamen loyal to the self-proclaimed president-to-be Mohamed Farrah Aidid who had support from armed civilian fighters.A U.S. Army force in Mogadishu, consisting primarily of U.S. Army Rangers from Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment; C Squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), better known as ""Delta Force""; as well as Air Force Combat Controllers and Air Force Pararescuemen and helicopters from 1st Battalion, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, attempted to seize two of Aidid's high-echelon lieutenants during a meeting in the city. Shortly after the assault began, Somali militia and armed civilian fighters shot down two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The subsequent operation to secure and recover the crews of both helicopters drew the raid, intended to last no more than an hour, into an overnight standoff in the city. The battle resulted in 18 deaths, 73 wounded, and one helicopter pilot captured among the U.S. raid party and rescue forces. One Pakistani soldier and one Malaysian soldier were killed as part of the rescue forces but other resources claim there was greater loss of life. American sources estimate between 1,500 and 3,000 Somali casualties, including civilians; SNA forces claim only 315 killed, with 812 wounded. The battle is also referred to as the First Battle of Mogadishu to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Mogadishu of 2006.Date	3–4 October 1993(1 day)Location	Mogadishu, SomaliaResult	Pyrrhic tactical U.S./U.N. victory[1] Strategic SNA victoryU.S. withdraws 25 March 1994U.N. withdraws 28 March 1995Belligerents UNOSOM II United States Pakistan Malaysia South Korea Italy Somali National Alliance (SNA)Alleged: al-QaedaStrength160 military12 vehicles (9 Humvee's, 3 M939 trucks)19 aircraft (16 helicopters – 8 Black Hawks and 8 Little Birds)	4,000–6,000 militiamen and civilian fightersCasualties and lossesU.S.18 killed73 wounded1 capturedMalaysia1 killed7 woundedPakistan1 killed2 wounded	SNA Militia and civiliansSNA claims a range of 315 to 500 Somali casualties, 812 wounded.

												This game is only for true fans of the series:-Some stages are way too much unfair, long and trial-and-error based;-There are too much RPG's (rocket-propelled grenadiers) and fixed machine gunners throughout the game;-There is too much grass and little stage variety;-All stages require long distance view but not all allow sniper rifles, so the player keeps chasing pixels;-The intros are way too long. Every time you restart a level you have to rewatch them;-There are too many enemies.And other issues.So, play this game only if you are a true fan of the Delta Force series.			",173,21,5,16,24,1,21

												Let me start by saying I remember playing regular DFBHD (without team sabre) as a kid, it was my first FPS ever. I loved BHD then and still do to this day. I would give that game a 9/10, however this expansion sucks. First of all the missions are really hard, and I beat the original BHD on Operator difficulty. These missions just seem to put an absurd amount of enemies to shoot at you, there are so many standing around it just looks stupid. In addition the maps look terrible. For some of the grassy areas instead of creating grass textures for the ground it looks like they just changed the dirt and rocks ground texture to green. Now we have green dirt and rocks. Also the glitches...like I said I played the original BHD and that was not glitch free...but these are ridiculous. On an oil rig mission where the goal was to rescue hostages and blow up SAM sites on the rig. The game was supposed to pick up the hostages with a helicopter and didn't but the game still told me to blow up the SAM sites, in turn blowing up the oil rig...with the hostages still on it, and it still said mission sucess! Mind you this wasn't after 20 playthroughs of this mission. This was one playthrough, my first of this mission. Then in another mission I got out of a humvee and kept the 50 cal...I thought ""this is an awesome glitch"" but when I shot the gun...the shooting sound and animation played but no bullets came out...I now had a worthless noisemaker. Unless this game is on sale I would not recommend it at all, especially considering you can get custom missions made by the community that are better. Oh and another thing the voice acting is horrible (and yes I know the original BHD didn't have the best either but this is just aweful) one of the lines is something along the lines of ""Do not blow up the trucks...do you understand 5-1?"" WHat? The cringee.....			",54,3,0,3,3,0,1

												Heyyo,Meh, a pretty darn boring game with mediocre AI... I didn't end up playing more than 20 minutes. I only bought it to add detection for the Evolve client. There's better FPS games on Steam... recommend any of those.			",466,98,12,57,64,6,85

												Played this game when I was younger. I still rather enjoy hoping on the servers and seeing the best graphics at the time of release. Many many hours played that aren't logged on steam. ",213,20,1,14,13,2,14

												One of the first FPS shooters I've played, you can say this is the game that sparked my love for the American army and the genre of special forces within military shooters over span of the years. As a child, this game has had made a severe impression on me: even as I will play it today, the overall story, voice-acting, mission-flow still holds up as I remember it back in the day. Though it cannot compete with the FPS or military shooters of today's standard, I would strongly advise anyone who intrigues in military shooters to purchase this game and play it! This is one classical gem of a game and deserves to be played by everyone.			",156,10,7,15,10,0,9

												I might have 9 hrs in this game on steam, but i have spent way more time on it than that. I had a CD version of this game years ago, (i think i still have it laying around somewhere actually) and man, do i love this game. This is without a doubt my favorite delta force game, the fact this is set in a place and time in history i haven't really seen before in FPS games is also what makes this unique to me. The AI might not be the best ever, coupled with the fact that you can kill 'em in one shot makes the missions a bit easy, or so you'd think. For you see, they might not be the smartest bunch, but my god are they accurate, frustratingly so. If you come across an enemy with a 50 Cal. you better set your focus on getting rid of them, or else they will tear you limb from limb.The singleplayer, aside from the ai as i already said, is pretty fun to play through, espicially with the Team Sabre expansion adding 2 new campaigns.the multiplayer however, i know pretty much nothing about, since i mostly just played singeplayer. But from what i was able to play recently, its pretty fun aswell.Overall, i reccomend this game if you are interested in shootin up somalis and drug cartels. Oh, and alligators aswell, dont forget them!			",209,2,11,5,14,1,8
