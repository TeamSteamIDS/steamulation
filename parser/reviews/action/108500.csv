Vessel - Fresh take on puzzlesFor me it was really refreshing experience in terms of solving puzzles. But there is much more than just puzzles to this games and in this review I'll try to explain myself. It all starts in a lab with a very nice introduction to the story about the engineer that has invented a way to control the behavior of the liquid and then realized the potential of his invention. To make it easier for me I will tell that with that invention you can turn liquid into a living creature that can follow basic commands. But as with any inventions there are potential issues. And those issues started in the very lab they were invented.  And that were the learning curve starts, gradually. It's not very steep to turn me off right away and not to gradual to make me feel the game thinks I'm an idiot. The game definitely knows what it wants to be and tell that to you in the right way. After playing for about 1 minute I was completely into it and I knew I was not going to bed before I complete it.I think it is quite easy to ruin the game with a review spoiler so I will try to stay away from solving puzzles and just talk about what I loved about the game in no particular order. So the first think I loved in this game are the Fluros, those creatures made of liquid using the invention I mentioned earlier. I felt that the protagonist has emotional bond with them and I started to feel that. You will probably too when you get into the game. There will be a variety of them and they will have unique abilities so you will have a lot to tinker about as the game progresses.Then there's graphics. From what you can see on the screenshots it's nothing fancy but there's charm to it. And for me that means more than anything. Believe me I recently played games that are 20 years old. So back to Vessel and it's graphics. It's an amazing blend of 2D and 3D that give the characters that unique look.Then there's music which I only started paying attention to after I learned the basics. The soundtrack is very immersive and it perfectly fits any given location or situation. I was sitting there on the couch with my headset on and enjoying the flow of sounds to my ears. The controls. The first thing I noticed were the clues on how to use switches and other things it was great and I didn't really need any manual or even look at the control scheme in the settings. I was playing with a gamepad and I didn't turn of the rumble because I didn't even open control settings. And that was a good thing. Because unlike games where the gamepad ruble is more like a jackhammer that makes your entire body to shake. In this game it's gentle and just makes you feel the feedback from the environment in just the right way.Gameplay is liquid. Yes, almost all you do involves liquid one way or another. It plays and feels so unique and I really don't remember any other game that was anything like it. Not that I played too many games but I played enough to say that for myself.And now, upgrades. It doesn't make the game any less difficult but it makes solving puzzles more convenient. And wanting to upgrade your equipment makes you solve optional puzzles and I love optional puzzles and missions.Last but definitely not least I'd like to tease you with a paragraph about the bosses. This being a puzzle game it will make you think how to approach every single one of them and the same tactics will not work. In my opinion everyone who plays puzzle games should complete the game just to appreciate the final boss and final puzzle. I can only assume how much thought went into making those and how satisfying it was to complete the game.Remember I wrote earlier that I planned to complete it that night? Not a chance. It took me 20 hours and it was worth every second I spent. And every penny to. Not that I spent to much during the sale but I would have bought it right away if I know what I know now.So pick it up sometime and enjoy!More reviews from Gameaways Curator ",135,9,0,6,0,0,2

												Intro------Bought Vessel on the humble bundle store for a couple of quid. Looked like a decent puzzler. Was looking for a game which could run on my laptop. This seemed perfect.Gameplay-----------I played with Xbox 360 controller and it was very responsive. Full controller support i believe. Graphics are nice and colourful. Slightly cartoony and cute but HD. The music was not annoying although i think it looped throughout the game. The fluid mechanics are nice. The difficulty curve is good, starting off with simple puzzles and moving onto more complex ones. Some of them were quite difficult at first, but after a bit of trial and error and sometimes looking at everything from a distance the solution comes forth! Very rewarding feeling on completing the game.I will look at other games this developer has made as I like his style and enjoyed this game a lot. First game on steam to unlock all achievements too after investing 30 hours on it. Conlcusion------------A very good game overall, i would give it 9/10. Bugged Achievement (Internal Rejection)?---------------------------------------------Some people say one acievement is bugged, the one where you have to create a dark fluro out of green glo goo (Internal Rejection). The achievement is not bugged, you have to put some green and some blue on the floor, then put the dark fluro eye in to start creating the dark fluro, but the trick is to start sucking up a little bit of it as it is being created, if not, it will not sustain itself and explode / die. 50% of each green and blue and then eye and then suck up a bit of the blue so it is more green than blue...... worked it out after 5 mins of trying....

												Vessel is a really neat physics based puzzle platformer with the primary mechanics revolving around fluids and these cute little fluid creatures that each have specific AI depending on the material they’re made of.I admit, because it’s an indie puzzle platformer this game sat around on my metaphorical steam shelf and collected dust for quite a long time. I don’t enjoy these types of games and I tend to find them overly frustrating or convoluted for the most part. Vessel certainly is not a cake walk by any means, and there were a few moments when I felt like progress was impossible, but it was nice because the reason I was having trouble was simply because I lacked a tool that I had not unlocked yet. The puzzles made me think but did not feel ridiculous or malicious, being able to progress through the game at a moderate pace really made the whole title so much more enjoyable.I didn’t complete the entire game, but it was not for a lack of enjoyment or a spike in frustration. Vessel is a wonderful game and deserves to stand out amongst the other physics puzzle platformers.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												I played this, then for an LP, then a few years later for the final achievements.This game is majestic and wonderful and I'm kinda heartbroken there is no sequel. The world, thin as it is, feels like something I want to explore more of. The Fluro are cute, exciting yet something to be respected. The puzzles are clever and sometimes amazing. It's sad that most upgrades are superfluous, especially since they feel like they could be used in exciting ways if the world just let it. And the environments. Gorgeous. Beautiful lighting, painterly landscapes, a steampunk aesthetics that even I, not a huge steampunk fanatic, can drool over. Vessel has a special place in my heart.It's not a long game, depending on your puzzle skills.But it's a truly wonderful game either way. If you're a cheapskate, get it on sale. But trust me, it'll stick with you.			",280,66,3,39,44,0,31

												The game is... okay.It has decent and quite creative puzzles, plenty of hints that build up the puzzles, the control is quite responsive, and there's actually some sort of story that draws me in. The visual isn't really up to my taste, but eh, may be other people will find it just fine.For me there are 2 problems with the game. The first one is that there's some sort of upgrade system that actually has no use. Nothing really gets easier by unlocking the upgrade, you can't get faster or die harder with the upgrades.The other problem is I find the number of puzzles quite lacking. There are maybe... 25 main puzzles here (could be 35-40 if you count the tutorial puzzles). I was seriously surprised when the game ends, I thought it's just mid way, especially since I haven't used the upgrades at all.All in all, I'd put down ""neutral"" score if I can, there are plenty of other games on Steam.

Publisher: Strange Loop Games[www.strangeloopgames.com]Developer: Indie Pub[en.wikipedia.org]Platform: PCControls: Full Controller SupportVessel is a fluid based puzzle-platformer in which you play as M. Arkwright, an inventor who created an automaton called a Fluro. They were created to help out with laborious tasks which they can perform better than humans. Only problem is they start evolving and running amok so you need to go through the world of Vessel to fix what they have broken. To help you out in the game you get a liquid gun with a tank attached to it. You can either spray liquid or suck it into it. It’s also upgradeable with different nozzle tips and larger tanks. With this and the Fluros you will be able to complete the puzzles throughout the world.You’ll play through three different areas where you will need to repair machinery that the Fluros have broken. The levels consist of a factory, orchard, and mines. Through these levels you will discover new types of Fluro that you can use. You also need to capture each type which will then give you a seed. The seeds can be thrown on the grown and spray with liquid to form whichever Fluro it is. These vary from ones that like to press switches, chase you, collect liquid till they pop, hide from light, or go to the light. The puzzles in the game are challenging and fun to do. I had a few that really made me think but the fun was in discovering how to get the different Fluros to work for you. The story also wasn’t too bad and did add a little to the game but it was really all about the puzzles. Overall Vessel is a fun challenging puzzle game to play and should not be missed.Bear Pros:Great liquid physicsFun challenging puzzlesFluro characteristics  Bear Cons:Somewhat lackluster endingOnly three areas to exploreNeeds more of these great puzzles (not really a con)			",2438,1021,85,323,253,20,376

												Quite interesting game. Visuals and audio are nice. Puzzles neither very complex nor plain - it's surely possible to solve them on your own after a bit of thought. Gameplay isn't as exciting as it could be to make you dive into playing non-stop but still easily attracts you for an hour or two every day. Technically stable software. P.S. You don't need to get all the available upgrades to complete it.			",191,84,2,21,15,1,35

												I had a really hard time understanding Vessel for the first few hours. The fluro storyline makes this a daftly weird game. However, after struggling through the initial learning curve, Vessel turned into a decent puzzle platformer. The different fluid combinations and eyeballs types make for some interesting gameplay. Basically you use fluros to stand on buttons, engage switches, explode, or create steam by shooting water at lava fluros enabling some machinery to open a door. Then, later on in the game, there are much more interesting fluros offering new elements that keep the puzzles fresh. Overall, a good challenge and a fun experience.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Vessel is a challenging physics-based platform puzzler. The puzzles are pleasantly difficult, and it features an attractive steampunk aesthetic.The gameplay in Vessel is mostly about using giant steampunk factory machines and manipulating creatures made out of water (and later, other materials) into doing your bidding. Some creatures are dangerous, but death isn’t a major obstacle in Vessel; it just resets the current challenge.What makes Vessel so fun to play, though, is the wonderful sloshy water mechanics. It's really fun to splash through this game. The level design is creative, and the puzzles are thoughtfully made.If you like puzzlers, Vessel is definitely worth a look. It's creative, polished, entertaining, and difficult. It's a bit pricey at $15, but look for a sale. ",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

Most people won't be getting agrovated at not being able to solve a certain puzzle. Because of this, you can very easily blow through the game. While there isn't very much content gameplay wise, the game is beautifully done. Everything looks great and the mechanics of the game are fun to play with.			",207,57,8,15,20,3,36

												I really liked the atmosphere, i.e. the music, sound, and visual style. The puzzles are creative and always seem reasonably challenging. I always felt a sense of accomplishment as I played through the game. Unfortunately, the game has two very frustrating sections that can definitely ruin the experience, so I'll just warn you about them. The second and third numbered puzzles in the mines seem to require that you make the nozzle that lets you create fluro blobs, but there's no indication from the game that you will ever need a certain upgrade in order to progress. You need that nozzle because it lets you shoot fluros through the grates, but there's no hint from the game that you can do that. It's very frustrating if you get stuck and keep trying to shoot green goo through grates, which you're clearly not supposed to really be able to do. Also, on the section with ladders, it turns out that you can use one of the nozzles (the one that propels you a little bit) to make the jumps easier, but the game doesn't really hint very well that you can use that nozzle to do that.Secondly, for the final part of the game (the accelerator) you should probably just use a walkthrough to figure out what you're supposed to do. The requirements to complete it are very unclear and don't make a lot of sense.Other than that, the game was one of the most enjoyable puzzle platformers I've played. I'd say I liked it more than games like Braid, Waking Mars, and Fez. ",216,50,8,24,23,3,32

												Vessel is a physics puzzle platformer primarily focused on liquid manipulation.  What makes it unique is that you can actually turn the liquid into living creatures called fluros which have simple behaviors you need to utilize to solve puzzles.  You also have a liquid tank and sprayer which you can use to suck up and spray liquids.  You play as the scientist who created fluros, which have now gotten out of control and are evolving new abilities and are interfering with machinery near your lab.  You solve puzzles in order to repair the machines so you can get your lab up and running again, and to study the new fluro types.Throughout the game you discover more liquid types and fluro types, as well as more interactions between different types of liquids.  The puzzles are varied and interesting with only a few being difficult enough to stump me for a while.  The game is paced very well without any large difficulty spikes or sudden flood of new mechanics.  Most of it works well, though as physics games often are, the simulation can be rather glitchy.  Especially when fluros are created with near the minimum amount of liquid necessary, they have a tendency to die randomly.  I did have to restart a puzzle or two due to not being able to fix various glitches, but overall it went pretty smoothly.Graphically the game is nothing special.  I wouldn't call the art style particularly pleasing but it gets the job done.  I would expect the game to run well on most PCs.Vessel surprised me being much more enjoyable than I was expecting.  When the game was released I didn't think it looked very interesting but it turned out much better.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle platformers.			",862,200,24,72,69,9,114

												I love this gameIt is an amazing physics puzzler that reminds me of the oddworld games.You control a scientist that can make little critters out of different types of liquids, they all do different things and they react to eachother in different ways (sometimes explosively) and you use them to solve puzzles, you also have a gun that squirts and sucks up different liquids, and the liquids are simulated brilliantly.The game doesn't have tutorials in the strictest sense but you are always being taught new ways to use your critters and liquids and you are constantly unlocking new things to do.Buy this game if you don't already own it.

												Great little game! Definitely recommend it.Quick pros:- Captivating world- Original storyline- Original gameplay- Good pacing - puzzles get increasingly difficult, but not too hard, and new items pop up regularly to keep things interesting- Polished game- Great soundtrack- Don't have to have lightning reflexes to get through it (like some platformers)Quick cons:- No control adjustments (keymapping, etc.) - I use a different keyboard layout and it was tedious to have to keep switching before playing the game. (But it was worth the trouble. Good game.)- Game crashed once on me.- One graphical glitch popped up for me later in the game related to eyes on the creatures.- Saves regularly put me in the same spot, but without the same amount of resources as when I saved...not fun.Other info:- This game is about 10-15 hrs of gameplay - fairly short. (Depending on how long you spend on the puzzles and going back for all the achievements.)			",35,11,0,2,5,0,0

												This is a 2D puzzle platformer with a Victorian era Steampunk setting. You have discovered how to animate water and an industrial revolution occurred because of it. But now your animated “Fluros” are acting a bit off and you've got to fix them.	While I didn't find the puzzles to be very difficult, I Still enjoyed the game. There is a kind of laid back feel to the game and completing the puzzles still gave a feeling of accomplishment. I've come to expect excellent music from indie games and the soundtrack is pretty good here. Wish a soundtrack came with the Bundle. While the controls are clunky; It only affected a small part of the game. The main character kind of reminded me of a puppet on strings, For some reason. Nothing too taxing, but a pretty decent game.			",82,30,1,7,15,1,15

												These puzzle-platformers are hit-or-miss for me. Lots of people like this game, so maybe it is me. Maybe I just wasn't in the right moo when I played this game, because it never really grabbed me. A good friend, who usually has the same tastes in gaming, really enjoyed this game. But I found the puzzles too arbitrary. I know, it is a puzzle game. What did I expect? That's why I'm trying to give the game the benefit of the doubt and say maybe it just didn't click for me. I usually like this type of game but maybe it went a shade too far into adventure game wacky puzzle territory for me?In any case, life is short and Steam is full of great games so I don't recommend this to others.

												Vessel is an indie-2D-sidescrolling-puzzler. This is almost a genre of its own with games like Braid, Waking Mars, & The Swapper. It has all the familiar fingerprints: low-key synth background music, cartoonish sprites, atmosphere, and a story pieced together through journal entires. These games live or die based on how good their puzzles are. This is always a tricky tightrope to walk. Too easy and it's boring. Too hard and you just quit in frustration. In Vessel's case, you control a tank full of different liquids, each with different properties. In addition, different lifeforms can be summoned (think Pikman but less direct control) that'll assume the properties of that liquid. These are then used to flick switches, step on platforms, and solve puzzle rooms. Familiar territory, so how does it do?Vessel is one of those games you don't feel good about not recommending. It is at least passable in the two zones, but the last zone introduces a frustrating light mechanic that is very unpredictable. As the game isn't hexed based, being off by a matter of pixels can change the behavior of some of your lifeforms. There are also some both graphical glitches and gameplay bugs that hamper things. Worst of all, Vessel never gives you that ""Ah-ha!"" moment that makes these puzzlers so compelling. The satisfaction of unpacking the interlocking parts of a puzzle and logically arriving at a solution is the opium of this genre and there just isn't enough here.I don't hat Vessel, I just wouldn't recommend anyone else put in the 8 hours I did to finish it.

												I GOT SO OBCESSED WITH THIS GAME THAT I COULD NOT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, THIS IS A FREAKING MASTERPIECE with some rare little problems sometimes BUT STILL THE BEST LIQUID PHYSICS PLATFORM PUZZLE GAME I EVER PLAYED!!!Seriously though, i really recommend, it has some very interesting elements such as no voice is ever spoken, story is told through visuals and his journal, the sweet melancholic music made by Jon Hopkins fits so well into the game.Fun fact: i never looked into the character's face until i started the second playthrough, and then i noticed the character proportions are cartoon, all because i got so immersed into this game universe.Edit: grammar.

												Vessel is a unique 2.5D physics-based sidescrolling puzzle game and is all about liquids and 'Fluros', creatures which you can spawn by combining their seeds with 6 different liquids.Solving the puzzles in the game requires a clever understanding of how the Fluro seeds and the liquids work together, which might require some trial-and-error but never really gets frustrating.The puzzles are well-designed, varying and constantly increase in difficulty over the course of the game. The level design itself isn't exactly mind-blowing, but is still fairly decent and fits the overall steampunk-ish design of the game.Unfortunately, the game doesn't provide much replay value, but with about 10-12 hours of gameplay it's a lot longer than most AAA-games these days - and that for 1/5th of the price!For me, it's already one of the best Indie/puzzle games of 2012 and I can wholeheartedly recommend the game to anyone who's slightly interested in either of both, so go on and check out the demo!

												First and foremost this game is about half puzzler / half platformer, so be prepared.  Some of the platforming can be just as challenging as the puzzles, especially on the mouse and keyboard.  It does have an indie feel to it, and some of the progression suffers a tad, as in some places you can find yourself wandering around unsure of where to go next, most notably a section in the Factory, due to the counter-intuitive little map shown above the goal machines.  I won't spoil it, but basically the map is backwards.  The Journal in the game that vaguely tells you where to go next does its job, and that's it.  It doesn't hold your hand.The graphics are really pretty, with an almost watercolor feel in places, and the backgrounds steal the show from the nearer sections to the screen and main characters.  I'm only past the first section, but I've already felt the overwhelming urge to break free of the puzzle's ""prisons"" and go outside and run around the lush looking town and landscape.  Another game set in this universe as some kind of RPG or Action RPG would be amazing.Coupled with the graphics is a really good soundtrack.  The sound effects are almost TOO good and eerily realistic for the cartoony looking style.  The music is really well done and fits the game nicely, ranging from artsy downtempo thematic music to more industrial techno type stuff, always matching the setting and action, or lack thereof.If I had to gripe it would be about the controls, especially on the mouse and keyboard.  There are certain elements that require the player to grab a device and rotate it.  If you've ever played Little Big Planet you won't be surprised.  What DID surprise me was how long it took me to figure out that when using WASD, you really do have to use all of WASD when spinning certain circular contraptions around to get the speed up.  What I mean is that if you're using a thumbstick, you naturally progress Up, to Right, to Down, to Left, and Up again as you spin the stick, but when using the keyboard I had to learn the hard way.  I don't recall any other game requiring me to go from W, to D, to S, to A, back to W in a motion like that, and it's really challenging.  I do like the mouse's use in aiming the player, but I may have to change to a gamepad before too long if the puzzles increase in difficulty.  The game says on the home screen that a gamepad is recommended.Overall, the game is a lot longer than I expected, and the style isn't really even ""Steampunk,"" but more of a neat hybrid that still incorporates liquids, hydraulics, and temperature.  Some of the sections are engineered solely around the puzzles, and if you step back and take a look at these sections you find yourself asking why someone would build these mazes and dangerous pitfalls in the first place.  This can sometimes ruin the suspension of disbelief, but once you accept it for what it is it's really a rad little game.  I've noticed a bug or two with certain machines' physics getting out of whack, but there's an option in the game to reset a puzzle if you've screwed up or boxed yourself in.  Other than that, it's polished up well and a lot of fun.**EDIT**After dicking around trying to get achievements I changed it to a thumbs down.  The devs gave up caring and haven't fixed some bugs that make the game literally unplayable.  On some puzzles the physics engine breaks down and you have to reset it just to get a random thing to happen.  Multiple achievements are so finnicky to the point of frustration, not in figuring them out, but in MAKING THEM HAPPEN.  If you're just going to throw out arbitrary random achievements without testing them or making sure they work correctly then you can suck it.  A perfect game would allow a player to do a solid run with NO DEATHS, in the way Limbo does, but not here.  Half the puzzles and achievements towards the end require you to look them up online just to make sure you're trying to do them correctly, and then you find out that you are, and it's just the game that's broken.  No fix is coming, so what started out as a joyful experience turned into hair pulling anger.  I hate crappy devs that pull this garbage.			",195,68,1,26,18,1,14

												Once i thought this game was just wierd.... It broke physics and steven hawkings mind...Then after afew seconds in the game the story gotten better and better, But yet the puzzles remain harder and harder.It'd probably one of the best puzzle games i played since 2014. I kept focusing on the puzzles but still hard.I raged sometimes on this game and spent a whole day trying to figure out the puzzles, A WHOLE DAY!But yet the game is pretty good. But afew glitches still remain alive in the game, Maybe they'll fix it.I'd rate it a 10/9 Better then R.L Stine.			",349,113,10,76,48,8,62

												Vessel is an excellent 2-D platform puzzle game. There are a few spots that require quick fingers and fast reflexes, although there are many puzzles where you just need to do the right things in the right order. Most of the puzzles are challenging without being impossible, so it is very satisfying when you solve a puzzle.I rate this game an 8 instead of a 9 because I ran into some game bugs on the final level (accelerator) that made the level unsolvable. I closed the game and restarted, and then I was able to complete the puzzle first try. I think there a few bugs like this in the game where you need to restart the game to make it work right. Still an excellent game and well worth your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Vessel is such a great puzzle platformer with a great storyline, great level design, great fluid dynamics, great dynamic lighting, and pretty much awesome everything. There are plenty of puzzles, each unique and building on each previous one, creating a great sense of accomplishment. I cannot recommend this game enough, I don't even know why more people haven't played it even with its low $15 price and the feature in one of the Humble Bundles.			",101,13,1,13,10,1,22

												This is an excellent puzzle game with a wonderful combination of possible gameplay elements. Multiple types of fluro 'eyes' can combine with several different fluids to produce a surprisingly large number of results and elements to be used in puzzle solutions. The fluid dynamics work quite well, and the upgrade system is nicely done. All the steampunky machinery you get to interact with is quite fun as well, and I love how they did the labs. The boss battles were very thought provoking and you must make sure you have a good grasp of all the elements at your disposal. Buy this if you like unique puzzle games.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

												A good game that forces the player to think in intreging and new ways. Unfortunatelly, the short play time makes this game not quite worth the price. It tries to add challenges to add to the playtime, but this is not the kind of game to support replayability. However, I would certainly recommend this if you find it during a sale, as it will give you a few hours of fun.			",28,5,0,6,6,1,14

												In a market flooded with 2D indie platformers Vessel is different because of its water physics. You have different liquids that have different properties, then different fluro that you can combine with the liquid to turn it into a kind of a mini robot with a pre-determined behaviour. And then you combine all this with switches in the level to solve puzzles. Some of the solutions are a little fiddly and take multiple tried to complete, a lot of puzzle solutions are blatantly obvious, and then there are times where I get the seance that the developer has introduced invisible walls to the fluro's behaviour to try and get them to solve the puzzle more consistently and reduce the fiddly nature of some of the puzzles. Many of the puzzles could have been playtested better, but then that is to be expected from an indie game.If you liked Trine, you will probably like this, although unlike Trine there is a no co-op here, Vessel does show some originality.

												This game is very good at what it does, but it goes overboard sometimes. Some puzzles are very easy and some are difficult until you find out that some mechanics were not properly shown so you did not have a clue that you could do that. After that it becomes easy or only a bit tricky. There are secrets(blobs) with a liquid that you need for upgrading your stuff. I forgot, what was it for and finished the game without upgrades...There is no voice-acting in this game just sounds and awesome background music by Jon Hopkins. Story is told to you in journal and that is kind of disappointing. Game is not very good looking as well. Loading screen is only 4:3 for some reason. Options are simple, but they cover pretty much all you'll need in 2D (2.5D) game. You can find there resolution, vsync, sound volume, fullscreen, music volume, gamma and language settings. In some puzzles you can get stuck or it can bug out. Some puzzles also seem to cause crashes. You do something there, then it stutters and crashes. To sum this up: Game has some little problems, but it's great in everything else! Recommended.			",217,31,2,24,15,4,20

												A great puzzle game with an interesting fluid-based mechanic. You have little helpers called Fluros who are both causing mayhem in your factory and who help you fix the problems they cause. You get to work with fluids like water, lava, blue/red goo, and glowing goo, making interesting combinations between them like steam, explosions and manipulating creatures afraid of or attracted to light. Pros:+Good music (though a bit repetitive)+Great mechanics+Challenging puzzles but not TOO frustrating+Interesting art+Good length. Not too short, not too long.+Nonlinear within groups of 5-10 puzzles, so if you get frustrated with one, you can skip it and come back to it. Also, there's no requirement to do EVERY puzzle before finishing an area (you can skip one per area and still proceed) but you get bonus stuff for upgrades if you are tenacious and do them all.+Upgrades. You can upgrade your nozzles and tanks to make your life easier, though most (if not all) of the puzzles are solvable without any upgrades. They just reduce the number of steps you need most times, or the time it takes.Cons:-A few puzzles are agonzing, either because you keep dying (lava creatures who chase you down, mostly) or have to restart because something went wrong with your setup. The final puzzle was torture, mostly because I knew what to do for AN HOUR but I had to keep restarting and setting the whole thing up once more because something went wrong with the execution.-The way the levels are set up is nonlinear, which I listed as a pro but is also a con. There are some arrows pointing you which way to go, but if you follow them, they just lead you to the end of the level (they're really just there to guide you after finishing a puzzle). You need to follow every path to find all the hidden goodies and bonus puzzles. You also end back up in your lab (the hub) after each area, which has the final puzzle in it, so I spent a good deal of time trying to get the final puzzle to work when I didn't have all the pieces, with nothing to indicate where I was supposed to go next. A bit frustrating. The levels are all connected to each other, with the first one you finish connecting to the lab on the left, so you basically have to travel counter-intuitively and PAST what you've already finished to get to the subsequent areas. Signs would  have been nice.Overall:The cons are really just me whining (except for that last puzzle. It was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥) Overall, definitely 9/10. I can see myself replaying this when I need a good puzzler. If you like Portal or Swapper, this is for you.			",44,70,0,5,2,1,6

												Picked up Vessel yesterday on steam.  Phenomenal art direction, particularly the music.  A shining example of indie game developing with notable emphasis on physics, art direction and conceptual ingenuity that shames many larger studios content to sit back and produce carbon copy modern military shooters.  Vessel takes a bold stylistic stance and it certainly has my recommendation.			",208,52,3,20,29,3,40

												An innovative and creative gameplay/story concept, clever puzzles that will make you feel very smart when you figure them out, a gorgeous soundtrack and a truly unique and beautiful art style with probably the nicest looking parallax scrolling I've ever seen in a game. Yeah, great game right here. My one gripe is that sometimes, even if you know the solution to the puzzles, it'll take a few tries to actually pull it off right. It can get a bit annoying, but hey. You're playing an inventor. Failure is part of that, right? Immersion, or something.			",453,241,10,34,19,5,43

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)This is a great physics-based platformer with a unique feel that I can heartily recommend. It has mechanical physics but also liquid physics, which isn't limited to filling containers, the liquids even form beings that run around and do stuff, and it's not fake that the beings are made of liquid (like, a hidden transition from one model to the other), because if you mechanically affect them enough, they dissolve and flow around again.On the one hand, your avatar's look and animation are a bit goofy (which doesn't matter, anyway), but on the other hand, that's because he consists of parts, if I remember correctly. (Writing this review from memory years after last play.)The sounds work well with the physical gameplay, they have a good realistic feel to them.Full disclosure: I haven't played through the whole game yet, but I can say that the 5+ hours I played have been good physics puzzle fun in one mostly continuous environment. I don't know if I would recommend the game for the full price of €20, but it's definitely a good product, you will not be disappointed.(For some reason, whenever I think of Vessel I also have to think of Rochard which is a quite different physics platformer. Both are relatively hidden gems. Maybe I bought them at the same time or something.)			",1053,464,26,127,134,10,138

												This is a great game on sale, but for $15 it's hardly recommendable, especially for about 7 hours of gameplay.It's an interesting fluid-physics puzzler, but the trailer makes the fluro creatures out to be some sort of monster gone awry. It's a really great tone/goal, that would've worked out great, but it gets halfway to it and falls flat. In the introduction to the 2nd level, it starts adding in horror elements with a bug-like version, made of lava, that simply chases you. Buuuuut, they're completely forgotten by the 3rd level, changing the tone of the game back to ""scientist fix it, no troubles"".Instead of a ""monster gone awry"" it's more like ""guy makes button pushing creature, creature pushes buttons"". The ending is pretty abrupt too, and ends on a ""you serious?"" note.There's a couple of puzzles in there that are interesting (kill fluro, spawn new one from corpse) but overall it's a very 'meh' game. I have to give it to the developer though as they created something that feels like it's completely their vision, unaltered.			",277,83,2,42,31,4,59

												Yeah, no, stay far clear of this one.Where to even begin. Okay. So, you know how most puzzle games are supposed to work consistently so that solving puzzles when you know the solution isn't a matter of luck? Not Vessel! Be ready for your fluros to randomly die in the middle of a puzzle! Be prepared for the AI to go off the rails and do something completely different than you were expecting! (Especially the light and dark fluros). And you know how physics-based puzzles are generally inconsistent to begin with? Guess which game is entirely based around its water physics? Yeah...I mean, I wanted to give this one the benefit of the doubt. It does try to avoid physics-based puzzles for the most part, and there are moments of clever ideas. But far more often, puzzles are just a matter of screwing around until you figure out what to do, at which point you actually have to get the game to cooperate long enough for you to do it.Honestly, I think the best part of the game may be the cave section before you get to the lab for the first time. There's a decent mix of platforming and puzzling there, and the puzzles can get pretty clever at times. I will go on record saying that I did play this first bit before purchasing the game and it led me to believe the game would be pretty decent (granted, I bought this years ago and never got around to playing it until just now, so...) but it goes downhill soon after. The puzzles in the factory all revolve around lava, the most dangerous of all the liquids in the game, and there's just a lot of dying in this zone... one of the protoplasm blobs literally requires you to just charge through some of the lava and hope you don't die. Every guide for this game has the same stupid solution. The orchard area is... alright. There's a lot less dying, the puzzles revolving around the blue and red goo and the drinker seed are pretty clever, nothing's too obscure to the point of being frustrating. But then the mine area... jeez, what the hell. This is where the game shows its worst side. There are fluros who are attracted to light. But they're really finnicky and basically impossible to control, it's hard to get them to go where you want them to. On top of that, the first half of the area you're mostly spending time in the dark, with the glowing liquid lighting up the area around you, but you still have to do a lot of maneuvering in the dark regardless. Then you get the dark fluro, which is even more finnicky and has a habit of jumping off in random directions to escape the light, instead of going where you want him to. One of the protoplasm blobs and the last puzzle in the mines involves guiding these guys and they are just pests. Ugh.I won't say this game is devoid of good design because it's about half balanced between the good and the bad, but there's more than enough of the bad to just make it a rather unfun experience... even in the good parts of the game there's still a lot of waiting around, the puzzles in general are rather tedious. I never felt inclined to keep playing the game much, and on top of that I switched computers in the middle of playing this game, which apparently doesn't cloud save, so I got to redo a good chunk of the game, which was great fun let me tell you... no...The graphics are okay, a little dated. The soundtrack and sound design is nice, but it's licenesed music so I can't give anyone on the development team much credit. The story is pretty thin until the ending, which is just... terrible...And there's really not much platforming here, either. A few puzzles have a little bit of platforming but it is definitely way more on the puzzle end of things. The game map is just a long string of puzzle rooms, too, there's almost no point to having these big open areas where nothing happens.I'm kind of rambly in this review, I guess, but I don't feel interested enough in this game to really sift through my thoughts. It's not very fun, it's kind of boring, occasionally frustrating, and only mildly entertaining at even the best of times. Definitely skip, you can do a lot better in both the puzzle and puzzle-platformer genres.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												A puzzle platformer based on fluid dynamics. The steampunk setting is a plus, but the controls are way too floaty and a constant source of frustration. Most of the puzzles are suitably hard and new gameplay mechanics keep on piling up until the very end. Shame that the numerous platforming elements leave a lot to be desired.

												It was actually pretty good until I got stuck on a puzzle that's based on pure luck it seems. I checked out some videos on YouTube to make sure I did everything right and yes, I did, but it still didn't work for me. Resetting the puzzle resets only the part I'm stuck at, not the entire puzzle. And I really don't feel like starting all over so I hope this gets fixed someday.It's a physics based indie puzzle game, by the way, A bit unpolished, but good none the less (provided the puzzles can actually be solved without them being based on luck).[Rating: 66/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This looked like a cool game, I love steampunk puzzle platformers but it was apparent from the beginning few puzzles that there were still bugs, puzzles weren't really puzzles because I was able to basically break them with a few quick movements like finding the correct sequence to flip levers so all are green when you can just slightly tap them and move out of the way. The colliders seemed to be off as well, as I was hanging onto a rotating lever after I had fallen off the platform and I was just stuck in a loop going round and round. Bit more testing/polishing is required for this game I think.			",77,8,0,15,3,0,5

												This is a great puzzle platformer with a unique liquid physics mechanic. The visuals are better than you'd expect from most platformers, you can tell they put a great deal of thought and effort into the design and feel of the game. Also the surround sound is a nice touch.The puzzles can be quite challenging & the Fluros, whilst not always doing what you'd expect, it's hard to not love the little guys. I'm only 2hrs in and still working my way through the 2nd area/level so there appears to be a decent amount of content, well worth the $15 imo.			",78,13,2,14,26,1,12

												Very interesting game, good weekend choice material. The puzzles are moderate, with a few exception here and there. I'm not really into puzzle games, but Vessel does the genre right. The use of physics with liquids to solve was cool, and the Fluros are fun to use. I like the slight upgrade system that was intergrated as I'm an RPGer, so I love to level up and upgrade equipment. The only bad part was it's over too quickly, I would have love to upgrade and buy more weapons and play more stages. All in all, a great indie IP.			",842,206,18,90,57,12,98

												Vessel. Not a ship. No, but it could be. A jug? A container? The developers were clearly trying to do something different with the title but didn't really come up with something very catchy. Not very memorable. A bit of 'could have done with more thought' you may say. But in reality this name is very fitting. Because like the lacklustre title that tries to be clever - the game is just the same way.What you have here is a good idea ruined by poor execution and very poor playtesting. Let's start with the good points. The notion of having fluidic buddies in a physics based puzzler is actually a very good idea. It's fresh and I can honestly say that some of the puzzles were truely very clever in how they used the mechanics. But at other times, they were really poorly designed and even riddled with bugs. I'm fairly sure that I solved a few puzzles due to glitches with the fluid-buddy AI and not something that the developers intended. Visually the game actually improves as you play further but even this improvement is marginal at best, the opening couple of levels are absolutely dire as you are faced with some very blocky environments which lack any atmosphere and has you platforming through some very generic areas. Things do improve further along and you will start to enjoy yourself by the end of the first 'level' but then things start to go very wrong. The creativity dips, the puzzles become mundane and then it improves again before ending the game with some horrendously vague and buggy puzzles. The developers even threw in a 'boss' at the end of the game and frankly I was stumped at what I should be doing because there was absolutely no indication of what the goal was. I checked youtube and even then the 'solution' seemed questionable and even for the person playing it didn't work very well. I tried the same thing and nothing happened... then... suddenly it glitches and did what I was meant to do. This wasn't the first bug either, I actually attempted to use the 'drinker' buddies and that totally broke the boss entirely. It wouldn't move. Moving on from here I figured out the final puzzle without any help, but the level kept breaking as the slime would trigger the gas needed for the experiment even when it wasn't touching the lava and in one instance both the lava and the slime triggers would not depress. Eventually I got everything working, I put the light-sensitive buddies with the red binary explosive in the top. They exploded when the light started to glow and then I fired the blue binary from my storage tank and.... nothing happened. All conditions met, but it bugged out.Moving on to my last gripe. The audio. I'm not kidding here when I say that it sounds like some of them were recorded on a cheap microphone in someones apartment. The wooden footstep sounds appear to have an echo like they were recorded at home and they are used for everything. Even when you are outside and running along tree branches it sounds like you're running along someones floorboarded kitchen. None of the music the game includes is really very fitting and it all adds to the already ham-fisted attempt at a steam-punk theme.Needless to say here folks, but this is a really poor, unfinished example of a puzzle game and it is a shame because the underlying mechanics were very clever. It's just that this game was pushed out the door before being ready. It needed someone to make some hard choices about what to cut out and what to remake. Or perhaps get some people who care about the quality of their work to do the audio and visuals.			",94,30,2,14,6,0,7

												All right, now here is a game with innovative mechanics. It's all about making these liquid golems called Fluros with various abilities to solve complex puzzles. It matters what the golem type is and what liquid it's made of, and you have to plan the interaction of their behaviors, so it's a rather complex game, but very satisfying when you pull it off. Expect a lot of liquid physics and ingenious puzzles. Of, and you can also upgrade your rig with extra storage tanks, nozzles and so on.For sheer innovation above and beyond the norm, I give it three out of four Fluros.			",1408,667,31,190,127,15,216

												I'd reccommend Vessel to anyone who likes puzzle platformers, however it does have a few flaws.The biggest flaw is the controls. They're very left-hand-heavy, being essentially those typically used by FPS games. While it does allow you to use the arrow keys for movement it seems like an afterthought, given all the other keys are clustered on the assumption of FPS-style use. While it works fine in a FPS, it doesn't work very well for a platformer, making the platforming a lot harder than it should be. The game itself does not provide a means of remapping the controls either, though it can be done by editing an INI file. The ending seems a bit lack-lustre to me, though that point is entirely subjective, so there might be some players who find it perfectly adequate.The visuals are just lovely. It's a pleasure to look at, and it really looks like an evolution of the 2D platformer. For that, and the fluid-based mechanics, the developers should be commended, and you should give them your money if you like this sort of game.			",264,70,3,19,40,3,51

												I only played the first 25 mins of this game but man it really has some issues. I'm using a pretty awesome laptop but I had frame rate issues. The water physics used in this game uses up a ton of performance. Platforming with such choppy frame rate is pretty irritating. The puzzles use these water clones a lot and getting them to not kill themselves is just frustrating. I love sidescrolling platform puzzles and I loooovvvve water physics but this game doesn't nail any of this. Graphics are also not all that impressive. Adunno, I'm not feeling it in this game.

Living liquid machines have overrun this world of unstoppable progress, and it is the role of their inventor, Arkwright, to stop the chaos they are causing. Vessel is a game about a man with the power to bring ordinary matter to life, and all the consequences that ensue. - Highly Recommended			",1018,195,27,62,74,1,90

												Vessel is a liquid physics-based puzzle platformer that has wonderfully gorgeous graphics, beautiful and memorable music, and a vibrant and interesting world to explore. Unfortunately, the core gameplay mechanic of using liquid physics to solve the game's puzzles doesn't feel like it was well implemented.The player must manipulate creatures spawned from various liquids in order to solve puzzles and advance in the game. However, the liquid physics engine seems rather imprecise and flaky, as liquids and creatures will occasionally behave in odd ways. This, in turn, makes some puzzles frustrating, as it is difficult sometimes to tell if you tried to solve a puzzle incorrectly, or if you had the right idea only to have it messed up by some weird anomaly caused by the physics engine. This is especially true (and highly irritating) in the game's latter stages.			",424,98,10,31,31,2,28

												this is an ok game. It keeps introducing new mechanics and elements throughout the game, but somehow still managed to be somewhat monotonous. Game is easy until the last section, which is oddly hard. It's difficult to controll the green liquid and get the fluros to go where you want them to in this section. it feels like you lose the control you've been perfecting throughout the rest of the game. It has a lot of slowdown. My computer isn't the best but it has run more complicated games than this just fine. It just has a lot happening with the liquid dynamics, and background and foreground all moving around. It made the game unplayable at points. I had to keep it at a really low res to play.  To summarize: Just another platform puzzler. Somewhat more unique than most. Not a very interesting story or character, though. A lot of 'upgrades' that don't really do much and feel like fluff. Lots of slowdown on ok computers. somewhat frusting at times because you don't directly control the solutions. Not worth 15$.			",73,27,2,12,3,0,3

												I was a little fooled by the trailer in thinking that this was more action than puzzler, but it turns out it's literally ""Move to next area, solve the puzzle, move to next area, solve puzzle"" rinse wash repeat. The puzzles/mechanics of the game aren't really all that great either, because the game literally feels like every other indie platformer I've ever played. At least the ones that I've played that I enjoyed had something in them that made them different or unique/interesting, instead of the same old ""here's interesting glob number 5, now use this to solve the next area"" over and over again. Suffice to say this game was a bit of a letdown. Had an semi interesting plot, but even then, I don't think even that merits a playthrough even.			",137,26,0,14,2,3,18

												For the most part, this game features clever puzzle design with interesting fluid mechanics.  Story doesn't really add much, but doesn't distract either.  Unfortunately once you reach the final puzzles, the game's mechanics and fluro AI stop following their own rules, and your well thought out solutions fall flat while dumb luck sees you though.  That leaves a bit of a sour taste to an otherwise enjoyable game.If Vessel 2 shows up in the near future and I can get it cheap, I might give it a second chance--but I can't help but feel a little burned by this one.

												Switch puzzle/physics games have always had a special place in my heart. You can usually find them piled next to things like my mental versions of political figures I dislike, or my memories of Star Wars Episode II--you know, things that I like to take out every so often when I’m bored in my head and burn just for fun. It took very little time for me to determine that Vessel would be added to this pile.Yes, I’m a little (maybe a lot) biased. I did just admit that I don’t like these kinds of games--but maybe let me explain a bit about Vessel and myself, and you may understand why.Vessel is inherently a game where you play as some nameless white guy who runs around and hits switches and pulls levers. I suppose he has some backstory of being some great inventor, but it doesn’t really matter to the game at all. I could have been playing as Calvin, the bag-boy from the local grocery store, and the game wouldn’t have changed much. In fact, I think I’ll just start calling the inventor Calvin. At least it makes *me* laugh.So Calvin is sitting in his lab, possibly reminiscing about his past achievements--the invention of a strange aquatic creature called “Fluorous”--when one of the Fluorous lock him out of his lab, leading him on an… “adventure” (by the loosest definition of the word)... where he must get back into his lab. Along the way, he’ll hit switches. He’ll open doors. He’ll pull levers and walk through more doors. If you’re lucky, you’ll get to spray water at something in random orders until, eventually, it might open another door. This inherently is the problem with most puzzle games in general but specifically Vessel--what is my motivation? What is my goal? Why do I care? I know nothing of the character, he isn’t that likeable, the Fluorous aren’t really interesting, and after 5 minutes I already know exactly the kind of game I’ll be playing.“Oh, but what of the water physics? They’re neat, aren’t they?” I suppose to some degree they are, but what does it matter? I’ve never understood why physics justify the existence of a game. Physics are simply that--physics. Companies sell physics engines, but gamers don’t *buy* physics engines, and most puzzle games are essentially just that--an excuse to display a physics engine. If I wanted physics, I’d walk onto my porch a drop a rock off my balcony. “Does gravity still work? Yep, it does.” Fascinating.One might argue that Vessel displays impressive, or at least “stylistic” artwork. To some degree, this is true--while the design did not appeal to me at all, I can recognize that work was put into the game’s visuals, lighting and layout. While the rooms are basically boxes with switches and buttons, they do try their best to appear interesting, with pipes running everywhere, cave-work in the background, and dynamic shadows/lighting. Yes, one might say that the game is “artistic” or “beautiful.” I could also tell you that the Sistine Chapel is “artistic” and “beautiful,” but I wouldn’t tell you that it makes the Sistine Chapel a good video game. I guess the biggest crux I have with Vessel and most puzzle games, is that I have to ask the question, “Why?” Why would I want to do this? If you stripped away the graphics--if you stripped away the lighting and soothing music--the actual game “experience” is equivalent to someone locking you in an empty white room filled with buttons and switches, and a PA box overhead says “you can leave when you figure out how to open the door,” and at that point it’s up to me find the correct order to hit all the switches and pull all the levers. Yes, there are generally clues, and yes it exercises problem solving--but so does a textbook--and ultimately at the end of the day, I’m just implementing procedural inputs into a linearly designed path that I have to follow to get to the next set of required procedural inputs and on and on until I can finally see the credits roll. Being a stubborn gamer, I usually do just that--however this time, I decided to break the mold and find my own escape from the crushing loneliness of the underground steam maze.Once I obtained the ability to create Fluorous seeds, I soon discovered that the game allowed you to create an infinite amount of them--better yet, it did not despawn the old seeds. Thusly, I set out to see how many seeds I could create before the game crashed. In truth, I had more fun swimming through my seed sea than any experience I had solving Vessel’s puzzles. After 15 minutes or so, the game crashed, and I finally had my freedom.			",227,43,1,59,4,0,21

												I was pleasantly surprised by Vessel.  Here is a platformer puzzle game with a unique mechanic and an interesting concept, but also balanced enough that it isn't too hard for the likes of me (see: Braid).  I first tried it at PAX, and was very glad to see it in the Humble Indie Bundle #6.You have a backpack/nozzle device that fires different types of liquid, and you have these unusual 'seeds' that make living 'Fluoros' out of liquid.  The type of seed determines what the Fluoro wants to do -- push buttons, seek light, attack things, etc.  Using combinations of these seeds and liquids, you navigate levels full of buttons and levers and such.  As you progress, you acquire new devices and can even upgrade your existing ones.  It's also cleverly both linear and non-linear -- you can often skip a puzzle and come back to it later, and you don't need to solve ALL the puzzles (but if you do there's bonus rewards that you can spend on upgrades).This game has a fun steampunk style, smooth animations, beautiful music, and lots of polish.  Even tiny touches like the sloshing sound of your backpack when you jump.  Everything meshed together well.  I liked it enough to get ALL the achievements.  It wasn't TOO short, but I wish it could be a little longer!			",272,77,3,25,24,1,69

												Wow, Vessel is utterly brilliant. What differentiates it from other side-scrolling physics puzzle/platformers is the amazing level of polish. The progression in difficulty and capabilities (at least so far, I'm only a few hours in to the game) is fast enough that you feel you're always getting or learning something new, without ever being overwhelming, and the puzzles have for me have had perfectly balanced difficulty, with plenty of challenge to keep things interesting while never giving me anything that got me stuck so long as to be overly frustrating.I don't find the movement to be as smooth and precise as some other games, but that's rarely important; the game doesn't much rely on doing the right thing with split-second timing but mainly on solving the puzzles. It still does have a bit of an action-y feel, though; squirting the water around is extremely satisfying.If you like puzzle-platformers at all, this is a must-play.			",328,163,10,53,60,2,65

												Challenging but rewarding game. Not as polished as some other puzzlers (Portal, Braid, Winterbottom) with its liquid physics system and the creature AI often behaving in unexpected ways but a very fun romp if you can handle that.			",282,155,2,52,18,2,51

												Quite a short game, but very fun. Some of the puzzles in it are straight forward, but others require a bit of thinking and I had to come back to some of them several times before finally working it out. Definitely recommend it if looking for something which is just good to play.			",218,122,5,17,27,3,41

												A puzzle game that has you messing around with different liquids and creatures (who are made out of those liquids) which each have their own properties that you must manipulate to solve the obstacles that are put in your way. It's not perfect - my computer would get somewhat bogged down on the larger puzzles where there are multiple creatures and liquids all running around , and I'm pretty sure that the official solution to the final boss doesn't involve getting thrown through both a grate and a wall - but overall I would say that I enjoyed my time playing this, and would recommend picking it up if you see it on sale.

												This was one of the more unique games I have played. The concept was original (to me anyway) and I enjoyed it very much. The story started out slow. At first I thought it was just another typical puzzle solving game. As the story picked up it got a lot more interesting. The steampunk style atmosphere was done very well. The puzzles were pretty easy at first but got harder, which is typical of any puzzle game. Overall it was very entertaining and enjoyable throughout. I would definitely recommend this game if you love puzzle games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the somewhat stilted looking character animation discourage you from getting this game. This is a really, really well done puzzle-platformer with some great mechanics that lead to puzzles that are inventive and challenging, yet not overly difficult. It has a lightly Metroid-esque skill and equipment progression as well as non-linear levels. Yet it does a great job of minimizing some of the typical annoyances of that type of game, with a sensible check-pointing system as well as a map system that lets you instantly warp between already visited sections of levels It's easily up there with Braid (thankfully without the stink of pretension about it) and Aquaria in terms of excellent 2D indie games that require some thought. I recommend it with little to no reservations if you're even slightly intrigued by what's shown in the trailer.PS. Has an *excellent* soundtrack.			",215,45,2,22,5,0,13

The puzzles are challenging enough that you could solve them with some thought and the Bosses are one of a kind. These cretures, they fluros, are a force to be reccond with. I give this game a 9/10, but only because it felt a bit short and the ending was a bit different to what I was expecting. Have a go, you have nothing to lose.			",111,61,1,5,2,2,4

												Do you want to make beings out of liquids that can do your bidding, then using them solve puzzles? If that sounds cool, then you should go play the demo, which is a good representation of the game as a whole, with the only real difference being there's much more of it. The puzzles range from easy to mind-boggling, though the game is weakest and can get frustrating when it requires precision since the physics aren't precise, though those points are mainly if you want achievements. Overall, a fun and pretty looking puzzle-platformer that took me about 13 hours to do everything.			",151,32,3,13,22,1,40

												Fantastic game! Beautiful art style and music which timed flawlessly with the progression, building as you understand more of each puzzle. The story is so subtle you don't even realize that it is being told. The hero is crafted so perfectly. He invokes both pride and empathy. And the puzzle's have a very nice learning curve but once you have the basics they aren't afraid to stump you and look back over all you've learned and your tools. This is deffinitly a game that needs to be experienced.9/10 only because the puzzle's can be a bit fiddly at times (though sometimes I was just doing it wrong!) Highly recommended.

												In this 2-D sidescroller you're.. some guy. And you're working on.. some thing. I'm sure this is explained at some point but I'm sick of reading character journals so screw the story. The focus is on these liquid AI machines. They can be made of water, lava, glowing nuclear ooze but what matters is they function as cheap hard labor workers; flipping levers and all that. Must fight urge.. to make a..  'wet back' joke. Anyways armed only with this liquid work force, a watergun and your wits you must bring a factory back online through a series of fluid-based puzzles. Did I mention this has a strong emphasis on liquids? It's certainly reminiscent of Bioshock; steampunk art style, water every where but this is more about the puzzles some of which can be very challenging near the end. It also seems they couldn't afford to do much testing near the end cause that's when it starts crashing a lot. Even so I still love it and no matter what I say try the demo even if you're not going to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely awesome platformer where the focus is on combining different fluros (minions) to help you get through obstacles with surprisingly different and creative semantics. The game is primarily a logic/puzzle platformer with a charming back story that gives you just enough background to make progress appealing.Pros:+ Great idea, well implemented and creative+ Difficulty ramps up evenly and the game introduces you to each mechanic gradually but without much hand holding, you have to make your own deductions and it works beatifully+ No bugs that I could find, except for last puzzle which seems a bit odd+ Music is ok, nothing to write home about+ Bosses that are challanging but still require logical thinking to beat not gimicksCons:- Not much of a replay value, but I didn't expect much anyway- Steam workshop not supported- Final workshop puzzle can be a tough nut to crack even if you do the right things but it works well enough that I can't complain too hard9.5/10 Love it, get it.

												1st time: yesPlatform: pcTime needed: 14 hoursI had a lot of fun playing this game, at first, then I enjoyed it less but it was still good. There are many good things about vessel so I think if you like puzzle platformer you will love this game. But to be honest I'd say the game was just good, nothing ""great"" as many reviews were saying. For example more often than not your first thing to solve is... figuring out WHAT you have to do. I mean you will not look for the solution but you will just try to understand what you should accomplish. That's not the best feeling in the world. That slows you down a lot, and gameplay (with fluid and not so perfect controls) will be sometime annoying. The very last puzzle was for me too annoying for example and eventually I checked on the web for some help because I was bored to just try random stuff while trying to figure out what I should aim for. Anyway the game is nice and could be interesting for many players. + Nice puzzles+ Nice atmosphere+ Cool 2d graphic+ Good soundtrack+ Early and mid game was fun + And also addictive- Less fun in endgame (I hated the very last puzzle)- Often you have to figure it out what's your goal more than just understanding how to do it- Almost useless upgrades- Imperfect commands - It felt a little too slow			",343,177,8,60,37,7,65

												Wow, Vessel is utterly brilliant. What differentiates it from other side-scrolling physics puzzle/platformers is the amazing level of polish. The progression in difficulty and capabilities (at least so far, I'm only a few hours in to the game) is fast enough that you feel you're always getting or learning something new, without ever being overwhelming, and the puzzles have for me have had perfectly balanced difficulty, with plenty of challenge to keep things interesting while never giving me anything that got me stuck so long as to be overly frustrating.I don't find the movement to be as smooth and precise as some other games, but that's rarely important; the game doesn't much rely on doing the right thing with split-second timing but mainly on solving the puzzles. It still does have a bit of an action-y feel, though; squirting the water around is extremely satisfying.If you like puzzle-platformers at all, this is a must-play.			",328,163,10,53,60,2,65

The puzzles are generally challenging without being impossible, the controls are functional, and the graphics are well done, though the sheer amount of liquid being calculated on screen will often result in large fps loss.Worth a few bucks and a weekend.

												Great soundtrack with emotion and ambiance.  Powerful story telling without use of narrative audio.  Kind of like a steam punk setting feeling, but instead of steam technology it is Fluoro (liquid based creature) technology.  Controls are smooth and mechanics are well done.  One of my favorite indie games of all time, I come back to it at least once a year.  I believe it should have received more attention and praise.  If you like indie games and/or puzzle platformers I recommend you try this game.  Would love for there to be a sequel or more games based on the same universe.  Gameplay and mechanics hooked my brain, soundtrack and story lifted my soul.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For a 2012 game I was pleasantly surprised that it ran natively in 21:9 (2560x1080) and without any hiccups smoothly at 60fps. Plus, it has flawless controller support, and a user-friendly save system.That aside, the game itself is wonderfully atmospheric, thematic, cute even, and super fun. Even the controller button prompts are thematic. The water physics are pretty and amazing. The puzzles themselves are clever and intuitive.  ",1040,422,35,136,76,9,136

The stuf you create while the story unfolds is just a true masterpiece, you just don't know until the very end and can't help but wonder. If you're gonna play it, don't watch videos, don't do tutorials it will totally ruin it... This should be played alone - offline from all messangers and connectivity (including the phone). Then you really enter into it.This is by far my best gaming experience - ever.			",27,3,0,1,4,0,2

												Bloody hell brilliant, perhaps one of the most well crafted endings in recent memory. A bit of a slog at times, but worth working through the sometimes finicky but very clever puzzles.Vessel challenges you to think abstractly in a way not many games do.			",423,111,7,31,20,6,32

												One of the best puzzle platformer metroidvania games I've played. Wish there was a sequel.			",261,159,1,50,34,0,45

												well, I've given this game another chance. so far so good although the lack of options for rebinding the inputs is quite a problem as far as controls go.			",199,32,4,3,2,0,17

												Great looking game and requires some brains. Not for Call of Duty or Madden fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I very strongly recommend this game. The story is enthralling, the music is soft, yet moving, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the gameplay is rather clever.Many of the puzzles are filled with plenty ""AHA!"" moments, and are guaranteed to make you feel like a total boss when you complete them.Buy this game.

												This is an awesome platformer/puzzler.  I am playing it through a second time after several years, still love it.  The physics are beautiful, music is appropriate for the environment, and the puzzles are challenging but fair.  My main complaint for this one is the jumping.  It's clunky and feels like it could've used more work.  There's not much to the story but I don't think it needs one.Even if it's not on sale this one is really worth it.			",250,55,2,37,7,1,10
