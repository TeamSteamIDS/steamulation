												The game Booster Trooper is a 2D indie shooter game.Price: 4,99 € / Summersale: 0,99 € (till 30th June 2014)I just recommend this game because it’s still pretty funny to play in single player mode.My personal experience (warning to my friends ♥) about the multiplayer is below!Graphic: Retro 7/10Sound: 9/10Controls: 10/10+ And I want to add it is pretty funny how the enemies scream when they die +Achievements: 260 achievements which spam you lolI mean I got 52 achievements just from one hour testing the game automatically.My experiences with MULTIPLAYER:A friend of me and I wannted to play Booster Trooper together. So we started the game and WANTED to look for a server. But there have been no servers listed. The status “Refreshing server list” never ended. Sadly.So I clicked “Host Match” and created a game with players and bots but my friend couldn’t join me. Good thing we had a Skype-Call and talked together about it during my fight with just bots.I left the game and told him to open a game but I also couldn’t join him. We found some discussions about this problem. The Servers are down since years and there is no support anymore. It's so annoying.... WHEN THERE IS SAID IN THE STEAM SHOP THE GAME IS MULTIPLAYER AND COOP THERE SHOULD BE ANY SERVERS! -.- And it’s not the only game with that problem.Another criticism from me: The bots seem to be kinda stupid. lol Or at least in my games they are sometimes hanging at a box and aren’t able to jump. Or they are confused running on one place.  X’D Also I played “Capture the flag” and I think the bot enemy wasn’t even able to get the flag or the bot doesn’t wanted to get it… I don’t know… it just ended 24:0 for me. And yeah it’s cool to win but not if you have the feeling the enemy is playing with his♥♥♥♥♥on the keyboard. o:Add: If you play ""Capture the flag"" against more bots (e.g. 11) it works. Seems like they are just 1vs 1 stupid. :cAlso the ""Pause"" button seems not to work.Anyways if you want to have a bit fun alone or just to collect achievements – here you have a cheap game. Or maybe you have someone who plays the game with you in local via home network.Local Multiplayertip:1.The two most popular home network types are wireless and Ethernet networks. My friend and me used a wireless network. So your friend needs: the name of your Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and the WLAN password.2. When both of you are connected to the same WLAN you start the game.3. You click: „Multiplayer“ and „Host Match“ with the settings you like.4. ATTENTION:The number of players seems to be bugged in this game, because if you choose 12 players and 10 bots (what would be logically for playing with one friend) theres shown -6 free slots for your friend and he won’t be able to join ya. So I noticed from trying it’s better to choose 12 players with 4-5 bots when I play with one friend. 5. When you made your settings you start the match.6. Your friend clicks: „Join match“ and now he will be able to see your game with a free slot. He just clicks on your game and will connect.			",224,60,10,20,8,0,13

												Booster Trooper lands in the Steam store front to help fill in a gap we probably didn't even know we were missing. Allow me to take you back to the year 2002, when a little known game called Soldat was released. Soldat utilized a unique 2D platformer game design, and still carries somewhat of a cult following to this day. What Soldat lacked at the time (and still today) is a strong aesthetic background. Don't get me wrong, it's a shareware game and for the price (free) it's a great value. Fast forward to 2010, and the DnS Development team has stepped in with a beautiful solution.Like other games in the 2D jetpack-platformer-shooter-deathmatch-whateverelse genre, Booster Trooper gives you control of a soldier that has the ability to move in pretty much any direction with the assistance of rocket pack. WASD controls will get you around the map along with a mouse controlled reticle that can be aimed wherever you please. The keyboard inputs seem to be well balanced, but I could never quite get the mouse sensitivity to a level that felt just right. I also lost track of the reticle during some of the more intense fire fights, which may just be a color setting for most, but I definitely needed some sort of contrast adjustment to keep it from disappearing into the carnage.As I mentioned before, the biggest thing that DnS Development has done with this title is raise the aesthetics bar of the genre in a big way. The backgrounds and map detail are incredibly gorgeous. The layering effects of everything make it feel like you are playing in a completely 3D environment that will probably leave you yearning to explore every nook and cranny that you can't actually get to. The character models themselves leave something to be desired with their bland and fairly static animations, but luckily this isn't all that noticeable unless you're wandering around by yourself. The multitude of ordinance animations and blood effects are done with a surprisingly high level of quality for each player and weapon, which is especially true when you consider the scale of everything on screen.Almost every single piece of audio included with Booster Trooper seems to have been designed to match the games intensity and in most cases it might even kick it up a level or two. The music selection has a great tempo, and if nothing else is probably the developers way of attempting to rock your eardrums while you wait for the firefight to take over. Weapon sounds maintained a slight hint of realism, but mostly sounded like guns from any movie set a century or two from present day (and understandably so, the guys are hovering around in jet-packs like it's a normal mode of transportation). No audible taunts from what I was able to hear, but the handful of screams and deathly grunts when someone is finished off give the characters a little personality and round out the audio set nicely.Even if you're a pro in this area of gaming, the number of weapons available to you would take at least a few dozen games to get a basic handle on the entire set. The inclusion of a single player (bot practice) mode is something I always appreciate because I don't have to drop into a game and have my butt handed to me for the first 46 matches while I figure out what gun I'm holding. Multiplayer mode doesn't really have a leveling or upgrade system unless you count leader boards, but if that appeals to your domination appetite it's nice to know that you can rule the top spot for as long as you want. All things considered, it's difficult to dock points for the little things that need only a tiny bit of polishing when DnS has stepped up in such a big way for almost every aspect of the game. If you've been a long time fan of this game type, or even if you're new to the party and are simply looking to test the waters, Booster Trooper is a solid choice.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												Holy daaaayum. Booster Trooper. This game would be hella fun if there was an online community. The sixteen hours I have put into this has purely been single player. It may not look much, but the side scrolling action arena that is on offer here is bloody fun. Fast paced, action packed style gameplay with a little bit of platforming involved. There is plenty of different weapons...but you are going to want to go with the mini-gun, my god, this weapon is siiiiiiiiick.  I found myself getting kill streak after kill streak with this thing. The regular rifle is good, but jeez, I was actually shouting and jumping in my seat with enjoyment while playing.Other reviews seem to slate Booster Trooper, but I reckon if you get a few of your friends playing it, you will have a blast.

												This is at its base a pretty fun game - it plays pretty smoothly, especially once you get the knack of jump boosting, the weapons give you a good range of tactical/playstyle preference options, while not perfectly balanced they are all viable options with benefits and weaknesses. The game modes cover all the basics - Capture the Flag, base defense, team death match, free for all, but there is nothing really innovative here.The arenas are graphically fairly diverse, but probably most of them are a bit too similar tactically, while others are a bad idea if you plan on having bots due to the limited routes and the poor AI pathing - if set to low levels you should be able beat up on the AI with its slow reactions and poor aim, if set hard the bots are pretty challenging as long as they don't get stuck on scenery, or failing to find a route to the target when playing CTF or base defense.Generally I wouldn't buy this to play against the AI, and decent random online games are rare nowadays, but if a group of friends wanted a fun lightweight action game to play against each other regularly, this would be a decent option.

												Booster Trooper is an alright arcade style shooter. It has bot support and without it it wouldn't be a game at all because multiplayer is dead. It has several game modes and maps plus a lot of achievements to earn but there's really not much to offer apart from that. After trying everything out (which wouldnt take more than a hour) you will most likely put it on the shelf and never play it again. I recommend avoiding this game unless you are an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥.			",689,185,22,64,77,7,106

												The future of platform shooting? ♥♥♥♥ no. This game is a decent 2D Multiplayer sidescroller. There isn't much of a community (according to steam charts it peaked at 6 players on 8/4/2015, which was 2 days before this post ( http://steamcharts.com/app/27920 )) So unless you are getting a 4 pack (or 3) you won't be seeing much multiplayer action.Now I got this game during a sale for $2.24 for a 4 pack ($.74 for 1). At that price, this game is worth it. This game is definitely not worth $5. It is decent, but not $5 decent.This game needs a few fixes and improvements for it to be $5 decent, but it is not far off.Pros:- Variety (15) of maps very well made maps- Good, fast paced combat- Multiplayer- 4 gamemodes- Up to 12 players at once Cons:- At first the jumping mechanic can be annoying, but once you figure it out it is pretty easy. If you hit jump (space) right before you hit your jetpack (w) you fly up really quickly.- The camera can be a bit shaky which can be annoying. This seems to happen when you move the aiming reticle quickly. - The bots (at least at normal difficulty, haven't tried the others) can be a bit stupid at times. On occasion they will get stuck in places.- There is no way to have a rotation of maps or gamemodes (the latter I don't really mind, but the former I do, it gets boring playing on the same map and it is a pain to have to restart the server every time you want a map change)- For whatever reason you can't access the score menu when the match ends. This is minor, but I still find it a pain.- There aren't many weapons at all. 5 primary weapons + 1 that really powerful weapon that spawns on the map that you only get for 30 seconds. There are also only 2 secondary weapons and only 2 types of grenades.- There are default servers, but it seems you have to Port Forward if you want to make your own.			",169,16,7,12,11,7,26

												This game is the worst possible thing that could happen to the *Soldat* game. Seriously, back in old days, with some ragdoll ultrasmall pixelated bloody violence, Soldat was an 11/10 game providing huge loads of fun, bullets, and Rambo arrows into your face, it had everything but a proper multiplayer platform. Once I've seen THIS game I immediately thought that this is proper Soldat clone on steroids with graphics, 3d, nonflash and steam multiplayer, but is it so?+Sound work is the only good thing-Clunky 3D graphics-low amount of weapons and most of the weapons just useless-pickup weapons too OP and one-shot everything in the range of sight-comparing to the soldat where you've been dismembered 24/7 the blood was flowing and the screams and gunshots never stop, this game with its cartoonish blood clouds has kindergarten level of violence-dead servers - dead multiplayer - servers are either down 24/7 or empty because nobody plays this crap-buggy game - you can get no damage from the rocket that exploded in melee distance but can get killed by the same rocket that exploded 5 meters away-small map pool-sometimes the game crashes for no reason-unreasonable high price for what you get-no steam cards It's not even close to the old flash Soldat game, I think you could at least try, you guys had like 10 years or so. Do not buy it, I think 1 youtube video would be enough.			",2056,824,59,208,221,16,291

												Really entertaining multiplayer sidescrolling gun blasting mayhem! Except that there is no one playing it. If you can get your friends to play it with you, it's a blast. Does have a bot support too, but beating bots gets really boring, really quick.You choose a main weapon, secondary weapon and a grenade you start with. Then you rampage across the map, blasting your guns, throwing grenades, collecting power-ups and defeating the lower beings. The screenshots pretty much tell the idea. Different maps and different guns call for different play styles. Use of jumps and the limited time of jetpacks can make you a very hard to hit target and a fast predator, or you stand your ground and give all you've got with your minigun that doesn't work in the air.

												8/10. This game is pretty much awesome. BUT you need to have friends to play with. AND . . . and this is a big AND . . . you need to get some sort of VPN app like Evolve (it's free) to be able to play over the internet. Otherwise, you're likely to experience issues connecting to someone hosting the game. When I first got this game, I only played it for like 10 mins against bots then spent like an hour trying to figure out how to get a multiplayer game going with my friends. We eventually gave up and the game sat untouched for a year. Then we discovered Evolve and tried Booster Trooper with it. And it finally WORKED! It was like finding a key to a golden chest and inside was this awesome multiplayer game!			",329,76,11,37,29,4,40

												I bought Booster Trooper at launch since it seemed like it could be a fun game. At the time, there were not many platform shooters, Apparently, I was not the only one thinking it could be a good game, because quite some people bought the game. I can tell since my rare achievements list only contains Booster Trooper achievements and I'm quite sure it will take a long time (forever) to get different achievements from other games. Why, you say? Simply, because apparently most of the players did get a few achievements, but never returned to the game. I used to love the rare achievements on my profile page but obviously, it's not that fun for me anymore.Booster Trooper is an online platform shooter. Sadly, there's no one playing the game anymore so you've got the option to play vs bots. Gameplay is all pretty basic but instead of jumping you use a jetpack to get higher up the platforms. There are multiple weapons like; minigun, sniper rifle, pistol.... you get the picture. There are some special weapons and powerups to pick up. Graphically, the game looks pretty awful, even at launch. It did not bother me much personally but it simply does not look good. Overall Booster Trooper is an OK game, which can only be recommend buying it together with some buddies, weren't it for the fact the price tag of the game is 5 bucks (4 pack: 15,-) which is way too much. Also, there are better games of the same genre like The Showdown Effect.  ",1619,637,54,225,180,17,281

												Booster Trooper is a 2d shooter platform.I will compare this game to Crash Comando from the PSN network because It whas my first game in this genre.And I had a really good time with this game offline and online with my friends.These a very unique games if you ask me because you did not see them very often on consoles as on PC so far I can remember.It's a totally new way to play arena shooter if you ask me.Controlers are really to get used to becuase of the 2d platform gameplay.This game support deatchmatch as capture the flag options.It's really fun to play online with friends if you like or just local single player with bots.There is a jump option only you will use your jetpack most of the time only you have a limited boost so this is very tricky sometimes,You have many weapons in this game like, Shotgun, Machine Gun, Mini Gun, Rocker Laucher and Sniper Rifle to choose as your starting weapons.And in-game you can vind bonus weapons for extra firepower for short amount of time.These are the granade and the plasma gun.There are many stages to explore and they look very good.If I compare these stages to crash comando's that is you only have 1 big stage. Crash commando's has the option to hav 2 rooms in every level. So this gives more space and sometimes less spamm killing in stages.Still it's not a really big thing only I wanted to mension this.Games has a good gameplay with some really nice beating soundtracks.It's shame there are not many service to play ... still there are some services online.I purchased this game for 79 cent... and now I know the 4 pack is also for 2,50 ... next time I will buy the 4 pack.It's a super cool game to play alone or with your friends online.It's a fun and good game and for the money.... this is a bargain.I give it a 7/10 score.

This is a good thing though, because I loved Soldat.  It's deffinitely a good game to pick up for some intense shooter action, more so if you're into side scrolling multiplayer games (Terraria anyone?).+1			",387,44,16,41,17,0,47

												I never thought I'd give a game a bad review....Booster Trooper. Screw this game. I'll keep this short and simple.1. My dung is worth more than this game.2. The pause button doesn't even work.3. No splash damage exists. My sniper rifle is the exact same thing as the rocket launcher.4. Why do they even charge this game? F2P  games make this look like a high school project5. Multiplayer=down.6. Have serious fun playing with bots.7. I'm crying right now about how bad this is.8. This couldn't even pass as a N64 game.3/10- Playable. That wasn't a compliment.No one should suffer the torture of Booster Trooper. I'm telling you this as a WARNING, NOT A REVIEW.

												Booster Trooper is best described as a side scrolling shooter. It features both single-player (versus bots) and online multi-player. It has 23 maps, 11 weapons, and 4 game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and Destroy The Beacon.Unfortunately the best part of it was the multi-player which has long since died. It has 260 achievements, but it is a very long and mindnumbing grind whether you idle or not. Some of the achievements don't even unlock properly or have correct descriptions!5/10			",512,241,7,64,46,5,73

												Really fun game filled with action and guns and many intersting 3d maps in one amazing 2d platformer. At this price you should defintely buy it. They only critisism I have about this game is the inability to upgrade or unlock new guns. I would love to be able to upgrade guns and give them special abilties and more damage etc. but this game is still addictive and really fun and even has multiplayer and singleplayer!

												Booster Trooper is a simple arcade action 2D platformer that is primarily a multiplayer casual competitive game.  The game does include a single player bot mode that will allow you to practice your skills and the game includes a nice variety of game settings, 24 different maps, and supports both the Steam Overlay and widescreen resolutions.  The music design is standard military fare, nothing particularly notable, but fitting and not too annoying.  Unfortunately, the games shooting sound effects, while somewhat realistic, really get repetitive quickly.  In addition, your player characters are rather weak, often resulting in as many deaths as kills.  For a bargain title though, the game is a competent although not particularly memorable entry, and worthwhile purchase for anyone who is looking for a quick diversion at a budget price.

												Booster Trooper is in the vein of games likes SpeedRunners or The Showdown Effect in that it's a side-scrolling, multiplayer versus game. But where some games have a fun gimmick like the race of SpeedRunners or have a more finely tuned combat system and shiny graphics like The Showdown Effect, Booster Trooper has neither of those things.It's an FPS in side-scrolling form, which admittedly can be a lot of fun. However the graphics are good but not great, and the gameplay is smooth but unremarkable. It's not a poorly made game just nothing really stands out about it. Couple that with virtually no one playing it anymore, and you can see why it really isn't worth adding to your game library.			",415,109,1,44,15,3,28

												Booster Trooper can be fun in small doses, but there are many game flaws that could be easily improved upon to make it worth playing longer. Jet pack fuel is probably my biggest gripe because it's difficult to make perfect platform jumps in the heat of battle and most of the time you end up missing and falling to the ground making fighting unspectacular. If they eliminated the fuel so you could free roam, it would put focus where it is needed the most--combat.As it stands, it's not worth more than an hour or two of actual game time even with the massive number of available achievements.

												For those who are familiar with the free game Soldat, you can already tell from the images and trailers that Booster Trooper is an exact copy of soldat but put into a 3Dish jacket. This game is fun to play offline with bots, but I'm afraid that there are no multiplayer servers whatsoever. I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that there's lack off mulitplayer servers and the bots doesn't always seem to be smart. You'll get tired quickly playing on your own. There is no way (from what I've googled) that you can download custom maps or mods for you to play with.			",256,22,8,23,16,3,39

												This game is unplayable. Cannot play in single player or online. Have to alt f4 out once it locks itself in a loop.Edit: After switching to death match from CTF I was able to play single player enough to unlock 100 achievements in a few hours.			",674,170,29,114,120,3,131

												Its a fairly simple run and gun game. Just pick up and play.Pros:Very easy to playHelps with your inner blood lustKill bots to your desire, and teabag themCan't blame the lag when you dieI got it for .75 cents so I ain't even madCons:Bots are really terribleYou die really easily (isnt this the future? where are the shields? we wasted all our technology on rocket boosters...)Not a very big online community, but it can easily be avoided with having friends to play with you8/10 would rocket boost again, and at least its better than that 2006 sonic the hedgehog game...
