												Since Exodus From the Earth is on sale once again, I guess it would only help people's decision out if I posted this. The moment that you start playing, the first thing you'll notice is how bland the graphics are and how bad the voice acting is. To it's credit, however, it came out almost six years ago, but the voice acting goes unexcused. So it's only right to give it the benefit of the doubt and ignore first impressions. Unfortunately, that's the least of the game's problems.What I noticed throughout is how odd the audio is. For some reason, there's this small static that occurs and it's more noticeable when you're wearing headsets. After a while, I got over it, but then comes another problem. Pressing the ""Esc"" key to go to the menu will play another song. Unfortunately, this song will interrupt the game's current music and continue to play after exiting back. Which is a shame, cause it can ruin the environment of your current mission when you want a break. Not to mention it can get tiring to listen to a bland voice making a ""dramatic"" speech. As well as having that speech play over soldiers shooting at you.The gameplay is generic. It's the typical First-Person Shooter genre you would expect, but I have some issues. In many instances, the enemies have abnormally accurate weapons. I understand that this story takes place in the future, but even on easy mode, I still have to be careful, or I lose a chunk of my health quickly. Exodus also enjoys recycling levels. You'll eventually ask yourself ""Wasn't I here before?"" And even realize that they recycled a crate depot three times (And you will notice it, as it is just a complex maze.) To add on to that, the four last levels on the preview screenshots do not exist in this game so there goes the defense of variety. At least there's vehicle driving, but poor controls somewhat cripple it and only two locations of the game have this. Be warned that you can stuck in several areas, as well. That includes the vehicles and the straight-forward shooting.The game also has stealth sections. I wouldn't mind and probably have enjoyed it, but because of how poorly programmed it is, scientists will spot you, even when they're a floor above you. You can't stop them, either. Once they try to sound the alarm, killing that man would only grab the guards' attention, anyway. You can always restart through save files to see if you can get through a level without getting caught, but I've tried so many times, that I stopped caring and progressed through brute force. Alerting the guards will welcome you with poor A.I. that won't go through doors to attack you and will even refuse to move at all, so you at least have that advantage.The story is difficult to follow. And I say this, because the voice acting is so bad and the game is written like a poorly translated script. From what I understand, that is the case as it was made in Russia, but that's still no excuse. Of course, there are even PDAs found throughout the game. Some are translated fine, some have awful typos, and then there are ones that appear to be typed as a joke. Almost like ""0mg u guiz g2g 2 dis party in teh office!11!"" Very amusing, but the script is still a damn mess. And what do you come to realize the story was all about, once you understand it? A generic plot, really.To Exodus from the Earth's credit, there's some unique puzzles and challenges that aren't too punishing, such as the last level, that can be fun, but they're not too frequent, either. If you want to try it out of curiosity of a obscure game, go right ahead. But overall, this game had way too many poor design choices and terrible programming mistakes. It's lengthy and difficult, I'll give it that. But it will only make you wish you were playing a better First-Person Shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why is there no option to rate the game as ""just about average"" instead of just ""Recommended"" and ""Not recommended"" ? because this game is just that. I can't say it's horribly bad, but i also can't say it's great either.First i had to combat errors even before i actually started shooting things:http://rejzor.wordpress.com/2013/12/28/how-to-fix-exodus-from-the-earth-game-steam/...because the game refused to run. After i fixed it, i had to manually assign the UAC to the game EXE so i could even use settings. And then i could actually play the game.Graphics are decent, sound is ok, gameplay is decently long, a lot of levels are quite nice actually (especially the first part of the AX planet). Weapons, while there is sort of a selection of them, some are mostly useless. Basically you just rely on a rifle with basic zoom and you aim for the head. All other weapons are either too clumsy or infective to even bother with them. Enemies are not the brightest out there, but sometimes they make surprising moves and they are often crazy accurate across wast distances.The main problem with the game is that you're basically fighting like 5 enemy types through the entire game. And most of those are just generic humans. Next problem is the way game feeds the story to you. It tries to do the conspiracy and evil corporations thing, but just doesn't manage to give you the right feel of it. You know, the Deus Ex sort of feel for the story, conspiracy, twists and stuff. Here, you sort of just tag along the story, because you just have to progress further and that's it.Anyway, the game is ok, if you like old school shooter where you have to tackle basic problems like flipping switches and stuff, look for access cards and shoot bad guys. It's not excellent, but it's ok enough if you don't have anything else to play.Btw, the last 4 screenshots in the store page don't exist in-game. I've just finished the game and i've never seen those maps/buildings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoy old school FPS, but this game was very frustrating. The recoil is ridiculous, enemies spawn out of nowhere and shoot you from across the map, and it's often confusing as to where to go or what to do. Getting through the game requires constant use of quick-save/quick-load, because you'll constantly die. The only things it has going for it are decent graphics, level design, and game length, but they don't compensate for the awful gameplay. Unreal 2, Chaser, and Red Faction are far better old school FPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a good old-time feel to it, however it is so unforgiving that it's more of a chore to play than it is fun.  You will find yourself reloading over  and over and over just to get through every battle.  The enemy keeps popping up from all around you, and only  a shot or two is enough to kill you (and they hardly ever miss - even when shooting from places where you can hardly see them because they are so far away).I like the atmosphere of this game, and I really want to enjoy myself, but it is  very frustrating.  If you don't mind constant reloading, and you like the old-time FPS games like Chaser and Alpha Prime, then you might want to pick this game up when it's on sale.  But, if you don't like to get really frustrated when playing, then you should probably avoid this one, and go with one of the other games in this genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chairman Mao Zedong wrote in his essay ""On contradiction"" that there is a big gap between theory and practice that needs to be solved through better understandment of historical materialism. Here is a good illustration of Mao's theory :Theory :Half-Life + Deus Ex + Ambition = New Masterpiece in the FPS GenrePractice & Result :Half-Life + Deus Ex + Parallax Art Studio = An FPS that suffers from bad art & level design and poor gameplay mechanicsConclusion :If you're about to make a game that tries to be Half-Life and Deus Ex don't design the futuristic universe with fluorescent colors that make everything looks cheesy as if the product was a toy made for 3 years old child. Also, robotic behavior should only apply to robots and not humans : ubermensch punishing and unforgiving shooting skill, no pain reaction, bad voice over -- who came up with these ideas in the first place?!That said, I am the one responsible... what was I expecting from a developer who made Liquidator (2006) and Utopia City (2006)...Rating:4.0			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've gotten up to planet xr and its pretty neat so far!I can't say its a great game. but if you've liked these games, give this a try:-chaser-timeshift-sin-sin episodes-alpha prime-ubersoldier ii-necrovisionand other such cheapy, guilty-pleasure, low budget european shooters, you'd love this. the voice acting is deliciously cheesy, the action is glitchy but intense.pros:-like hotline miami with quicksaves-like chaser meets timeshift without the time shifting-pretty fun little game-if you love cheap trash games, you'd love this-looks about as good as source engine games-funny voice acting-guns are punchy, have lots of recoil, but you get used to themcons:-enemies do the same damage to you as you do to them-chaser-like level design-sometimes leaves something to be desired-the vehicle section is pretty dumb-obviously a dub of another languageI would only recommend if you enjoy playing cheesy games and can see past their faults because you just enjoy trash. if you have actual tastes in games that can't see past a bit of trashy games now and then, then by all means skip this one. but i was pleasantly surprised by this game, since I played past the underwater levels in chaser and that was pretty engaging.

												Imagine if you took Half Life 2 (A game released 4 years BEFORE this one) and stripped out the interesting story, the neat premise, the great voice acting, the flowing and sprawling levels, the vehicles, and frankly any good AI. You'd get a game about twice as good as Exodus from the Earth. Seriously folks, if you're hungering for an FPS, pick something else. Even on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely dated 'stealth' game.I use the term lightly as you're not really rewarded for stealth, you fight the same amount of enemies regardless.The stealthy way is definitely the way forward, as you simply take less damage.Hit detection may be way off when standing, running or burst firing a weapon, but trigger control and crouching seem to eliminate most of these issues.If anything, the game isn't challenging, it's more of a 'react quickly enough to enemies spawning' than planning assaults.If you wish to buy the game, be aware the storyline is lacking. It's there...sort of.

												This game has it all, hilarious cutscenes and voiceacting, great weapons, challenging combat, and it even looks halfway decent.  If you need to wash the aftertaste of dull AAA FPS out of your mouth then think of Exodus as the sequel to CHASER.  There's a shotgun that fires three shells at once and ejects them all in different directions as the enemy's corpse slides across the floor frictionlessly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible game. I got about 3/5 the way through and a bug has stopped me going any further. A gate won't open. I googled, and the only single walkthrough online says I should be able to pass. Youtube doesn't have one user who has made vidoes of all the levels. The Steam forums are almost empty. There really is not player enthusiasm for this game. I bought it for £1.60 and would not have payed anymore. I think every level I played so far had at least one bad point. A place where you have to hit F9-quick-load, over and over again. If not just one place many places where you had to use it lots. Using F9 maybe a hundred times to get through a level is not right.The graphics are old and no better than Half-Life 2. The AI can see through walls and so can attack the moment you poke you head out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The voice acting was shotty at best, but it was definately worth a playthrough if you're wanting something that feels old school, but enough going for it to keep you playing til the end.

Everything has invisible barriers around it, sometimes 10ft around things.Summary: Its Half Life but with a dull lead character (Yes Gordon the mute has more charisma), garish & shiny graphics, awful voice acting, glichy sound, messy controls, a dreary mundane sounding story and a ton of other bad stuff. Play Half Life instead.  3 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: August 10, 2015
												I got this game because, just like another crown jewel, Alpha Prime, it seemed to offer an old-school Red Faction-like feeling. Since I don't actually care much about game reviews(not because I don't trust or believe what people say about a game but because I believe a review is, just like ones opinion about a game, a matter of taste), I ignored the general impression and I decided to give it a try. First thing, the graphics are not that good nor that bad. I think generic would be the right word for this. Now, I don't usually rate a game for it's graphics and I am not gonna start now but if this is important to you, keep in mind that I wanted to try this game because it had the look-n-feel of old FPS games even if it was released in October 2008. In fact, everything about this game feels generic. The sound effects and the soundtrack are OK but nothing special. The voice acting is not necessarily bad but it's kinda weird. Everytime I played this game I had the feeling voices aren't embedded in the cutscenes or the game itself but applied over. If this doesn't ring a bell, I guess I could say the voices sound like a 70's studio record. But this isn't the main problem.. Actually I'm not sure there is a main problem. The game seems to be a bit ""bipolar"" (if this can be said about a game) when it comes to level design and combat consistency. While some levels are quite nice and well done, some are poorly designed and many times make you wander around trying to find your way through or trying to find some well hidden lever or button. Of course, this is not as easy as it seems since usually you are under heavy fire and enemies will keep on coming until you press the button or pull the lever or exit the room. Unless of course the level is well done and has a nice design. In this case chances are you'll find almost no bad guy so you'll have time to admire every detail. Another annoying thing is that there is almost no enemy variation. You only have 4-5 enemy types and you'll encounter them all in the first part of the game. And they are all generic. There is the light armor guys with rifles and shotguns, the heavy guys with rockets and grenades, the sniper dudes and a few more. And while they are so generic, the are very aggressive and accurate. They rarely miss and they do a lot more damage than you can do to them. All these make the game quite frustrating but they do however make a decent gameplay and offer a challenging combat, something that's to be expected from an old school game. There is a big selection of weapons you can choose from and, just like in every old school game, you can carry lots of them with you. The story can be quite interesting even if, just like many things in this game, it's very generic, but only if you manage to get around the odd voice acting and the oddly written (or badly translated) PDA messages. Unfortunately, the game is a bit too long for what it offers so even if the story may seem interesting, it's not enough to make you wanna finish this game. In the end, Exodus from the Earth isn't a really bad game and can actually be entertaining if you like old school FPS games, but it fails to offer anything new to the genre.  I bet you won't regret getting it on sale for 80% off but still, you shouldn't expect much. 6/10 potatoes and a NO from me, altough I wish I could give it a MEN since I can't actually give it a YES nor a NO.

												Even on easy the game became frustratingly hard, very early on.  I had to play this game in god mode from almost the beginning.  The English voice acting was cheesy at best and the story line (although it had promise) became predictable and very generic. The level layout and designs had very few real issues, but were bland for the most part. The game for me has no redeeming qualities, I’m only glad that I bought it when it was on sale.
