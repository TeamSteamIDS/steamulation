												Don't judge this game by its combat system. It's serviceable. Ok. Nothing at all fantastic. Reminds me a bit of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker but actually marginally fun. But that's all just filler. My recommendation is to level stealth and pistols because they're absurdly overpowered and you can get through the game very quickly with them.The real gameplay is the dialogue system and your interaction with characters. It's really something else. Every dialogue choice is timed and you have to have you options picked before the other character finishes speaking. There are no awkward pauses between lines and it all flows like good dialogue in a film. That might sound like you don't have control or you won't be able to react fast enough but that is not true. Your options are presented in a succinct but clear way. Usually they are just provided as a single-word description of your overall tone that allows you to quickly process your choices and decide how you want to respond. Sometimes your choices don't have obvious consequences and how the player character acts may catch you off-guard, but those situations are very rare.But as important as your breath of choices in these encounters with characters are the consequences of them. While the game follows a somewhat fixed revenge story your relationship with each character will change your experience of that story hugely. There is a multi-layer conspiracy for you to uncover and if you do not play your cards right there will be parts of it and roles played by characters that you won't even realise you missed. Everyone has secrets and your relationship with them will affect what you learn about them.And that is not to say you should buddy up with everyone. Having characters hate you can be to your advantage. A poor relationship with one character may actually endear you to someone they dislike. Making them angry may cause them to make poor decisions that benefit you.There's a huge depth to the story and it really does react to everything you do. Characters will reference your past decisions and attitudes and it will shape the details of the story you find yourself in. Your choices matter. Your relationships matter. That is what Alpha Protocol is all about.			",358,134,4,27,21,4,54

												Without a doubt the best modern spy game I've heard of. I'm not a fan of wordiness, so here's the basic rundown, pluses and minuses and stuff.+ brilliant stealth system. People notice gunshots (but not silenced ones), dead bodies, themselves being shot... loads of stuff+ skill customization is wonderful. By end-game of my stealth build I could walk into a room invisible, kill 5 people and walk out without anyone seeing me. Leeroy Jenkins run: kick in the door, empty the clip, everyone's dead before the alarm's raised.+ boss fights were pretty good. They all had features to make them unique, and it was fun to fight all of them except non-spiked Brayko+ dossiers were super useful, both as flavor-text and in-game. I loved pausing before the end to read all the stuff I'd learned about everyone+ cutscenes were well-done. Most were skippable (BRILLIANT) and I loved Mike's various responses to things+ special mention for letting me Punch Marburg as a dialog option+ also: ""refuse"" ""kiss my♥♥♥♥♥quot; ""♥♥♥♥ off"" is the best set of options I've ever encountered.+ There were so many things I could do. The devs coded in a lot of secrets and stuff- dialog choices could've been more descriptive. I wasn't expecting Mike to insult someone when I pressed Suave.- I wish Sis got more involvement in the game- there were an unfortunate amount of glitches, such as Mike trying to hold an Assault Rifle like an SMG, or slowly creeping up a wall* Positive or negative: the Chain Shot's final upgrade is incredibly overpowered. This would be completely negative, but it allowed me to destroy forced aggro fights (bosses) and continue on my merry, crouch-walking way.* Some of the glitches were hilarious. I managed to stick a guard through a wall, and he wouldn't stop vibrating.* Security minigames. I loved the Digital Keypad, was neutral on the Lockpicking, and despised Hacking, because of mouse sensitivity.* The characters could emote really well! ...could be a little higher-rez, but it was originally for consoles, so whatever.Overall, wonderful game! I'd easily give this a 9/10 on a standard scale, and wish there was a sequel in the making.			",49,2,0,2,4,1,0

												I'll start off by saying this game was an unexpected gem. Alpha Protocol is one of the best RPGs I have every played. The premise of the game is original, the dialogue is superb, and the story kept me interested. I felt that the characters were quite easy to get attached to after a few dialogues. There is one major flaw this game has, and that is the combat and stealth systems.Combat and stealth, or just interacting with enemies in general, is extremely clunky in this game. At times it is frustratingly bad (for example, shooting enemies from <20 ft away and missing with half the magazine), but in my opinion the excellent dialogue, story telling, and decision making all make up for it. As other reviewers have said, another notable aspect of this game is that the decisions you make in this game actually change the way the story unfolds, unlike most games where they only change the ending. I think this gives the game more than a little additional replay value.Other notes: the graphics are excellent compared to other games released around the same time. The sounds are of high quality. The voice acting is great, in my opinion. The level design is rather simple, but it works. The AI are pretty stupid, but that can be a pro or con depending on how you look at it.If you are looking for a game that is rich in story and is addictive, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a combat oriented game with developed combat mechanics, you may want to try something else. I have to take 1 off for the crappy gameplay, but this game still gets a 9/10 from me.			",225,23,2,6,6,0,5

												I usually make the main conclusion of the game in the first sentence. But Alpha Protocol is so suave, that it needs personal and quite thorough preparation to make an appropriate statement.This game comes from the Obsidian studio, which is known for taking already acknowledged action-RPG systems, and then remaking them into much deeper, truthful RPG. It scares many old fans of those previous games, but undoubtedly earns some new admirers from those who can see farther than one step ahead. It was with Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout New Vegas, Dungeon Siege III...Alpha Protocol was the first game released by Obsidian which was not a part of a big franchise. It was made with limited resources, powerful publisher (who overhyped the project, but made it un-cool), and on the engine of Mass Effect. While limited resources were not a problem to make an outstanding game, other two biases its fall in the release.People were expecting another Mass Effect, in cloak-and-dagger setting. But Alpha Protocol had much less pathos and shooting, than in the beloved and iconized sci-fi world, and much more responsibility for every action, than everybody was expecting. So for some time Alpha Protocol became a pariah in the world of the Mass Effect fanboys, who kept a majority in the gaming trends and patterns.I admire Mass Effect for huge and rich on details sci-fi universe. I enjoyed playing ME games. But even more I am enjoying some pen-and-paper games based on ME universe, but using different mechanics. GURPS is good, Savage Worlds - even better. I’m telling you, that mechanics in the ME games is far from desirable for the immerse RPG play.However guys from the Obsidian took it and turned into a quite decent and even bright thing. They added a timer to dialogs (field agents supposed to think fast) and they added perks, events and consequences to almost every line we are speaking and every turn we are making in the game process.While Alpha Protocol is relatively short, it is so hard and intense in terms of character development, that many players just failed with good choices there, made a weak set of skills and were forced to leave the game unsatisfied. Of course, they all made thumbs down reviews, and that drowned the game on the market. Only now, after 5 years after release, the tide is finally turning. The numbers of players who managed to played it like it was supposed to is growing, so the Metascore is slightly raising better. You can see current state of minds just by look for combination of Phil Owen+Alpha Protocol (see commentary). Although I’m not totally agreed with that fella point of view, well, yeah, generally, Alpha Protocol IS one of the greatest RPG of the given time.It is a great RPG – if played right. And how are you supposed to do that? When making choices in that game, just make it like a responsible, adult man, who really can play in the cloak-and-dagger games. As always, there are two main approaches, one silent, other is assault, and as a third option, you can try to mingle and twist (sometimes speaking saves much more bullets than stealth). But please! Please, do think beforehand doing something! Even when you have to think very fast, you still Need to Think, and not just picking lines and turns occasionally.Summarizing:Alpha Protocol is one of the best current-gen RPG I’ve played, I’ve paid for it twice, and I don’t think it was wasted. Quite opposite, it is one of those rare titles in my book, which totally worth the money.As of gameplay, you got a skill tree and dynamics from Mass Effect, but greatly enhanced towards wagering a given role of a field agent of US secret service. You hack computers, breaking locks and skulls, you mastering pistol and sniper rifle, but, the most significant, you collecting info on your opponents, and that info, used at the right time, is your strongest feature.As of bugs, so commonly commemorated as a game’s main fault… I must make a statement that I didn’t see any significant and game-breaking flaw by all 5 years I’ve known that game. I’ve played it from its release, with quite a humble hardware, on the 4 different PC systems, and everything was working smoothly. Always! Well, AI of the opponents sometimes was performing some questionable tricks, but that’s not a bugs pattern.Overall mark is 9/10, and I’d really like to see some more stuff like this. From Obsidian, or from some other inspired and gifted people – that’s irrelevant. As long as it's at least that non-linear in choices and consequences, it's fine.			",725,238,45,156,102,5,232

												Alpha Protocol is a single player action RPG game with branching story dialogue based on your choices that will affect the way your game progresses and ends. The game has a modern spy movie setting ala James Bond/Mission Impossible. There are dossiers to read through, webs of secrets to uncover, and enough cloak and daggery to make you question who’s side you really are on and who is playing who, typical spy stuff. HOW IS THIS AN RPG?:This type of action RPG game has a single hero, third person camera. You will earn level ups and have dozens of skills to choose from and have different weapons and gear to upgrade. Depending on how you approach some missions you will have access to side quests within your current mission that could potentially benefit you afterwards in areas such as the black market for example.IS THIS A SANDBOX RPG?:The game is not a free roamer and is fairly straight forward to keep the story moving along, it is broken up into the main hubs of Saudi-Arabia, Rome, Moscow and Taipei. However the order of what areas you decide to visit are entirely up to you.EXTENDED REPLAY VALUE!:Completed the game as the sneaky, non-lethal, silenced weapons, computer hacker, suave, smooth talker type? Why not try playing as the shoot first ask questions later, shotgun toting, explosives expert, confrontational, hard headed type? Or a mixture of both or something completely different. The game has multiple dialogue choices and event outcomes depending on what type of play style you go with. You will definitely get your money’s worth from Alpha Protocol if you decide to do multiple play throughs.Admittedly most of my time spent on Alpha Protocol was on the PS3 and I basically did a speed run for nostalgia’s sake on the PC/Steam version. If this is your first time going through Alpha Protocol you are realistically looking at around 20+ hours give or take per go through.It’s too bad SEGA didn’t commission a sequel to Alpha Protocol due to poor initial sales showings, but that shouldn’t deter you from experiencing this gem of a game, very underrated.

												Imagine, if you will, a combination of early Splinter Cell and Deus Ex: HRs little brother, with a drop of occasional Saints Row humor choices in your dialogue options - all presented in a janky but ""holy-$h1t-this-is-fun"" package.That's Alpha Protocol, a game where your actions and attitude actually impacts the story and peoples' reactions to you, for good or worse. Yes, this is the game that actually DELIVERS on the promises of so many other RPG-likes.My first playthrough ended with me maxing out my stealth skill, enabling me to knife party my way through enemies as a ghostly apparition. My dialogue choices consisted mostly of flirting when inappropriate, threatening with executions (sometimes before enforcing them), and punching people who I believed deserved it.I have 400+ games in my backlog, and all I can think about at the moment, is how I'm gonna play THIS game again next.Also, when in doubt (as I had to learn the hard way, and with a little help), remember that the answer to:-world hunger-environmental pollution-the financial crisis-your John Smith small p3n1s that needs 3 inches RIGHT NOW-space exploration-and a happy life in general......is Chain Shooting.So write that down for when you're gonna play Alpha Pro...Oh, who am I kidding, you're gonna play it right now, of course!

												One of the best executed third person shooter out there.  The stealth mechanics are flawless.  The skill tree is detailed without being cumbersome and I don’t need to learn how to use a pistol before I can shoot a shotgun (that’s right Mass Effect, callin’ you out.)The story is better than average and they’re not afraid to call the bad guys out.  The Saudis, Russians and Chinese are key antagonists (sure that helped international sales.)  The evil corporation trying to start a global war is a little silly (evil corporations don’t start wars, they sell virtual trading cards.)Enemies react logically to seeing or hearing you, rather than letting you have a running gun fight through the intergalactic U.N. headquarters without anyone batting an eye (burn two! ME), although they are a little quick to get tired of looking for you after they find the dead body of one of their buds.  The boss fights are challenging without the bosses being overpowerd into super (or Metal Gear Solid) villains.  The fight with the Russian drug lord is classic.In conclusion (that makes me sound smart,) if you like TPS/RPGs it’s a must own and it’s 5 bucks less than some other TPS/RGP (needs some Aloe Vera for those sick burns Mass Effect?)

												VERY underrated game. I myself hated it when I played it for the first time, mostly because of the shooting mechanics. But later I went to play it again. And it was great.The best thing about it is the plot line and how you can affect it. Game has a lot of branches, and many of them affect the ending. Shooting is awful though, until you get a few skill points in it. I personally played with pistol and highly recommend it, because there is a skill that allows you to shoot ~3 bullets at once. Very useful against bosses or in rooms with a lot of enemies.Overall this game is nice, especially if you can get through it's bugs and unfriendliness			",582,122,9,53,52,6,87

												It's currently 3:30 in the morning, I literally just finished the game, and I'm no good at writing reviews, but here it is.I spent $50 during the 2015 winter sale, of which this was the last purchase I ALMOST didn't make. Out of the $50 I spent, this game was the best I got. Sure it's rough in places but currently I'm too tired to single any out. Overall they're just so small they didn't really ruin the experience for me, just mildly annoyed me in places. One of the biggest complaints I've seen in the reviews is bugs and crashes. I never experienced ANY crashes, and can't remember any bugs. The second complaint is that the actual gunplay isn't great, and no it isn't. But personally it still kept me entertained, but the stealth was great. Of course the best part of the game was the choices and story. I've played ALL three Mass Effect games and although I loved them, the choices mattered a LOT more in this game than all three of them.It's now 3:40 and I'm going to bed.  If this review recieves any attention, I might edit it when I've actually had some sleep.(P.S Learning there probably won't be a sequal makes me REALLY sad; I hope there is one someday.)(P.P.S I have just nominated this game for an award in the 11/23/2016 sale.)

												Alpha Protocol is a Third-Person Action RPG which feels like it was maybe a half year's polish from being the best game of the previous generation. In it, you play as a recent recruit to Alpha Protocol, a secret intelligence agency of the United States. You carry through a series of missions, some of which can be played in any order, in order to drive the story of what happened to cause an airline to be shot-down to its conclusion.The primary thrust of Alpha Protocol's novelty is its choice mechanism. In many conversations, there will be multiple options available to the player (typically suave, aggressive, and professional). Different characters will react differently to you depending on what you use, and the player builds a reputation over time. This leads into gameplay perks, new initial reactions from characters which previously haven't been met, and many other branching storyline options. Furthermore, what order you choose to do missions can provide additional intel which can unlock FURTHER branchings in missions, optional objectives, and may other items.The game is not without fault - depending upon what sort of focus you choose to give your character's skills, some boss fights can prove to be very difficult, and this is where the polish could have been most beneficial. That being said, it's hardly enough of a flaw to remove a recommendation for this game - it's absolutely worth the asking price. Rarely have I finished a story-driven game and immediately felt the desire to go back and play through it again while making different choices.Highly, highly recommended.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												I'm surprised I haven't written a review for this before.If you've heard bad things about Alpha Protocol... let's be fair, there were MAJOR issues when the game originally launched.  The game was unstable as heck on PC, the framerates were terrible on ATI cards, and the load times were unbearable.  It was really terrible technical experience.But even back when the game launch, I endured those technical problems and found quite possibly my favorite FPS/RPG hybrid.  This one ranks up there with the original Deus Ex, folks.  It's *really* good.These days, it's much better.  Alpha Protocol has been patched up, any modern hardware is way more than powerful enough to run it smoothly.  So now you can pick it up and enjoy a fantastic FPS/RPG experience without the terrible technical issues.Cutting straight to the heart of the matter, Alpha Protocol offers you absolutely insane amounts of choice, and every single decision awards you with a different perk that provides buffs to certain playstyles.  And I do mean every single decision.  Did you complete the mission without doing side objectives?  Did you complete the mission doing only a specific one?  Did you complete the mission without: knocking anyone out, killing anyone, or even being seen?  There's different perks for each.The most refreshing part of the dialogue system for AP is that it's both ""in-depth"" (classic ME-style drill downs) without the silly ""top choice is good person, bottom choice is bad person, middle choice is neutral person"" crap.  Intead, Good/Neutral/Bad are broken into Suave/Professional/Aggressive.  Effectively, choose your own spy action hero stereotype.  Are you the suave James Bond?  The professional Jason Borne?  Or the brutally effective anti-hero John Wick?  And based on that stereotype you get - you guessed it - different perks that provide different playstyle bonuses.  Even the personality type isn't purely for decoration.  Different characters like different personalities.  But what if you don't commit to a style?  Well, the game is paying attention to THAT, too.  And if you're picking responses to get people to like or hate you specifically, you must be bluffing to manipulate these folks - gasp, your character is a charismatic mastermind!  And there's a perk for that too!Really, this is a legendary title that was very poorly received due to massive technical issues.  If you've overlooked it before, I can't recommend enough giving it a spin if you're a fan of ""0451"" games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

tl;dr -> Realized almost every main character you interact with has a friendship gauge, so I opted to play as James Bond. 69/10 tried to get into every female character's pants.NOTE: You can read my full review here[theroguereviews.com]I had originally played this game years ago on my Xbox 360, however, my rented copy was damaged and I could only play through the first few missions. From what I was able to experience, the game was a lot of fun, and I was very excited to try it on the PC. I completed it in ~17 hours, but be advised – my character was pretty broken, so I think you can easily extend your playtime to 20+ hours. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience.If you like stealth-based (or not) espionage action, third-person RPG gameplay (like the Mass Effect series), lots of choices and potential consequences, and a fluid storyline, then you will really enjoy this game. I would have loved for this title to be picked up for a sequel, as it has massive appeal and all the right gaming elements.The aesthetics are pretty good – on maximum settings the amount of detail in the characters and background is high. You can customize Agent Thorton’s appearance using a small pool of options, even deciding whether he should wear civilian clothing or armor on each mission. The countless cutscenes seamlessly integrate dialogue/action-trees (using a wheel of options, similar to those seen in the Dragon Age and Mass Effect games), and the special effects are well-done. The music and sounds are great, adding to the intensity of each mission and making you feel like an actual spy in a high-stakes situation – in some levels the music matched the scenery so well I would pump up the volume to immerse myself even more. The story is well-written and engaging – something I especially like is how, depending on the mission order you select (you can pick missions from 3 countries), the story and gameplay experience will change accordingly. For example, you can complete all of the available missions in Rome, or you can do a few, finish some missions in Taipei, then continue the Rome mission-line. Differences in mission order will affect things like available resources (intel, handlers, etc), possible interactions/choices, and character dialogue.The controls are fairly typical of a third-person shooter and easy to familiarize yourself with. There is a (partially) skip-able tutorial segment that is very helpful at teaching you all of the gameplay elements. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with third-person espionage (or shooter, depending on your preferred playstyle) games. The most difficult part of the game will probably be boss fights, since you can easily stealth (or kill) your way through a majority of the missions. In-game achievements and perks are a plenty, and you will constantly receive nice bonuses like an experience gain for picking 10 locks. These bonuses will keep you strong enough to survive most missions.Gameplay is very fun and consists of you moving through a mission area, attempting to complete a variety of goals like “destroy an objective” or “obtain information.” Along the way, you will have to stealth (or kill) your way past different enemies and cameras. Your actions during each mission (and during dialogue scenes) will influence your relationship with any accomplices, who may each be a potential handler in your missions. Depending on your relationships, handlers will provide different bonuses. An interesting component that I really liked is how handlers will provide bonuses even if they dislike or hate you – encouraging you to really play how you want to. For example, one handler will give you +10 endurance (health), and +15 if she really likes you; on the flip-side, she will grant you a 5% reduced cooldown to your abilities if she dislikes you, and a 10% reduction if she hates you. Allies are more likely to help or forgive you if they like you, and enemies who you frustrate may make more mistakes. Each individual responds to your dialogue differently – for example, some characters may prefer a professional agent, while others like a laid-back, funny one.Overall, the game is a lot of fun and will bring you many hours of enjoyment if you are interested in any of these genres. Even if you do not like espionage (or action), you can play on an easier difficulty and just enjoy the story, cutscenes, and dialogue/action options.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] ",250,87,0,51,38,2,49

												If you are playing this more than 5 years after release, you probably read enough reviews to know what features make this a great game: The dialogue system, the decision tree and how both shape the story. If these things interest you, give it a go. The action mechanics are mediocre, though. Don't play it for that. Also, there are a few bugs and no community patch to fix them. So it is really not about getting the most of a stealth action game, it is playing a remarkable story game that happens to use stealth FPS action.And that's all that constitutes my review. Let me now tell you how to enjoy this game: Suffer through the missions in Saudia Arabia - they introduce you to the limitations of the world and the engine. Those are tremendous. The mission design gets a bit better afterwards, and hopefully you got used to the limited freedom of movement.  Chose stealth and either pistols or martial arts. Without stealth movement and a matching fighting skill to chose from, you'll miss out on half of the game otherwise. Chose the easiest difficulty: The AI is not good and you'll simply get less annoyed this way. You're here for the story. Also, reloading produces a bunch of bugs, so not having to reload often is a good thing.♥♥♥♥♥♥off characters if you do not like them. Really, it is okay and makes the game interesting. Read up on the bugs of the game, mainly before the embassy mission in Moscow Keep at least two manual savegames around: One in-between missions, one during the current mission. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spent the entire game carefully fostering relationships with every character, orginization, and even enemy I met, converting them all to my side, and becoming good friends with many of them. In the end, I decided to betray them, methodically elimintated them all, smoked a cigar with the main baddy, and went on to covertly rule the world together happily ever after.10/10			",143,21,1,20,8,0,18

												Would highly recommend this game.  This is similar to Splinter Cell gameplay.  Replay value is through the roof.  One of the only ""choose your own adventure"" type games where the choices actually matter.  Excellent plot.  Side note, I didn't have ANY of the glitch problems some people were mentioning.

												A one of a kind RPG ever existed. On the surface the gameplay may look very clunky, looking past that is one very underrated game. Every story and dialogue choices you make have a very big impact to the outcome throughout the game. The only downside for this game is the control and gunplay. It is just functional but not really the best control. Aside from all that the narrative and story is delivered really well in this game.			",237,52,3,37,28,0,33

												A really awesome and flawed game that i really loved and i really recommed to those who loved choices-based story and some rogue agent action Pros: - It has a really good story involving secret organizations and agents going rogue- The choices that you make and your actions in the game really effects your reputation  towards different enemies and allies later in the game- The enemies that you will fight and the allies that will help you in carrying your mission will be decided by the reputation you have toward a certain enemy/ally- A pretty deep leveling up system Cons:- Graphically speaking, it looks bad- It does have tons of bugs and glitches throughout the game- A really simplistic combat and stealth system- Braindead AIs with VERY limited vision- Some boses were very easy and could be defeated within minutesOverall, if you could withstand the terrible gameplay and lots of glitches, it really have some of the most interesting story i have ever found			",16,1,0,2,3,0,0

												This game is totally underrated. The graphics are decent for an older game, they aren't great, and there are some bugs that are prevalent in pretty much any Obsideon game.  But, for the story, and for the mission maps, it's a winner.  I love sneaking up on fools and planting sound generators, going in for the stealth kill.  I also like the conversation, and the intel component.  A lot of people give this poor reviews due to performance, but I just don't see it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha Protocol is either the most underrated game ever or the most unknown game ever. Seriously, take a second: Have you ever heard of this game before?SEGA and Obisidian Entertainment?Espionage RPG?It was mentionated on Rock, Paper, Shotgun?Yeah. I guessed that. With this intruduction, let's game to the game itself:Graphics: Pretty good. Facial expressions and overall quality of the game's scenario is pretty good to look at. It doesn't try to be the most beautiful game ever at the same time that it tries to don't look awful. Since they are a little dated, you don't need a powerful machine. Gameplay: Overall presentation to gameplay tatics and mechanics are self-explanatory and how YOU will use them is pretty much up for the player. The game let's it quite clear: If you fail, the failure is your own fault, not the game's fault. If i can say one bad thing about the gameplay is the key biding: The Space Bar is, at the same time, the button used to run and to go on cover. No, really, i'm ♥♥♥♥ing serious. Now imagine this situation: You need to go stealth because you're on low health, but then, suddenly, your characters run and now everybody is just going to f*** you up. It's quite frustating to say the least (But at least the death animation is so funny that i can't get frustated when i die).Stealth system and hacking/lockpicking/etc overall works great and in a good amount of difficult. You WILL need to be careful in this game to not die. Dying is easy even for the hardcore stealth game fans (I'm playing on Hard and believe me: It's gets REALLY hard).Multiple pathways and overall level desing helps a lot the player and are a good touch in a game that works like this one. Same goes for the RPG system. It's quite balanced and the upgrades are self explanatory and really helpfull at many situations. So, save your AP (Experience Points) and get's what suits you better. Because this game is going to put you at your maximum.This game also have boss fights and, man oh man, they WILL REALLY PUT YOU TO THE MAXIMUM. You will have to be twice as careful when fighting bosses and they have a relative amount of HP (Depending on your difficult. I'm on Hard, so you guess). If you want a comparation for instance: Imagine Deus Ex: HR. Pretty much THAT.I have to say this: This is a game that isn't made for casual gamers. And i really mean it when i say that they try really hard to make this clear.Sounds: Voice actting is okay, nothing special. Soundtrack of the game is quite good and always does a good job at putting you in the mood of the mission/warning you when something is going on (Like being detected).Story: Many people liked it because of the beliavable characters and the construction of relationship through the game (Mostly because of the multiple dialogue choises). It's not really something new, but it does a good job at letting the player wanting for more and more, and keeping going through missions. Overall, you may not know Alpha Protocol™, but he exists. And is a good game for what it is, and pretty inovative too. I have to say that this is the first action/stealth RPG that i've ever played (I think) and it did a pretty good job at trying to start this new kind of genre. It's a shame that it din't really made a lot of sucess and the sells weren't good enough for a sequel.But hey, it's still purchasable on Steam. Give it a try, you will find a good challenge with this game.PS: On Steam i will have just some minutes, but i've played it for 3-5 hours in offline mode because my internet just felt down at the time. Damn good job sycing my play time, uh , Steam? GG WP.			",638,132,23,43,31,9,65

												The story is gripping and the way that it branches really gives the player the power of choices that matter. You really feel like the decisions you make have an impact on the game world and that there are consequences, both positive and negative, for the things you do and say. Some people may not like the dialog system, but I think its absolutely genius! Limiting the time you have to choose dialog responses makes you have to think on your feet and pay close attention to detail. Not to mention, it allows for great replayability of the game. The characters are also really well constructed, each with their own personality, likes and dislikes, that you have to find out to successfully navigate conversations. Voice acting is pretty good too.Another large aspect of the game is the RPG element: choosing your skills, specializations, weapon loadout and customizations. Although the interface could use some work, it isn't the most cumbersome of console-ported interfaces. That said, I think the mechanics are well done. The skill tree is reminiscent of Mass Effect 2 except you have more individual skills to choose from which is nice. I've read that the skills can be unbalanced and lead to ""power-leveling"", but I've chosen to ignore reading what particular skills those are because I like finding out for myself. I'm going to defend the game here and say that unbalanced skills in an RPG is perfectly acceptable; Of course not every decision you make is going to be the right one and that is the beauty of having choices--having consequences to those choices.The weapons customization is also slick and adds a good bit of depth to gameplay since you can customize your weapon mods to suit your play style. For example adding a silencer may decrease damage but gives you the advantage of stealth.I also like the experience/achievements system which rewards you differently based on your approaches to situations in the game. I never felt like I was missing out by not making a particular choice, because the game would reward me either way, but the rewards would differ.Now for the bad parts: Enemy AI is lacking. For example, anytime you sprint, guards have the uncanny ability to hone in on your location. Also, this isn't Splinter Cell: Enemy bodies disappear almost instantly and guards don't really get suspicious when you kill their friends as long as they don't directly see you doing it (or hear you). Also, the alarm system is kind of broken. The game works on a checkpoint system so even if you trigger the alarm in one checkpoint, there are no negative consequences for the following checkpoint area. This means the game is very forgiving when it comes to stealth. Trigger the alarm? No problem, just bust out your assault rifle and kill everybody in the area then continue to the next checkpoint.The other large annoyance is the save system. The game uses checkpoints for saves and overrides each checkpoint save when you reach a new one. This can be frustrating when you want to go back in time, only to find your last manual save was 2 days ago because your checkpoints were overwritten. Now when I first found out there was no ability to quick save, I thought it was a stupid design decision. But now, I see that it falls inline with the rest of the game's design philosophy: You're choices matter and there are consequences to your actions. Allowing you to quick save whenever you want takes away from the gravity of your actions since you can redo them infinitely without consequence. Overall if I could change it, I would keep the checkpoint system, but have it save each checkpoint separately.That said, I think the save system and the poor AI are excusable, given the very engrossing story and the very well executed branching and dialog system. That's not to say that the action and actual gameplay are not fun in their own right, just that the former elements steal the show. I'm sad to hear Alpha Protocol received such poor reception from the press and initial users, but I hope others will give this diamond in the rough a chance. And just hopefully, Obsidian will be given the chance to do a sequel.			",294,93,2,45,30,5,41

												A decent Rpg set in the espionage world. While the concept seems original the execution could have been better, in short this is an Obsidian game, so it has all the trademarks of that developer, and they are: Great story with interesting characters, a very innovative dialogue system, good Rpg mechanics and a lot of decisions to make that affect your story in a hard way. But as all the Obsidian games there are a lot of problems concerning gameplay. It has a stealth system that is very rough around the edges making it hard to go through a mission without being detected, a bad camera (which can be fixed for most of the time if you have a controller), a very basic level design and some bugs. Graphically i found the game to be inconsistent, while some characters are very well modeled some textures of the levels seem outdated.With all the problems i still say that this one was one of the most original games i ever played, if you are looking for an different type of RPG to play give this one a go and you can buy it cheap nowadays.

												As a preface, I've gotta say that Alpha Protocol is one of those games that does a hell of a lot of things. But then it does a hell of a lot of those things really badly. It's like a 2:1 ratio of good features to bad features.For those of you who like RPGs, and making a character from the ground up, Alpha Protocol offers that pretty well. There's plenty of perks and a full set of skill trees to invest in as you level up, allowing you to make completely different characters each time.BUT. You can easily make your character overpowered by investing all your points into select abilities that make you excel at your playstyle. About halfway through the game, playing as a stealth/tech guy, I had an ability that let me sprint around completely invisible for 25 seconds, with a 90 second cooldown. During that period, I could knock out anyone without getting spotted. This meant literally every stealth section of the game became as simple as using that ability. Also, the ability that lets you line up critical hits from cover meant I could just take down an entire room of enemies without even aiming a weapon.Then there's the dialogue system. It's ♥♥♥♥ing phenomonal. No other game really gives you such a feeling of choice, and entire missions can be locked behind certain dialogue options. You never know what you're missing out on or what you've just gotten yourself into. For example, at one point in the game, I spared this one assassin, who shall not be named. I didn't have to do that at all, but when I did, it gave me good rep with a faction I didn't even know existed, access to some extra black market goods, a new handler and some extra support for later missions. Quite a lot just for one seemingly meaningless choice. Then again, I could have denied this other faction if I didn't trust them and I would skip all those other benefits entirely. The dialogue system is surprisingly extensive and you actually do make some meaningful decisions with it.BUT. It's like Fallout 4. i.e. You pick the option ""Dismissive"", and suddenly your character has made some really condescending remark, while you were expecting him to say something completely different. On more than one occasion I've ♥♥♥♥ed up dialogue choices purely because I had no idea what my character was to say. A real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It should be done Deus Ex style, where you can see a brief sentence of each option before picking it, because as is, there are plenty of important decisions you can ♥♥♥♥ up by just not knowing what your character is going to say.I do like that the game has a full fledged reputation system for each character, and depending on what you say or do, each character will gain a different view of you. Depending on if someone hates you or likes you, they'll alter what happens later on.BUT. The game really likes to drive home this whole ""Reputation"" system. On more than one occasion, the game will face you with a pretty laughable decision. ""This person will be killed, but this other person can be stopped. You can only do one of them, but not both, for reasons. Why have I even given you the opportunity to only do one of these things? Well, err..."" The game really likes to remind you that this system is in place and really drive home the ""moral decisions"" narrative.The stealth gameplay in Alpha Protocol is pretty nice. It's very Splinter Cell-ish, but also gives you a lot more versatility. I found that I just levelled Martial Arts right up very high. That was enough for me to just beat my way through every area. Hell, it was even effective against bosses.BUT. It's really unpolished. Enemies will spot you through cover in certain places. Maybe because the cover isn't adequate and they can still see you over it or something like that. The game doesn't really give you any indication of when you're in effective cover or not. Cover that doesn't seem to be effective, like hiding behind a chair, suddenly works like a charm. The alert phase is messed up as well. Enemies will head straight to full alert after seeing you for less than a second. There's no real period of grace or timeout. Once they see you, you're spotted. Luckily, this is counterbalanced by the ""Evasion"" ability, which makes you invisible for a certain amount of time after being spotted. To add to all that, distractions barely work. You're given a distraction device, but whenever you use it, the enemy will seemingly sprint right towards you anyway, even if they don't know you're there.In terms of story, it's actually pretty good. I expected it to be another Splinter Cell type of story where ""Jamal Rafiq Bumbaclot the Second"" does something that violates national security so a bunch of spec op guys find him and realize he's actually just working for someone else, and it was all a ruse. Then the game introduces a different twist that turns the game more into Deus Ex. Now Jamal Rafiq Bumbaclot is still there. He's just been Deus Ex'd a little. I quite liked it, even if the ending was very simplistic.On another note, the game is horrendously unbalanced. Just investing in a few different skills will suddenly make you overpowered af tbh fam. This one ability, when upgraded fully and used in a creative way, can be used to kill pretty much every boss in the game in less than 3 hits. Even the final boss, with his body armor and everything, was reduced to half health from one blast of this ability.Also, the game's got a fair few weapons you can kit yourself out with, and a lot of interesting minigames, such as hacking and lockpicking.All in all, it's a very Deus Ex-like game, story-wise and gameplay-wise. Alpha Protocol is definitely unique, but despite its flaws, I really enjoyed it.Also, there are a few moments that don't really make much sense lookingatyoumarburgandyourfancyvilla			",115,9,0,14,12,2,7

												I would've liked to enjoy this game since it tries its best to give you the feeling of an Bourne-like agent. The RPG elements give this game a great boost. If you like games with this spy theme and you could ignore the underwhelming third-person shooter part and clunky controls, then you will love this game. However, in general I would not recommend this game because although you have the option to play it stealthy and without kills (my favorite way), the game engine and AI make it not possible.

												Alpha Protocol is 3rd person stealth shooter with RPG elements. You play a new recruit to a secret spy organization, and travel around the world fighting terrorist plots and other threats. The game is very open in that you get choices on where to travel next and how to act, which can have drastic effects on how exactly events unfold in each particular area.Alpha Protocol allows the player to choose their approach to being a spy, according to one of three archetypes: James Bond, Jack Bauer, and Jason Bourne. Your decisions and dialogue options reflect how those particular agents would respond to any given situation, and the story unfolds in reaction to that decision. I have played through this game before both on console and on PC (non Steam), so I have witness just how drastically different your experience can be throughout the storyline. It's a game that holds up on repeat playthroughs because of this variation.Alpha Protocol both benefits and is harmed by having Obsidian as the developer. The story is one of Obsidian's finest, with the dialogue and voice acting as some of the high points. However, Obsidian is not known for developing stealth shooting games, so the gunplay does suffer as a result. Alpha Protocol also has it's fair share of bugs, which we've all come to expect from the studio.The gameplay is not a strong point of this title. You will have to put experience points in to weapons to actually be able to hit your enemies, which can be frustrating at times. You'd expect a secret agent to be able to at least hit a target 10 feet away reliably. The good news is that you don't really need any weapon besides your pistol, so you can put points in that while freeing up more for other abilities.I really cannot stress enough how enjoyable the story and writing is in Alpha Protocol. You will meet a variety of interesting characters, and your choices within the game feel like they have a real effect on the overall story. That is pretty rare, since a lot of titles just seem to give you the illusion of choice. While the gunplay is not polished, it's enjoyable enough to keep you going until the next bit of story. The abilities work to give your playstyle a bit of flavor, so not everyone has to fight their enemies the exact same way.I give my full recommendation to Alpha Protocol. You get the sense that you are playing through a genuine spy movie, and you get to decide what type of spy your character is going to be. This game has become a bit of a cult classic recently, and it really deserves that attention. It did not get a stellar reception upon its release, with most reviews focused on the bugs and mediocre gunplay. Many of those bugs have been patched since release, and the real star of this game is the story.Grade: B+			",776,367,21,112,93,8,122

												If you can look past its rough edges, Alpha Protocol is the most exhilarating spy adventure in gaming.-----------------------------------------------------------------------It's not hard to see why Alpha Protocol was critically panned on release; the combat is clunky, visuals are mediocre across the board, and intrusive mini-games disrupt the game's flow. If there is one thing I want you to take away from this review, it's that none of these issues should stop you from experiencing this thrilling action RPG.You play as Agent Michael Thorton, an operative working for a secret United States organization known as Alpha Protocol. This organization is responsible for many of the shadier aspects of the U.S.'s foreign policy, and you'll be tasked with traveling the world to be its hand. As the premise suggests, you'll become involved in many international conspiracies and meet many important people along the way.The game features light customization options, with the ability to slightly change Agent Thorton's appearance as well as how he plays. There is a skill tree where you can dump points every time you level up, but the choices you make here aren't compelling at all. If you want to play as a stealth character just dump all of your points in stealth and call it a day, the points have to be allocated linearly so you won't be allowed to choose which aspects of stealth you want to pursue first.Each country you visit will have its own safe house. From here you will see all available missions and be able to equip yourself for them. Alpha Protocol agents are not funded by the U.S. in order to minimize paper trails, so you'll be responsible for purchasing your own gear through local black markets. Each country will have a ""big"" mission where all of the smaller objectives you've completed culminate into a big finale. You're given some freedom in how many of these smaller missions you choose to pursue and in which order you want to do them in.Perhaps more important than being well equipped for your missions is being well informed. You will acquire dossiers on every major character in the game and you flesh these out as you learn more and more about them. Many games feature an in-game glossary as a complimentary feature for those who want to learn more, but in Alpha Protocol they are near essential to the gameplay. Understanding all of the characters and organizations you will be working with will help inform your decisions in dialogue sequences. Some characters are lax and would prefer conversation to be softened up with jokes, while others have little tolerance for anything but the utmost professionalism. The visuals are unlikely to win anyone over. Character models are average and animations are stiff, the games textures haven't aged very well either. Thankfully presentation is saved by great voice acting, which is crucial because the game's dialogue is fully voiced.The dialogue system is the star of the show. The dialogue wheel displays the tone of the responses you can give (i.e. Aggressive, Professional, Suave) instead of writing out lines and lines of text; this is important because all conversations are timed. I was initially put off by the system, I generally like to take my time when responding in RPGs, but it didn't take long for me to see the brilliance in its design. What it essentially does is turn dialogue into part of the action. You have to be quick on your feet when you respond in high pressure situations, and your responses can carry weight throughout the entire game as you build or burn bridges with major characters.Alpha Protocol's fun dialogue system wouldn't mean much if it didn't feature a strong cast and and interesting story, and as you might expect from Obsidian it delivers on both of these fronts. The story unravels in a non-linear fashion depending on which missions you choose to pursue first. Every character has their part to play in the game's complicated narrative, and learning more about each of them will give you one more piece of the puzzle. The gameplay that exists outside of dialogues and dossiers is really what pulls this game down. Missions take place in relatively linear levels where you shoot or sneak your way through your opposition. The AI of the enemies is poor; walking into another room will get them to completely forget about the fact you just killed someone in front of their faces. The shooting is also clunky, aiming requires you to stay held onto a target for a few seconds in order to land a completely accurate shot. What does this mean for the player? Your bullets don't go where you point them unless you hold your aim still for a few seconds. The end result is that the shooting feels completely unsatisfying, I ended up putting the game on its easiest difficulty setting and plowing my way through the combat sections so I could get to the next dialogue sequence as fast as possible.Unfortunately, awkward shooting and stealth aren't the only issues plaguing Alpha Protocols missions. The game shoves in random mini-games for hacking computers, unlocking safes, and disabling alarms. Each is a tedious endeavor and isn't satisfying at all to complete. They could have all been easily achieved by a simple button press and I'd be far happier.Though it may appear that I have had more bad to say than good, I overwhelmingly enjoyed the time I spent on my first playthrough of the game. As I reflect on my experience with the game, I don't think about my qualms with its combat and stealth mechanics, instead I think about all the characters I interacted with and all the decisions I made. If you don't mind the fact that Alpha Protocol looks and plays like it was made by a B-List studio, then you're in for the best James Bond game ever made.			",311,59,5,58,27,0,51

The Good:* Alpha Protocol is a unique 3rd-person-action/RPG hybrid. Truthfully, though, it caters more to the ""twitch"" side of stealth than the ""methodical"" side. Keep this in mind if you like your Stealth games slow or medium-paced.* Alpha Protocol laid the groundwork for some of the games that you are playing right now. It is the reason current-gen iterations of Deus Ex, Borderlands, and Fallout exist in their current form. And, because of this groundwork, AP has similarities to all three of these series, but it is unfortunately a worse game.* It is widely-reported that the game has a number of game-breaking bugs. This may have been true upon release, but is NOT true now. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs.* The method of gameplay caters to the players' choice: it can be played multiple ways: run-n-gun, stealth, etc. However, playing with stealth is quite difficult compared to games like Metal Gear, Splinter Cell, or even Oblivion. This difficulty leads to many more twitchy fire fights than you would typically desire in a stealth game. And it's not a ""good"" difficulty. It really feels cheap or unfair when the enemy detects me while I am in full camo in the dark, crouched and not moving.The Bad:* Most levels are essentially hallways, with only one or two alternative routes that can be used.* Some animations are a bit stiff. For example, the open scene features your avatar's bicep and forearm occupying the same space at the same time. Enemies will also ""slide"" into cover at times, and the normal guard's walking pace is way too low for the length of his stride.* Character animations are incomplete. Most games feature some sort of ""turning"" animation as your avatar changes direction. Turning is automatic in Alpha Protocol: your character is facing one direction and suddenly faces another direction.* The computer hacking feature is definitely the dated relic of a game developed for a console. Rather than allowing a click and drag interface using the mouse, the player must move two ""passwords"" across the screen using the keyboard for one and the mouse with the other. Although I have done a poor job of describing it, believe me that the interface feels dirty and and the controls are alarmingly poorly-designed. * UI Features, such as the item selection menu, are a little unintuitive. They are confusing but are not hard to get used to.* Pausing while in the middle of a conversation is really inconsistent. Sometimes the game allows you to pause, other times it doesn't. This is especially frustrating because the game allows you to choose what to say, and if you step away from your computer to give the baby a bottle, you may come back to a conversation headed in the completely wrong direction, essentially ruining your game up to that last checkpoint.* On one mission I was instructed several times to use dust storms to hide my approach. There were no dust storms. On another mission I was told the sound of trains would disguise the noise of my bullets. The trains: they did nothing.* Bugs encountered: (1) after dying, I loaded my last checkpoint and the game crashed. (2) On one mission, I found an invsible wall in the middle of a hallway, got my foot stuck in a rock, and found a health dispenser floating in mid-air. (3) It is impossible to do a stealth takedown on an enemy near a door, you will simply knock the door down instead of killing the enemy.The Ugly:* Alpha Protocol's method of encouraging the player to be stealthy works by making the combat mechanics horrible. One example of this is that in order to shoot accurately, you have to wait 4 or 5 seconds between each shot. Deliberately making your game worse to encourage a particular playstyle is a horrible idea, why did Obsidian think that would help their game?* Playing the game 100%, or even ""somewhat fully,"" requires lots of extra (boring) dialogue. Even worse, and the reason why I don't think this game will be remembered, is that the game ""features"" hours of reading extra dossiers to find clues.The Verdict:* Alpha Protocol is neither solid nor decent, but a game that you may enjoy if you are a fan of Bioware or Bethesda games. The game is an interesting combination of stealth, gunplay, and mind-numbingly boring conversations and reading segments. I only recommend picking up this game if you are interested in game design so that you can see how pacing, genre-hybrids, and player agency became such important concepts in newer games.  Alpha Protocol experimented with these methods and was successful in some ways and a complete failure in others.			",224,72,4,40,33,2,60

												There is always that game. The game most people know is good, but never played. Alpha Protocol can definitively be put in that category for a lot of people.For the others, who actually played it, ask them what is the best spy game they played, and a lot of them will probably mention Alpha Protocol. Alpha Protocol is a lot less known than franchises suchs as MGS or Splinter Cell, which spawned multiple games, but it does a lot of things rights all while maintining a pretty realist setting.You see, Alpha Protocol isn't just your random stealth game. In its story telling and character developpement, it's a lot closer to a RPG. The story follows the main protagonist as he gets recruited into an secret agency working for the US goverment. After training and a few missions, for some reasons I won't explain, he is forced to go rogue, and work on unraveling the conspiracy which put him in that situation all while avoiding being hunted by his former colleagues. On the way he will meet numerous allies and ennemies, and take part in a lot operations in various countries until the thrilling conclusion of the story.But you see, even if I wasn't willingly leaving the details of the story vague, Alpha Protocol is a game where your decisions really matters. Who you will befriend, the ennemies you make, who gets to live or die, is all up to you via the decisions of your character. Dialogues often leave you a limited time to answer when you are talked to. So you need to respond in a pretty quick and instinctive manner. While some people may complain it's a bad idea, especially without a way to savescum easyly, I personnally find it gives the story a more organic feel. It does help the whole cast of character is really well done. Most of them have some pretty complex stories behind them, and their own psychology. Psychology, as such, is important when dealing with others. You need to understand the kind of person you're talking to and act accordingly. The character of Frank Heck, in particular, has become a fan favorite.The game has multiple endings, some being pretty amazing, like joining forces with the ""bad"" guy(s), and even betraying them just afterward to take over. Something which isn't seen pretty often in games.As for the gameplay, the stealth as well as the gunplay is pretty solid. And it's an other strength of the game, really. While you can go around relying on stealth on most mission(not all mind you), and/or diplomacy, you can also take a more direct approach, or being a tech wizard relying on gadgets to get the work done, there is even a hand to hand combat specialist path, depending on how you wish to build your character. Out of stat gains via missions completed, you  also get rewarded with passive bonus depending of your playstyle and your choices. Taking a lot of damage will grant you extra resistance, using a weapon a lot will make you better with it, going non lethal will make you better with non lethal weapons, etc etc. The good thing with such a system is, no matter how you play, you will get something out of it to suit your general playstyle, which is pretty good and clever.The only flaw I could find is the fact some weapons were a bit poorly balanced, to the point the best guns are actually the pistols, and everything else is kinda bad(which is mostly due to one pistol skill being really brutal).Some things are done via minigames, such as lockpicking, hacking and rewiring. A lot of people don't like the hacking minigame, but personnally I never had any problem with it. Overall, if you want a spy game with a good setting, a really good story, interesting characters and enjoyable gameplay, you can't go wrong with this game. Chances are, seeing it's getting old now, you will get it for a low price, even more during a sale, so by all means, get that game. You won't regret it.			",184,8,0,25,12,1,30

												""Alpha Protocol"" is a game that desperatly needs and definitely deservers a remaster. I will sya this upfront, I recommended this game as it gave me 8-10 hours of good fun. But it does not handle the test of time, mostly in visuals department. Stealth animations are hideous. But other aspects like player control camera etc. also shows the signs of aging. The rest is just fine or better. The classisstroy have it's twits, pretty neat, unexpected even to those who already seen their share of stories. Limited timefor giving answers (similar to TTG games) helps to keep the pace although I would much prefer to see at least first few sentences instead of one-word description of character attitude. And the game has a high replayablity value as the number of game affecting decisions is really impressive. Even the order in which you decide to do the missions affects the story.

												Take the choices and RPG elements of Mass Effect and the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid and you get Alpha Protocol. A surprisingly good game with a dialoge tree and choice system that actually dramatically changes the story. It may, in fact, be the most dynamic choice system I have ever seen in a game before. The story is your typical espionage story, but still very enjoyable. The stealth and shooting mechanics are both pretty well done and a wide variety of ways to complete a mission. This game may also have the distincion of the most OP pistol in a game ever. The first Halo has nothing on Alpha Protocol's pistol when the right perks are equiped, meaning you can finish any boss in a matter of seconds. Overall, this overlooked game definitely deserves more attention as it really is a very unique.			",315,121,0,22,8,2,8

												It's an Obsidian developed Espionage RPG. It's a real ""diamond in the rough"" situation. It plays like a third person shooter, but doesn't handle like one. This turned off a lot of people who tried to play it like Splinter Cell and realized just aiming a headshot wasn't enough to actually hit if your skills weren't actually high enough.The real star is the story and conversation system. You have a set timer on how to respond to conversations, keeping the flow natural and pushing you to role play on the fly, without a lot of time to judge your response.It's also, like many Obsidian games, *very* buggy. Expect to reload saves from falling through the floor more than once. When I originally played this on Xbox 360, I only had a couple of crashes through my entire playthrough.I really recommend the game if you're wanting something different from an RPG.

												This game is awesome. It's basically like a less sci-fi version of Deus Ex, set in modern day era & dealing with topical issues (but never overblown). Definitely a hidden gem!P.S. Contrary to many reviews, my experience of the game has been perfectly stable so far, no bugs encountered. Hacking is challenging, but nowhere near impossible.			",194,69,28,55,23,1,42

												Alpha Protocol is a cover based, over the shoulder shooter 'Espionage RPG.' While the shooting isn't amazing, the RPG elements and story are what pulls you in. I'm not a big fan of stories in RPGs, but this game pulls you in, because it tailors itself to your choices in conversations. Characters remember what you say, and what you say can not only come back to haunt you, but affect who becomes a friend or you later on. Not just that, but you can execute characters, but be prepared to face the consequences when their allies come for you.The graphics are great, but there is pop in every so often, the characters are believable. No one is a laughable stereotype and the dialog is fully voiced. You'll find dead serious characters, flirty ones, low key people and over the top ones. There's something here for everyone character wise. Since the cut scenes require you to make a timed choice, it kept me engaged more than other RPGs that I'd just skip cut scenes and dialog.The bulk of the game is an over the shoulder shooter, which has pitfalls such as coming around a corner with the camera to the right of the character, the enemies can't see you, but you can only see wall. Combat is simple, left stick moves, right stick moves the camera, hold one trigger to aim, another trigger to fire, You have one bumper for a special ability and another bumper for equipment such as grenades, health kits, EMPs, flash bangs, radio bombs, sound makers to attract guards. There's a button for cover, action and running. You'll have a button for melee, a quick switch weapon, since the game only lets you carry 2 at a time. While you can't pick up weapons from downed enemies, but you select and customize your weapons before the mission. You have your choice of pistols, shotguns, SMGs, and assault rifles. Several types of pistols, shotguns, SMGs, rifles and so on. All of the different types aren't really upgrades so much as side grades. You might sacrifice damage for reloading, accuracy or recoil. Then you can really tweak things with scopes, mussels and so on. You can buy clothes, armor, plates, gloves and they all have different stats. Sacrificing stealth for damage, endurance for upgrade slots. I didn't find myself clamoring for armors and weapons. On top of that, you have a lot of useful perks in the game that you get to buy with AP from leveling up. When you start out the game, you pick a basic class with default stats and perks. Things like stealth, martial arts (hand to hand), toughness (damage you can take), shotgun proficiency, pistol proficiency, and so on. The perks are nice, but can sometimes make the game too easy. Everything from more damage and accuracy to usable skills such as chain shooting a pistol, slowing time and being able to knock down enemies from a 'critical' hit with a shotgun.Between missions when you're buying weapons, armor and equipment, you can also buy intel and read emails from the cast of characters. Some have extra intel, unlock new things from the black market, other emails give you a chance to reply, simply to improve your standing with characters. The safehouse hubs are really nice and help with the immersion. You don't just pick missions, weapons and check emails you walk around the places, checking out little details and trophies like a glass eye from an enemy. They're big enough to be fun, but small enough to not get overwhelming.Once you complete the first operation, the game will open up to your choice of different locales. Each locale has a slew of different missions to chose from so you're not always pigeon holed into one mission. Each mission has a 'handler,' each has a perk that will help you on a mission. Sometimes you can vaguely select who you're paired with. Some handlers will grow to hate you if when you start killing or shooting civilians or soldiers you're aligned with.While the cover of cover based shooting is okay, other games do it better. You can roll out of cover, unstick yourself from cover, but you can't vault over cover or pull  enemies over the cover. The only times that you can vault over something is when a floating icon marks it. You can drop down off a ledge if its marked with an icon. The whole icon to do this or that makes the game feel very stiff and rigid when other games make it more free flowing. The game has regenerating armor, but not regenerating health. It is a nice compromise, and while you can get shot a few times on normal difficulty and live, any more than a few bullets will kill you pretty quick.Enemies will pace around areas and when they notice you they'll shoot, which will alert others and not just that, but they will trigger alarms to call others. It is a nice system and you can stealth kill or disable them. You can go through the game not killing 99% of the enemies. There is even a perk with stealth that will let you see arrows through walls with the direction all enemies are facing.The enemy AI is okay, but its not out for blood most of the time. The basic enemies can do most anything. They'll try to flank you, some of them will throw grenades to get you away from cover. The game makes good use of the enemy AI by having open areas with ladders so you can flank the enemies and they can flank you. If you can do things like climb ladders and use zip lines, so can they. It makes for an even playing field. Enemies will reload just as you do and then its a safe moment to take them out either through melee or shooting them. When you brawl with an enemy, they'll guard, so you'll have to time your strikes.The maps and AI do a good job to make things interesting and not just a straight forward hallway shooting spree. You'll be able to stealth around them in most cases if not gloriously zip line into them. You will also see different factions shooting on one another, which is always interesting, you can intervene in one way or the other if not just slip by unnoticed. The maps also allow for exploration and you're rewarded with finding parts, weapons, cash, intel and other things.There are a few types of mini games in Alpha Protocol, such as a simple wire hacking game where you need to select wires in a specific order. You'll see numbers attached to wires and the wires are all mixed together for you to select which one is attached to the number you're on. There's a lock picking mini game that has you moving tumblers up or down based on how hard you're pulling the trigger, then you pull the other trigger to freeze the tumbler for success. Finally, there is a computer hacking mini game that has you placing two lines of code amongst an entire word find. If time expires, the word find will shuffle and you'll need to find where the two lines match. If you fail these mini games so many times, it sets off an alarm, alerting enemies. It is a good punishment for failure, but a lot of the time, the enemies are already dead.To many the game takes 20+ hours to complete, but I manage to breeze through it twice on normal at 12 hours each and it was worth the replay a few years later. I explored all areas, the one thing that I didn't do was read all of the emails, maybe that's where the extra 8 hours comes in. The endings were completely different on both playthroughs, but again your alliances lead to things and you have ultimate control over what happens no matter what twists or turns happen.In all, its not a perfect game, but I can deal with it with a story that wraps itself around you. Everyone should play it once for the dirt cheap price. I bought it for $2. If there was a sequel, I'd buy that too.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.One Hour Reviews - Game 7Alpha ProtocolPurchase Date: 9/24/2011I picked up Alpha Protocol years ago in a good sale, but it's taken me this long to finally getting around to playing it.  Alpha Protocol seems to be one of those really unappreciated games that never reached the popularity of other games from Obsidian Entertainment, so I was never in a big hurry to pick this one up.I liked the way the game starts without any grand cutscenes to set things up.  Instead I find myself controlling my character right away, with no context as to what is going on.  I'm used to a lot of these role playing games having a slow start while you get some huge exposition dump setting up the game.  Instead I'm busy trying to escape from a building where I am seemingly a prisoner.Which of course brings up the other big difference with this game, is that you are playing a government agent.  There have been countless fantasy based role playing games, and more recently a lot of sci-fi based games, so this makes for a refreshing change.  The game quickly reveals that not all is as it seems, and I find I am in a training facility, which in turn leads to the tutorial portion of the game.  The tutorial does a good job covering the basics of combat and gunplay, along with stealth elements.  The game also provides an opportunity to customize the look of your character, at least to an extent.  It's not like some role playing games where you can completely customize your character and gender.  Here. the character is a specific agent named Michael Thornton, and the customization options are cosmetic.  I put on a beret and some aviator sunglasses before moving on in the tutorial.As part of the tutorial, the game introduces three minigames.  One involves picking a lock, which I found to be pretty easy (too easy really).  The next involves disabling an alarm, which brings up a circuit board where you have to follow lines arranged in a maze-like fashion to figure out which pins to clip.  This was my favorite minigame, as it felt like just the right level of difficulty.  The last minigame I saw came when I was hacking a computer.  You are presented with a sea of text, which I assume represents computer code, and you have to match a series of letters and numbers in the text.  So it's kind of like a word hunt except the board is constantly changing letters, except for the static text you are looking for.  For me it was really hard to spot.During the tutorial I found myself interacting with other agents, which brings up another major part of Alpha Protocols gameplay.  Conversation is a big part of most role playing games, and this is no exception.  Each conversation will provide a choice of several responses, which are in the form of attitude options such as 'aggressive', or 'suave', or 'professional'.  These choices drive the conversation and can influence your relationship with the other party for better or worse.  The game makes it pretty clear that this conversation mechanic will be important when you are out in the field.I didn't progress that far in the game before my hour was up.  Once I got through through the tutorial, I was hit with the exposition dump to setup the first mission, and then it was off to Saudi Arabia.From what I saw, this game looks pretty promising, and I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time in it.Overall Recommendation:  Keep			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												Mass Effect + Metal Gear Solid + a little Splinter Cell = Alpha Protocol.Every choice you make drastically alters the outcome of the story, maximizing replayability.The game can be played super stealthily (my favorite), or guns blazing.Skill tree is pretty big. Many ways to grow your character.You can customize your character's looks.Realism in missions isn't huge, but it actually doesn't detract from the awesome gameplay.Going to need to play this one again once or thrice.

												This is one of my favourite games of all time, almost as good as the first Deus Ex. It has meaningful choices and consequences, good stealth mechanics similar to Splinter Cell, a hacking minigame and excellent Mass Effect style dialogue options where you have the choice of being a dou che, being an aggressive dou che, or being a horny dou che. You can also equip an epic beard and straw hat for massive sex appeal. The bossfights are ridiculous and I mean that in a good way. There's one that is absolutely hilarious. The only downsides are that the RPG stat-based shooting mechanic- he's a world class spy, but he can't hit the broadside of a barn at 10 paces to start with. It's such a shame Sega abandoned it not long after release due to a lukewarm reception from the critics and poor sales, but they did release one patch. It is such an awesome game and you really have no excuse not to pick it up as it's dirt cheap now. I have actually completed this game twice but for some reason the Steam game time was bugged.

												Really fun game - would like to see more games of this type. Similar to Mass Effect (/ etc) in that it has a dialog wheel to choose various responses from, but it has the timed element from Telltale Games in here, too, so you have to choose fast.The gameplay is fairly straightforward - you can run in and murder everything, or you can play in a more pacifist style, taking down enemies without killing them and without being seen. I feel this is probably the more ""fun"" way to play the game, but you can certainly play it murder-hobo styles if you want.Good variety of characters, though as I recall, it runs a little light on female characters that aren't also love interests.And as with a lot of games like this (see: Deus Ex: HR), once you get invisibility, it rather trivialises a lot (but not all) of the game.

												This is an aged stealth/shooter/rpg game with a nonlinear gameplay. As being a stealth game, it's just par. as being an rpg, it's below par. It's not a good adventure, yet an unsuccessful action game. But in total, it's Alpha Protocol. During the game you are a special agent Michael Thorton (not Mike, never Thornton). You will get some missions such as kill A, meet with B, gather intel about C etc. At some point you may feel that the missions are repetitive. The enemy AI is not good enoug for a stealth game but time to time they can easily outnumber you. The plot is very generic. A field agent who used in a tricky mission goes underground to stop the 2nd cold war. During the gameplay you will encounter o bunch of NPCs. You will be given 2 to 4 chouices during the conversations. Some NPCs always like the first opion, while others like second or third. Depending on your choices you can get new missions and/or allies. Boss fights are hard but all they have some tricks to overcome. There are 3 miniganes also.Llockpick, hacking a cımputer and hacking an alarm system. All are not so hard and repetitive but you can pass them by using extra tools purchased from the market. I really enjoyed my gameplay time. It's a good game for old fashioned lads like myself.

												Though it suffers from the troubled development that so often befalls Obsidian, Alpha Protocol is nevertheless an amazing RPG; It could be described as a superior copy of Mass Effect, adding actual choices and consequences in a more modern setting. The stealth and action are mediocre but the real core of the gameplay is in manipulating people through your actions. You are given about 5 seconds to make all your choices, be they flirting with a journalist on an airplane or deciding whether someone lives or dies and the game responds wonderfully to each one.Do you extort the arms dealer or arrest him? Do you smash a bottle over your contact's head when he wastes your time or play it cool to get on his good side? Do you bluff your way past the guards or sneak in through the roof? Extorting the arms dealer will get you some cash and a reluctant mole in the area while arresting him will provide you a nice bonus and reduce arms smuggling in the area, the enemy will have worse equipment but you might have a harder time getting gear for yourself. Assaulting your contact might result in him phoning up a friend at the place you're trying to sneak into, resulting in better security. Bluffing past the guards may be frowned upon by a more professional handler you chose while a more aggressive or sly one would have approved.You can play Alpha Protocol half a dozen times (ignore my playtime) and still find plenty of new things in every playthrough, I   found an entirely new mission in one playthrough that exposed a new side to two characters I had written off before, at another point I antagonized a character so much that they attacked me and left. I can think of few games that even come close to AP's reactivity, characters will call you out for anything from wearing full combat gear in public to leaving a trail of bodies in your wake.If you enjoy RPGs then Alpha Protocol definitely deserves a try.

												In my humble opinion I consider this game one of the best RPGs that I have played in the most recent years.This is mainly due to the choice & consequence prevalent throughout the entire title, what you do, how you talk and dress echoes and reverberates throughout the narrative and shapes your relationships with the generally varied cast of characters.It's not a game with open environments, but rather a game that funnels players to key locations but then lets the player choose with what method obstacles will be approached, both on a macro- and micro-level (Do I go to Rome first? Do I equip myself with casual clothing for this mission? Should I respond with a snarky or professional comment? Do I sneak past or kill this guard?)Alpha Protocol also boasts a strong amount of replayability purely to discover the various ways in which conversations and characters actions are altered by the player's choices.However the game is not as polished when it comes to the actual missions and the combat in those, I feel there's a lack of depth in the stealth, bodies disappear almost immediately, enemies patrol almost like robots and for some reason bashing open locked doors immediately triggers an alarm, even if said door is just a rickety wooden one not visibly connected to anything.The combat is functional, but not fantastical, assault rifles and SMGs feel neglected compared to the awe-stopping power of a shotgun and the critical-hit-with-blindfire pistol method.Bossfights can be either annoying or terrible, depending on if you built your character around combat or stealth (and tech) respectively, this is simply due to the player being forced into combat even if the rest of the mission had been successfully approached with complete silence.Overall I'd very much recommend it if you enjoy choice & consequence, character interactions and generally being a special ops man who may or may not shoot gun a lot, just remember to put at least some points into one type of firearm.

												This really is one of the best RPGs in existence. Obsidian made an amazing game. It's an RPG where your choices actually matter. A change in allies can mean you stealthily moving onto a roof to take out guards with snipers, or bursting through the front gates in a BMP and machinegunning your way through. You owe it to yourself to play this game. Also, specialize in pistols. They're a bit overpowered compared to every other weapon.			",921,301,15,113,122,10,161

												This game really is a mixed bag.To keep it short, this is a third-person shooter with RPG elements (conversations, relations, skills). The overarching story has to do with espionage and conspiracies and thriller stuff like that. You play the role of Michael Thorton, a new recruit in Alpha Protocol. You can pick different backstories that affect your starting skills as well as some conversations later down the line, a la Mass Effect 1.To highlight the good points, I really enjoyed the conversation system in this game. It was very similar to Mass Effect, and the voice acting was solid for the respective roles of the characters. The story seemed interesting at times, and enough to keep me going.However, that's where the good points end. This is an incredibly clunky game while in the shooting sections, and regularly glitched on my computer. It was nothing game-breaking, but very immersion-breaking. Also, the shooting mechanics seemed woefully half baked. You can improve your shooting skills, but your reticule never gets any smaller even when crouched and not moving, and its a big damn reticule which means this super secret agent f##king sucks at shooting.Also, its VERY short for a single-player-only RPG; probably about 9-10 hours. Tripling that length wouldn't fix all this games issues, but i'd still press on because I wanted to see how Thorton's story ended.I really wish I could give this game a recommendation. I really do like it, but this is disappointing coming from a studio as good as Obsidian. I'd definitely play a sequel if they made one, but they'd have to iron out the bugs and tighten up the story. I wanted to see deeper and more involved conversations and character development.As it is though, I cannot give this game a recommendation unless its on sale for $2. I REALLY hope Obsidian makes a sequel, because I will definitely be first in line to buy it.			",79,9,3,15,27,0,10

												The real star of the show here is the reactivity of the story.The story itself isn't really great or anything but it is very reactive, not only to your choices in dialogue but also during regular gameplay. Decide against killing mooks? The game will react. Decide to complete an objective a different way? The game will react. It's basically like having the story as a game mechanic.The gameplay on the other hand isn't really that good. It can be a little buggy or broken in places, but nothing show stopping. You can become somewhat over powered relatively quickly with the right set of skills so if things begin to become a slog try another skill set.Multiple playthroughs are necessary to really appreciate the story.Gets my ""Replayability"" stamp of approval.

												Sure, the game is far from polished and will never be anything more than a rough beta.But it's one hell of a rough beta.This is THE 1990's Spy Action-RPG you've been waiting for. Every trope, from ninja invisibility to incredible martial arts to sniper pistols to shooting rocket launchers at bad guys to stereotypical terrorists to evil corporations to disco-rock coke addict mafiosos - It's. All. Here.It's a full game. Over five acts, 30 unique characters, forty missions, forty side quests/objectives, consequences for almost all actions, romance options, and hilarious methods of execution against the final boss.If someone told me Michael Thorton was Commander Shepard's ancestor, I wouldn't be surprised. He's THAT badass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was easily engaged with everything the game offered and was easily able to keep playing and not get bored and finish the game.Except one notorious boss fight, the whole game was an awesome blast of the funs.Would probably absolutely definitely recommend.

												More greatness from Obsidian but this time in the form of a third person spy rpg and I must say there's so much right about this game with just a few minor technicalities. Firstly, the story was very well done and I liked how it went full circle from start to finish with a few non-linear points in the game that leaves you asking questions of how your actions affect the future and the repercussions they have.  Speaking of actions, the dialogue and choice system in this game was one of the best i've witnessed personally and I've seen a few people complain about the timer on the choices but I really didn't mind it and I felt it added to the realism of Alpha Protocol. The choices definitely have consequences and carry weight and I felt guilty at times in the game when I felt that I made the wrong decision and it actually made me want to go back and settle the score.  My main gripe with Alpha Protocol is the combat as it felt messy and bareboned at first, I could tell that Obsidian modelled the combat system and upgrade system after Mass Effect as it bore a striking resemblance but it wasn't as good i'm afraid. However, towards the middle of the game the combat picked up a little and I genuinely enjoyed the upgrade system and rpg elements that were present.  Overall, I would certainly reccomend Alpha Protocol to fans of the Mass Effect series and just rpg shooters in general and I just loved the clever, political writing like a corporation starting wars just to make massive profit by selling weapons to both sides.

												This game was released 6 years ago to a divided response and it's obvious why; the combat is sometimes unresponsive, the AI is glitchy at times and the shooting mechanics take a while to get used to, but on the opposite side of the spectrum Alpha Protocol is a fun game that plays like the Mass Effect series - its biggest strength is in the story and the dialogue options, which can change the outcomes of the story and the fates of its characters. This game, despite its apparent faults is still fairly (but at times frustratingly) playable and quite fun, with plenty of replayability depending on the choices you make. It's a shame that this didn't become a franchise and that there's barely any other games that allow you to play as a badass spy.			",158,69,0,15,11,3,10

												Finally. An RPG that's NOT high fantasy, sci-fi, or some JRPG hybrid. You have choices but there are no blatant ""right"" vs ""wrong"" picks like other games. The plot is reactive and you might not even encounter major NPCs at all between one play and another. The plot isn't idiotic. The characters are all unique, and in true Black Isle/Obsidian form, the dialogue is spot-on. But this isn't Mass Effect 2. The gameplay mechanics are rough around the edges. The stealth systems work but don't feel fully realized. Enemies can spot bodies, but bodies vanish after a few seconds. Later you get the ability to turn invisible and walk right up to people to KO them yet remain undetected. Gunplay isn't quite a ""shooter"" under the hood. The UI for activating abilities/gadgets/ammo types is kind of clunky. But the rest of the game's good enough that you accept it.Alpha Protocol was a financial DISASTER. Nobody bought it. The reviews were middling. But I so, SO wish more games were like this.			",505,108,4,62,32,2,72

												One of the most underestimated game ever made. Combat mechanics might get little clunky and graphics are not mindblowing, but the real game is in the story and how it revolves around your actions. There are so many endings and playthroughs and most of it will be different every time you play the game. When you have possibility to go to missions and you choose for example mission in Russia, the things you learn and story there will influence next mission, but if you chose that next mission first, the story will revolve differently. ALso characters will behave in the way, you interact with them. This is truly worth an applause for Obsidian, who took the crown from Bioware in my opinion. Apprentice has become master.

												Obsidian's underrated espionage RPG, Alpha Protocol has amazing malleability and replayability as far as how you shape the story with your mission choices and the way you treat others. The open nature of choosing your missions can cause you to meet allies who will help you in later missions... or remember what you did to them the next time you meet, so be cautious; you may even miss a couple of characters entirely depending on where your travels take you!The game also has an incredible dialog system, where people will come to know you by your actions and expect you to act a certain way - you can prove them right, or throw them off - something that can come to your advantage played carefully. Enemy or ally, both can work to your favor. Also interesting is the ability to choose a background that further affects conversations and gives your extra points in different categories. (choose Rookie first!)While the gameplay is your standard TPS/RPG hybrid, this game is a must have for anyone that enjoys games with top tier dialog and freedom of character development such as Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines or Fallout: New Vegas.

												 Another one of those underappreciated near classics. An espionage thriller narrated as a series of cut-scenes with action interludes. A terse story, and what your character says and does during the action scenes has a powerful effect on what happens later. Character gets better weapons as the game progresses but cannot carry much and descretion is often the better part of valour--or can go full noise and to hell with the consequences. If anything, going fully stealth with fully tricked out stealth pistol is overpowered. Doesn't worry me-- I like to avoid unnecessary killing. Quality falls away a little toward the end. More time, more polish and this rough diamond would have been a real masterpiece. Just buy it, it's cheap and a single playthrough is quick. A single playthrough is not enough, a full exploration will take four or five playthroughs.			",58,17,0,13,20,0,24

 Would you like to take part in an action movie where the protagonist got betrayed by his higher ups and gone rogue and then needs to stop the ""Evil forces"" from ""destroying the world""? If yes, Welcome to Alpha Protocol or ""<instert_movie_title_here> : The Game .""  Alpha Protocol, is an cover-based RPG shooter(yeah sounds weird but that how it plays for me at least) in which decision matters. Game got decent replay value but thats if you overcome the little performance setbacks(that I only read about) .  Story One thing that grab me was the story or to be more precise, the way the story is being told. You start the game with a tutorial missions and once you complete them, you gonna be send on the field. But before that you gonna be send to forward in time during an interrogation in which you gonna hear something like ""overview"" of your past actions and this happens for most part of the game . After the interrogation you are send on the field where the game actually starts.Without spoiling much( aka wont say nothing about start and end of the game) can freely say that most of the game happens in 3 cities : Rome,Moscow and Taipei . Each of the cities got its own main ""questline"" but you can unlock side quests if you buy intel from the black market. But have in mind ... once you leave the city you cant go back so you may try to complete it all.In terms of actual plot ... well its pretty generic : you are betrayed, you go rogue, you have to oppose a big corporation before it start a war. During the journey you will meet different characters that may or may not help you . Dialogue Game offers decision making that often counts on your response during little chit chat and less about the action you take. But you have to be a fast thinker when comes to picking a response because the game doesnt want to break immersion. But no worries since you can response in 3 ways: professional, offensive and suave. You have to take in mind that different characters respond differently to your answers so you must be quite a talker if you want to profit with your tongue. And by profit I mean getting some bonus intel or perks . Hell, you may even skip half a mission if you know the right guy! Missions The game isn’t a straight line of mission after mission. Instead you are given a safehouse(hub) from which you buy and equip gear, obtain intel and start missions. You still have main missions but by doing side missions may unlock different ways to complete missions or simple perks. Now some missions are available only for some “period of time”  so you have to pick well what mission to do and when. Skills While you play you will gather experience points which will give you ability points that will help you upgrade your skills : Stealth , 4 weapons(Pistol, SMG , Shotgun and Assault Rifles) , Sabotage , Technical Aptitude , Toughness and Martial Arts . Now you cant max them all so you have to pick the best that suits your style. To help you out with this, the game offers you to pick 1 class out of 3... or make your own class if you pick the option Freelancer.While upgrading your skills you will ""learn"" some abilities to help you out in emergencies. Though some abilities like ""Shadow Operative"" makes the game feel more fantasy than realistic which is a shame. But overall game gives options for different styles though at some times its punishing and makes no sense. Equipment What is gonna be a RPG game without gear,huh? Well the gear options in here is quite limited but still add some sort of depth ... maybe . Before every mission you can check your gear and gear up the way you want it with gadgets and such.You can carry 2 weapons at once and you can customize them a bit. You can change their barrel,scope, magazine and grip. Once you are done with it its time to pick your suit. Suit can be equiped with up to 4 different modifications that can help you out. Last but not least you got your gadgets wheel which you can fill with grenades, mines, EMP, first aid and some others that I never used.  Once geared up its time to head to the battlefield .And always be sure that you have enough ammo to start the mission without problems. Combat and Shooting As said, combat is mainly cover-based shooter style but you can do stealth takedowns and as far as I remember one boss fight ended up with kiting a lot .Now the shooting is a bit different than most games because you need to ""focus"" aka wait for your crosshair to get smaller and brighter before you make your shot. This is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off players quite fast in early games when you dont have any upgrades in your weapon of choice skill. There arent that many big fire fights to make it a ""rage-quit"" material. Overall it need some time to get used to it . Hacking Now time for the most annoying part of the game for most players. The mini games for hacking,picklocking and switching off alarms.Now switching off alarms is fairly easy : you need to press the right switches in maze-like scheme.Picklocking is also fairly easy: put in line the switches .Hacking ... oh lord ... the hacking ... I wonder how many people actually quit the game because of it .Check this image : http://abload.de/img/ap7dbuso.jpg or a video to see what I'm talking about. In-game all numbers will be switching non-stop and your goal is to find the line of symbols that isnt moving and mark them.. with one of the 2 line of codes you are given . But be careful.. one wrong step and you gonna set the alarm on and you will need to re-do it . So you are better to put points in Sabotage if you want to manually do the hacking.Or you can just stock up yourself with EMPs and not bother with any of those. Replay Value The game got quite some replay value, 3 endings, several approaches on different missions, unlocking missions by talking much. Its easily can keep your interest for 2-3 playthrougs. First one is always to try the soil and then you may focus on different objectives. Overall Nice story, neat idea and RPG elements but quite lacking gameplay elements and with possible performance issues(for which you better check the hub) .			",564,175,23,111,57,11,131

												Alpha Protocol.Underrated but still quite an awesome game. I was pleasantly surprised as i entered its world of espionage and from the beginning, it shows you that your decisions have weight. They actually matter, unlike in other games that promise that your decisions have outcomes, this one delivers. You can be a really suave spy, a really aggressive 'roided up spy or a professional killer spy or even a combination of the three. You can make people hate you or like you. Both of those have corresponding consequences/rewards. Makes for interesting conversation choices throughout the story.The graphics of this game are okay in my opinion. It hasn't aged that badly actually. The combat mechanics aren't as bad as i was expecting but there are exploits that players would discover. For instance, melee attacks are OP as well as pistols. In my playthrough, i never needed to use my rifle or any other gun for that matter. Why? Chain Shooting. The Chain Shooting skill for the pistol makes for quick and deadly executions. (think today's Splinter Cell: Conviction/Hitman: Absolution's Execution/Instict kills.) I found stealthing the whole map to be an enjoyable experience as the enemies barely have time to react to you punching their lights out.The story is well told and your decisions have an impact on how the game tells it to you. I can't say much about it without spoiling so you'll have to play it. This game is well worth the full retail price, but if you're on the fence or just don't wanna spend a lot, you can wait for a sale so that you can pick it up and enjoy some espionage.I want a sequel to this game so bad.But sadly, Beta Protocol is still in Alpha.

												At maximum stealth level, you can basically walk through most maps entirely unseen, taking the most direct route from checkpoint to checkpoint, entirely invisible to all the enemies.  It's like the game designers realized you'd get bored with the game, so they gave you an option to just skip most of it.  They also gave you a pistol, which at high levels can one-shot kill almost any enemy in the game, if you wanted to skip the bulk of combat as well.  There are at least two easy ways to play the game 'right,' and I found one unfortuante way to play the game 'wrong.'  While the pistol can kill anything, the shotgun can barely kill the starting enemies.  Leveling it up doesn't make it materially better.  If you chose a shotgun build, you've chosen wrong, and the game will punish you for it.  The one interesting aspect of the game is also one of its most frustrating.  Conversations have real consequences and are hard to reset and replay.  It encourages you to research your conversation targets well, like you're supposed to, and to accept convesation mistakes if you make them.  But it's too easy to make mistakes.  The game doesn't tell you what you're character is going to say, it just says something like, ""suave.""  Now ""suave"" might be cool and seductive when talking to one character, but creepy and stalker-ish when talking to another.  You don't know until you click the button what ridiculous crap is going to come out of your mouth.  So I never really felt like my conversation choices were ""my choices.""  It was just a question of whether I pushed the 'right' button, or the 'wrong' one, based on what the online wiki said.  That's not fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Alpha Protocol 

			Views: 1,441		

			Alpha Protocol is a modern Spy style stealth RPG 3rd person shooter. Available at Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/34010/ Here is what I found for the fix For The FOV.		

	Alpha Protocol is a modern-esque style third person stealth game withan enriching story element.  The first thing to notice is that the sensitivityin the aim mechanic is just insane, if not annoying to the point of unplayable.The game would benefit from a field of view slider, or the ability to scroll out as well.  	The story centers around a top secret governmental program createdto  do the governments dirty work, so at the same time giving them plausible deniability if anything should go wrong.  It is a modern James Bond game,without the corny puns.  The choices you make effect how the environmentshapes around you.  The result of your choices change the context of the game,making you feel like what you do matters.  	The character build comes with many different options for what you can choose as a specialization, as well as active and passive abilities.  This adds to the games replay-ability.  In addition, the weapons come with a largevariety of customization options.  The guns feel good, and convey the rightweight and power that you want to have in a shooter game.  You can play the game in the style you want, whether it be melee, ranged, or stealth; the game doesn't punish you for playing how you want but rewards you for it.	The game also offers the option for technical minigames; you are forthe most part not forced to lock pick or hack to get to certain areas; you could, for example, use a grenade to force your way past.  The difficulty of the minigames increases as you level up, but they offer variations so that it's not repetitive and boring.  The only issue I had was with the computer hacking  minigame, in which again the extreme mouse sensitivity leads to not completing the hack within the time limit, which then activates alarms, and can then lead to pulling you out of the stealth mode you had successfully completed until that moment.  	The combat is done very effectively.  You can charge in to attack yourenemies, but be aware that the enemy will respond to your tactics, and employ methods to try and counter your approach.  The stealth element was very satisfying, as you can actually ghost through a level if you choose. The enemies level in difficulty, adding to the suspense and requiring that you choose how to level your character carefully, or follow the preselected level design paths for you. As well as making you think more about how you are going to approach any situation.  	The level design is done very well.  Despite the fact that it is linear,each zone looks different, and every mission adds variety in enemies and aesthetic, making the linear aspect a non-issue.	The game interacts with you; your choices make a difference.  You cancreate the character you want to create, and play the way you want to play.  This game has been enjoyable to play; I never felt that my time was wasted.  This is an easy game to recommend.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho ",268,110,1,57,17,0,44

												While ambitious, this game is really difficult to recommend. The controls are unwieldy and unintuitive, ending up with all the worst parts of both shooters and rpgs, and with poor inventory management to boot.			",278,61,2,80,14,3,40

												One of my favorite games. The gameplay can be clunky and it has some bugs and cut content because it was rushed to meet its deadline. Still the game is an excellent Mass effect-like agent game.			",324,36,2,47,20,2,31

												This is the most reactive rpg I have played. Everything is so tightly done regarding the dialog system and how it  REACTS to previous choices.  It is just a shame that the gameplay it is attached to is pretty mediocre, and fairly bad in some of the minigames.The game's easy mode is to max up pistol and brilliance.  That is the best. You get 3 ""moods"" for every response. From memory, left is cold and professional, up is AGGRESSIVE, and right is suave. It is meant to be 3 spy archetypes, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer, and James Bond, but the ""Bond"" option instead ends up being the Sterling Archer option.Needless to say, if you are fond of Archer, doing at least ONE playthrough with  THAT set is a treat. This is a title that seems pretty bleh or mediocre on the first playthrough, but just the sheer amount of detail and change that can happen with apparently MINOR decisions makes it shine above pretty much everything else before and after it. Play it. Then try it again. If you can stand its (now for me very minor) issues of gameplay being rather mediocre, it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing set of experiences. It is a game that no matter if you play it 10 times, you will find new details on each playthrough. You  CANNOT experience all of it in one single playthrough.Definitely recommended.

												'Mass Effect' and 'Splinter Cell' had a child named 'Alpha Protocol'. It turned out to be a flawed genius. There are a lot of faults with this game. Broken gameplay mechanics, PS2-era graphics, inconsistent frame-rates and an uninspired beginning. But if one can look past its many shortcomings, this game turns out to be an absolute gem. A global espionage-RPG in the true sense. To start things off, you first pick your character's class: Soldier (firearms), Field Agent (stealth), Tech Specialists (hacking) or Freelancer (a combination of skills of the player's choice). Each class determines how well you perform a specific task in the field. With regards to gameplay, I'm sure the devs were targeting a realistic approach to combat. For instance, you have to aim at a target for few seconds to let the reticule converge. Thus, ensuring that every gunfight turned out to be a challenge. The melee system comprised of martial arts which allowed you to knockout enemies either stealthily or engage them head-on. All character abilities were upgradeable with sufficient experience points (XP). Hacking was one of the highlights of the game. There was a unique system in place each for hacking computers, opening locks or bypassing keypads and alarms. Many people found the hacking system frustrating but I think it was fairly straight-forward. Challenging, yes, but very rewarding in the end. The graphics were rubbish, plain and simple. Character animations were clunky, anti-aliasing horrible, lighting awful, movements jerky and texture loading very slow. These were some of the biggest down-sides of an otherwise fantastic game. Level designs were very good though with plenty of alternative routes to complete objectives.The plot is where this game really shines. The story is gripping and opens up once you're done with the Saudi missions. And it hurtles you head-first into a global conspiracy mess. Allies (and enemies) are made along the way and your treatment of them has future implications in the form of gaining intel, weapons, money (if allies) or facing problems and hurdles (if enemies). Reading their dossier in advance helps you choose favourable options during dialogue sequences. Characters are interesting and unlike many other RPG games, dialogue never feels bland. Alpha Protocol needs a sequel to set its problems right. It requires perseverance and patience to overlook its many problems and bear with its frustrating nature but underneath all that, this game is a true gem. One not to be missed.			",74,12,0,3,1,0,3

												I should hate this game, as it has the same approach to boss fights that Human Revolution had (not balanced for stealthy builds).I should hate this game, because the difficulty goes up and down like a rollercoaster if you specialize in only a few skills early on.I should hate this game because it crashed more than a few timesBut I like it despite all these flaws, because the rest of the gameplay is solid, the skills and equipment highly customizable, and your behaviour has real consequences.

Finished the game twice so I guess I'm in the former.P.S. The pistol is your best friend in this game. Upgrade it fully and it's basically GG.

Mean Mr. Mustard's short Alpha Protocol review 1) Essential - buy it NOW 2) Recommended - buy it on sale 3) AvoidTime to complete - 15 hours to finish main campaign.Played multiplayer? N/AWorth revisiting? Yes, multiple ways to play and loads of different choices to make.Best part - Going full pistol and spamming chain-shot turns you into a time-slowing killing machine.Worst part - Game looks and feels subpar but don't be fooled, the epitomy of a rough diamond.

												I often reminisce about how much of a hidden gem this game is. It has an espionage premise, packed with some very nice skills, which ultimately you carry into the compelling storyarc. The only downside I can think of is that you're not really feeling like playing it again since it is linear, but it was a fun ride nonetheless!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I passed on this game when it came out because the critiic community lambasted it. After hearing many good reviews here on Steam, I decided to give it a try. I was not dissappointed, Yes, the graphics are dated. Yes, there are bugs (mostly wonky AI in my game, no game breaking bugs as of yet). Even with these factors I find myself thouroughly enjoying the game.  It is just plain fun to play, with a lot of choises to be made (and made very quickly). If you like the idea of a shooter/stealth/spy game with RPG elements you will enjoy this game, blemishes and all.			",104,21,3,11,7,2,5

												This was a game i really enjoyed ! Came out of nowhere and really surprised me since i had heard all the negative press. Is usally dirt cheap on sale and is more than worth its price. The dialogue wheel in this game is far superior to anything Bioware has produced to date. Here your decisions actually matter! They do make an impact and you can have completely different endings no 3 colour nonsense here. If you love RPGs then give it a go you wont regret it.			",248,42,2,51,18,3,47

												tl;dr: Could have been a good game - a prime example of balancing gone awfully wrong. Normally I would love this game. I *should* love this game. But I can't. It's like getting drunk. At first, it's fun. Then, you regret it and swear to never do it again. Rinse, repeat.The spy-theme is cool, and I love the idea of this RPG. Storywise there are no complaints from me. Graphics are a bit outdated by now, but I can live with that. Sound, music and voice acting is really good.Overall, this could really be enjoyable. As the main character, you get the sense of being in the middle of a spy movie. It is immersing. You can customize the skill tree of your character. Straight-up shooter? Tech wiz? Silent but deadly? All this is possible. And it allows you to approach situations in different ways. Mostly. Sometimes.Except where it doesn't. Then the game flushes sneaking or tech wizardry down the toilet, and you hopefully have maxed out one of the weapon skills when waves of enemies are thrown at you. Oh, you did not? Prepare to die, Mr. Thorton. Seriously, Deus Ex has shown years before this game how it is done properly.And the boss fights. Impossible for me to win. I can accept a challenge. I can accept a tough game. But this is ludicrous. I simply followed the game and wanted to complete my first city, Moscow. There is no indication in the game that the particular mission could be too hard. So you sneak through the compound, face the boss. And then you die. Again. And again. And again. And then you give up, forget the last hour that you sank into the game for nothing, and follow a different path (mostly because I googled how to win this fight - turns out you should do a few missions elsewhere first). Where you also encounter another boss. Same story. I died, again. And again.Save points do not help. Sometimes they are too far apart (e.g.: that one triad attack mission), so you have to repeat almost an entire level. 15 minutes of playtime, wiped away. Over and over again. Hey, Obsidian, I know the game is targeted for consoles. Get your act together on the PC. Let me save anywhere I want. It's not the 90s anymore. Challenge me with smart gameplay, not technical limitations.Speaking of which: navigating the levels can be tricky. Mike does not always go where I want him to go. The camera sometimes turns suddenly by 180deg, and sometime the main character does as well. Very annoying when you started aiming for the bad guys. Moving around, taking cover, getting out of cover... not as fluent as it could be - as demonstrated by other games from the same year.Thing is: would I read this review, I would think that I could live with all that. And sometime I can. Then the game shines, and it's fun, and it's challenging. I enjoy it for a few minutes. And then the hammer falls, and I curse under my breath.There are very few games that literally enrage me. This is one of them. To vent, I can either smash something - or write a review. My things around me appreciate me writing this. I really want to love this game. I want to play it again. Maybe I will in the future, when I forgot how horrible and angry I felt when I played it last.Or maybe I simply made all the wrong choices and leveled all the wrong skills and gave all the wrong answers. I still don't think a game should punish me for that, but, well...Summary:+ I love the spy theme+ interesting characters+ decent story+ this game makes you emotional...- ...unfortunately, this emotion is ""hate""- clunky controls- friggin' save points- horrible balance- animation of Mike sneaking is... umm... funny?- Deus Ex did it better, years ago- for me, cheating by changing the config files was the only way to salvage some funRecommendation:get it when the price is really cheap (and I mean *really* cheap), or you really want a challenge...

												While not a bad game per se, Alpha Protocol attempts to be too many things at once and manages to be mediocre at all of them. It wants to be an action-RPG like Mass Effect with dialogue branchs and a reputation system, but the depth of conversation seems to be superficial. Choosing to be polite or a jackass illicits different reactions for the first sentence, but proceeds to give you the same information after the reaction. It feels hamfisted and doesn't carry as much weight as it could have.AP also tries to mimic stealth games like Splinter Cell, but the detection system feels arbitrary. Sometimes getting spotted feels completely random; you may have been perfectly sneaky, in the shadows and out of sight, only to have an enemy spot you from afar anyways. I've seen worse stealth implementations by far, but not from titles that are supposed to be this caliber.The action also feels a bit dull too. For an agent who is supposed to be highly trained, the protagonist can't aim to save his life. I've spent enough time with guns to know that all the guns in this game will hit point of aim at any of the distances you will find in AP. Shooting basically feels like its a punishment for not sneaking properly, and sneaking is such a gamble that the two combined get aggravating.Also, most of the characters are boring, and a few of them could have been lumped into one person for all I care.Anyways, if you're looking for some stealth gameplay, an immersive RPG, or a good third person shooter I'd suggest looking for a game that does only what you're looking for and not Alpha Protocol. This game isn't bad, but it's hard to recommend because it's so mediocre. I could only recommend this if you want to pretend to be James Bond and none of the Bond games out there appeal to you.

												Alpha Protocol is one of the best games I have played, and it is one of the most underrated games I have ever come across.Alpha Protocol is a espionage RPG where you play as Michael Thornton, an agent who is sworn to protect the interests of the USA.The beauty of this game, which is a little older now, is how amazingly, intensely deep the choice system is. Similar to Deus Ex, the game revolves around how *you decide to play*. I've never known a game to be affected so much by the decisions you make, moreso than Deus Ex. The game is hugely fun. The controls are a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but they are superb when using a controller. So do that. I hugely recommend this game, so good.Nilesy ",312,139,3,47,47,5,46

												I finished the game playing as stealth character and a little bit of shooting.I do not recommend the game that much.Here is a summary of what I think of the game:The positives:+ Does have variety of environments. + Interesting dialoug system and very similar to Mass Effect's. The only difference between this game and mass effect is that your response is timed. Pressing X usually gives a charming/sarcastic response, Y for more agrressive and angry, and B for Profoessional and calm.Meh:* Has various ""mini-games"" such as picking locks and hacking. They do get repititve and they feel unrewarding to do.* There is ingame cash in which you could pay for weapons, upgrades, armors, and missions intel. However, since combat is bad (I will get to that) then having tons of guns doesn't really help.* Character is customizable but the customization are kind of limited. The negatives:- Combat is very annoying especially when starting off the game. It takes from early Ghost Recon games where you have to stand still and aim at your target until the cursor circle gets smaller. This is not suitable for this game at all especially when you are caught with too many guards and they are close to you. It also make boss fights frustrating.- A.I. with stealth is very very basic. If a guard get the sight of you, alert mode starts right away. This gets very annoying because sometimes they can see you even when you are behind a wall or a cover. Unlike games like Tenchu or MGS, the guard has no ""Hmmm?"" window. If he sees you expect swarm of guards coming at you.- The game is not clear on the benefit of killing humans or knock them out since bodies simply disappear after 10 seconds. True that killing humans might trigger some conversations with NPCs later on, but this has no noticeable gameplay factor at all.- Camera is a bit annoying and feels a bit stiff. Reminds you of some PS2 titles.- Movement is not as fluid sometimes. For example, when you reload, the character stops moving. - Stealth moves are very limited. For example, you can only jump on certain locations and others you can't. You can never move above any obstacle.How good is the story?The story did not really get me interested. It is very similar to Splinter Cell games. Voice acting is good. Didn't like most of the writing. Romance is very very very awkward and tasteless. OverallThe idea behind the game got potential. At first instance, it seems like it can be a Mass Effect meets Metal Gear. However the game is simply not up to expectations and much of its elements are outdated.			",156,39,1,21,16,1,9

												A flawed masterpiece. The gameplay itself really isn't much to write home about, but I have never seen another RPG that reacts to your decisions quite on this game's level. I highly recommend it for the storyline as it seems like no two playthroughs are wholly alike. However, Obsidian was screwed pretty hard by Sega when it came to polishing the game. I recommend playing on Easy because the gameplay, especially the hacking minigames, definitely aren't this game's selling point.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Funny enough this critically panned game is probably one of Obsidian's best efforts in the last several years.  The C&C is on par with the original Deus Ex (and arguably better although it benefits from a decade of tech advance) in that the ramifications of decisions made at one point won't manifest until much later and the results are more than just cosmetic/cutscene oriented.  Unfortunately the combat is weak, level design is sub-par, and stealth is poorly implemented.  Compounding these issues are some utterly broken talents like Chainshot and Shadow Operative that trivialize any and all combat situations.  Could have been a great game but still worth a playthrough despite the flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game. The execution of the entire game could've been a bit better, but what's there is fun. It actually manages to do something new and different in the RPG genre so for that, I applaud it. The game itself could've benefited with some better control schemes, because when you need to be really stealthy, you still move way to fast. And killing bosses can be a ♥♥♥♥♥. There are multiple solutions to finishing a quest (stealth, action, diplomacy) and with the experience gained you can upgrade your character. Nothing you haven't really seen before. Add multiple endings to that and a good story, and you've got yourself a great, fun game. Don't listen to the critics, try it yourself.[Rating: 88/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												When I heard about Alpha Protocol, I had two thoughts. One was that an espionage action-RPG was one of the best ideas for a video game I'd heard. Alpha Protocol delivers on that. The story is a pretty damned good espionage potboiler. It could almost be a lost installment of the Bourne series. That the story is pretty damned good isn't all that surprising given it's an Obsidian production. These are the people who did KotOR II and Fallout: New Vegas. True to form, expect outstanding writing, difficult choices in terms of what the ""right"" thing to do is, witty dialogue and bold characterization.Of course, Obsidian has another, less positive reputation, and that's for delivering unfinished, buggy games with as much cut content as what's actually in the game. Unlike KotOR II and New Vegas, there's no real modding community that I could find dedicated to restoring cut content (if, indeed, it was even accessible). Reading about Alpha Protocol I braced for the game to bug out frequently and to have plot holes I could drive a Mack truck through due to cut content. Honestly? I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I'm just unperceptive, but after one minor bug in the early going and one crash to desktop, the game played smoothly. There was one instance where the game triggered a flag that I had done something that I hadn't, which got brought up in the story as a plot point a few times later on. And...that's it. For Obsidian, that's shockingly solid. And as mentioned above, the story was satisfying. I'm sure there were things that were cut, but for what it's worth the story didn't have the trainwreck feel of the end of the (pre-restoration) KotOR II.The gameplay is fun. One way to think of the game is to think of it as an espionage Mass Effect. Another way, one I think is an even better comparison, is that it is more of a spiritual ancestor of Deus Ex: Human Revolution than the previous Deus Ex games were. There's definitely no ""right"" way to play the game and build your character though you can make the game much harder if you generalize OR specialize too much. Playing a stealth-oriented character is tough in the early going but once you start to unlock higher powers it's almost game-breaking...except against the mostly-unskippable boss fights. Also similar to Human Revolution, if you've only been focusing on non-offensive powers, the boss battles can be ball-bustingly hard.I've heard Alpha Protocol talked about as a ""flawed gem"", which is pretyt much how ALL Obsidian games are regarded. On the bell curve of what Obsidian games are usually like, I found Alpha Protocol to have a stable build, a complete story and good if not MGS great levels of stealth-action gameplay. If you like action RPGs and want to play in a fresh and different setting, you'd do well by this in my opinion.			",120,35,0,19,19,2,20

												This review is so similar to my Game of Thrones one, i got exactly the same feelings after completing this game.Great story, a story with multiple choices and different endings, a story worth of a movie or the tv series. Infact this plot is so good that this is enough for me to give it a positive review, but unfortunately that is all what is good in this game.Alpha protocol is a 3rd person stealth action game, similar to Deus ex Human revolution. And here is a HUGE, gigantic BUT's.-but level design is very uninspired and pretty liniar.-but very similar enemies with poor ai, boss battles very easy, and difference is gigantic health pool of bosses.-but weapons variety is poor, and new guns are mostly a re-skin with a better stats.-talents are good but not very useful-but animations on characters are very badAwful gameplay, poor man's Deus Ex Human Revolution or Gears of War (if you play it like 3rd Person Shooter). I wish there was less of combat overall, but combat is 80% of the game...Decide yourself. I liked plot A LOT, game has the good amount of replayability but all else about this game seems clunky and unfinished.This game is perfect if you want to become a spy. You can roleplay a stubborn patriot, James Bond, stealthy assassin, the worst guy ever, basically any spy stereotype you can think of.Edit: it took me 10+h to finish it, sometimes steam not detecting it's launched because it initiates internal launcher before you can start the game.

Title: Alpha ProtocolGenre:  Action, RPGDeveloper:  Obsidian EntertainmentPublisher: SEGARelease Date: 28th May, 2010TL;DRSpies. Shooting things! Missions. And a whole barrel of fun. ProsGraphics are great, and good for 2010 too when this game first came outGood voice actingYou can make your own adventure/define your character's personalityStoryline hooks youConsWould like to scroll through weapons rather than go into a menuAiming weapons isn't perfect No option to reread the tutorial (I got 15min stuck on hacking at one point :p)  Gameplay Originally an Xbox 360 game, this action RPG takes you straight into the world of spies and espionage (after selecting the type of agent you want to be), and you wake up in a lab, spending the “tutorial” of the game breaking out. It helps to use your common sense factor as well as the game mechanics of rolling around shuffle sneaking with a funny walk and hitting people. And possibly shooting everyone too. I didn't make my character too sneaky. And I think I set off the alarm by failing to pick the lock. I also accidentally shot someone when figuring how to sneak and be aware, so instead of being covert and suitably spy like, I ended up just shooting everything. ♥♥♥♥♥es got nothing. Who needs stealth? Ha! Not that I'm defining my playstyle or anything. Let me just make my character look incognito by giving him big black glasses and a beret. No one will suspect anything.The storyline balances well with the action given, it's enjoyable to follow, from your orientation/induction teaching you the different weapons and methods of succeeding, to the life challenging missions upsetting criminal organisations around the globe. It's pretty much like a James Bond movie in game form. The voice acting is good. I like how I can have the options to be sarcastic, professional, indifferent or defiant, so I can create my own personality within the game.The music is appropiately slueth like, giving the feel you're sneaking around against the clock. It helps to set the mood.The types of puzzles in this game vary, though most of them centre around time limits. For example you need to pick a lock in a certain amount of time, or clip circuits in order, or hack a computer by finding the embedded code on a screen of randomly generating numbers – though that took me quite a few tries to figure out since the instruction wasn't so clear.The graphics are good, the environments are well defined and it's visually easy to follow your progress through a mission, along with promptings when you reach the right spot. It's high end Xbox 360 graphics so you can expect some prettiness.The Ai mechanics focus on brute force, deceit/sneaking and picking and choosing targets, and explosions. I used sound generators to lure people into traps ... then punched them out myself.There will be points where you can't get away with the reckless playing, because the alarm system will pull everything in the vicinity to take you down. It's a shame you can't scroll through to find the weapon of your choice, you need to go into a menu and select them. For me I have to press G in order to start looking in the menu. I would prefer it being more fast paced by being able to quickly scroll through weapons.Overall VerdictRecommended. It could even be worth more, so I'm happy to get it for the price I got it at. You can choose to be stealthy or not. You have the option to play it out how you want. And that for me makes it fun.Want to read more of my reviews?

												While some might be put off by the rough edges this game has, or even the medicore graphics. Underneath it all, is gem of a game that gets overlooked far too often. This game is a mix with Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, and Mass Effect. That said it does not fly above those titles in the things it takes from them, but still does a good job of blending them together and creating an overall enjoyable experince. Alpha Protocol has a decent storyline, while it will not set the bar for years to come I found myself pretty invovled and caught up in the narrative. The characters you interact with are all great, some I felt closer to more than others. I found myself wanting to please certain ones, while others I didn't care to impress, even going as far as being a jerk to them as much as I could. The dialog within conversations is wonderful, everyone who has lines feels natural and nothing feels forced. Conversations depending on you're responses and if you are well liked or hated change fluidly and can really change situations, sometimes going as far as changing major story plots. In today's game industry people often go for graphics over gameplay, which is a shame because with Alpha Protocol, it often gets overlooked for just that reason. The game is by no means a ""ugly"" game, it even looks nice in most parts. But it will not blow you away, of course since this game is using the Unreal Engine 3 (a crap engine anyways, one that far too many devs depend on) the standard Unreal Engine 3 issues like texture pop in, and missing textures for a few seconds tend to happen. The gameplay is another issues where this game often gets slammed hard. It is not a 3rd person shooter, it is a RPG mixed with 3rd person shooter elements. You will not go in popping headshots and lighting up the AI with machine guns while chugging down a can of mt. dew. You will need to put the skill points you earn into different weapon types, if you do not put skill points into say, assault rifles, you will not hit anything with them ever. If you want to be Solid Snake and sneak throughout missions, you will need to put skill points into stealth, or you will not be sneaking anywhere. You want to be a expert computer hacker, better put skills into the skill tree for that, also different classes and speicalizations effect you differently as well.  The game also has a large assortment of guns, bullets, items and parts for weapons you can customize you're personal arsenal with. In closing, this is a often overlooked gem brought to you by Obsidian, so it does bugs and sometimes feels kinda rushed, but is still worth playing. If you still feel iffy on it, it goes on sale often for 3$ or less dollars during sales. There is no reason not to give this game a try.			",225,14,1,35,16,0,28

												Takes a little getting used to, but I actually really like this game.  The fact that your decisions affect current and future missions, supply availability, back up, and buffs from your handlers means you really have to watch how you talk to people...and who you feed a bullet to.  Older game, sure, but a pretty good play if you ask me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha Protocol lets you take the role of Michael Thorton, a new agent of the top secret organisation Alpha Protocol. During the game you will solve a global missile crisis, expose traitors and do all that good spy stuff we know and love. The story behind the game is well done, with no plot holes I could find and believable, if slightly caricatured, characters. It will take you through several different missions in an order of your choice, with each mission influencing the other ones and demanding meaningful choices that not only warrant, but leave you encouraged for several playthroughs.Gameplay is varied and easily customized to your liking; in fact, this is one of the very few games where both stealth and going in guns blazing is a valid choice in all situations, though some might favour one thing over the other. Combat is not your standard Third Person Shooter - Mike actually has to aim his weapons, which constantly affords you the choice of going for precise, slow shots or spraying and hoping for the best. This choice is by no means obvious; while precise shots are generally preferable, one kind of weapon (the SMGs) actually rewards spray and pray behaviour.To me, the really interesting part was the dialogue system. Talking to people becomes a far more engaging experience than in other titles simply due to the fact that you are timed and the game actually progresses while you speak. Have a skill on cooldown? Keep the terrorist talking until you're good and ready to take him down. Filled to the brim with adrenaline and fuming at the mouth? Cut his speech short before you come down and your buff runs out. Not only that, but most of the conversations actually feel realistic and have a strong impact on the world around you. If you tell someone off, this will be represented in your later communications, and he might be more hesitant to help you or just not mention information, preferring not to go the extra mile for the idiot that insulted him. Ths makes the game world seem very alive and helps the characters become more than just cutouts with a ""press button, get quest"" mechanism.Not only do you have a choice in the way you fight and the way you talk, you also have an rpg-like levelling system to shape Michael the way you want him to be. Not only are placing skill points and unlocking abilities, the world also changes you. Depending on your actions and the things that happen, you gain perks that can influence everything from hitpoints to skill cooldowns to equipment prices.All in all I heartily recommend you pick up the game if you like spy thrillers and/or third person RPGs/shooters. This game has an awesome storyline and interesting customization options that easily rival games like Mass Effect. However, you should know that more than a few people have reported bugs, some of them game breaking, and while I personally have never encountered any be aware that you may have to fiddle a bit to make everything run smoothly.

												***Welcome to Alpha Protocol Recruit!***Disclaimer: This game is an espionage RPG, NOT a SHOOTER. So your hard-earned split second pixel hunting skills do not matter that much.When I have noticed this game, at first I was sceptical due to multitude of bad reviews out there but the game itself proved me wrong over and over. Feeling masochistic I decided to set the difficulty to hard and chose Recruit background which essentially starts with no skill at all. *Your Career As an Agent*At the initial stages of the game you choose a background and decide about your skills which you shall develop and the amount of different skills provide a good deal of options to you. Whether you want to go in stealthily, guns blazing or with Bond-style techs, you can develop such abilities as the game progresses. Of course when you approach the game you should consider that this game is RPG which means for example when you use an Assault Rifle, investing in some mods to stabilize your weapon and supporting that with some Assault Rifle skills...you will have an easier time. Do not expect shooter style easy aiming. If you are inexperienced at a certain skill do not expect your gaming reflexes to save you. And similarly if you do not invest in Stealth abilities, you will have a hard time remaining unnoticed...but it is not impossible. Everything in this game tries to enhance your preferred gameplay style.Now as an agent of Alpha Protocol you will be given an initial training and then they will send you to certain missions where everything you do or say will have a future consequence. Now that is where the game shines. Every person and organization within game contains a dossier where you can learn about them which can be to your advantage. A person might like aggressive and intimidating approach while another will try to remain professional or sneaky. In dialogues and actions if you reflect such things, then you get on their good sides. But you do not necessarily need to get on their good sides and sometimes antagonizing people could provide you different benefits on the long run. And let me tell you...you shall face several important decisions throughout the game, some doors will open for you some will close. The killer side is the amount of memorable characters and lore the game has. Considering this is an Obsidian game, expect really good writing and indepth lore regarding the gameworld/characters whether it is about an arms dealer or a hierarchical corporation which has too many fingers in every pie across the globe along several side factions which you can encounter as allies or enemies depending on your actions. *So You Want to Be a Hero?*Unlike other games where you hoard countless gold/money/coin where you will never use...Alpha Protocol provides you several tempting options to spend your ill-gotten or hard-earned money throughout missions. You want some intel on a certain person? Maybe an armor fit for stealth? Perhaps we can interest you in some incendiary grenades? You pay up on Clearinghouse which is the online blackmarket ingame where you can buy/sell several weapons, armor, gadgets, ammunition, weapon/armor mods, intelligence regarding missions and support. For example, if you buy a sniper dead drop at a certain mission it might make your job easier or you can hire a surveillance service to provide you detailed map of an area or maybe one of your allies can provide assistance at a mission for a fee. As you can see aside from material stuff in Clearinghouse you can spend your money on things which will alter your missions for better.Of course, there are some downsides to the game since we are in 2016 the graphics will seem a bit outdated but that is easier to get past. There are also minigames which are tolerable except hacking which can be extremely confusing at start but requires a bit getting used to abyssmal mouse control during it and good eyes to spot unchanging code segments. But it is recommended to avoid hacking most of the time if you are not patient and invested in technical abilities which makes the process easier and more palatable. Other minigames are fairly straightforward such as lockpicking and disabling alarms, you shall have no major issues with them. And one last issue could be the hard boss battles which requires tactical approach since they have no mercy. But as a recruit I never gave up, no matter Mike is blasted up with grenades, sub-machine gun'd to death or beaten by several sucker-punches from behind! But yeah boss fights can be hard if you are not properly equipped with some lethal means let it be martial, gunpower or gadgets.Now on my experience there are moments when the game truly shines. On one of the missions I was quite cornered and decided to give up on stealthy-nice guy approach and threw some incendiary grenades to kill 5-6 enemies which then granted me the perk ""Plan B: Kill It With Fire"" which literally cracked me up. On another note, if you go in stealth suit to meet certain people they make fun of you whether you will sneak out after the conversation or not. Which reminds me that the game provides perks based on your actions, choices and playstyle. Even watching news can be helpful at times you know. Also as a final note, Recruit background will have different cutscenes/dialogues/emails then Veteran which is unlocked by finishing the game on Recruit. So there is you NG+ if you are looking to try different things with a more experienced character. But as I initially said Recruit can be hard at start.*Conclusion*Alpha Protocol may have its shortcomings here and there, but if you can look past that you shall have great time with one-of-a-kind espionage RPGs. In my opinion this game is better then games such as Deus Ex: HR which while had excellent differing approaches to missions, they did not have emphasis on relation with other characters too much. In Alpha Protocol nothing is ever black and white. So if you are up for some espionage RPG, give Alpha Protocol a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Garbage mechanics... how this game got released with shooting so horrid and movement so clunky is beyond me.The timed dialog choices are the highlight of this game, but the actual decisions you make don't amount to anything. Choosing dialog options has never been more exciting but once you choose nothing comes out of it long term, a character might pop in later and say ""I'll help you because you helped me"" but you'll never find out what they actually do, or see anything of any significance come out of it. I saved one character at the beginning, so he popped up before the final mission to ""help"". But your character asks ""I need you to broadcast something..."" and the scene fades to black. You never find out what he actually does, what he broadcasts or why... The game's ending is not affected by your choices up to that point as far as I could tell, and the actual resolution of the game's conflict is left to 3 paragraphs of endgame text.I played through because I heard positive things about the dialog and story choices. Those may have been the best parts of the game, but they do not make up for the most horrible gameplay i've experienced in a game in years. Shooting in an RPG is hard to do correctly, but even the original Mass Effect did a better job with it. Borderlands, Fallout and the most recent 2 mass effect games have all found ways to pair RPG concepts with at least passable shooting. How Obsidian couldn't make something even remotely fun to play is beyond me. At least I got the game for like 5 bucks.			",275,72,3,58,55,3,82

												Before you read the review I would like to ask you to ignore my time spent in game - I played this half a dosen times when it was not on Steam and bought it just as a ""thank you"" to developers.I'll start with cons, if you are looking for a good Third Person Shooter, look elsewhere, action part of this game is relatively bad: it's impossible to fatally hit an enemy without aiming for 5 seconds first, a quarter of availiable weapons is not capable of killing at all, AI acts strange and shooting in most levels doesn't really fit with the atmosphere of the game.And that's all, nothing else about this game is bad. It's a fairly decent representative of stealth genre, not Splinter Cell and like level, but still, much better than action part. Overall, traditional TPS\Stealth part is present so that you weren't collapsing in awe before the second part of part of the game. Just invest in stealth to deal with mooks and in pistols to deal with bosses. Now, that second part. When the protagonist is not busy beating up some mooks, on scene comes the talking and reading part of the game. Alpha Protocol features about 20 organisations (titular Alpha Protocol, Al-Samad terrorist group, CIA, NSA, Chinese mafiosos, you got the idea) to interact with and nearly 30 characters. Everyone has his secrets, agendas, loyalities (well, your tech instructor doesn't since his ""secret"" is revealed in the first hour in the game without any effort from your side). And unlike many other games where you refer to some as ""that guy, who is characterised by X"", Alpha Protocol will make you remember everyone. You're guaranteed to pity Sis, respect Albatross and genuinly hate Marburg. Bonus points for not using cliches for the most time (Shaheed, Hong Shi and President Sung are notable exceptions) I've never seen such an image of a Russian mob leader (Konstantin Brayko, for those who decided to play) before.Another amazing thing about this game is complexity of it's plot. After I finished the game for the third time, trying to play differently each time, I decided to check some forums to read opinions\help with problems. I had a major WTF reaction when I saw people discussing event and possibilities and lore details I didn't even suspect to exist. For example, one of the bossfights ends with the boss running away to give you a second chance to beat him\convince him to join your side in the finale. However, If you collect all the pieces of his file, earn his hatred towards you and generally act like a smartass while talking to him, you can mock him, hitting all his weak points, reminding him of his past, which leads to him being so enraged with you that he forgets about his safety just to get a chance to kill you, thus allowing you to kill him. Another example, near the end of the game you have a talk with a pretty asian woman who you were building relationship with for the whole game (that's mostly optional). After talking with her for a couple of minutes you are presented with the following options: continue talking (comes in different flavours) or have sex with her. Guess, which one is more popular... However, if you continue to talk to her, she gives a lot of very interesting information which may affect the endgame if you will choose to use said information.In the end, I recommend this game to everyone, who is capable of finding joy in interesting story. Just don't let the boring beginning in Saudi Arabia to make you lose interest in this masterpiece.			",205,29,12,26,9,0,33

												Although there is a lot of controversy to this topic, i think this game is amazing. As a fan of RPG's and the types of games where you choose your dialog and make choices is probably my favourite genre of video-games, if you're a fan of Mass Effect or perhaps even Witcher, and like the dialog, you will probably like this game.What makes it even better is that it has a pretty fun gameplay, where you could play as the grunt that goes headfirst into fire, or a spy who manipulates people and goes through mission stealthily. It's amazing, you should buy it.			",264,52,2,49,29,2,20

												Don't let the time played fool you-- I've played this game through a ridiculous number of times, and only recently bought the Steam version.Especially at the asking price this is an underrated little gem.  It has its rough edges and (sometimes endearing) glitches here and there, but it's adaptive in terms of both narrative and gameplay style in sometimes astonishing ways that many games claim but few actually deliver with satisfying variety.Do you want to be Batman, and stealthily tear through foes as the master martial artist with the gadgets and the tranq gun?  No problem.Do you want to be Bourne?  Lethally mow foes down in quick shock and awe close combat and pistol chaining?  You betcha.Do you want to just go full on console FPS style heavily armored marine killing machine?  No one will stop you. >:|The three conversation stances, similar to Bioware's conversation system, are meant to evoke the snark of Bond, the ire of Bauer, or the cool head of Bourne; or mix and match them as you please.  Fourth conversation options will also open up depending on what you already know about the person, what origin story you pick... or how well they (dis)like you. Not only that, the game's narrative shifts in often notable and surprising ways depending on what you do, in what order, with whom, and how-- two different plays as Agent Thorton can even yield the -player- a different view of the convoluted conspiracy behind the game's story.This deep, rich story is also one of its downsides-- due to the aforementioned lack of a final polish, some story threads are either vague or missing entirely, and while the otherwise diligent foreshadowing and character dossiers tend to let the player read between the lines rather clearly... the story can be hard to follow -without- going 'waaaaat' and looking deeper.Overall I love this game; I'll replay it again sometime soon, and then again, and then again probably after that.  This last play through, at -least- my eleventh or so, I discovered an entirely different way to kill one of the game's main antagonists.  There's good reason this one's a cult classic.

												Altough a quite unfinished product as what it is, Alpha Protocol has much to offer in the form of the choices you will have to make during your career which in turn will have an effect on your future as an agent. Rather than just being the same old Mikey all the time, you can change your angle of approaching different people, by sometimes pis**** them off with the aggressive style often associated to Jack Bauer or you can just keep them doing favors for you because of the suave style of James Bond you chose to use. Maybe aggressive and suave styles will not always work and you want to keep yourself in the line of duty by being a professional like Jason Bourne. The thing is, you need to learn to adapt yourself to the ever changing environment.When it comes to the action, you can choose to upgrade your skills to match those of Rambo's or put all your efforts on sneaking, depending on which one is more to your liking as a gaming style. Knowing your enemy by simply collecting all the available intel on him/her, gives you a huge advantage if you two decide to pick up a fight. Of course, it's not once or twice you can avoid being beaten up by a giant boxer if you choose the correct phrases. Just be sure to create good relations with the people you meet, and you will find yourself being helped by different organisations if the price is right.Now, I beat Alpha Protocol twice on PS3 system soon after the game was released, and decided to buy it also for my laptop because of the glorious moments I had with it while playing it on PS3 years ago. To this date I have played this game through six times on my laptop, once with every background, and not until now can I say I know just about every twist this game has to offer.Do I need to say anything more? Alpha Protocol has offered me good gaming experiences and memories in the form of a modern espionage RPG. If you are a gamer who dares to look beneath the surface of this highly underrated piece of art, I have no doubt you find yourself being comfortable with it. Just don't forget to turn up the radio guys!			",10,0,0,0,0,0,0

As a fan of RPG's and the types of games where you choose your dialog and make choices is probably my favourite genre of video-games, if you're a fan of Mass Effect or perhaps even Witcher, and like the dialog, you will probably like this game.What makes it even better is that it has a pretty fun gameplay, where you could play as the grunt that goes headfirst into fire, or a spy who manipulates people and goes through mission stealthily. It's amazing, you should buy it.			",264,52,2,49,29,2,20

												Don't let the time played fool you-- I've played this game through a ridiculous number of times, and only recently bought the Steam version.Especially at the asking price this is an underrated little gem.  It has its rough edges and (sometimes endearing) glitches here and there, but it's adaptive in terms of both narrative and gameplay style in sometimes astonishing ways that many games claim but few actually deliver with satisfying variety.Do you want to be Batman, and stealthily tear through foes as the master martial artist with the gadgets and the tranq gun?  No problem.Do you want to be Bourne?  Lethally mow foes down in quick shock and awe close combat and pistol chaining?  You betcha.Do you want to just go full on console FPS style heavily armored marine killing machine?  No one will stop you. >:|The three conversation stances, similar to Bioware's conversation system, are meant to evoke the snark of Bond, the ire of Bauer, or the cool head of Bourne; or mix and match them as you please.  Fourth conversation options will also open up depending on what you already know about the person, what origin story you pick... or how well they (dis)like you. Not only that, the game's narrative shifts in often notable and surprising ways depending on what you do, in what order, with whom, and how-- two different plays as Agent Thorton can even yield the -player- a different view of the convoluted conspiracy behind the game's story.This deep, rich story is also one of its downsides-- due to the aforementioned lack of a final polish, some story threads are either vague or missing entirely, and while the otherwise diligent foreshadowing and character dossiers tend to let the player read between the lines rather clearly... the story can be hard to follow -without- going 'waaaaat' and looking deeper.Overall I love this game; I'll replay it again sometime soon, and then again, and then again probably after that.  This last play through, at -least- my eleventh or so, I discovered an entirely different way to kill one of the game's main antagonists.  There's good reason this one's a cult classic.

												Wicked game. Most fun I've had with a spy-style game in a long time. Storyline is a bit hard to follow at times, and it's a decent web of pro/antagonists. Combines a few RPG and ""Choose your dialogue"" options which keeps everything fresh.			",37,2,4,9,13,1,16

												Overall, Alpha Protocol is a hidden gem and another game from Obsidian that hit the mark for me.  Basically, the plot is okay, the characters are alright, the combat is meh.  However, the reactivity and C&C (choice and consequence) is very noticeable, and may permeate more areas of the game than any other I have played.  This means that you have real impact on how the game plays out.  Occasionally, my Michael Thornton would end up saying something unexpected based on the limited dialog wheel and it would alter the game in a way I did not want, but I am willing to overlook that for what the game does well.  If you and a buddy of yours were to each play this game separately, it's likely that your experiences would be vastly different.  For that reason, it is a game that everyone should try at least once.			",94,17,0,26,5,0,8

												A glorious flop, Alpha Protocol is a highly ambitious project with great ideas but weak gameplay. Sitting in the Deus Ex genre of rpg-stealth-action-espionage, it offers a customizable protagonist and a game world that reacts to your chosen style of play and personality to present a long, branching storyline where your choices really do matter. Friends might betray you, enemies might become allies, and the plot has plenty of ways it can wrap up. Stealth mechanics are passable and easily broken by overpowered skills, combat is fairly generic, but between plot and player choice and overall style, it creates a distinct sense of immersion and does a fine job really making you feel like a spy. Frustrating at times, but satisfying, it's worth a look if you enjoy a game you can play any way you want to.			",374,111,9,41,22,4,35

												Sadly massivly under-rated, this was a suprisingly great roleplaying game attempting to break the genre norm. People either love it or hate it and obviously I belong to the first group. The modern day setting actually allowed for choices with consequences were the consequences were real, were your character did not need to be send a random email by each random npc to create the illusion of actions having meaning. And, for the same reason, some moral questions were a lot harder.			",204,127,0,74,35,3,64

												I will be stoned for this, but Alpha Protocol is quite a lot like Deus Ex, only much better.

The critical panning the game got was not only undeserved, but also shameful.			",245,124,1,28,8,1,32

												Alpha Protocol is best, and perhaps most favorably described as different. It is the standard cover based third person shooter stealth game mixed in with a dialog system and storytelling mechanics that would put any RPG to shame.The variety of choices and options in this game, and how they effect everything from the storyline to stat bonuses is truly inspired. It is one of the few games that can honestly claim that every game will play different and deliver on that promise.The gameplay is fairly generic however and it is marred by seemingly unending wave of bugs that can turn an otherwise entertaining game into a frustrating exercise in teeth-grinding within minutes.Despite it's obvious problems Alpha Protocol should be applauded for integrating choice and consequence into the gameplay in a way Bioware can only dream of. The mediocre gameplay and exorbitant amount of bugs however means this will never be the classic it was meant to be. Such a shame.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

 Alpha Protocol™  Play as Michael Thorton, an agent who after the first mission learns of inconvenient facts and is forced to leave the agency and act on his own to discover the truth. This production is very good in terms of storyline, character variation and making hard choices. This is pretty good stealth game but poor TPS which in my opinion it gain more when we try not to kill anyone on our way. In my opinion, the game is good and I enjoyed it very well. An engaging storyline, interesting characters, developing and improving characters and equipment, difficult choices and the variety of locations we visit. As for me, this is a title worth recommending. ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Think Deus Ex: Human Revolution but with spies.It's really good but has some deep flaws that don't deteriorate from the experience, just like DE:HR.Stealth and pistols, just like in HR, are extremely broken. With some low-level perks you can pre-aim your pistol through walls, going for easy headshot kills. Add a silencer to your pistol and you can just take out rooms of enemies one by one. It is cheesy, but pretty fun.The plot is really good, with well rounded characters with their own allegiances.If you've enjoyed Human Revolution, then you get this game.			",376,82,13,39,35,5,60

												This was an OK experience. I like to think of AP as a cross between Mass Effect & Batman Arkham...Maybe even Deus Ex!But...you can really pass this up.If you're REALLY considering reading this whole review, let me tell you whyAS A STEALTH GAMEFirst of all, gameplay is mostly stealthy. That is: Hiding, waiting for enemies to have their backs turned, then kill them without being detected. That is pretty cool. But the feel of the rest of the gameplay just didn't do it for me. Combat kind of blows. It's just not FLUID at all and the amount of control feels like I'm prodding a pregnant cow. For everything it can offer, I would rather be playing a Batman Arkham game when said and done. If you're looking for a Stealth game, do not buy this game, go buy Arkham Asylum. ""But...COMBAT?!"" Yes, you can customize your character to be more run-and-gun...but it just wasn't polished enough to really make it feasable alternative. Shooting with that silenced pistol was really cool though. Expect to take a long♥♥♥♥♥time trying to get unreasonably lucky on some hard bosses.AS AN ESPIONAGE GAMEThere is hacks, gadgets, electronic sautering, lockpicking... yes. They are nice little minigames to make you feel espionagey. But by the end of the game, you want to stick a lockpick up your♥♥♥♥♥if ONE more of these just gives you money (money is used to buy better gear...but you really don't NEED better gear). Nothing that is actually mission-changing at ALL. The integration of these into the actual missions were below expectation, but it was a good effort especially as sometimes it would give you some story.AS AN RPGThis is where Alpha Protocal helps to outshine it's not-as-good-as-Batman stealth gameplay. This I went IN not expecting to like the story, but it was actually pretty cool. The protagonist is way more likable than expected. Not the most AMAZING story, but still pretty OK!Like MASS EFFECT, you get to CHOOSE how you want conversations to go. You can indicate the mood throughout the conversation. Very cool. A LOT like Mass Effect, but with it's own little twist! Kind of felt like a cheaper version of it. You can Romance women you've kept close near the end, but don't expect anything dramatic...could be a horribly animated kiss, then a ""Mission Completed"". Not close to even Bioware romances. But, the transitions are kind of cheesy, almost immersion breaking to an already semi-bland story. The things/coroprations that are ""mysterious"" in the story, are uninteresting, and I really couldn't care less about learning about them.The story is run on semi-tracks. Kind of like Mass Effect...linear...but you get to choose your linearism to some degree. Emphasis on SOME degree. Little freedom, but what it is is very appreciated. Go to Saudi Arabia base. Then to Taiwan, Rome, Moscow (those 3 in any order). Then final mission. The safehouse feature was very cool, but honestly I couldn't help feeling like implementation of overall RPG elements was an EXTREMELY poor effort.""What about the SKILLS?!"" To put bluntly, choosing your class isn't really important. It's not really a necessary feature even (you choose whatever skills you want anyway)... the skills aren't very diverse and your choice in them don't really change your gameplay in an already linear game. If you choose anything but spy...you're going to have a ♥♥♥♥♥ier time because combat is not feasably enough implemented to go run-and-gunning. Don't expect Mass Effect skill options/progression...and DEFINITELY don't expect Skyrim status on this. Very basic, not worth getting worked up over.REPLAYABILITY??It's OK...but not really unless you have a strong desire to watch this a second time. Like Mass Effect, the story is pretty much the same, but with different outcomes in the middle if you choose a different dialogue option. But it's importance is severely lessened in Alpha Protocal. I have no interest to replay the story again for another 10 years. Like I said above, class/skill variety is way too lacking to expect replaying just for that as well. CONLCUSIONLook at other games like this closely before buying. There are a lot of similarities Alpha Protocal shares with other games, but is absolutely sub-par compared to them.♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm always optimistic & thumbs up in reviews, but I just CAN'T be with this game. It's just OK. The story was pretty cool, but it is just another game touched by Obsidian. Alpha Protocal = don't worry about it			",69,2,0,16,10,1,8

												If you've ever wanted to be a secret agent like 007 or Jason Borne then Alpha Protocol might just be what you're looking for!The good:+The story feels like a fun mix between James Bond and the Borne Identity movies.+The dialogue and writing is snappy, funny and delivered fairly well by voice actors throughout.+The gameplay feels akin to Deus Ex in that you customize your own character and play as you please.+The levels encourage exploration as you can find hidden stashes of cash, dossiers or even upgrades.+The game is fairly short, but encourages multiple playthroughs with different approaches in both gameplay and story decisions.The bad:-Animations tend to be stiff and robotic.-The camera zooms in too close and can be clunky to work with.-The combat is poorly executed and you should at least max one weapon skill to keep up.-Plays awful with a mouse and keybord, get a controller and enable it in the options menu in-game.-Bugs, bugs, bugs! It just wouldn't be an Obsidian game without them.-The final mission feels rushed and is more bugged than the rest of the game.Bottom Line:Alpha Protocol is a rough gem that will leave you frustrated at times, but satisfied by the end. If you're unsure I would suggest you pick the game up during a sale.			",157,45,0,20,14,1,30

												So underrated. Yes, the combat kind of sucks (it's servicable, but is entirely consolized and a bit wonky at times), but the real reason to play this game is the dialogue system. It's rare enough for video games to get something as mundane as people talking right so when it does happen it's a bit of a revelation. Dialogue options not only give you bonuses and pay off in real ways that affect the plot, but they are also timed--so rather than allowing you to sit and mull over what your character should say you need to make snap judgements and live with the consequences of your decisions. The result is that talking to people becomes a form of combat all its own--something which is, admittedly, much more exciting than the more literal forms of combat the game throws at you, but which is revolutionary enough on its own to make the game worth playing. Plus the plot/dialogue are well written enough to mostly rise above their hodge-podge of spy tropes and cliches. An overlooked (if rough) gem.			",214,85,2,68,14,0,27

												I originally purchased Alpha Protocol for PS3 when it came out a few years back.  After playing about midway through it I found it to be pretty boring and dropped it.  During the recent Steam sale I picked it up for PC and finished it today.  The story is very engaging and you meet a number of very interesting characters throughout the story.  The graphics are dated and the cover, shooting, and stealth are a little iffy at times.  However I have to say the game was very fun to play and had an original story with RPG elements unlike anything else I've played.  The dialogue choices alone make you want to replay certain sections to determine which responses may have alternate paths to take.  Again this one is primed for a replay and recommended to anyone that is willing to look past some of the unpolished parts and enjoy the game for what it is.			",61,8,0,10,0,0,0

												Alpha Protocol is a 3rd person RPG game made by Obsidian Entertainment. You play as Michael Thorton, an agent with a top secret branch of the CIA.I can not speak highly enough about this game. Yes it does have some issues which I will get to in a bit but overal this game is amazing and very much worth your time if you are interested in the RPG genre. Lets start off with the pro's for this game.Gameplay: You have 3 options for how to play the game right out of the gate. You can play as either a complete stealth style never being noticed by anyone. A middle of the road style where you use stealth to take out your enemys. Also an FPS style in which you go in guns blazing with no regard for stealth at all. This alone opens up many hours of replayability and is something I personally have not seen very often.Customization: Just about everything about your character, except general looks, can be customized. Your weapons, what gear you take with you, and your armor or lack there of are all fully customizable giving you a plethora of options for each misson you go on.Dialogue: The dialogue system is top notch giving you multiple options for how you want to respond, some of which are very entertaining. This also leads into a reputation and romance system that is very well developed for characters that actually make you care about them on some level.Impact: This is probably the most important part, at least for me. The decisions you make in game, who you talk to, how you handle each situation, all matter a great deal in this game. Your choices have consequences and you have to carefully consider what you want to say, how to say it, and what to do at any given moment.Now  lets touch on the negatives for this game, and yes, sadly there are a few.AI: The enemies in Alpha Protocol are not the best out there. The can be rather predictable at times and glitch out. That being said it is not game breaking in any way and personally it didn't bother me all that much.Combat: Alpha Protocol is first and foremost a console game. It was ported over to the PC and as such has a combat system that at times can feel clunky and drive you nuts. Once you get used to it though you can get through the game just fine.Hacking: There really is no other way to say it, the hacking minigame in Alpha Protocol is absolutly terrible. It really could have used an overhaul but it sadly never came.Bugs: There are a few other bugs in the game some of which can be quite annoying but I personally never experienced anything to dramatic or game  breaking.Graphics: This was a console game that is pretty old at this point and was ported over to the PC. The graphics are not top tier yet at the same time I have seen a LOT worse out there.TLDR: Alpha Protocol  is a great game very much worth the asking price and even more so if you can get it on sale. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Granted its a dog to play with keyboard & mouse but use a 360 controller and you are laughing all the way.Visually its a nice looking game that runs well on most systems, only downside is that the textures can pop in, this happens on the kit out screen and in the safehouse usually, however if you remember Mass Effect was equally as bad for this!Decent branching story where your decisions do actually change outcomes later down the line.Wish I had actually picked this up sooner than what I did!

												i'd love to say that i absolutely without any doubt recommend this game, but i'm honestly a bit more lukewarm on it than i wanted to be. i'll say it right here, if you want a stealth action game with rpg elements, this game is not going to cut it at all. the stealth is super janky, the hacking and lockpicking minigames are fidgety and progress to being almost unplayable by the end, and the shooting is awful with pistols just becoming an instant win button as you specialize in them and martial arts being fun, but super janky and kind of useless in later portions.it kind of lacks the polish in its core gameplay to make you feel like an incredibly stylish and smooth secret agent, you just end up feeling like a crazy maniac dashing around punching people and chainshotting entire rooms and then the camera bugs out and you're running in the opposite direction. which is fun in its own way, but the game gets frustrating like that.the important thing, though, is the character interaction. i like the writing in a lot of obsidian's games, and while i can't say the plot in this particular game really astounded me, it was a great vehicle for character interaction, which is the real highlight. the way you talk to people, the way people think of you, they're all recorded in-game and while a lot of games just have it as window dressing, it's actually really in-depth here. every mission presents you with choices to make, and every choice has a big effect on other missions and the way people view you. and ultimately, it all really does add up in a lot of key interactions.so when it comes to all that, i consider that part of the game strong enough to at least be worth taking a look at. i wouldn't say this is a game you should pick up for full price, but it goes on sale often, and if you're interested in that aspect of the game, it's definitely worth a look for sale price. all that, and stephen heck, who i can assure you if you are a good and just person will become your best friend.

												This game has its flaws, it has a clunky combat system if you were coming from Mass Effect however, the story and the dialogue make this game a suprising delight. Would recommend it to anyone who loves adventure-rpg games. Also when I got it when it was on sale for 2 USD a couple years back, making it a definite steal for what I paid for it. Hope they make a sequel with a improved combat system in the future. In summary, its a diamond in the rough, takes the right kind of player to appreciate this game.			",88,5,2,5,1,0,6

												Pros: - The game has a great story, interesting characters that will react to you and your actions (helli liked every character)- The perk system is awesome, giving you a ton of different options to choose from ( from stealth to firearms to hacking)- The game is highly replayable- I loved collecting dossiers on different people and factions in the game, provides an extrainsight into the story- Game ain't to hard unless you want it to be (tip: don't start on the hardest difficulty)- It takes around 20-25 hours to finish the game depending on how you play it- The dialogue system works in a way that you have 3 stances: Suave (James Bond), proffesional (Jason Bourne) and agressive (Jason Statham) giving you the choice to make Mike the character you want him to beCons:- First level is boring but it gets much better after it- The gunplay makes me cringe everytime, it's unpredictable and the only way to hit someone is to wait for your croshair to ""charge up"" while out of cover, it gets better if you upgrade your perks- Even with my good pc the game stutters here and there, luckily you can fix it by messing with the ini ( backup your files first)- Graphically it can put some people off- There are some areas where you have to play the way you don't want to ( Fist fighting with your stealth only character) but thankfully that's just 2-3 areasNeutral:- The hacking minigames are nothing special, same for lockpicking- The cover system works as intended but it ain't anything specialBuy the game, play it one way then replay it with different choices.I found this to be one of Obsidians best games.

												Alpha Protocol  is a prime example of early games made by Obsidian. Great concept attached to unfinished, buggy game. You play as Michael Thorton, special agent on his quest to stop global terrorism... or whatever. Story isn't that important in this case. What's really interesting is choices and consequences mechanic. During the game you will have to make a lot of decisions and most of them actually matters. Depending on what you say through a conversations, how you approach missions etc. you will get different outcome. The consequences vary from something as simple as skill boost to more complicated things like loosing or gaining allies. Furthermore you can choose in which order you play the missions and it has impact on the story too. I'm not saying that it will change it diametrically but certain things will differ. Generally Alpha Protocol can be divided into two parts. The first is built around choices, the dialogue system, character customisation and leveling up. Also in this part you will be preparing before missions which includes more dialogues and briefings. It's all great. But there is the second part. Missions itself. And they are bad. Theoretically you can be sneaky or go full Rambo but more often than not you will end up killing every enemy on a level anyway. Just because simple “miscontrol” (and controling Thorton is real pain sometimes) or because you've “misclicked” during mini game and activated an alarm. You can of course restart and try again, but everyone has their limits and sooner or later you'll have to answer the question: how many restarts is too many, and then go full Rambo. It wouldn't be that bad if combat was properly executed, but it's not. Shooting is boring, blank experience. There are martial arts too, but to fully enjoy them you would have to be stealthy and as I said it's not that simple.Despite it's flaws Alpha Protocol is solid, good looking game with great concept behind it. Definitely worth to give it a shot. But it's your choice to make.Disclaimer: I'm living in third world country so my english is poor. Sorry :( ",102,38,0,10,3,0,15

												Alpha Protocol is one of those games that sneaks under the radar for most people but is actually a pretty decent game. It plays and feels like Mass Effect but with a spy setting. You play agent Mike Thorton who is recruited to a secret spy agency called Alpha Protocol and you find youself embroiled in a plot to kick off a new cold war which you need to stop. The strenghs of this game are in it's RPG elements. You can conversate with other characters via a dialogue sytem similar to Mass Effect and Dragons Age 2. Depending on what you say to a character can influence their opinion of you, which in turn can affect what they're willing to tell you. Get friendly enough with a character and they might help you later on in the game via intel or providing support on missions. The choices you make also have an impact later on in the game, for example going all gung-ho ona mission lead to more enemies in the next mission as security is increased.The combat sections of the game is what lets it down. You can use various weapons which can be upgraded in your mission,as well as abilites you unlock as the game progresses. The combat does get repetetive after a while though an interesting mechanic is the ability to acquire intel before a mission which gives you advantages like reducing enemy numbers or a sniper rifle drop.Another interesting feature is the intel you can collect on factions and individual characters. Instead of being useless filler information, this intel can be useful in giving you hints in how to get a character to like you in a conversation or the tactics they use in a fight should you need to fight them.The Good:- interaction with other characters is this games main strength as well as the many ways and options you have in dealing with other characters and in missions.-levelling system is pretty good with each point gained in a skill conferring you a bonus of some sort.-Weapons and body armor customization is pretty good and varied-the intel feature is pretty good and is actually of use instead of being just fillerThe Bad:- combat isn't great and gets repetitive-game is pretty buggy at times.(i found my character was getting stuck in the ground every now and again)Overall this game is pretty good if a bit flawed. Worth picking up if you enjoy action-rpgs like Mass Effect and Dragons Age. 7/10			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

A Flawed MasterpieceFrom the get-go: the gameplay is TERRIBLE. It's simply awful; animations are terrible, enemy AI is either ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or omniscient, the mini-games scale poorly to the point of being nearly completely broken; fortunately once you learn how to exploit it it is incredibly easy.The gameplay however is the flawed part.The plot, however, is simply amazing. I'm not referring simply to the story. It's how it plays out that is simply amazing. When most games claim that actions have consequences they usually mean that you merely get to choose some buttons at the end and a pat on the back because you killed few or no people.With Alpha Protocol this is not the case. Everything you do changes everything around you. Every single gameplay can be different merely because of how you chose to react to certain people. And the NPCs react to who you are to the point of some being able to figure you out because of your past actions and reputation.This even reflects itself in the gameplay where there are perks related to your play style but also how you roleplay. Basically it's possible to be (somewhat) uniquely rewarded for all possible play styles. Are you a pacifist? Kill everyone? Mix and match? Are you nice to people? Irreverent? Random? You'll be rewarded.That's why it's a masterpiece. Play it twice and you'll start to see it. From then on you'll start seeing how every little detail is a part of something bigger and a single playthrough is not enough to experience the entire plot or even the full extent of possibilities within the game itself.This of couse only applies to people who actually like games with a plot. If you're the run & gun type to whom games are merely ""violence porn"" and you zone out if someone doesn't get shabbed every 45 seconds then don't even buy this since it'll just be fodder for you to ""write"" a terrible review.I blame SEGA for rushing this.

Granted its a dog to play with keyboard & mouse but use a 360 controller and you are laughing all the way.Visually its a nice looking game that runs well on most systems, only downside is that the textures can pop in, this happens on the kit out screen and in the safehouse usually, however if you remember Mass Effect was equally as bad for this!Decent branching story where your decisions do actually change outcomes later down the line.Wish I had actually picked this up sooner than what I did!

												I downloaded this on sale years ago, and tried many, many times to start a campaign. This time around I finally got beyond the training and played through the game. It's not the worst game I've ever played, but it's not good either. In this very short campaign, you'll encounter glitched enemies who appear randomly in sight, visuals cutting out, loading textures, and very poor weapon accuracy (which is based on how patient you are).The story itself is quite good, and my desire to see how everything worked out was my main motivation in finishing the game. I really enjoyed the conversation system, which legitimately has a serious impact on how the story of the game unfolds. The replayability is solely in these conversations, as one can try out different paths to see the story unfold in a different way. Unfortunetely, the game itself is not very good so replaying it solely for the story doesn't interest me at all.This game is only for hardcore RPG fans who have the patience to overlook the game's obvious flaws. If you are a completionlist who would like to play through all of Obsidian's games, then by all means get this. There is a good game somewhere in here, but just not good enough to recommend to anyone other than the previously mentioned.			",218,23,0,69,6,1,24

												I was impressed by the depth of story and dialogue choices in this game, and how the approach you take with people will have an impact on their impressions of you, and also that there are different effects based on what you choose. It's also one of the few games I've seen where having a low reputation with some people can actually work in your favor, if you prefer not to cater to everyone. The combat is fun and as for the character you have a lot of different skills to develop how you like; you can focus more on stealth or go hand to hand, or choose from pistols, SMGs, shotguns, or assault rifles. There are diffferent types of each weapon class with different stats and the same goes for armor; plus, all of the above can be customized with a variety of parts you can buy to improve the weapon or armor abilities further. If you played and liked Mass Effect and/or Deus Ex, you would probably enjoy this too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha protocol can be summed up as a middling game at best gameplaywise, but an amazing showcase of choice and consequence.The actually gameplay is best ignored as much as possible, by one of the broken builds available, to better experience the way the story can change depending on your choices and actions. Your actions, and how diligently you keep track of the information you gather can change a playthrough completely. You will largely play through the same levels (although some are only available if you do/discover certain things) but the way they play out are rather different. Your foes can become friends and vice versa.			",147,13,0,29,4,0,39

The storyline is extremely well written, the characters are really developed, the dialogue is top notch, and there are multiple endings depending on the choices you make. Ever character has a unique viewpoint on your character and how you act which changes the game world around you. Occasionally, you will have problems with little things like a puzzle or combat, but the storyline and characters more than make up for any trouble you might have. 9/10			",62,21,1,13,20,0,32

												Alpha Protocol, more accurately the critical response thereto, is a monument to games journalisms’ need for art-house institutions willing to judge games on non-commercial, non-standard merits. Considering Alpha Protocol as one considers most AAA-titles reveals a failed experiment: a reactive plot with inconsistent characters, gunplay that doesn’t quite land, unbalanced skill-trees that result in a clear hierarchy of character builds, and a floundering finale. These properties are, in some ways, Obsidian’s hallmark: since KOTOR2 and NWN2 the studio (my personal favourite working studio) has been plagued with releasing inconsistent products. In some ways, Alpha Protocol is the worst offender: there are some marring bugs that were never fixed which can lead to very flawed plays. Despite the above mentioned issues—even the slightly bland story and inconsistent characters—I’ve played through Alpha Protocol three times and enjoyed each pass. Obsidian remind me of a quote from Tony Kushner (American dramatist most famous for Angels in America): Kushner distinguishes between two types of artists, “the ones who ask small questions but give great answers and the ones who ask huge questions and often, as a consequence of the ambitiousness of their questioning, fail to give good answers”. Kushner holds that both are necessary, and I agree with him; Obsidian and their works should be treated as the second category. They ask huge questions about RPG design, and though they fail, the questions themselves are both a merit and a necessity. Alpha Protocol questions the very foundations of RPGs: it is not science fiction or fantasy, it has a branching plot in which the player is almost fifth business instead of universal saviour, and there is no party. Spies, turncoats, flashbacks take you on a global adventure that feels, ultimately, small: this isn’t fate of the galaxy (KOTOR) or fate of the Great Wheel (NWN2) stuff. We have a relatively localized plot that, while slightly bland and riddled with some forgettable characters, unfolds organically and persuasively. Everything feels like it happens for a reason, and you never question your character’s role in it; the game is quite good at being reactive (or at least appearing so, and illusion is everything) and that’s the whole goal. And on the merit of its questions, I think Alpha Protocol is an important game. It asks: does an RPG need a party? (no); can it deal with slightly smaller stakes? (yes); can it play like an action game instead of an excel simulator? (yes), etc. I would never absolve Alpha Protocol of its bugs or failures—one particular bug causes all enemies on a map to disappear, which can make some areas of the game unforgivably bland, until you figure out that it’s a bug you can correct by shutting down and reloading, which is still unacceptable—but regardless I recommend the game as a glimpse of what RPGs could be like. And, honestly, the bugs aren’t that bad; if you’ve made your way through STALKER, you’ve played far worse on that front.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal rating: 8/10Replayability: MediumBudget: It's not an expensive game, it's an older title by now. It's worth the money. Lenght: A couple of full days worth of playing should get you through. This game has a lot of excellence. While occasionally, it seems a bit like a parody on spy-series and spy movies alike, it does a really great job of portraying the setting of being some sort of secret agent. Gameplay wise, it doesn't quite live up to modern standards. Don't ge me wrong, it's more than playable. Heck, it's even enjoyable, but certain things in the game could defiantely have been done better. Prettier. Aiming for instance, and the clunky animation from the sneaking motion. Some of the equipment in the game looks outright stupid, but apart from that, most of it is pretty cool and resembles real-life tactical equipment. The game features a lot of roleplaying elements in- and outside of missions. Over-all, I'd say Alpha Protocol is the best ""agent"" game out there, the reason I'm punishing it's rating is because it's not that old, and yet in a few ways it looks much older than it is. Dialogue is great, missions are good and it even incorporates quite a bit of humor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alpha ProtocolMy vote: 8.5/10Mark my words: ""If one day I'll be rich... I will pay for a sequel""I just finished this game.it's beautiful !!!That was my first rpg game for PC, I get fun and interest for the story and mechanics.The story, omg, is near the perfection.All your decisions, will be important in this videogame. Will change the game, like the support, or the allies-enemies.Your relationship with the people will be important, If you will be evil with them, they will do the same. Or If you will be a good person with them, they will do the same with you, like information or help in the missions.You'll decide if kill or not someone, or save or not someone. And the reputation system, I really like it.Yes this game have bad animations, graphic, mechanics. But the missions are funny and the story, I told you, for me is near the perfection.Guys, I don't know why this game get so much negative votes, 6 years ago. Maybe for the graphic, but you should just play this game for the story.Guys you can get this game for only 2 euros from some sites.This game for me is the best in the RPG games.I will miss Michael Thorton.* I played just 8 hours because I got this game for Xbox 360, 6 years ago (Day One)* Sorry for my little errors in English			",148,35,8,18,15,5,19

												After playing other games since finishing Alpha Protocol, I keep wishing those that boast a great conversation and choice system would look towards this game as a way to do it well. Possibly the best thing about the game that at best is a flawed gem, there's no doubt that it is a gem, so long as you're willing to look past just how flawed it is.Make no mistake, the whole game feels clunky, almost as if it was designed after all its characters, plot and the flow-chart-requiring choice system was implemented. It features that bizarre aspect of playing better the further in you get as you put points into your RPG'd character. That said, it does feel like catering to every aspect of a spy-in-fiction available, from sauvé Bond-esque conversationalist, cool-gadget user and pistol-preferring gentleman, to the Bourne ""beat the crap outta them!"" specialist in martial arts. It's just a shame that while you're developing these, or even your own character idea, that you must suffer the wonky gameplay in the mean time; shooting, some stealth sections and particularly the boss fights are all rough around the edges, but work just enough to be passable.Again, the emphasis is on everything else. There are some fantastic characters that are incredibly well developed and will no doubt linger with you for some time after playing. Dialogue and the story are clever and whilst the over-arching plot might be a bit been-there-done-that, it never takes center-stage and thus never feels like it's letting the side down. The reason you should want to play the game is for every conversation you have which is directed by the need to read into non-playable-characters, both from the dialogue you're having with them that second and in collected information along the way, so that by the end you can try and manipulate the situation to your want.It's a slog to suffer through, but come the conclusion I felt incredibly satisfied that it was all worth it for an experience I've not enjoyed in any other game. My advice would to be turn up the radio and push on through.*Played with a 360 controller as keyboard and mouse controls felt sub-par.			",88,6,4,5,3,1,10

												Another half-baked game from Obsidian.The dialogue system is good. The story is more or less intriguing. But the rest is complete crap.Movement is clunky. Camera is bad. Shooting is horrible. And melee is even worse. Character development system is too primitive. Locations are too linear and provide almost no variety in walkthrough. Enemies are super dumb, but have a great aim and spot you immediately (played on hard). And if you thought you could bear all that because it's a stealth game - no, you can't. There are moments when the game throws enemies at you and the only way to deal with them is a direct confrontation.If you want a spy game, play Splinter Cell or No One Lives Forever. If you want an RPG/shooter, play Mass Effect. If you want cyberpank stealth/shooter, play Deus Ex. Alpha Protocol tries to be everything at once and fails miserably.			",290,110,2,36,13,2,29

												Alpha Protocl is a truly stellar Western Role-playing game. Developed by Obsidian, the guys behind Fallout New Vegas, this role-playing game puts you in the role of Mike, a spy for Alpha Protocol. Mass Effect and Dragon Age are lauded for their ability to have branching storylines, and many feel that those games don't deliver too well. Alpha Protocol is the answer to those people's complaints, as the perfect synegy between storyline and gameplay. Storyline truly branches around what the player says, and whole missions change and even become available based on your decisions. The character is given three different conversational tracks to choose from, which are based on personalities similar to Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer, and James Bond. Combat is RPG-based, and the skills you take really modify what your character can and can't do. No other recent game truly puts agency of the player, and allows him to so fully shape the game.With all of that said, Alpha Protocol IS pretty buggy. Not game-breakingly so, but still to the degree that it could put some people off the purchase of this game.Get this game if you loved Fallout New Vegas, or you felt that Mass Effect or Dragon Age left you wanting. Or if you want to be a kickass spy. Because, who doesnt?			",666,148,13,70,77,5,91

												I love this game. Don't let any of those trolls get you down on the negative aspects because if you are a fan of any spy in the history of literature then you will love this. This made me watch Bond, Mission Impossible, 24 and Taken again just for reference. The first playthrough I wanted to get a feel for it so I went with the Mission Impossible route, some jokes, some professionalism, making friends with poeple you come accross for info. Then I played full bond, just a pistol, no armor, stealth, suave and of course if you are a Roger Moore fan, the corny and suggestive jokes. Then I played as Jack Bauer, agressive, confrontational, but knows when to kill and not to kill. Then I played full on Taken and opened up a can of Liam Neeson on my enemies which turned it into less of a spy movie and more into a Rambo like movie where anyone who got in my way or was a potential threat....they were dealt with. So if you are a big fan of either one here is the playstyle to follow.Ethan Hunt: Mixuture of everything including armor and weapons, little to no suave but plenty of jokes and yet maintain seriousness and mostly stealth 007: You can be as aggressive as Brosnan and Craig or as snarky and funny as Moore, to the cockyness of Connery and if you feel the need to throw in some Dalton gun play go for it. However everyone besides Dalton does not wear any kind of armor so be warned. Jack Bauer: Again little to no armor but damn aggressive and up front, you basically carves through anyone he wishes yet spares those he has has to. This would be the hard gameplay.Liam Neeson: This would be the INSANE game style, no armor, just a pistol, wits and of course you eliminate EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE. Which makes everyone mad but hey its Neeson we are talking about here.Then you have others:The strong quiet types like Steven Seagal to Rambo and the Commando Arnold (which is a specialization option) So which ever spy you want to emulate go for it. I prefer Bond and word to the wise, download a track or two from the movies, really sets the RPG mood.			",10,2,0,4,0,0,0

Mike: I'm a spy.Scarlet: (laugh) Did this line ever worked?Mike: I don't know, are you impressed?Scarlet: No.Mike: Then never.― Mission: Picking Up. Status: Failed ;)Obsidian Entertainment. Interplay Entertainment. Black Isle Studios. Different varieties and the same common, great story - the best RPG's ever. And probably the last title, which I have not played - Alpha Protocol.After 23h (two full runs):PROS+ three JB styles - Bond, Bourne, Bauer + Agent History styles & Advance for 2nd run...+ ...resulting different game's style during a mission+ full customization - weapons, gears, armors, beards and mustaches ;)+ dialogue system+ locations and their structure+ very nice NPC's+ reputation and romances (in 007 style [or Buck from KillBill ;P] My name's Mike, and I'm here to give you my pike.)+ nice character development+ last, but MOST important - REAL choices and consequences in a REAL non-linear storylineCONS- enemies AI- flawed combat system- and terrifying MASS of smaller and larger bugs sometimes completely ruining all the pros...- EDIT: somehow I forgot about the terrible, massacred-my-eyes, inhumanely against human rights... hacking.Subjective rate: A+ for non-linear choices and consequences, and for that you really feel like a secret agent/spy/mercenary in international intrigueB- or C+ for story AND technical sideD or F only for technical sideF+atality for hacking styleReally, I have no clue why released to market as terribly technically underdeveloped game like this. And what the strangest thing - despite all the bugs... story is complete and consistent. Whatever you do, whatever you choose - there are no gaps as in the case of (for example another Obsidian) Fallout: New Vegas.Strange. This game is no longer count on any patches, but surely it deserves a sequel, with the same dose of juicy RPG AND with normal engine, without the dramatic novice programmer's mistakes.

												One of the best RPG's ever made and that is it's biggest strength and flaw. The story is great with a lot of replayability, The skills are many and allow you to play any way you want. But at the same time this game can be slow and sluggish, this isn't Mass Effect you can't go guns blazing without aiming and you can't sneak without waiting and planning ahead.So if you are ever looking for a pure amazing story with many ways to change the outcome, and a large amount of skills then this game is for you.

												This is an excellent game. I haven't had this much fun sneaking around in a long time.  Story is very good.  Gameplay is amazing.  I'm not completely done with it, but I'm probably going to replay it again as soon as its done.Its essentially all the best parts of the Metal Gear Solid games, but without all the crazy japanese stuff. (Sometimes I like crazy japanese stuff, like enemies who are genetically merged with wasps, but its also nice to have a great stealth game thats a tad more serious).Sidenote:  You will see  a ton of horribe reviews for this game, because when it was released around 2010, the AI was horrible.  Since then its been patched, and the AI is good, so disregard old reviews, only listen to recent ones.10/10   This is one of the best stealth/spy/espionage games ever.			",237,57,2,46,32,4,17

												I feel like writting reviews today so i need to post one about this game wich is one of my favorites. Don't look my Steam play time i already completed the game twice elsewhere.So the game is just GREAT if what you are looking for is IMMERSION despite some flaws. If you can enjoy Gothic 1/2 despite the graphics and clumsy combat/movement and get yourself immersed into it after just a few hours then i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this game. If not, you might want to find your happiness elsewhere.The game is all about choices and consequences. There is no good or bad, it's all about how you see ethic, you are the spy and you investigate the whole game depending on your own morality. But everything have repercussion, how you interrogate someone, how you work, what you undertake, who you trust... and this is what makes the game feels so good, so right, so IMMERSIVE. This is why you forget rpg intended mechanics where you need to level your skill to be able to land a shot properly or be totally invisible making the game a cakewalk. In fact i kinda liked this aspect of the game too and never understood people ranting about it. What annoyed me the most the first time i played Alpha Protocol were the boss battles. It felt so ""out of place"", so ""unrealistic"", even gamebreaking when playing only with stealth and no good weapons, but then i found a way to finish and i couldn't wait to see what else the game has to offer. That's why i like it so much and would recommend you to buy it.			",52,34,0,47,6,0,7

												I've had this game for a few years now and every now and then, I'll take it out and play it through. I must've beaten this game about five times by now and I can honestly say, it's one of my top ten favorite RPG's of all time. It's just so unique and fun to play. Sure it is not perfect, but you don't play a game for perfection, you play a game to enjoy it. The story, the choices, the characters are all fun although some cliche. I'm not going to say else much, just get it already. It's on sale now but if I can go back in time, I'd buy it at full price.			",172,34,2,25,13,1,24

												What do I say about this game? It's not particularly well done, but the writing is excellent. It's a second-rate console port, but it's suprisingly talky and interesting at times. There's a fair share of unpatched bugs, and might run like♥♥♥♥♥on your system, but if it works, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ immersive and fun to play. The weapons handle like♥♥♥♥♥and you're going to hate the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them at first, but that merely is a thing that's done to demonstrate just how awesomely broken the stealth system is in your favor. To summarize, this is basically an unrefined project that got booted out the door, yet another hallmark of Obsidian's approach to making games, but most of it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome and you might not even notice the bugs. You know, right up until they stop you from completing a mission dead in your tracks.Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ computer hacking.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												I thoroughly recommend this game.Despite all its flaws, glitches and errors (of which there are a few) this game is tremendous fun. The RPG side is not well fleshed out but it still has a nice sense of fulfilment to it. The discussion tree is vast with so many choices to go through, I suspect this game can be different every time through up to 4 maybe 5 playthrough’s (if you can stick it out that long).The characters and story are great and very well fleshed out. I loved finding out things about everyone I met and the world in general around the action seemed deep and rich as well. As for the combat it was alright, for an RPG it was fantastic, for an action game it was average at best. The Ai is either amazing or so stupid it ignores being shot. I found little use for the gadgets but I loved using some of the skills. As for progression when you gain enough XP you level up and in doing so can add to a number of espionage/weapon skills. You will probably want to specialise in one weapon, doing more than that means you can fill out the full skill tree. Side note: pistol is OP.If this game is on sale you should pick it up, not recommended at full price unless you love the concept, too many glitches to really justify though.Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												I played this game on the 360 shortly after it was release and I LOVED it.  Branching storylines based on real time conversations and quick choices with consequenses made/make this game unique and enjoyable.  There are some fairly glaring issues.  The enemy AI is pretty awful...like yeah pretty darn awful.  Some of the animations are weird and screwy...Mike sneaking for example.  There were numerous bugs (in the 360 version at least...I haven't played the PC port much yet) but the storyline, relationships, dialogue and interactive nature of the game make up for its, admittedly, numerous shortcomings.  It makes you feel like you're a real part of the story, not just watching cutscenes.			",24,7,0,15,2,0,7

												While the gameplay isn't the best in the world, I played as a dude who ran straight up to people and either shot them with a pistol/smg or punched them, the dynamic choice system is very good. It felt like the choices I made actually had impact on me, especially when the consequences catch up to me. But again, some gameplay mechanics didn't seem to work, like stealth. If you want to play a game that lets you choose your own path, get Alpha Protocol.			",124,11,0,7,6,1,21

												This game is worth it, but it will disappoint you, and possibly frustrate you.As many have said, the dialogue system and character interaction are very well done. The perk system is cool, and the skills system is decent. And the story (just done first few missions) is spy-ish.I liked the buy the intel, the dossiers, and the reading it entails (makes it feel more grounded in espionage than just first person shooting). The graphics are good (including the character details when talking, etc). I liked the mini-games (which simulate hacking, lockpicking and eletronic lock bypassing) which are based on observation puzzles against a clock.You will be disappointed by the animations which are a bit stiff but not bad. The controls (because of a possible poor console port) seem a tiny bit sluggish. You will become a little bit annoyed at the hacking mini-game because of the wildly poor mouse response to it.And finally, you might become ANGERED by the too frequent (for me at least) crash glitch which occurs against walls and corners, especially when stealthing which you will want to do a lot because, y'know you are a spy. So when your character jams permanently into an invisible wall-terrain join, just seconds before the checkpoint for the nth time, you will WANT to SMASH your pc screen. DON'T. Just turn off the game. and come back to it later. You will enjoy it again after a break....and hopefully the bug won't hit you so maliciously the next time.			",46,14,4,9,5,1,14

												Seriously underrated game.  This is an RPG game, not a purely action game, so you need to level up and work on advancing your skills and customizing your character.  If you expect traditional action gameplay, you'll be disappointed.  But as an RPG, it's a lot of fun, and the espionage settting is a fun change of pace from the usual sword-and-board Tolkien cut-and-pasted drivel that most game makers seem to think we want in our role playing games.  The game is very ambitious, though you do have to be tolerant of some of relatively rough production values.  OK, very rough production values.  I guess that's why most people hate the game.  But if you are the kind of player who wants a game where your decisions really do impact the gameplay, the story, and the future missions, this is a great game because it delivers in that department.  Mass Effect has more polish, and better gameplay, but really, at the end of the day, all your decisions do is change a few seconds worth of cut scene at the end.   The Telltale Walking Dead games love to tease you with the choice between saving one character or another.  But then, no matter who you save, they end up dying a few minutes later.  Your decisions simply don't matter in most games.  But in Alpha Protocol, the story can change dramatically from one playthrough to the next in a way that most games still can't compete with.And, sadly, it's still one of the only non-sci-fi, non-fantasy RPGs out there.

												Alpha Protocol is one of the few games I wish I'd never played, because I'd still be able to experience it for the first time.Everything you do in this game has consequences, from conversations with the other characters to how you carry out your missions. There are whole missions you can miss out on depending on how much intel you gather, and characters that you may never meet face to face. The story is non-linear, with different outcomes and events depending on which order you complete the main hubs in.If, like me, you're a sucker for story in games and are willing to put up with slightly clunky gameplay, give this one a try. The story, settings and characters are all fantastic, and the audio design is among the best of any game I've played. Overall, it definitely places in my top five favorite games of all time.

												Alpha Protocol is hands down one of the best spy and espionage games on the PC. It kind of makes you feel like Jason Bourne. The interactive story provides satisfaction in knowing you are actually a part of the outcome and all of your actions have consequences. In addition, the timed responses mean that all conversations remain fluid and believable. The perk system provides persona customization primarily between stealth or run and gun. There is a money collection system for buying weapons, armor, and accessories through the black market to enhance your chosen perks. The aiming system was biggest weakness, the enemy AI could have been improved, and the bosses seemed overpowered, but overall there was really very few issues with the gameplay, and the execution is top notch. The game also offers a lot of replayability due to its diverse story paths. This is a must buy.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												An interesting take on an espionage game, Alpha Protocol manages to keep you on your toes for most of its story, with a plot straight out of a Bourne movie. The game has some pacing problems but it gives you an impressive amount of freedom and still wraps things up satisfyingly. The characters are refreshing and the innovative conversation mechanics (limited time to choose your answer) force you to actually think about your replies. Sadly, the gameplay is very aracade-styled, with the shooting elements completely broken in your favor when using a mouse and a keyboard. Still, it deserves to be played as one of the few true espionage RPGs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic action/rpg that was plagued with poor press on release. It's basically like a modern day james bond, with all the womanising and over-the-top action one would expect. The shooting mechanics feel a little 'light', similar to mass effect's gunplay, but not as bad.The game can be played any way you like, lethal or non-lethal, run and gun or stealthy, but have little bearing on the overall outcome. If you're looking for a hardcore stealth/espionage game like metal gear solid or splinter cell, it doesn't really deliver.Intriguing storry, great voice acting (featuring Jim Cummings aka Minsc) and just a satisfying singleplayer experience overall.

												A truly underrated title. It has a really great conversation system, interesting characters, and excellent leveling up and customization, allowing you to go through the game with different builds.It is not, however, without its flaws. The gameplay controls are not very responsive. For a game looks and feels like it should be a third person shooter, the actual shooting mechanic is very poor. The stealth mechanics are better than the shooting, but Splinter Cell this is not. And it a few mandatory boss fights, which are of course terrible in this style of game. In fact, the game is very similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. They certainly both occupy the same genre of Steath/Action/RPG. The biggest difference is that DXHR has better gameplay, but far worse plot and character. Alpha Protocol has much better characters, plot, and dialogue/choices, but the gameplay is less polished. That said, if you enjoy games with well written characters, interesting choices, and one of the best conversation systems ever in any RPG, then you'll enjoy Alpha Protocol.			",135,64,0,34,8,3,21

												Really cool. Game of its own genre. It is not a pure shooter, it is not a pure thief-clone, it is not a new Deus-Ex. It takes a lot from different games and is something like a first-person-shooter-adventure. If you like to kill/disable with your style in a not too linear story, this might be your thing.The problem of most people with it was the expectation I think.

												This is one of those type of RPG's that is so misunderstood. I orginally played the game on 360 and enjoyed it so much I bought it on Steam as well. The thing people have to remember is that it plays like an RPG despite its 3rd person action perspective. This means that sniping sucks until you level sniping, and that you can become OP depending on which skills you choose to focus.But with a story that has possibly more decisions to make than Mass Effect and with multiple endings, its an amazingly fun game as long as you play it as intended.

												i3-4150, EVGA 750ti Superclocked.Resolution: 1920x1080Graphics settings: Ultra SettingsAverage framerate: 60 fps with vsync. Never a potate framedrop.Input device used for game: Played with gamepad, though switched to Mouse and Keyboard. Both systems are equally as great in this game.I was gifted this game and was definitely not expecting anything of this epic magnitude. It was pleasantly surprising considering I'd never even heard of the game before. As far as the controls go, this game is solid: there's a large inventory, weapons customization, and skill-tree system that is easy to learn and navigate. I'll admit that when I was greeted with a huge Sega logo and wopwopwop do do do woooop electronica I was thinking ""Oh man, dat hilarious dubstep♥♥♥♥♥♥.Oh noes."", but as soon as I entered into the game I was astounded by the quality of the voice acting, and pretty decent graphics considering that this is a previous-gen console port. I'm going to keep this review very short: If you're into secret societies, black-ops, PMCs, and shady underworld conspiracy theories, this game is for you. This game has single-handedly opened doors for me into the spy/espionage genre and since then I've played Spec Ops The Line and Deus Ex:HR. I'm going to be trying MGS games as well. This game is chock-full of ethical decisions and is begging for another playthrough as from what I've read, there are hours upon hours of different paths and cinematics. Do you want to be a guns blazing, bomb planting execute-every-character in-the-game-type to see where that leads you? Do you want to be a Melee-only character and a silent assassin? Do you want to be the suave, filthy,flirty, and cocky Archer-like spy who pisses off all of his mission handlers? Do you want to have a gun fight with a Russian in an arcade/discotheque to a blaring 80's hair metal soundtrack? You can do all of this.This is an underrated game you've never heard of with a rich story-line that you should definitely pick up.			",199,67,1,22,18,1,14

												It was a very nice surprise. It is not a perfect game though. Boring and hard-to-figure-out in the beggining, but nicely developed thoughout the story. The game is divided into chapter, which one comprises of a series of missions to investigate an international security issue. Well done. The safehouse concept was very well implemented in which you can buy/sell weapons, gadgets, and key intel to unlock additional side missions (investigations) related to chapter's story mission. After completing the first chapter, you can choose from 5 professional styles which of them with unique abilities and gadgets. I can relate spy, soldier, engineer, etc.  I chose spy...it is a stealth game, guys. But fell free to choose a different one to go assaulting everywhere. Also, there are a wide variety of weapons to fit with your choosen professional style. That would allow game replayability. As you progress you gather experience points that will lead to characther's level up and upgrade points to allow you improving certain abilities at your choice.Level design are very nice. Again, this game have its isues, but it gathers the best elements of stealth action games: Hitman, Splinter Cell, Batman, Deus EX, you can recall other games in every element of this game as you play it. It is not purely linear, because by using the safehouses, you can return to certain areas to collect items, hacking computers, find money caches, collect ammo, etc. THAT IS GREAT.As a RPG, dialog system is a bit different from other similar games. Here, you may choose your reply tone rather than the response phrase itself. Options varies from sarcastic, professional, ironic, flirtatious...Oh yes, there are romance options you can decide about. You also can reply to emails to disclose sensitive information, flirt, threat and compliment someone else in your mailing list. Here your decisions matter and will affect the game ending. Weapon wheel are difficult to browse at the beggning but I got used to. There are lethal and non lethal takedowns that are cool.  It resembles the Krav Maga martial art. Mini games are not that cool, some of them are tough, but you can buy certain upgrades to help you out. There are abilities you can upgrade with its cooldown time that can be reduced with level up points.The weakiest part were the Boss battles that should be much better. Without spoilling, there are certain upgrades and gadgets that will make your life way too easy fighting bosses. But overall, it is enjoayble and worth playing.  It is worth playing with moderate expectations. RECOMMENDED.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A few words: Jolly good fun!!!Where to start??? A lot of choices, a lot of characters, a cool (if kinda campy) espionage story, what's not to like??? The way they handle choices is very brilliant. It's up to you whether you want to be a suave spy a la James bond or cold combat pragmatist a la Jason Bourne who punch the hell out of anyone dare to deter you from your objective. Choices matter. Some characters may like you, some may hate you. But what I like it isn't about good or bad choices. All choices have its own advantages and disadvantages. By threatening some informant you may get discount on weapons but he will alert the local government, blackmailing a local triad boss may get you a large sums of money but you lost his support, etc. There're also a lot of small details, such as dialog change based on where you start your mission first. Love this small care to details.There are also a lot of characters, some of them become your handler (your mission intel guy) and give you passive bonus, such as lowering the chance for your enemy to detect you or increasing your endurance. Sadly most of the time you'll be guided by Mina (your default handler) with few option to change handler in several missions. The problem with a lot of character is most of the character aren't really fleshed out. Some of them are really interesting but their story end up abruptly without closure about who's this guy really is or who the hell they work for, etc. Such a shame, really.And the story!!! Hell yeah it's your typical espionage story, about deception, betrayal, and controversial topic. What's make this game special is the way the story handled. A lot of your choices will affect the story. The story is immensely branching, many of your choices will create a completely different way the even unfolds and how the game will end. It's up to you whether you want to play a game about revenge, about patriotic spirit, or maybe you can gain something from all the conflicts? Who knows, eh? So what are you waiting for??? Play this game!!!			",138,18,4,36,6,1,12

												A cross between Mass Effect and James Bond. It has it's flaws but the fun story and interesting mechanics along with a simple influence system makes it a blast to play. The game seriously looks dated now but that is a small gripe in comparison to the depth of gameplay and dialog system. The replayability is pretty high with multiple endings and outcomes for various missions and character story arcs. This one is an absolute buy for an RPG fan looking for something fresh and unique. Let's hope they make a sequel some day!			",206,16,6,22,29,0,25

												Gameplay and controls are akward and plain bad. Its a ""stealth"" game, yet cover system is broken, you can pass by unnoticed by walking next to the enemy who take about five seconds to notice you and another five seconds to finally start shooting. Yet, other times you are sneaking and they magically know where you are. The shooting is... worse. I like realistic games, by realistic I mean, basic laws of physics apply, this being said, a game where somehow you shoot and bullet turn 180 degrees and headshot an enemy is not what I would call ""realistic"". The people in charge of the graphics did a good job with the textures, yet it takes about a second for textures to fully load in my computer playing in medium, (specially noticeable in inventory menu). I don't think this normal for that to happen on a computer with i7, 12 GB Ram, 4GB Graphics Card, which can load textures faster in newer games on High graphics. Also they really, really, like Depth of Field, which is nice to focus on the important during cutscenes, but fails miserably when you are sneaking and try to shoot, just before you shoot, some stupid object near you gets focused and your target gets out of focus so all the enemies, which are stupid, end up shooting you. The very begining was, nice, I thought I would like it, sadly, I don't. Luckily I got this game from the Sega Humble Bundle, but $15 for this? If you like spending $15 on a broken game, this is for you.			",103,8,4,8,29,2,16

												If you play the game on easy/normal, it is a very good game with some decent gunplay and story, choices give you different perks, as well as if people like you or not. However on Hard you're pigeonholed to certain strategies as the only way it was possible for me to beat certain areas as Spy was a glitch that allows you to become invinicible until the next cutscene.So, if you're down for a good story, and decent gameplay mechanics, go for it, but it is frustratingly broken on higher difficulties for fights unless you choose to become a super badass killing machine			",220,38,1,23,8,2,12

												Came close to giving up on this game after the abysmal introductory mission in the Middle east, but as soon as things went global the story really picked up and that's what kept me going. If you overlook the poor execution of stealth and the wooden animations, and the fact that unless you spend AP on gunplay, you will mostly miss shooting at your enemy despite having their left eyeball in your crosshair , there's really a fun game underneath. Finished it in 14 hours though, so for an action RPG, it's a bit short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a tough call to give this a thumbs up or not. For the longest time it would have been a thumbs down. However I had some free time not too long ago and decided to power through the intro and I got hooked. The gameplay isn't all that great (if not outright bad), but the story/dialogue redeemed the game for me. Once I leveled up a bit, and learned how to exploit the game mechanics the game clicked for me. Maxed out stealth and got the 5 shot multishot for pistols. Once I did that I could just focus on enjoying the story and stealth through about 90% of the game.The best part of the game, and the part I am giving a positive review for, is the story/dialogue/writing. Your choices matter, your relationships matter, the order you do missions matter, sometimes even your choice of attire matter (well once anyway). I haven't played the game twice, but there were multiple ways to accomplish things, multiple ways to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off, or win them over.			",149,46,0,37,23,1,19

												Alpha Protocol does the best job creating a non-linear, branching narrative with meaningful decision points of any game I've encountered. Your relationship with various characters effects how they respond to you down the line and changes the color of the story being told. For once, there are no wrong options in a mechanical sense, either; every path leads to unique, sensible mechanical benefit through an elaborate ""perk"" system. You are genuinely rewarded for making your own way through the game, as well as for playing it more than once.There's a catch. This is one of the buggiest games I've played. The minigames are frustrating, the action wavers from slick to stuttering, and an untold number of glitches really put a damper on all the great level design and RPG systems at work. I still recommend it for the dialog and the chance to see a branching narrative done right. It also innovates on the guns-and-conversations genre with it's conversation system: as in Mass Effect you select the tone of your response rather than the exact wording, but here you only have a short amount of time to pick your response. This keeps the tension up, makes it feel more dynamic, and reduces analysis paralysis.Highly recommended if you can stomach the lack of polish. I really hope you can, becasue it's a wonderful game.

												Being able to make choices in a game is a big deal these days. It's just a shame few do it well. And out of those few that manage it, Alpha Protocol stands tall as the prime example. The gameplay may be archaic at best and broken at worst but it crafts an excellent techno-thriller with a well thought out world and invites you to spin it how you want. Whereas an average game would give you a bonus if you made someone your friend, Alpha Protocol may reward you by angering someone so much that their hatred of you clouds their judgement. Whereas a normal game makes you choose a side, Alpha Protocol invites you to play multiple sides, playing them off against each other leaving the remaining allies ripe for a final, easy betrayal. If you like games that let you truly get involved in their storylines and don't ever make you think how 'this choice would actually work in a video game', play this. Seriously, there's not really another game that has done choices as well.			",354,114,4,51,43,5,83

												The game is structured around a series of missions in certain cities, including Rome, Moscow and Taipei. In each city Thorton has a home base where he can catch up on email, watch news reports (periodically updated to comment on the chaos caused by his latest operation) and buy new weapons and equipment. From each base he can rally out to do missions, which are sometimes nothing more than short cut scenes as Thorton tries to wheedle information out of someone else but are sometimes long and elaborate infiltration and combat operations. For each mission Thorton can attempt to achieve his objective through sneaking into locations without being seen, going in all guns blazing or attempt diplomacy (or some combination of the three). He also has the ability to hack security systems, remotely unlock doors or set traps. A levelling-and-skill system also gives Thorton a wide array of abilities he can upgrade to improve his chances of success.You can generally engage in conversations aggressively, suavely or professionally, with occasional extra options available if you have researched the right info about the character. Intelligence dossiers (bought through the black market or found on missions) hold clues as to how people will respond in certain situations, allowing you to manipulate them into helping you out. It's a clever system, enhanced by some satisfying dialogue and some terrific, unexpected outcomes which radically change the way the story develops.The game's reactivity is probably its best feature, with characters living or dying (sometimes taking entire storylines and occasional missions with them) based on your actions, or how you go about doing things. Alpha Protocol rewards replaying more than most games for this reason, with real consequences to your decisions.Alpha Protocol does have a reputation for being heavily bugged, although I did not find this to be the case. Minor bugs abound, but on only two occasions was I forced to reload. Out of a 15-hour game, that's not too bad at all. It's a game clearly in need of a few more months of polishing, but it's still perfectly playable to completion.			",313,18,14,20,6,2,27

												This is a tough one to review. I'm going to try and assert what this game is trying to be, followed by what it actually is. Alpha Protocol is advertised as espionage game with RPG elements, this may give potential buyers the idea that the level of sneaking involved is reminiscent to that of the elder Splinter Cell series, but unfortunately this is far from true. The mechanics in Alpha Protocol limit you to basic climbing, basic hand-to-hand combat and you should expect that most sneaking will consist of simply taking cover behind objects to break the line of sight, which is rather disappointing. However, the RPG elements in Alpha Protocol are nifty and interesting, they can greatly influence the game and the modifications you make will definitely be an asset to your personal skills and gameplay. Lastly, spy thrillers usually involve conspiracies or dirty gritty stories, and Alpha Protocol does this in a somewhat decent way. Don't get me wrong there, the story is pretty interesting and involves the player traveling to diverse locations and meeting different people, but the presentation of the story is lacking. With that in mind, my last important note and a lot of the justified criticism for this game can be mentioned shortly and firmly: this game should not have been released yet. Alpha Protocol is very buggy, feels unpolished and in overall these things killed what would have been a great experience. My verdict: only buy this if it's on sale, a price tag of  €5,- would be as far as I'd go. Of course, one might pay more if he or she is not annoyed by bad character animations, odd NPC behavior, graphics glitches and event triggers that do not work as intended. For reference, you can look up Voidhead's 'Alpha Protocol - bugs, glitches and annoyances' video on YouTube.			",116,12,7,6,17,0,15

												This game is a lot better than people give it credit for. There has not been any other game this generation I've played that has had such an impact based around the player's choices and the consequences of them. This is a real RPG. Your stats matter, if your character isn't skilled with shooting guns you will miss every other shot. It won't hold your hand. You will make mistakes. You can't save everyone. People will die by your call. Everyone you meet can die by your decisions. The world is in your hands. Don't mess it up. I say pick it up on a Steam sale if you're not sure. Multiple playthroughs are necessary to see how differently the game can branch from your decisions.8/10, not perfect but I have a lot of fun playing it.			",241,24,0,26,19,2,63

												This is the game that all of the ""choice-based"" games like Mass Effect or the TellTale game series wish they could be. It's deep and interesting and your actions have a real tangible effect on the story. Instead of chosing to go with a morality system the game features reputations, which have to be managed carefully, it's not always a good thing for everyone to like you. The combat is pretty poor unfortunately, and the game was (and probably still is) fairly glitchy, however it is an unforgetable game experiance so I highly recommend it.Be sure to play through at least twice so you see how different everything gets by the end.

												This game is sort of like the son you never wanted. It loves you unconditionally and will sit in your library patiently, waiting for you to love and accept it. And you'll rebuke its affection, saying it's ""not polished"" or ""poorly balanced"" or ""buggy"". When really, it's just a diamond in the rough, and you won't pay for medical to get his vertigo checked out, and you haven't cared enough to deal with the lice in his hair. But every once in awhile, you see it in the corner of your eye, and you know, you just know, that you need to do better by him. So you play with him for a few hours, and those hours become days, and you think, ""Maybe I was wrong"". Just because Kathy makes you pay for child support after the divorce, and still dumps him on you more than four days a week, doesn't mean you shouldn't love him. And it's in that moment that Morgan Freeman's voice can be heard, saying, ""You've done good"".			",170,77,2,33,12,0,12

												Alpha Protocol is the most reactive game ever created. Every other RPG you've played where ""choices matter!"" and ""you shape the story!""? Complete bunk compared to this. There are SO MANY things you can manipulate that it is entirely possible to end the game with the entire main cast dead or every single one of them alive. If you enjoy good writing (the game was developed by Obsidian who have created some of the greatest RPGs in the business), semi-cheesy spy fiction and interesting characters you will fall in love with this game.Now for the bad parts:The start of the game is pretty slow and fairly linear. After completing the tutorial and the first ""hub"" the game opens up hugely in both options of where to go and the impact of your choices. Many reviewers never got past this first area and therefore never got to experience the 'real game', leading to a lot of fairly negative reviews.A lot of people dislike the gunplay and combat. Personally I found it solid and enjoyable, if not particularly special. However, the build balance is slightly out of whack - the pistol's Chain Shot (similar to Mark and Execute systems found in other games) is way better than any other weapon's special ability. However if you just embrace the cheese you can run a Martial Arts/Stealth build that leads to you, about halfway through the game, being able to turn invisible and punch every single person in the room in the throat, which is wonderful fun. Be aware that some bosses are really really hard to melee though, so pure martial arts builds might suffer.Despite these and some other minor niggles, however, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. There's nothing on the market that compares to Alpha Protocol for reactivity.			",140,14,0,32,15,3,41

												As every technical aspect is on par or above with this generation and the story, while using some cliches of the genere, was solid; I belive that the greatest faliure of the game is that you are limited to the mission areas (coincidentally full of bad guys) and that means reduced interactions with the world. But the line about every action has consequences is very true.			",1977,840,63,270,300,15,380

												Alpha Protocol is an awesome action RPG game from Obsidian Entertainment and published by SEGA which is about a guy named Mike Thorton. Then you can customize your Mike Thorton and then you set up the skills you want for him. Then you can set up the classification for Mike Thorton like be a field agent, a freelancer, etc. In the world of Alpha Protocol you will have to make some tough decisions. Those decisions will affect the game and the future storyline of the game. And also there is a romance option on this game as well. Mike Thorton can choose a female character to romance and be with. This game is amazing and really underrated. This game is not that known but most know this game enough to create a fanbase for it. Which is why I considered this game as a criminally underrated cult classic game. I highly recommend this game because this game is really fun and it's awesome! I would definitely be on board for a Alpha Protocol 2 game! :D			",557,147,3,26,16,4,3

												A success in storytelling and choice/consequence. A missed opportunity in gameplay. Alpha Protocol does a superb job in making your choices matter. Tackling the story missions in a different order leads to different reactions from the main character and other NPC's, alliances being made with different factions with enemies made from others, and significant impact on the endgame. Likewise conversation options, and how fast or slow you make dialogue choices, can impact the strength of your opponent or even skip a fight entirely. This game does a great job in enforcing the weight of your decisions and making you feel like a spy. Alpha Protocol fails in the combat department. Shooting feels inprecise and melee combat (especially in 1 on 1 scenarios) is a simple test of mashing the attack button. AI is poor, even for the time this title was released.I still recommend this game to fans of choice and consequence in games or fans of the action/spy genre. If the combat systems of a game like Mass Effect could synergize with the rest of this game, Alpha Protocol would have become much more than the overlooked title it has become.			",12,14,1,6,9,0,6

												This is a very underrated stealth/action game that recieved a lot of crap when it first came out. If not for those early reviews I have no doubt this game would be rated at least 80-85 on metacritic. The main problem is that the developers tried to put everything into the game, so it doesnt nessesarily excell at any of them. With that said, the game is very unique because of this as well. You're able to build social connections in the game, customize your armor and weapons, and go about missions however you like. You'll see the results and effects of how many people you kill or how many people see you once the mission is over. You even get a little terminal in the game that you can use for emailing other characters.Overall it's a really good game, but it may take a bit to get used to the very strange shooting mechanics. Once you've jumped that hurdle you'll be gold.			",315,103,1,31,51,3,46

												The excellent title from Obsidian Entertainment (the sadly underrated Alpha Protocol), delivers to gamers a uniquely satisfying experience. Alpha Protocol suffers from perhaps two things only - the admittedly horrible combat system, and the ""average"" quality of the AI. Most video games boast ""average"" intelligence; this title is no different, and although that wouldn't make much of a difference in the long run, a game which focuses on stealth mechanics should most definitely have decent AI. Now, what Alpha Protocol DOES deliver is in fact an incredibly mature, well-thought, and gritty story interspersed with above average scripts (some good, some bad); memorable characters, locations, interactions, story pathing, and a decent upgrade system. What makes this game essentially worthwhile though, is the character networking, the scripting. Relationships matter, and the dialogue flows like a good spy thriller. The relationships one makes in the game directly influences the end game conclusion, and it's a most satisfying experience indeed.I would recommend Alpha Protocol for both newcomers and the avid afficionado of the genre alike.

												Ignore the negative press. This is easily one of my favourite RPGs of the last generation. The sheer reactivity of the game is staggering, and the dialogue trees are second to none. In an age where voice acting has stunted the opportunity for player choice, this is one game that manages to pull it off.The combat ain't Mass Effect. This is foremost a stat-driven RPG. Your gun will miss if you haven't put points into it. For some, that's unacceptable, but I never saw that as a problem.Obsidian might be a flawed developer, but they're the best RPG maker in the biz.			",181,121,2,30,17,4,33

												9/10 Ignore the metascore and check out this game.It's Obsidian, which sadly means that it's a flawed work of genius, but it's still a work of GENIUS! This game is the sequel that DEUS EX deserved, never mind that Invisible War nonsense...Most importantly remember that this is an RPG and not a shooter. This means that blazing gun battles are not well presented, but it also means that ALL of your decisions, and a LOT of your casual throwaway comments have an impact. Not just in a ""character X was killed, we'll replace them with generic NPC in this mission"" way, but in an actual ""You didn't back me up when I was arguing with a contact, so now you'll never get to know about a side mission and potential comrade in a future chapter"" way. This leads to me giving it the best possible praise for any RPG:PLAY THIS GAME! THEN REPLAY IT IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY! THEN AGAIN! And yes, some of the mini-games can be frustrating, but there are tools for defeating those. Just like Deus Ex, there are multiple solutions to any problem. Trying to raid your former boss for files that can  solve your final case? Why not show some professional courtesy and slip in and out completely unseen, without setting off any alarms. Or just give them a little nap? Or show them what happens to people who fire you and spread them suckas over the walls with your shotgun?Personally I stormed through an ""Elite"" force's base taking down every armed guard with my hand-to-hand, just to send a message.Finally, I'm not saying that Alpha Protocol is the game version of Burn Notice, but if you made a game of Burn Notice, it'd look a lot like Alpha Protocol.

												I absolutely love this game! Despite all of it's bugs, animation problems, questionable level design, gameplay flaws (stealth system and shooting are truly horrible), it is one of those games, which give you a chance to LIVE the experience, not just shoot-kill-see-the-cat-scene. The plot and the approach to storytelling are amazing, the characters are really interesting; the dialog system is something similar to the one we've seen in Mass Effect, but it is more complex: there are no simply paragon/renegade/something_useless options, you have to find the dialog tactic for each of NPC you meet in this game. Strongly recommend this game to the fans of Obsidian titles and RPGs in general.			",148,68,1,40,8,0,41

												I have fond memories of this game from my Xbox days, but this PC port - at least with Win10 - is unplayable. The big problem is that commands are usually completely unresponsive. Whether I'm trying to take cover, select an inventory item, or throw a grenade, the game refuses to cooperate more often than not, which, as I'm sure you can imagine, is a bit of an issue when the fecal matter hits the spinner. And no matter what the graphical settings (and my Fallout 4-friendly laptop is not the problem), the framerate has frequent (as in, every couple of seconds) tears and stutters at all times. It's just an awful - or at least poorly updated - PC port of a perfectly decent console game. That said, the style hits some good notes, and the roleplay elements are still pretty neat, being better and more complex than almost any of the competition even now. Which just makes the unforgivable control problems that much more tragic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Introduction:Alpha Protocol combines an enthralling storyline with a functioning role playing core and the highest grade of replayability in years! This game is my favorite Spy game to date of writing this review (3/29/2016). It has it's flaws but at it's core is an amazing game. Look beyond its obvious faults and Alpha Protocol isn’t frustratingly bad, but frustratingly good; that is, if you care to look that hard.Positive:+ An astounding variety of ethical decisions that affect how the story unfolds+ A wide range of believable, fun characters; characters that you just have to love (and hate)+ Great FPS with a plethora of guns to choose from with attachments+ Government thriller story that allows you to pick which route you want to go+ Romantic options+ Multiple endings+ Excellent execution of FPS/RPG with fun minigames (hacking/lock-picking)+ Character creation allows for different types of playstylesNegatives:- Game designed for console that causes a lot of bugs for PC port (listed below)- AI is bad, sometimes it reminds me of old school Goldeneye- Crosshair/Accuracy, bullets just seem to randomly miss no matter where the crosshair is placed- No Sniper Rifle as a choice of guns to upgrade, although placed in game in missions- Bugs, overall a terrible PC port- No Achievements- No Steam trading cardsFails of computer port:- Hacking is extremely tedious sometimes moving the mouse to get to the correct location- Mouse sensitivity is terrible, hard to adjust for multiple weapons (IE: moving then using sniper rifle)- Camera movement was bad, I ended up getting used to it though- Graphics could be better, designed for consoles- No hotkeys/gadgets for skills because it was designed with limited buttons of a controller- Bugs againGood Game: 7/10, could be a 10/10 GOTY if they fixed their computer port issues (or made a game specifically for the PC)Good game that's a MUST BUY during a sale. I think it's even worth full price ($14.99 at the time of writing this). It is a rare game that I might actually replay. I am the type of person who can only watch a movie once, same with games. Alpha Protocol might break the trend when I replay it. This was one of those games I just couldn't stop playing.It needs a sequel to get everything right and designed for PC.Some screenshots of the game (some may contain spoilers, didn't go through them):https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImpalaPUA/screenshots/?appid=34010 ",612,253,11,110,84,7,72

												In Alpha Protocol, players control Michael Thorton, a young man with a chip on his shoulder who acts like a real bummer around his friends after his girlfriend left him for his uncontrollable flatulence problem. The game takes place over the course of a single night where Michael’s bros take him out for a night around town. This however isn’t just any night, for Michael’s friends decided to activate what they call the “Alpha Protocol”. The game reveals itself to be a visual novel dating sim where Michael Thorton’s friends pressure him to talk to young ladies, but only after talking to them about how alpha Michael is, and how much of a catch he would be. This goes on for a while as every eligible lady is turned off by Michael’s stench of sewage and rotten eggs. In the end, Michael comes to the epiphany that perhaps he should look for some ladies who also have trouble controlling their sphincters.The moral of the game’s narrative is that perhaps being beta isn’t so bad.

												Alpha Protocol is the gaming equivalent of a homely girl with a heart of gold. She may not look that great in comparison to some of her sisters, nor will she entice many people with her odd quirks; however, once you get to know her she will blow you away with her razor sharp wit and give you some truly memorable conversations.

She's in good company with Deus Ex and Vampire: The Masquerade in the sense that these gals have some serious quirks but are ultimately the dream girl at the end of film.She may not be for everyone at face value but if you give her the chance she deserves you surely won't be disappointed.

She's in good company with Deus Ex and Vampire: The Masquerade in the sense that these gals have some serious quirks but are ultimately the dream girl at the end of film.She may not be for everyone at face value but if you give her the chance she deserves you surely won't be disappointed.

												8/10 - Very good game but without that much of replayability.Is this game worth the purchase? Yes.After all this time Obsidian got rid of most of the bugs so now the game experience is good.If you want a mixture of rpg elements (a lot of them and with actual repercussions on the story) and decent cover-based shooter then this game is for you; also, completing the game nearly only with stealth and takedowns is possible or, if you want to be a gunblazing tankier bearded badass you can achieve it.I completed the game in about 17 hours on normal using mostly the stealth+silenced pistol+takedowns approach so it can be less long if you like to shoot everything on sight with shotguns/assault rifles/gadgets.And yes, you can get the girls in here.sidenote: the pistol tree is pretty much op but, along with the stealth one, it's a must if you want to play the stealth approach.

												I adore this game to bits. I've almost put 24 hours into this and will put more into it. The dialogue is fantastic with characters responding to things like your previous choices and how you've talked to them in the past. There are also a crap load of choices. In my first run I played as a charasmatic ninja god who shot everyone in the end. In my current I'm a no nonsense tech god who takes people out using traps and shotguns. The levels are sadly mostly linear and the combat isn't very good. The enemies also just feel like differently skinned goons with nothing interesting about them. Oh and the Chain Shot Reload Cooldowns combo cheeses any and all bosses instantly. Overall great for people who can ignore combat gripes and enjoy a great story.			",114,22,0,25,12,0,11

												Based on the three J.B.s: Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer and James Bond this is a spy game where you choose the action, stealth or suave demeanor to get though. Despite the less and glowing reviews this game is worth the time you spend with it. Fun missions, decent storyline, and a chance to live off the radar. If you want something different from your FPS that has some RPG elements, and some nifty dialog choices, then give it a try. One last thought not sure why so many reviewers had technical difficulties with the game, but none were found during my play though, possibly the patches have done their job. Overall a Good game.

												I finished this game like 4 times before buying it from Steam (Or, perhaps, I got it with a Humble Bundle. I don't remember correctly) and I enjoyed every single bit of it.You play as Michael Thorton, a brilliant and promising trainee to join the ranks of Alpha Protocol, a secret agency. Prove everyone and yourself that you're the best agents around. As the world around you seems to collapse, you always find a way out.Introducing a similar, but much more interactive, dialogue system like Mass Effect, you decide the attitude you want Michael to have towards people, depending the personalities of the others and what you have read in their dossiers.Be a spy lurking in the shadows or a tough soldier ramping your way inside compounds and bases. This amazing third person shooter game also have RPG elements allowing you to make the agent you want to be.The story is not so long, I think. Depending on the difficulty, 20 hours should be enough for you to finish it.Perhaps you've heard about some bugs and glitches this game have. I will not deny it, it's not a perfect game. As everything, it has some flaws. But, trust me, it's an experience hard to forget.Would I recommend it? Hell, yes!So, feel free to buy it, my friend. I'm sure that, if you like RPG's, you will totally love it.			",369,40,7,38,16,3,30

												Great game but it could have been so much more.  Good:It's a spy shooter that let's you play the way you want, stealth, guns blazing, etc.  An RPG skill system can be used to bolster your play style, for example developing lock pickking, silent running, rifles, explosives, etc. Your choices in and out of combat give you influence with various characters and ultimately decide how the story unfolds and how the game ends. Bad:It was obviously dumbed down for consoles.  Some of the hacking mini games are annoyingAlthough the story is good, some of the choices are forced a la Mass Effect, choose who dies.Worse, it does so, by commiting the ultimate gameplay sin where you win a battle, but lose in a cutscene.Overall.  I love the game, but it could have been so much better.  As with many Obsidian games, the final execution just isn't quite there.  When will game makers understand that the real art isn't forcing us to choose who dies.  It's in allowing us to discover how to save both, or maybe not to be the hero and let them all die.  Still, highly worth playing.			",97,14,0,16,4,0,17

												Controls are clunky and painful, protagonist has an absurdly annoying voice that you will immediately be sick of, when the player walks around while crouching it's one of the most comical animations I've ever seen, and the shooting mechanics suuuuuck.But it's still one of my favorite games, becaaauuse...1. It balances player choice with a smooth narrative. No matter what direction you choose, the story always compensates and fills in the gaps with finesse.2. The skills actually reward you by giving you crappy skills to begin with. You start out as a top operative but can't shoot worth a damn, and then after several missions and a few upgrades, you're finally getting the hang of things and notice a dramatic improvement in the mechanics.3. The supporting characters dynamically react to how you treat them. This is the closest we will get to scripted AI dialogue where our responses affect the NPC's attitudes and behaviors in conversations and remain consistent throughout the game unless you resolve the conflicts.4. Gun modifications make sense and follow a semblance of realism, which isn't unpopular nowadays but adds a nice addition to the game.This is a super toned down version of Just Cause with fantastically crafted dialogue. And right now it's 3 bucks. You have no reason to not buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first thing you will notice is that the combat itself is very.... unique. When I first played AP, it was hard to get into but I persisted, hearing good things about this game from other people. After the first few mission were over and the international plot began to emerge, along with the characters who would be along for the ride with you, I was hooked. It is an RPG, not a shooter by any stretch. And what an RPG. Obsidian continue to impress with the story lines. No binary good/bad system is in the game, something which shows this game to be beyond anything before. Many will think of Mass Effect while playing, and to an extent they are right. The first ME was a poor combat game but a good RPG. This is a brilliant RPG: each choice makes a diffrence, every single dialogue choice could change the end of the game in subtle ways.This game could be much better. The combat and stealth could work in a more logical way, the pistol could stop been the answer to EVERY combat question. But the dialogue, plot and characters make this all worth playing.

												Alpha Protocol... What an odd game to be reviewing. This game has average AI, Bad combat, clunky animation, stealth that is ruined by invisibility and guns that feel like pea-shooters. Yet, the dialog, choices, and story, somehow manage to make this game compelling and a blast to play. The guns suck, but the shotguns are somewhat fun to use once you charge them up. The melee combat is a bit odd just run up and punch someone two or three times and they are out, or sneak kill/knock-out. Honestly, this is one of the best games there is, but SEGA constantly changing what type of game they wanted made it a bit of a mess. But even though it is a mess, its like a Jackson Pollock painting.Sure it isn't the most amazing game of all time, but it is worth a play through. Just keep in mind, this is an RPG, not a TPS.

The combat system is probably one of the worst in recent memory, shooting feels absolutely terrible and stealth is just outright broken... but the roleplaying is absolutely top mark and more than makes up for the bad gameplay. I know that doesn't sound like a glowing review when one whole half of the game is badly made but if you're the sort of person that is willing to look past rough edges, you'll be rewarded in heaps with this game.

												Alpha Protocol is a spy themed action RPG in which you play as Michael Thorton. A guy recently signed onto a super secret ultraviolet level covert ops group that do jobs that other organizations can't handle. Plays like a third person shooter like Mass Effect 2, with your standard cover mechanics and dialog choices. With the dialog you can choose to play your character like different spy archetypes ranging from Sean Connery James Bond to straight up 'WHERE'S THE BOMB!?' Jack Bauer. However some skill trees are broken and one part of a game takes a cocaine fueled difficulty spike.Fun game overall, rack up orphans and hospital bills over your spy career.			",493,135,6,70,40,3,66

When you level up you gain some AP, and then use on your  skill tree(skill bar in this case) and purchase a point in that tree with said AP. Overall combat is tigh and punishing,especially since it's form blackisle studios the guys from the original fallout(who then were known as Interplay).Tip: By going out your class, I mean if you are building a stealth character don't expect him to be good at frontal combat, your gonna suck. This IS an rpg, so you can't  go gun toting ala Gears, COD. The enemies will bring you down, for playing stupid, so play with brains & not moron mode. In one word GET IT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game but it could have been so much more.  Good:It's a spy shooter that let's you play the way you want, stealth, guns blazing, etc.  An RPG skill system can be used to bolster your play style, for example developing lock pickking, silent running, rifles, explosives, etc. Your choices in and out of combat give you influence with various characters and ultimately decide how the story unfolds and how the game ends. Bad:It was obviously dumbed down for consoles.  Some of the hacking mini games are annoyingAlthough the story is good, some of the choices are forced a la Mass Effect, choose who dies.Worse, it does so, by commiting the ultimate gameplay sin where you win a battle, but lose in a cutscene.Overall.  I love the game, but it could have been so much better.  As with many Obsidian games, the final execution just isn't quite there.  When will game makers understand that the real art isn't forcing us to choose who dies.  It's in allowing us to discover how to save both, or maybe not to be the hero and let them all die.  Still, highly worth playing.			",97,14,0,16,4,0,17

												Alpha Protocol... What an odd game to be reviewing. This game has average AI, Bad combat, clunky animation, stealth that is ruined by invisibility and guns that feel like pea-shooters. Yet, the dialog, choices, and story, somehow manage to make this game compelling and a blast to play. The guns suck, but the shotguns are somewhat fun to use once you charge them up. The melee combat is a bit odd just run up and punch someone two or three times and they are out, or sneak kill/knock-out. Honestly, this is one of the best games there is, but SEGA constantly changing what type of game they wanted made it a bit of a mess. But even though it is a mess, its like a Jackson Pollock painting.Sure it isn't the most amazing game of all time, but it is worth a play through. Just keep in mind, this is an RPG, not a TPS.

												I adore this game to bits. I've almost put 24 hours into this and will put more into it. The dialogue is fantastic with characters responding to things like your previous choices and how you've talked to them in the past. There are also a crap load of choices. In my first run I played as a charasmatic ninja god who shot everyone in the end. In my current I'm a no nonsense tech god who takes people out using traps and shotguns. The levels are sadly mostly linear and the combat isn't very good. The enemies also just feel like differently skinned goons with nothing interesting about them. Oh and the Chain Shot Reload Cooldowns combo cheeses any and all bosses instantly. Overall great for people who can ignore combat gripes and enjoy a great story.			",114,22,0,25,12,0,11

												I finished this game like 4 times before buying it from Steam (Or, perhaps, I got it with a Humble Bundle. I don't remember correctly) and I enjoyed every single bit of it.You play as Michael Thorton, a brilliant and promising trainee to join the ranks of Alpha Protocol, a secret agency. Prove everyone and yourself that you're the best agents around. As the world around you seems to collapse, you always find a way out.Introducing a similar, but much more interactive, dialogue system like Mass Effect, you decide the attitude you want Michael to have towards people, depending the personalities of the others and what you have read in their dossiers.Be a spy lurking in the shadows or a tough soldier ramping your way inside compounds and bases. This amazing third person shooter game also have RPG elements allowing you to make the agent you want to be.The story is not so long, I think. Depending on the difficulty, 20 hours should be enough for you to finish it.Perhaps you've heard about some bugs and glitches this game have. I will not deny it, it's not a perfect game. As everything, it has some flaws. But, trust me, it's an experience hard to forget.Would I recommend it? Hell, yes!So, feel free to buy it, my friend. I'm sure that, if you like RPG's, you will totally love it.			",369,40,7,38,16,3,30

												One of the last games by Bioware and Obsidian that I've finished.  I'm a big fan of both companies.  Alpha Protocol isn't a bad game, though the plot is relatively uninspired and the dialogue is a little...wooden.  However, you can see glimpses of greatness here and there. Gameplay is very, VERY similar to Mass Effect with over-the-shoulder run and gun interspersed with cut scenes.  Even the skill system foreshadows the games to come.  In the end, if you like Mass Effect, you'll probably enjoy playing through.  Especially if you get it on sale.			",197,57,4,50,36,2,43

												A very good modern espionage game. The story is very intriguing and the player will get to make decisions for their avatar that could drastically affect the game in later stages. The developers do a good job at keeping the game open, yet linear at the same time, so the player is never caught with an overwhelming amount of things to do but never trapped into a single linear story. Highly recommended, it's the best modern espionage game out on the market right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is seriously one of the best games I ever played. Yes. Seriously.Not only is the gameplay is really good (you can approach your missions in any style you like - sneaky or brute force, lethal or non-lethal, solo or with help, etc.) the story is very engaging. It's a true spy story. It takes you all over the world (which leads to very different areas in both style and atmosphere) and brings you in contact with all manner of organisations with their specific style of members and a number of very interesting NPCs. The roleplaying aspect - where you choose from different styles of answers in dialogs (like professional, sarcastic, casual, suave, etc.) has a true impact on the gameplay, as do you choices during your missions. It gives you different allies or enemies.Except for the good old violence, there are also locks to pick, electronic locks or alarms to disable, and computers to hack, all tree done through minigames that decrease in difficulty if you have the right skills.Progression is level based. Your PC goes up in levels by earning experience, which gives you points you can spend on several skill tracks, things like stealth, pistol, assault rifle, sabotage, etc.There is also a sort of underground black market where you can buy all sorts of weapons and armor and accessories for those, as well as gadgets like grenades and spy trickery, but also intel, like maps, dossiers on NPCs or organisations, support, extra mission objects, etc.So, yes, I love this game. It really has it all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A great level system and trait system, it does lack in cover usefullness with the locations available being quite difficult to discern. Also the minigames do suffer from -for me at least- the mouse controls not syncing up with their supposed position on the puzzle.			",430,86,5,76,35,2,78

												Alpha Protocol is the gaming equivalent of a homely girl with a heart of gold. She may not look that great in comparison to some of her sisters, nor will she entice many people with her odd quirks; however, once you get to know her she will blow you away with her razor sharp wit and give you some truly memorable conversations. Her incredible depth will make you learn more and more things about her even after ""playing through"" her three times - leaving you yearning for more. She's in good company with Deus Ex and Vampire: The Masquerade in the sense that these gals have some serious quirks but are ultimately the dream girl at the end of film.She may not be for everyone at face value but if you give her the chance she deserves you surely won't be disappointed.

Yes.After all this time Obsidian got rid of most of the bugs so now the game experience is good.If you want a mixture of rpg elements (a lot of them and with actual repercussions on the story) and decent cover-based shooter then this game is for you; also, completing the game nearly only with stealth and takedowns is possible or, if you want to be a gunblazing tankier bearded badass you can achieve it.I completed the game in about 17 hours on normal using mostly the stealth+silenced pistol+takedowns approach so it can be less long if you like to shoot everything on sight with shotguns/assault rifles/gadgets.And yes, you can get the girls in here.sidenote: the pistol tree is pretty much op but, along with the stealth one, it's a must if you want to play the stealth approach.

												Let me just start by saying the Alpha Protocol is one of the few RPGs I know that have delivered on it's 'choice changes the game' mechanic. I've played this game for 80 hours now, and I can say that there's cutscenes I have seen in LPs that I haven't even played before.GameplayHonestly, this isn't the best combat I've ever seen. You can play with stealth, or just shoot everything in the face. You start off with 4 classes to choose from which have perk points already in some predetermined places, but you can mix them up. A 5th option, Recruit, has you starting with no perk points at all, making the game a lot harder. Completing the Recruit option will unlock Veteran for future playthroughs, who has perks from previous experience.You can carry two weapons with you at a time, ranging from an assault rifle, a shotgun, an smg and a pistol. They can be upgraded and you can even buy more of them in the safehouse.The safehouse serves as a hub for you inbetween missions, allowing you to read your emails (which sometimes contain funding or other useful information), watch TV about 'recent affairs', or check the black market. On the black market you can buy things ranging from a map of the complex to intelligence on a person.You can build up intel on people or groups, and knowing it can sometimes give you an extra option in conversations. They also give you a certain damage bonus against some of the bosses.StorySPOILERS:The story begins with you, Mike Thorton, waking up in a secret government facility. You break out, only to find that it was a test of your abilities. You are sent off to Saudi Arabia, to recover stolen Halbech missiles. A terrorist group has stolen them, and they used them to blow up a civillian plane earlier. There will be sequences where you are sat in a room talking to a man about what you have just done. The idea is that the missions happened months ago, and you're being interrogated now. You will learn in Saudi that the missiles were never stolen, they were given freely by Halbech. With the help of an agent, Mina, who is still operating in the AP facility, you escape, and quickly realise that Halbech are attempting to spark a war, so that they can ramp up production and earn more money. Off the data you take with you you find that there are three major Halbech locations. They are Rome, Taipei and Moscow. You can visit them in any order, but the game will change considerably based on which one you go to. After collecting information on Halbech, you have to return to the AP base to finish it all. Based on if you romanced anyone or you were good friends with them and they survived, they will join you on a final boatride into the sunset.VerdictThe story is extremely well written and has a very high replayability, only being dragged down by the combat. For that, I'll give it an 7/10			",19,9,0,3,6,0,6

Alpha Protocol™ is an overlooked gem of an RPG. Alpha Protocol™ is the whole package. A branching story, filled with multiple game-changing decisions. Each mission has more than one approach to it. Weapons and gear customization. Story: You play as agent Michael Thorton, tasked with his first Alpha Protocol mission. Things, however, are much different from what they seem to be, as Thorton becomes involved in a conspiracy. The story features many turns and twists and yes, you can be evil as much, as you want to.  Gameplay: Alpha Protocol™, however, is plagued in its gameplay. While you can opt for a stealthy campaign, you're still forced into close combat and horrible boss encounters.  Movement is detailed, you can climb walls, crouch, vault over. However, it is also restricted. You can do those things only where the game says you can.  Shooting, on the other hand, is terrible, but this plays a part in the character progression. Depending on what skills you decide to improve on, shooting can be enjoyable. As mentioned above, there is character progression. These are upgradable skills, which can influence your experience with the game and, combined with the dialogue choice, encourage multiple playthroughs. Sum up: So is Alpha Protocol™ worth checking out? Yes, definitely. While the gameplay is a mixed bag, the story is worth it. Give this one a try,			",140,27,3,11,10,1,6

												Yes, this game has some fundamental flaws and could have used some more testing before it was released.  BUT, if you enjoy the decision elements of western RPG's such as Mass Effect, and open-ended gameplay like Deus Ex, you will love the twists and turns available to you in Alpha Protocol.  I have played through this game twice, taking two very different approaches, and it was almost literally like playing two entirely different games.  My suggestion for making the most of this game: build your character to be stealthy (the stealth system was well-refined) and throw any obsession you have about choosing the ""correct"" conversation option out the window: you will ALWAYS be rewarded for whatever option you take, even if what you chose seems ridiculous!

												After finishing this game, I really don't understand why it got such a panning - it's great!I'll start with the not-so-good stuff first:•	The AI isn't great, and•	The boss battles are insanely unfairThat's it.Alpha Protocol is an espionage RPG/shooter, but really - first and foremost - it's a great story well told. It offers choices that have real consequence, and it allows you to play it out however you see fit.All out action? Sneaky stealth? A combination of both? You can tailor your character to suit your play style. I'm a sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at heart, so I chose a Specialist, with Stealth and Martial Arts as my lead attributes ;)You want to kill everyone you come across? You can. Prefer to be non-lethal and just use a painful take-down instead? You can do that too. That assassin that tried to kill you, you want to kill or spare it? Again, up to you, and each choice will affect the story.Conversations I found a blast, with usually 3-4 options as a reply - 'Joking', 'Suave', 'Professional', 'Tender', 'Taunt', 'Antagonise', 'Execute'... Each response can have its pro's and con's, whether positive or negative, and affects how the other person will react to you in the future. It looks pretty good, while not spectacular. The look is very 'clean', and there is a few clipping instances, but I really didn't find anything that marred my experience. I'm not sure how many hours it took to complete, as the Steam hours counter didn't work on quite a few of my plays. I would say around 20-25, though. I played the game using an Xbox 360 pad, so I can't really comment on the mouse/keyboard controls, but from what I've read, the pad is the way to play, really.I paid £5 for this in the Steam Sale, but I really wouldn't have felt cheated if I paid full whack for it. It really is a shame it was received the way it was, and that the sales reflected this. I would have loved another slice. It's a good job multiple playthroughs are catered for... :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's basically like every spy movie rolled into one game.  It used just about every spy trope there is to be a great send up to the spy genre.  Solid writing, great characters, plenty of memorable moments on playthroughs (some being boss fights, others just being conversations), but gameplay is just a bit unbalanced.  Some skills just aren't that good, while others are really overpowered and really break the game by making bosses go down in seconds.			",133,32,3,29,7,0,21

												This game didn't deserve all the hate it got. It's a pretty decent RPG where choices in friends play an important role. The progression system is good and all, but there are some fights where you'll sit there and think ""Huh. I put all of my points into stealth, and now I'm stuck in an open gunfight with an insane boss. This sucks.""  There are a small number of bosses like this, but enough to make it a real hassle. I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPGs and spies, but you NEED to put at least some points in at least one gun. I suggest the pistol if you're trying to avoid killing people. It's the only gun with tranquilizer ammo.			",173,47,1,22,7,1,19

												This game got a seriously bad rap. It's not the best third-person shooter I've played, and oftentimes one might run into an annoying bug, but overall it's a game that offers a lot.Espionage isn't the most investigated genre in the gaming industry, at least not to this level - and Obsidian did a good job of it. Globe-trotting, stealth missions, lethal or non-lethal methodologies - it's a good example of a good game being lambasted unfairly by the general public.The dialogue and choice system are top-notch and can vastly change the playthrough from one game to the next. Most comparable to the dialogue system in Mass Effect, how you treat others can have serious ramifications long down the road; choices made when conversing with one character may completely alter the conversation you have with another several chapters later. A very impressive achievement, and one that seems to have flown under the radar of most.Highly recommended.			",590,123,5,95,38,4,78

The story is amazing and you're constantly forced to make morally grey decisions with consequences that actually have an effect on the plot.If you're willing to look past or deal with the many issues it has, then you will find an experience that is rare to come by in modern gaming.My full review:

												Don't judge the game by the first hour.This game is fantastically well-written. If you're a fan of RPGs and rate dialogue, story, characters and consequence over guns and explosions, you will absolutely love this game. I'm currently on my 3rd playthrough, and have had a very different experience each time. If the reason you loved Deus Ex: Human Revolution was because of the conspiracy, the dialogue challenges and the repurcussions of your actions then I would DEFINITELY recommend you play this.Annoyingly, there is a definite learning curve and the movement and combat controls are lacking. I very nearly gave up on this game within the first hour, because I found the computer hacking minigame (coupled with the checkpoints save system) so frustrating I wasn't enjoying it at all. But I am VERY glad I stuck with it: once I got the hang of the hacking game and levelled my character to be more stealthy, the limitations became much less evident.Buggy controls, but *superb* writing.

It's a game where you decide the fate of a majority of the cast, giving you the sense that the story is guided as much by you as it is by the designers. With a number of ways to customize the experience – you can play as a stealth agent with a silenced pistol or bullet-spraying berserker – it is an entertaining role-playing experience with some little flaws.

The faction system forged through real character choices is fantastic. The dialogue system keeps things interesting as well. Likewise, I actually loved the combat system, although the game was too easy. Also, AP has perfect pacing; levels never drag on and the game keeps you interested until the end. I only experienced a few minor bugs, so I really can't relate to all these complaints. To me AP will go down as one of the most under-appreciated games ever. To each his or her own, but if you can look past the hate and ignore the quirks, you too might just become obsessed with being Michael Thorton.			",322,70,5,41,12,3,36

												8.5 / 10 I think this game is totally under rated. the game must have been patched, i only saw one major glitch. the stealth in this game is pretty good, thats how i played it anyway, but it really only allows you to fully specialise in one weapon which is annoying.Evasion allows you to go invistible for 3-6 seconds when an enemy sees you, to allow you to attack or hide. if stealth, you want the proper stealth gear ($130k) that is not avaible after you finish saudi arabia, get it there.also there are other cool perks, hard to kill reserects you at death and allows you to recover. You have a secondary health that recharges, so it you hide somewhere, it gives you a good chance of survival.SIUMMARISING, Its a subtle cross between hitman tactics and dues ex story line, but is not as good as either of those games. The amount of influence your decisions have on what happens next though, is very impressive. Would recommend. 22h to clock roughly			",265,68,6,46,24,3,73

												This game didn't deserve all the hate it got. It's a pretty decent RPG where choices in friends play an important role. The progression system is good and all, but there are some fights where you'll sit there and think ""Huh. I put all of my points into stealth, and now I'm stuck in an open gunfight with an insane boss. This sucks.""  There are a small number of bosses like this, but enough to make it a real hassle. I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPGs and spies, but you NEED to put at least some points in at least one gun. I suggest the pistol if you're trying to avoid killing people. It's the only gun with tranquilizer ammo.			",173,47,1,22,7,1,19

												It's like Bioware and Obsidian had a baby. The gameplay and npc dialogue will leave you reminiscent of Mass Effect, while the story will probably remind you of Obsidian's inability to put together a decent story. At least this game has an ending. Several, in fact, which all depend on actions you take through the game, as opposed to one important decision made at the end. Even though it's marketed as a stealth rpg, you are free to go in guns blazing, although that will punish you through means of severely reduced mission rewards and your allies either hating you or loving you for it. Think Dragon Age's approval system, where some of your allies might look down upon killing police officers, while others might encourage you to take down anyone in your way. In a way, this is an interesting game mechanic, as there are some npcs you might want to hate you for story related reasons.Overall, a solid game that didn't get the appreciation it deserved when it first came out.

All these aspects are at least on par with Bioware games, so there's some quality to it. All in all, giving it a try wouldn't be a bad idea if you're a fan of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After finishing this game, I really don't understand why it got such a panning - it's great!I'll start with the not-so-good stuff first:•	The AI isn't great, and•	The boss battles are insanely unfairThat's it.Alpha Protocol is an espionage RPG/shooter, but really - first and foremost - it's a great story well told. It offers choices that have real consequence, and it allows you to play it out however you see fit.All out action? Sneaky stealth? A combination of both? You can tailor your character to suit your play style. I'm a sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at heart, so I chose a Specialist, with Stealth and Martial Arts as my lead attributes ;)You want to kill everyone you come across? You can. Prefer to be non-lethal and just use a painful take-down instead? You can do that too. That assassin that tried to kill you, you want to kill or spare it? Again, up to you, and each choice will affect the story.Conversations I found a blast, with usually 3-4 options as a reply - 'Joking', 'Suave', 'Professional', 'Tender', 'Taunt', 'Antagonise', 'Execute'... Each response can have its pro's and con's, whether positive or negative, and affects how the other person will react to you in the future. It looks pretty good, while not spectacular. The look is very 'clean', and there is a few clipping instances, but I really didn't find anything that marred my experience. I'm not sure how many hours it took to complete, as the Steam hours counter didn't work on quite a few of my plays. I would say around 20-25, though. I played the game using an Xbox 360 pad, so I can't really comment on the mouse/keyboard controls, but from what I've read, the pad is the way to play, really.I paid £5 for this in the Steam Sale, but I really wouldn't have felt cheated if I paid full whack for it. It really is a shame it was received the way it was, and that the sales reflected this. I would have loved another slice. It's a good job multiple playthroughs are catered for... :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far one of the jankiest and most enjoyable Action RPGs you can play.Obsidian is nothing if not a writing savant and with Alpha Protocol it shines through. Gameplay is your basic spy game; stealth around, jump kick a guy, put several bullets in his head at once. Nothing groundbreaking but it doesn't need to be. As I said, it's packed to the brim with quality dialogue choices and trees that would make Mass Effect 3 weep. Shepard? Nah son, give me Steven Heck any day.A+ quality Obsidian title. Don't expect some perfect simulation or deep immersion, you are looking at the wrong company for that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: Absolutely brilliant conversaion system concept. Excellent story arc arguably better than 24 and Homeland combined. Between the conspiracy theory puns (from the silly to well-founded) and the parodies of the media, I enjoyed every minute of it.Cons: Make sure to use an Exbawckz360 controller because of the annoying mouse bugs. There are also some confusing choices to make at two integral parts of the game, but they're actually not bugs. You also don't get absolute freedom in how to go about accomplishing the mission; you can't make Mike into a bad guy without some serious contradictions of character.Other thoughts: It is not an open-world RPG so don't expect to be able to play past the ending. Other than that this is quite possibly one of the most underrated spy-RPGs ever. I blame the bugs.			",152,9,3,20,10,1,33

Mainly in that pistols are ridiculous if you max the pistol combat skill, you do not need anything else ever.  Also the hacking takes some getting used to, but it works well enough if you skill properly.At time of writing, this game has dropped to a ridiculous price of $2.  Everyone should get this game if they can run it.  While it's not perfect, and it's clear that huge elements of it were chopped, it's still a masterpiece.			",337,98,2,37,44,3,67

												A game I both love and hate in equal measure. The combat is janky and unbalanced as all get out and animations/texture quality can be laughable at times. The hacking minigame is unspeakably awful.It's also one of the finest modern RPGs from this generation. It far eclipses what Mass Effect tried to do in terms of it's dialogue system and how characters react to your actions. The dossier system actually ties back into the game and the options you're given rather than being extra lore reading. And the sheer amount of reactivity to your choices and the consequences that can result put Mass Effect to shame, causing genuinely different endings based on how you play - sometimes drastically different. There isn't a blue, red, or green light to be found. The beginning takes patience to trudge through, but once you're past the Saudi Arabia hub the game begins to shine.			",340,120,9,83,30,1,73

												Seeing as how i purchased this game for 2 dollars, this is actually a pretty decent game (storywise at least).  If you're a fan of games where your actions and choices have consequences, this game is for you.  Some of the decisions you make really do feel like some of the decisions people in inteliigence would actually make.  The decision points are never A = good B = bad and you don't really know how your decisions will completely effect the storyline.  The conversations in the game are also well done and feel very natural.  There is, unforunately one glaring problem, and that is that the combat is pretty awful.  Shooting is not skill based at all, and is reliant on how you level up your skills.  Also the inventory suffers horribly from consolization, and you are unable to map equipment to hotkeys, rather relying on a radial wheel (like you would use on a console).  So if you enjoy a decent story and dialogue get this game (was 2$), but don't expect anything great combatwise.			",193,30,0,41,24,0,52

												Disclaimer: I am a self confessed RPG nut.I have to make a guilty confession,  this game slipped under my RPG radar, a fact I'm not proud of, even more so, because it's actually quite good.Taking strong elements from Deus Ex and Splinter Cell, you get to play as either a Spy, Commando or Tech, which equtes to the modern day roles of Rogue, Warrior and Mage, with skill trees to develop your class.Similiar to Deus Ex, there are key conversational turnpoints where you can aggravate or side with the other party, and sometimes it's worth your while to♥♥♥♥♥♥them off.There are boss battles, and these seem to run counter to the approach of the remainder of the game, particulary if you favour stealth.That said, the end boss battle was the easiest of them all, and again, there is parallel to Deus Ex with multiple endings based on earlier conversations.I'm a bit bemused why this got savaged by critics, as it's actually a pretty good game, with high replayability.

Unfortunatly there are crippling save and control glitches and issues, don't even attempt without an xbox 360 controller.			",857,279,19,96,67,9,115

												Great game with plenty of globe hopping.  Plays similar to Mass Effect during the missions and offers multiple paths to complete the objectives.  Stealth and Gunplay are equally valid ways to progress through the game.  also the conversation system, which is timed, increases the immersion.  You don't get time to sit back and decide the best course of action, you must react.  I'm a fan of the system.			",202,44,10,37,9,2,23

												Pros: Absolutely brilliant conversaion system concept. Excellent story arc arguably better than 24 and Homeland combined. Between the conspiracy theory puns (from the silly to well-founded) and the parodies of the media, I enjoyed every minute of it.Cons: Make sure to use an Exbawckz360 controller because of the annoying mouse bugs. There are also some confusing choices to make at two integral parts of the game, but they're actually not bugs. You also don't get absolute freedom in how to go about accomplishing the mission; you can't make Mike into a bad guy without some serious contradictions of character.Other thoughts: It is not an open-world RPG so don't expect to be able to play past the ending. Other than that this is quite possibly one of the most underrated spy-RPGs ever. I blame the bugs.			",152,9,3,20,10,1,33

Solid writing, great characters, plenty of memorable moments on playthroughs (some being boss fights, others just being conversations), but gameplay is just a bit unbalanced.

												Seeing as how i purchased this game for 2 dollars, this is actually a pretty decent game (storywise at least).  If you're a fan of games where your actions and choices have consequences, this game is for you.  Some of the decisions you make really do feel like some of the decisions people in inteliigence would actually make.  The decision points are never A = good B = bad and you don't really know how your decisions will completely effect the storyline.  The conversations in the game are also well done and feel very natural.  There is, unforunately one glaring problem, and that is that the combat is pretty awful.  Shooting is not skill based at all, and is reliant on how you level up your skills.  Also the inventory suffers horribly from consolization, and you are unable to map equipment to hotkeys, rather relying on a radial wheel (like you would use on a console).  So if you enjoy a decent story and dialogue get this game (was 2$), but don't expect anything great combatwise.			",193,30,0,41,24,0,52

												This game got a seriously bad rap. It's not the best third-person shooter I've played, and oftentimes one might run into an annoying bug, but overall it's a game that offers a lot.Espionage isn't the most investigated genre in the gaming industry, at least not to this level - and Obsidian did a good job of it. Globe-trotting, stealth missions, lethal or non-lethal methodologies - it's a good example of a good game being lambasted unfairly by the general public.The dialogue and choice system are top-notch and can vastly change the playthrough from one game to the next. Most comparable to the dialogue system in Mass Effect, how you treat others can have serious ramifications long down the road; choices made when conversing with one character may completely alter the conversation you have with another several chapters later. A very impressive achievement, and one that seems to have flown under the radar of most.Highly recommended.			",590,123,5,95,38,4,78

												This game, had a low critical rating when i first bought it. And after buying it, i could easily understand why. However, i also found myself loving the game. Stealth becomes extremely overpowered when points are poured into it, and the main character comes off as a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at almost all times, but there is plenty of fun to be had in the character progression and choices, the sheer amounts of weapons and armor are boggling, and you've got plenty of ways to finish every level depending on the stats you've chosen. I played as a stealthy martial artist. I developed an innate hatred of guns in this game quickly, they seem to be as effective as meatballs against king kong. Martial arts however, works fine, and can be fun to watch in action.The choice to be lethal or non-lethal can change how events occur, though the game can penalise either depending on how it's implemented. The choice system is amusing, though some events are set in stone, you can make allies and enemies easily. My character, by the end of the game had slept with every possible female in the game. This astounded me, as i hadnt even been trying to.This game is fun, it isnt a paragon of great design in any field, but it does succeed in being fun, and giving a super-spy feel to the player. Finally, i know that i don't have many hours logged on this game. A stuffup with the steam overlay stopped me from logging hours, or getting achievements as steam didnt register i was playing.

But then if you compound that with the fact the razor is eight years old, has only one functioning speed (chainsaw), and feels about as smooth as a face rinse using a garbage disposal while munching on chewing gum made of glass and recycled kittens, you'd get the picture.Playing Alpha Protocol is also like flying to Hobart for Easter only to find out when you get there that all of Tasmania is, in fact, now a black hole. But instead of vaporizing instantly into nothingness, you're forced to sit in an auditorium where the seats morph into goblins who munch off your balls and thrust javelins so far up your bum you choke on them. You’re forced to die slowly while watching reruns of Sex and the City on the JumboTron and wee elves drain your bank accounts by one-click-buying the world’s stock of Harry Potter merchandise on Amazon.

												great dialogue system (3 distinct archtype taken from james bond, bourne, and jack bauer free to choose in game) which could also influence the way the story fold or molding your character in combat (trait). the stealth and shooting prob kind make new player turn off if they playing it like any fps/action based game but after you invested the point toward your skill it def help a lot. the big minus thing i hate about this game are simply the OP of pistol, slo mo zoom 3-5 shot even a boss only take like 1-2 usage of the skill.but still worth it for the story variation alone :). forgot to add if you often alt tab the game will slowing down that made it playable unless you relaunching the game			",129,24,9,34,18,1,24

												As much as I love stealth and games where choices matter, I can't recommend this game. It has a lot of stealth sections in the beginning, but near the middle (which is as far as I got) it starts to fall apart. The second I walked through doors, even though there was no alert, the enemies were already heading for cover and getting ready for a firefight. There is one ability that lets you see enemy locations and alert levels, and when the enemies were running for cover, I could see they had no alert level at all. Level design spoilers ahead, but no story spoilers. In the last mission I got to, you're in a mansion and I could only use stealth for the first beginning parts of a room at best. The levels were open designed and everything to make stealth close to impossible for that level at least. Maybe I should have played more and not jumped to conclusions on this, but a few levels before this one everyone was instantly attacking me too. So in the end, this game just turned into another boring, brown, generic, third-person military cover shooter.			",159,25,0,15,22,1,21

												Despite it's flaws, this game is amazing.  Things get blown up, sexy men, shoot people, sexy ladies, you hack things, sneak around, oh and get some lovin from some sexy ladies. There are a variety of ways you can play. Want to just jump right into the action, and mass rage at everyone? Okays, cool, you can do that.  Want to pull some martial arts out your pocket, and knock them senseless? Yeah. That'll work too. Want to sneak and be some wicked ninja? Right on!  (though stealth has some major 'game breaking' flaws for some). The most interesting aspect of this game is the dialogue choices. You can choose from different styles (sauve, professional, joking, etc), which all affect how the fractions and individuals view you.  Getting them to hate you, or like you will have its benefits for you (such as an increase in endurance).  However, if one fraction favors you, you may have issues with those who oppose it- choose wisely! The point? Must buy.			",198,78,8,47,20,2,40

Your choices actually feel like they affect the world in a tangible way. It's certainly more RPG than TPS, so adjust expectations. Some very minute visual/gameply glitches, nothing game breaking.

												Great game with plenty of globe hopping.  Plays similar to Mass Effect during the missions and offers multiple paths to complete the objectives.  Stealth and Gunplay are equally valid ways to progress through the game.  also the conversation system, which is timed, increases the immersion.  You don't get time to sit back and decide the best course of action, you must react.  I'm a fan of the system.			",202,44,10,37,9,2,23

												It's like Bioware and Obsidian had a baby. The gameplay and npc dialogue will leave you reminiscent of Mass Effect, while the story will probably remind you of Obsidian's inability to put together a decent story. At least this game has an ending. Several, in fact, which all depend on actions you take through the game, as opposed to one important decision made at the end. Even though it's marketed as a stealth rpg, you are free to go in guns blazing, although that will punish you through means of severely reduced mission rewards and your allies either hating you or loving you for it. Think Dragon Age's approval system, where some of your allies might look down upon killing police officers, while others might encourage you to take down anyone in your way. In a way, this is an interesting game mechanic, as there are some npcs you might want to hate you for story related reasons.Overall, a solid game that didn't get the appreciation it deserved when it first came out.

												Better than its reputation led me to believe. Don't get me wrong, it has flaws, but once you get the hang of it it's very enjoyable. If you've been debating about picking it up I highly recommend grabbing it. Some of the controls are funky (hacking is rather annoying and feels like it was clearly designed for 2 joysticks) and the story is fairly cliche but in usual Obsidian fashion the characters are very well put together and I easily found myself sucked in despite ARPG/Shooters not being my thing. Some of the design reminds me of Deus Ex, you almost always have the option of stealth or combat and both are viable. The design allowing you to pick and choose allies which directly impacts the way the story unfolds is great.			",250,107,6,201,63,3,117

												This game isn't perfect: it has its share of glitches, and just getting it to run can be quite the hassle.  It's worth the effort, though.  Besides the solid gameplay that allows you to pick virtually any approach with equal effectiveness, it shines head and shoulders above every other game in making your decisions meaningful.  Everything you say can have both large and small impacts on the future of the game, to the point that you can play it a dozen times and not see everything.  And that's no exaggeration - I've done it.  The game is that satisying.The technical issues mean I can't give this game a strictly positive review, but if you can get past them, you'll find an incredibly solid and immersive game that will continue to surprise you even after several playthroughs.

												This game is great in some ways and completely broken in others.  The story is fun.  James Bond the RPG in a nutshell.  Nothing wrong with the premise.  Interesting characters and locations.  Stealth mechanics are ok and the dialog options is some of the best in any game and thats including dialog wheels in Bioware games.  Its Obsidian so good dialog is what you can expect. It falls apart when you actually have to do combat.  Gunplay is iffy at best and while melee is fine you rarely get a chance to do it without running across a room to do it and thats rediculous.  The part that truly brings this game down is the bosses.  OMG the worst bosses in any game ever.  Hell I would argue this game didn't need bosses.  Its a game about being a spy gaining intel and learning who the bad guy is.  Forced boss fights with normal people who take a gazillion shots is bad enough but they are insanely hard for no reason.  90% of the boss fights I died like 10 times before I was able to beat them and i feel it was mostly luck that did it for me.  I regret putting this game on normal because it was damn near impossible.  In fact the first time I tried the game it was impossible.  One boss fight was simply unbeatable from how I leveled Michael and that is just stupid!  Level up right or you will never finish the game.  Put points into stealth to make every mission easy and max out pistol because the pistol becomes your best friend.  Put in a lot of points to a second gun as well.  Assault Rifle served me well.   This is not advice this is required to actually get through the game.  Without stealth most missions will drive you nuts with the combat.  Without pistols at high level bosses will destroy you.  Even then put the game on easy.I had fun with this game but I also got angry with it too often to count.  I just wish I put it on easy because there's nothing to prove in giving yourself an anuerysm for those damn boss fights.			",307,40,4,39,12,3,20

												This is almost the definition of a 'flawed gem' game, with some fantastic ideas showcased throughout its' 15-20 hour runtime, some of which are implemented better than others. While the gameplay can feel rough around the edges at times, the story and characters are this game's highlight in my opinion, with good dialogue and great character development (particularly via their interactions with the player character). Also, the amount of choice given to the player adds a couple of playthroughs' worth of replayability. Its' fairly linear level structure may not appeal to some though, so be mindful of this before purchase if this is a game-breaker for you.Overall, although the game has a lot of bugs and some shortcomings, this is a game I readily recommend to RPG fans, especially those looking for a modern setting and an engaging story.

												+Great Varied Gameplay (stealth/action/conversation)+Fun TPS RPG+Mission Variety+Good, but not memorable voice acting and characters-Graphics are okay, most glaring graphical hitches are enemy walking animations-Context based movement (climbing ladders, jumping ledges, drops)-Limited Weapon VarietyThis game compares very favorably to a mix of Deus Ex Human Revolution (ability acquisition), Mass Effect 2 (conversation options / TPS cover combat), and Uncharted (TPS cover combat / Characters / Stealth Takedown Animations).  I like this game better than Mass Effect 2 in terms of actual gameplay in both conversation options and combat.  However, its story is not unique enough to awe you like Mass Effect.  The whole time though, I kept on thinking to myself that if they put a little more polish in the graphics and made the movement ""free"" instead of contextual like Uncharted or the Assassin's Creed games, the game would be a deeper Uncharted.[GET ASAP]			",269,60,3,54,21,1,42

												Great semi-linear third person shooter with stealth elements and morality system. RPG-skill system with character traits based on your in game actions, a weapon loadout system, cool story (think Splinter Cell) and distinct (if not particularly memorable) characters make this a must play, especially if you like Mass Effect (gameplay), Deus Ex HR (gameplay, story), Splinter Cell Conviction (gameplay, story) or good games in general.

												The game was suprisingly fun for what it looked like.  While the combat system isn't the greatest, it reminds me a bit of the original Deus Ex, the options for how to go through the levels are where the game shines.  There are several different paths per level, depending on your choice of stealth, equipment, dialoge, ect.  I certianly wish that SEGA would make another, but with the luke warm reviews at best when the game came out, I doubt they will.  Ahh well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great in some ways and completely broken in others.  The story is fun.  James Bond the RPG in a nutshell.  Nothing wrong with the premise.  Interesting characters and locations.  Stealth mechanics are ok and the dialog options is some of the best in any game and thats including dialog wheels in Bioware games.  Its Obsidian so good dialog is what you can expect. It falls apart when you actually have to do combat.  Gunplay is iffy at best and while melee is fine you rarely get a chance to do it without running across a room to do it and thats rediculous.  The part that truly brings this game down is the bosses.  OMG the worst bosses in any game ever.  Hell I would argue this game didn't need bosses.  Its a game about being a spy gaining intel and learning who the bad guy is.  Forced boss fights with normal people who take a gazillion shots is bad enough but they are insanely hard for no reason.  90% of the boss fights I died like 10 times before I was able to beat them and i feel it was mostly luck that did it for me.  I regret putting this game on normal because it was damn near impossible.  In fact the first time I tried the game it was impossible.  One boss fight was simply unbeatable from how I leveled Michael and that is just stupid!  Level up right or you will never finish the game.  Put points into stealth to make every mission easy and max out pistol because the pistol becomes your best friend.  Put in a lot of points to a second gun as well.  Assault Rifle served me well.   This is not advice this is required to actually get through the game.  Without stealth most missions will drive you nuts with the combat.  Without pistols at high level bosses will destroy you.  Even then put the game on easy.I had fun with this game but I also got angry with it too often to count.  I just wish I put it on easy because there's nothing to prove in giving yourself an anuerysm for those damn boss fights.			",307,40,4,39,12,3,20

												I love this game a lot. I had pretty low expectation and had heard some pretty negative things about it. But let me tell you this is an amazing game for any RPG fan, the most important thing to note is that this is an RPG, it's not a shooter. It doesn't feel like a shooter with RPG elements this is an RPG with guns. It's a damned good RPG, there are multiple ways to approach every situation, choices to make and consequence for your actions. Highly recommend for anyone out there looking for a great modern spy/stealth RPG.			",141,47,1,17,15,1,28

												I've only been playing for a few hours but the issues are piling up quick. If I had to resume the game in a sentence, I'd say it's what Mass Effect could have been if it was handled by inexperienced developers.What to begin with? It's made by Sega and Obsidian but I'd have never guessed.The controls become immediately a problem as you start moving around your character for the first time.Clearly this game was made for consoles and barely adapted to PCs. It becomes even more apparent once you start messing with hacking and mini-games, as the mouse is emulating the right joystick. You have to keep moving your mouse towards a direction in order to simulate the pressure you'd apply on a joystick, which means you'll be out of bounds of your mousepad in no time. As soon as your mouse stops moving, it registers as if you released the joystick.The aiming, is the old Mass Effect style. Big lousy crosshair that seems confused between recoil and spray.While the game keeps calling it recoil, there is no recoil in this game. Instead the crosshair enlarges as you keep firing or move (Moving your aim also enlarges it, even if you're not moving your feet) which makes your gun spray area larger, forcing you to miss shots. This game really wants you to move, stop, aim, shoot then move again. No fluidity whatsoever in combat except for those melee takedowns.The interface has weird reactions to key presses. When you press the default toggle key ""C"" to open your gadgets panel, the window pops up and you can interact with the window but the ""C"" key is still locked, making you wait a few more seconds before you can close that window again. (Yes, it's a gadget panel and not crouching, the crouching is done with the old style CTRL)You cannot close that window by pressing ESC either.Actually, some windows you bring up with a key press will not close by pressing the same key again, instead you have to navigate through the menus.The speech, which if you've never played this game, is pretty much like a poor version of what Mass Effect did.I enjoyed it nonetheless but here again, you can see the inexperience/lack of polishing of the developers..Sometimes, not always, when speaking to someone, the answer will pop up before the NPC is done talking, triggering the countdown that forces you into the default answer. If you decide to wait to hear what the NPC asked of you, you will be left with less than a second to click on the answer you wish for, potentially making you say something you didn't want to. I understand those types of timers are meant to keep the conversations going and be more realistic, and even though I disagree with the principle which makes me heavily biased, my opinion is that they (the timers) should be at least twice as long, giving the player more time to think about the situation. (It's an RPG element and should be treated as such, time and thoughts are involved)Now, for the gameplay/level design.. Which is what made me write this review in the first place. There are some terrible decisions that only makes me guess what is the next thing they'll mess up.The ""Training"" sessions is what I'm refering to, there are 3 trainings you can go for (afaik) (Weapons, Gadgets and Stealth). If you complete the Weapons training with enough points, Mina, the person in charge of it, will suggest you to try her ""bonus"" round, which gives you more goodies (Cash/hardware). Good, sweet deal.You then go to the Gadgets training and more or less the same happens. As you finish the training with a high score, Darcy the guy in charge of that session will offer you a similar ""bonus"" round  (although I'll explain why the bonus of that training is absolute garbage later).So far so good, the game has a pattern and I'm following it. I head to the third training (Stealth) and get started, I run a few rounds and get what I think is a near perfect score. I get back to the person in charge, the old man tells me I'm doing above-average and asks me the same question other people in charge asks me when I'm not getting enough points to get the bonus, which is ""Do you want to try the course again?"". So of course, I whine; think about what I could do better and try the course again.. I retry for an hour, getting a 58 seconds time with a perfect score. At this point, i'm so close to perfection and still getting 135 points and still being asked to try the course again..I get frustrated, start googling and I find out that this old man, doesn't propose you the bonus until you say you don't want to try the course again...You created a pattern that ends up in an infinite loop, that is one of the worst design you can think of.I'd expect that kind of mess up towards the end-game, where many games tends to lack polishing.It's astounding that this happens in the first hour of gameplay.This would have been an incredibly easy/fast thing to fix compared to the trouble it causes especially in the beginning where most people makes up their mind about your game.As for the Gadget training's bonus round, they spawn you in a closed room with a rack of gadgets. They tell you that your objective is to disable all the alarms and that everytime an alarm goes off, more guards are spawned. As the guy talks to you for what feels an eternity, the gadget locker is locked and you have nothing in your pockets. You can't prepare for what's coming and instead forced to sit around and listen to that mofo.As the guy finally finishes serenading you, gadgets are spawned in your pockets, the locker gets unlocked and the enemy's door opens and all the alarms triggers. All they taught you in the previous Gadget training is out the window. You can't trap them as the only door opened automatically, you can't sneak in because they're watching the only door like hawks and you can't move around in your room because they can easily spot you from outside.Welp, I decide to start chugging static grenades like there's no tomorrow, I kill all the guards then use a gadget that stops alarms. The alarm stops for less than a second, then rings again, spawns more guards etc..So after getting pummeled and shot at, I start again, chug grenades, kill all guards then I walk into their room.I see the alarms on the walls so I started trapping all of them, trapped the newlyfound doors and basically do exactly what the previous training taught me to do. Once i'm ready, I disarm an alarm manually, it magically triggers again less than a second later and more guards spawns right behind me, in the middle of the room, effectivelly bypassing all the traps I've setup.Frustrated again, I start googling.. To find out you have to crawl in a corner of the room you spawn in, disregard everything that you've been told and just spam the gadget that stops the alarms. Bam, less than a minute and it's done.. A+I'm not sure what that bonus round was supposed to teach me but I'll take the 20k$. kthxbye.All in all, these types of mistakes are timeless. It doesn't matter that the game was released 7 years ago like it was or 15 years ago. These are fundamental problems that only demonstrates a lack of experience and/or lack of polishing.I've played a TON of games, both old and new, I have a massive steam library and I've rarely seen a game getting the complicated parts right and the fundamentals wrong. I mean, don't get me wrong, there is much worst out there. It just hurts to see that from Sega and Obsidian, I have to assume this had a decent budget.To end on a good note, I do enjoy the RPG elements. It's hard not to compare it to Mass Effect as most systems are very similar, even the level up interface/mechanics. It doesn't seem to limit the player by blocking everything away like newer games tends to do and instead letting you choose your own path. I like the speech system, where NPCs may like you more or less depending on the answer, even though your options are always one word (Suave, Professional, Suspicious etc..)			",426,112,28,73,60,3,90

												I had this game for a good while, but I had major gameplay issues from the start and I kept getting annoyed and leaving it alone for months on end. I had a friend point out a couple of fixes to me, and suddenly, hello - I lost an entire night because I was enjoying the game just that much.Those fixes, btw - your default interact key [I believe it's Spacebar], should be left as default. In the hacking minigame at least one of the threads insists on Spacebar just to be able to work. You can always assign a different key as the backup key and it'll work fine for everything else, but for hacking to work, Spacebar needs to be left as default. Also, don't try overriding the graphical settings from within the AMD or nVidia software - it can break the dialogue boxes, leaving them blank and you unable to actually choose your dialogue. Considering how Alpha Protocol works, this isn't a good thing.Those two bugs were gamebreaking for me originally. Once I knew how to get around them, the game played like a dream. Clunky in a few places [combat/movement wise] and I despise the checkpoint system, but I would still happily play it over and over again. There is major replay value depending on where you'd like to travel to first, your dialogue options, everything else. Definitely worth it on sale, though not necessarily otherwise.

												Besides all the bugs(that other people say they have gotten but i haven't) and bad reviews this game has gotten, it has a great story and is a pretty enjoyable SPY/Secret Agent RPG. If your looking for a game thats straight action shooter, you should do Borderlands or even Modern warfare before looking at this game. The hacking/lockpicking minigames are hard at first but midway through the game you get a good feel for it and can get through it easily. Although the controls for the game could be a lot better, there isn't much you can do about it.  The Story has some good Dialogue and you control the way Mike(your character) behaves during the conversations(Like Mass effect) you have and choose different ways to do things. Replayability is High as there are a lot of different ways you can handle things. Boss Battles are cool, some are challenging but it all depends on how you play. you can be stealthy or go guns blazingI'd give this game 7.5/10. Buy it if you see it on SALE.			",415,54,8,64,44,2,56

												Obsidian is one of the few developers who have earned my trust enough for me to be willing to buy their games without hesitating. I can't think of a game by them that ever disappointed me, but I can think of plenty that became some of my favorites, and Alpha Protocol is one of them.In terms of the core gameplay, the game is only slightly above average. It's framed as a stealth game, but there are plenty of character options to let you play as loud or quiet as you want, or even dump all your points into Martial Arts and become a kung fu spy if you want. The AI can be a bit finnicky sometimes, and the camera mouse controls sometimes have issues, but for the most part it's functional, and fun to play. The real distinguishing factor of the game is in the dialogue, and other choices. An average playthrough may only last 10 to 15 hours or so, but it has enough replayability to easily make it worth playing several times. Everything from the order you take on missions in to the people you ally with likely has an effect on future events, and there are enough ways that events can play out differently to continue to surprise you even after 3 or 4 playthroughs. The game features a full Bond-like cast of memorable characters, each of whom have their own likes and dislikes that can influence your results throughout the game. It really puts up the illusion that this is a real world of espionage, and it's easy to find yourself invested in the character and story because of it.The one place where the game does falter is the dialogue interface itself. The game uses a Mass Effect-style one-word-choice system, where most dialogue choices fall into three categories - Suave, Aggressive, and Professional. It's not as simplistic as it may seem, and it is somewhat necessary to shorten the lines since unlike other similar games Alpha Protocol is fairly aggressive with its timed dialogues and often may not even give you more time than it takes for a character to finish their sentence to make a decision, but it does occasionally end with you misreading the prompt's intention and leading to the main character saying something you didn't want. This ties in with the fact that the main character's voice actor isn't all that great at times, and he doesn't do a very good job of actually sounding particularly suave when you pick those options. Alpha Protocol is the one game where I don't completely hate the use of the dialogue wheel, but I still wouldn't mind it being gone.If you're into Bond movies or just spy fiction in general, Alpha Protocol is a pretty easy pick. Almost every Obsidian game has their faults due to both publishers rushing them and Obsidian themselves not being that great at managing their time, but like most of their games the faults aren't enough to bring down what ends up being another really great RPG to add to their list.

Perhaps unpolished, but still a gem.Fan of Deus Ex, or Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, and their brethren of immersive sims?  Don't pass up Alpha Protocol.Be warned, of course.  The game is riddled with severe technical problems; across two PCs and two operating systems, this game has proven more challenging to merely run than any other game I've played in the last five years.However, it is also among the very best.  The setting is lacking any particularly fantastical elements, and the characters are arguably not especially memorable, but the intrigue is well presented, and subtly woven.The game's dialogue system is superb, reminiscent of Mass Effect, but with the addition of a timer, forcing you to make decisions on the spot and stick by them.  Characters react to your playstyle, and the choice to play stealthily, non-lethally, or  loudly and violently will ultimately impact certain sequences.  Don't expect to notice massive consequences for your choices, but repeated playthroughs show an excptional number of subtle, appreciated differences.Gameplay is ambitiously diverse.  Certainly, as a whole, it controls somewhat awkwardly, as the game does not master any of its elements entirely, but it offers many options competently enough.  The standard paths are available; stealth, hacking, gunplay, and melee (unarmed, in this case) are all present.  Various abilities, unlocked through RPG-like progression, offer a feeling of meaningful specialization, and nicely allow you to focus on a certain skillset.If you can tolerate its technical failings, Alpha Protocol offers an experience that's difficult to compare to any other recent releases.  It was clearly a labor of love, and fans of other Obsidian games probably know what to expect, in terms of its stability.Highly recommended, if you want to take a risk on something different from the norm.

												This game is proof that Metacritic is a broken for review measurements. 72/100 these days conjures up ideas of mediocrity and most people would have lowered expectations. However, this game is anything but mediocre. Some dodgy AI aside (such as enemies not seeing you when you are stood right next to them) this game is brilliant; great locations, great story and choices that feel that they matter. If you are looking for a 24/James Bond hybrid which is not too challenging but incredibly fun, then look no further.			",710,263,22,74,55,6,80

												This is a very fun game about espionage, secret service agencies and world conspiracies. The plot itself is kind of naive, somewhat cliched but the storytelling itself is very fun. The character development is great, there's a lot of attention to detail, lots of choices to be made during the game that will have their consequences in future. The dialogue system is great - you get a mood of reply which you need to choose really fast. Depending on the reply you can gain reputation with the person you're talking to and that can open up different resolutions of conflicts in the game.The gameplay itself is not terribly exciting. The AI is somewhat dumb which spoils the shooting part, the minigames (hacking, lock- and codepicking) are simplistic and get dull after a while. Stealth is really powerful tool. I've heard a lot about bugs in the game but I haven't encountered many during my walkthrough. I got stuck in a texture once and saw AI do some really stupid stuff.Despite all it's flaws Alpha Protocol is a great and fun game. It's like reading a good super-spy book and watching a good James Bond movie. I've played this game practically non-stop for 3 days, it is that much fun to get through the plot and see what comes next, how this all will end and how it all will be resolved. This conspiracy/espionage setting is really a breath of fresh air in RPG world and I really can't have enough of it.			",97,17,0,56,20,2,45

												I've totally loved this title! I've read that ""Alpha Protocol"" contains somewhat good stuff, good action but it has also crooked story and repeating gameplay tactics, so in the end it's a low rated game. I don't think like that. It's far better game considering its production date and game engine problems. It sure given me great play time and in the it totally worth it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha Protocol is a flawed, but enjoyable gem the likes that Obisidan tends to provide. Playing somewhat similar to Mass Effect, with heavier consequences that are not only more dramatic but also further down the storyline, Alpha Protocol provides an excellent game surrounded by the nuances of Espionage.Visually, it is interesting but with it's flaws. Animations are rigid and lack the smooth transitions that many other games have. Gameplay in itself can feel a bit awkward with controls and it may take a bit of time to get used to the way weapons interact with a Roleplaying interface.With no sequel, grab this if you enjoy spy games with a heavy emphasis on relationships with your co-workers, targets, and other people as well as prefer a stronger Roleplaying aspect to the likes of Mass Effect.

Replaying it to see the different ways everything plays out is just as fun as the first playthrough. I'd love to see Sega give the okay on a sequel. Options to stealth almost everything or just run and gun are there.There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing I've found in my many playthroughs that have been game breaking.

												Yeah the gameplay is pretty broken and janky. It's not really as bad as people make it out to be, it's sorta a ghetto Metal Gear Solid experience with some really bad balance problems if you pick your advancements right.Where the game really shines is in your interactions with the other characters and your ability to change the plot depending on your actions. Sure, lots of games SAY that the storyline plays out differently based on your choices, but this is pretty much the only one that's ever really delivered.Well worth the price of admission at this point. Just turn off your brain a little for the shooting sections and enjoy the ride. Then turn around and replay it with different choices! Hell, do it twice! Three times!

Product received for free
												-First impressions, will have full review on the way.-Alpha Protocol is a third-person action RPG shooter with Stealth elements developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and published by Sega. Starting off this review, Alpha Protocol was a game i played when i was much younger, but i barely remember anything from it. So, my experience was bad, and i thought the game was bad, and it was a physical copy. It was around the time of release, so it had some issues, such as the issue i had myself, of completing a tutorial, but, it claiming that i haven't. Now for the review. Alpha Protocol contains an intresting narrative, and the game has a good tone, but just doesn't feel all so serious yet. The storytelling is also very good so far, and the game is reminding me of Mass Effect, the first game, which i thought was okay, but it did have really amazing storytelling, character development, and stuff. This game also has a dialogue system insanely similar to it, and it really, really feels just like that, although, the storyline isn't as good as Mass Effect. The characters are all very well written, and character development is also very good. For the gameplay, it does work well, and it makes me feel as if this is the Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain of 2010, or an early Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. And talking about that, the gameplay has some unique stuff, but not much. It's the precision thing, and i like it. The gameplay isn't very tactical, but it is fun and induces you into creating strategies and stuff, using your mind, just like MGSV:TPP does, except, a lot of the gameplay depth and detail is removed here. Combat is also pretty damn good, although A.I is quite dumb at times. The graphics look top-notch, even at the time, but it doesn't stand out today, but it still looks good. At the moment, the game is very good, but we still didn't talk about the only problem i have with it, which is sadly slightly big. The game contains occasionally unresponsive controls. Anyway, i still think the game should get better, as the intensity of the storyline isn't quite gripping me yet, although it is intresting, it is really not bad, but so far, it feels as if it's gonna get much better. The gameplay, will too. The weapons? There aren't that many. I like the concept of Agent History at the start of the game, too, which you select actually before you get to play it. My experience so far with Alpha Protocol is good, and could nearly achieve a 9/10 with its gameplay, specially since the Stealth works very well.8.8/10 ~Only so far.This review will be updated constantly as i go through the game.

												Alpha Protocol is one big deception. The stealth action is lacking and the enemies sometimes act ridiculously. Because of this most of the missions are a drag. A shame since the created world lends itself perfectly for a spy game. The surprisingly fun conversation system, in which the choices have a real impact on the gameplay, is a spark in the dark mess called Alpha Protocol.Alpha Protocol is a strange game. No matter how good and deep is the RPG part, with a well told story, it's almost completely broke when it's time to shoot and sneak. The A.I. is so cheesy and random that completely make you forget your class and skills.Watch a Bourne movie instead.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												It’s third person shooter/RPG that is most similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mass Effect. The plot is very reminiscent of James Bond and other rouge spy movies.The story is actually pretty intriguing and decently written, involving different factions of spies, mercenaries, terrorists and secret police; taking you to places such as Moscow, Rome and Taipei.  Its interaction mechanics with NPCs during cut-scenes is the highlight of this game.  It allows you to chose different dialog choices that influences the story and character relationships. The cast of characters is colorful and they are all very interesting. Each NPC has a unique and different personality and a huge part/theme of the game is manipulating people to get what you want, that means acting aggressive, professional or suave depending on the person. Your relationships and interactions can also influence the way a mission plays out, whether or not you’ll receive back up, determining who are going to be fighting, and what items on the black market you can purchase. The game also emphasizes dossiers and gathering intel, which gives passive combat bonuses to specific factions and helps you learn about a character’s background so that you can learn how you’re supposed to talk to them if you want them to like you. Missions offer multiple paths, approaches and options. You can also bang MOST of the chicks in one play through, if you play your cards right (this is, hands down, the best part).Combat and controls can feel clunky, it seems like they wanted to make weapon specialization and stats like accuracy, stability and recoil matter in a third person shooter, so it forces you to ‘focus’ your cross hair on your target before you can shoot or else your shots will be all over the place.  This can make early game very annoying because your shots won’t focus fast enough, and any kind of long ranged combat becomes a pain.  The game forces boss fights, there is no stealth solution, you have to straight up fight them so it's highly reccomended that you pump up the stats in at least one weapon (fun fact pistol is over power). Regardless of the boss fights, playing stealth is generally over power, it rewards you with more stuff than a straight up commando/aggressive play, and it trivializes a lot of missions. There are 2 hacking mini-games, a word search and clicking tangled wires in a specific order. They get repetitive fast and are not really fun. The game can also be glitchy at times; there have been times when I’ve been spotted and never should have been (through a wall), times where I’ve gotten stuck in walls and had to die or reload my save, and the game had crashed on me 4 times throughout my play through.I’d recommend it if you like the talking parts of the Dues Ex and Mass Effect or just enjoy a good story driven game. You’d have to deal with the par combat, missions and maybe a rough early game.			",285,93,6,43,22,4,35

												READ THIS!To truly enjoy this game make sure to save often. Autosaves tend to screw you over IE they will autosave right as the door behind you gets locked and you cant double back for loot or something else. This is my main gripe with this game as I love exploring every edge of a game like this and sometimes the game literally blocks you from doing so when you've reached a certain point. Always make saves in case you need to backtrack so you don't have to restart from an earlier point.Also, make sure to check out the FOV bind with a quick google search, this will allow you to zoom out from Thornton(you) and allow better viewing specifically for widescreen users. This game is simply put; Awesome. It's like if Mass Effect went spy on budget. It's a really good game if you like RPG/TPS mechanics with (meaningful) leveling. If you play Recruit on Hard difficulty at first you will feel truly like a recruit and by the end you will feel like a freaking super spy of awesomeness. This game has an amazing element of evolving and also its dialogue tree which actually affects the outcome unlike other games of this genre (looking at you Mass Effect...) Allthough there are some INCREDIBLY annoying things about this game like how the AI will literally do a 180 once you shoot them and spot/simultaneously fire on you. Being a stealth character is more difficult then it should be as this game is mainly built around running and gunning but it's a fun challenge and by the end stealth+pistol became very OP and ultimately rewarding. If you enjoy Mass Effect type games and are willing to look past the occasional issues this game runs into(crappy autosaves, barely serviceable PC port, occasionally weak or unfair AI) it will result in a pretty fun experience that I'll be sure to replay once I unlock Veteran.

												thinking of revisiting this game right now.i played more of it than just these 7 hours before i had this steam account.a good deal of it really.its basically an action/stealth RPG with choice and consequence and a coolnon linear espionage/ conspiracy story.id say the stealth and combat mechanics are very decent.i guess there are some flaws here and there but i cant think of anything right nowthat really took the fun out of it for me.the writing of the game is very good.. its obsidian after all..graphics are okay even though the game is fairly ""old"" now.honestly in my opinion at 15 bucks you can get a lot worse games and this game is actuallypretty damn good! i mean its not just okay and whatever but a game that you should at least try once.i have not expierenced any bugs or performance problems either.pros+ rpg elements, skills and stats and gear. (fairly decent selection in my opinion)+ interesting non linear story with nicely written dialogue, interesting characters and various settings from china to russia to the middle east etc+ good quality of animations, nice cutscenes, talented voice acting+ decent combat and stealth mechanics (nothing too special but nothing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or boring either)+ choice and consequence+ aged but still decent enough graphicscons-loading screens during levels- while the AI is not ""broken"" it isnt the smartest either. sometimes you think wait? he didnt see me there?- like i already said there are loading screens some areas are bigger some are smaller.hardly a difficult sell. i dont understand the mixed reviews it recently got. its a  good game with high production value (at least for its time) done by obsidian who.. dare i say it? always delivers at least a somewhat interesting expierence. and they are charging less than most early access games on steam. (think about that!) and if you can get it on sale... well then its probably cheaper then a menu at mcdonalds.go ahead dont believe and try it.. it may be rough around the edges here and there... but its quite unique.

												So this game was much better than I expected.  I felt there were some areas they could have done better on though...The sniper rifle is not effected by mouse sensitivity. It was so aggrivating to move it just a hair and it would fly all over the place. Several games have this problem, I don't know why.The tranq bullets need work. I got a double head shot with a single tranq bullet Deadpool style. I'm no doctor, but I think the first guy probably isn't asleep...They said I killed marines in the embassy in Russia, I am almost entirely convinced I didn't. This may be a bug.There should have been a first person option. Some games have to be third person but many don't and I feel like this one didn't. Some tight spaces I couldn't see the enemy cause my character was blocking my view. I wish I shot more accurate. The chance to miss is fairly high, even with max rifleman.I personally didn't like hacking computer terminals. It was like a word search in middle school. I never liked word searches.------Random notes:Not a problem but I'd recommend you have one of your weapons the pistol. You really need tranq bullets to beat the game and the pistol has them.Also I'm sad I didn't kill all my enemies but that may be my own fault. I'm also curious about Sis and G22, sure I killed a lot of them but what ever happened to them?------Now, there were some amazing areas. Despite it's flaws, the combat system was a blast. I enjoyed the boss battles (even if they didn't make a lot of sense in an otherwise mostly realistic game)I enjoyed the four romance options, I especially enjoyed you can pursue all four. I disliked that they didn't really stick around. Maybe if you guys do a sequel you can pick up with the romance from the first game? Seems a waste to have the options but never do anything with them.The dialogue system was fun. -----I admit I haven't played many games like this, really only Mars War Logs and Of Orcs and Men but I would say this is the best of those three. I can't say how this compares to Mass Effect but I still recommend it.			",215,88,0,57,24,1,79

												I tried to like this game, I really did. After hearing absolutely damning reviews, I wonderd if this was going to be one of those 'Deadly Preminition' type games where the awsomeness and hilarity of the story makes up for it's abominable gameplay. Unfornately I was dissapointed.Enemies see you from 100 meters away in stealth. Even if you're behind something. Line of sight is completely broken.The guns feel like pea shooters and the combat system is flat out not there with basically one button to mash until you know the dude out. Movement is awkward and strange as the Protaganist seemingly proceeds to slide and float across the ground and the myriad  of glitches where I fell through the floor and got stuck.The story I never got to experience properly as I never got off the first level where I had to hack a door. The minigames are also mindbengingly annoying as it seems that it was designed for a controller. Dont bother with this. Unless you're getting this with the Humble Bundle, then I cant think of a reason for anybody to play this.			",310,55,10,46,33,3,47

												So far, this game is very interestings combining an action/spy game with RPG elements. Now so far it is executed very well, stong graphics, great sound, fluid gameplay..AI is a little off at times and I can see this game becoming very difficult as you progress further. The small puzzles are great such as the Lockpicking, computer hacking and alarm disabling are nothing ground breaking but add to the the game. Being able to customize your player skills is fantastic and really shine as it hits right on the mark to add the rpg feel to the game. I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys James Bond or Mission impossible style gameplay, with Martial arts, cover and many more features. This game seems to combine a little of everything which might be its downfall of trying to do to much but so far makes for a fantastic game! i would recommend while its on sale to pick it up!

												Every aspect of gameplay is awful: glitchy controls, poor AI, you name it and its broken. Dialogue is riddled with quicktime events, and thanks to the awful controls you will never get the choice you want. To make matters worse, the autosave system is set up to prevent you from reloading when you get shafted by the broken controls. This game is so bad I wouldn't recommend it even if they gave it away free.			",186,18,6,13,7,1,6

												I forgot I didn't have a recommendation for this game because I pirated it years ago.Anyway, the premise of the game is pretty awesome, and not really something done before, you're Micheal Thorton, a  bipolar and slightly psychopathic spy that gets betrayed by his own agenecy and has to go rogue to save the world. Well, more like save face for America, but close enough.   I'd go into praise about the gameplay here, but unfortunately Deus Ex: HR did almost everything this game did but better.  The stealth is wonky as ♥♥♥♥ (the developers probably realised this and literally made one of the skills make you go invisible the first time you are spotted) the combat trees are unbalanced, and worst of all there's level scaling, at the start of the game, people die when they are killed, and near the end russian gangsters are tanking headshots like they've been crocodil addicts their entire lives.I briefing mentioned the protagonist's mental deffecientcies earlier, the dialogue system is sort of similar to mass effect, instead of picking what you are going to say, you instead pick an 'approach' such as being suave, joking, aggressive, etc. However, you don't know HOW WELL or how MUCH Micheal is going to go.  Cutting to the chase, Michael is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible at jokes, and is extremely violent and sadistic when given the chance.  To make things worse, being successful against certain NPCS tends to just mean picking one approach and staying with it instead of responding appropriately in a fluid converstational matter.  Of course, since it's an obsidian game, it's filled with a few glitches and probably missing 20% content.All these terrible things being said about the game, it's definitely worth your time, there's some great scenes, and a couple of interesting characters, and some decent customization for your very own secret agent.

												8.5/10+ nice presentation overall, good character models, some bad textures though, could use more detail in the environment, the art is fine though+ gameplay is very interesting overall, with great variety, from stealth to fps, with some high tech tools depending on how you choose to play it+ excellent writing, some fantastic dialogues, very deep dialogue tree, as you expect from one of the companies that have mastered it (obsidian)+ conspiracy story, a bit generic , but it is presented in a realistic way, some very nice side missions that you get to choose as well+ good upgrade system, weapons variety etc- rough technically, mediore animations, generic fps mechanics, generic melee mechanics, fighting certainly needed a polish- could last longer (especially if you go all the way to the main story without caring for the side missions it is really short)- nothing else, it could be a masterpiece if they gave more time to its production, highly recommended though especially to those bored of all the fantasy rpg games out there			",2588,1193,98,301,308,25,396

												Alpha Protocol is the quintessential flawed gem: many faults, a lot of heart and lack of execution. I enjoyed this game a lot no matter all the design's faults. The story is great in terms of reactivity and  roleplaying but sadly the story alone cannot save the game from all its problems and most importantly  for the lack of a coherent overall vision (that can be explained with the troubled story of its development).H(o)rgasm Rating (Holistic Review Gameplay Art Story Metrics):Gameplay: 12/25 (mediocre)Art: 15/25 (good)Story: 23/25 (great)Holistic Rating: 10/25 (the execution and the lack of vision kills the positive parts of the experience)Total Rating: 60... but the rating do not says it all in this case!

												First I thought, oh hey, a bargain for 2 Euros.Then I started the game... and suddenly lost 6 hours of my life before I realized that it is well past midnight.This game is pure awesome. It delivers on presentation, story, sound only sometimes I wish I could fiddle with the mouse sensitivity for sniping. The effects of your in-game decisions are very visible in the storyline and so far, it looks as if there is no right or wrong choice... you just play like you want to play. If I had to, I would describe this game like a playable version of a James Bond movie who had a love child with the Burn Notice TV series.As long as it is 90% off, BUY IT! No excuses! This game is well worth the money and I would pay 40 bucks and consider it money well spent. The last time I had so much fun was with Mass Effect 1 and 2.			",453,90,15,93,67,1,86

												Overall pretty decent game. Stealth mechanics leave a little to be desired. Fairly limited movement (jumping, dropping) is only available at certain spots. Camera can get sporadaic at random times but not often enough to be a problem. Story is realistic at the beginning but become slightly cliched and silly at the end.  Gun mechanics are fun and innovative reminding me of a fresh take on the deus ex mechanic of steadying the shot. Completed it in 10 hours so I wish it was longer.			",85,8,1,7,7,2,5

												Dont trust the reviews. This game is very overlooked because people were expecting a third person shooter aka Mass Effect and got dissapointed. This game is a RPG first and a TPS second. If you keep that in mind, and raise your skills accordingly... to your weapons + playstyle then you will enjoy this game. This game has high replay value and a very dynamic story that changes through each playthrough. It's very hard to get the same ending/middle if you take different approaches. I have beaten this game 5 times so far and have learned more and more about the story line every single time. Very enjoyable RPG with action elements in it.Story is 9/10 and the most dynamic to date. If your looking for a game that will suck you into its world and give you freedom of choice, this would be your game.			",169,16,10,7,3,1,9

If you can look past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs then this game is a must buy (it has been on sale pretty often so you might just want to wait for one just to get it for a price under a pack of smokes).

												This is a great game. Just finished it.Disclaimer,  there are some annoying glitches and bugs here and there but once you get used to the weapon aiming and the hand to hand combat it's more than tolerable. If you can see past some of the minor flaws, you'll find one of the best video game stories I have ever played. Not quite the character development of Mass Effect but a great secret agent story. The dialogue, story, and voice acting are excellent. The moral and ethical choices are really satisfying. If you can crank up the resolution the graphics still look pretty good. None of the writing or voice acting were filler. All the emails, dossiers, and newscasts are crucial to the plot and game play, and quite funny at times. You really do have to build a rapport with characters and be tactful with the ladies to get anywhere. Make sure you go for the ""Ladies Man"" acheivement. ;) One of the things I found dissappointing was even on a mission with patience and perfect stealth you still have to fight your way out as part of the story. Overall, if you like a Jack Ryan, Jack Bauer, ripped from the headlines kind of story, you'll really enjoy this. The newscasts and politcal scenarios could have easily been written in the last couple months and don't feel dated at all. Truly a hidden gem, well worth it even if not on sale, just make sure you finish it, it's worth the time. I just hope they make a sequel. Given that there's no Metal Gear or Splinter Cell games in the pipeline that I know of, I think this is an underserved market right now. Too much fantasy needs a little bit of reality. Even if it's the Mission Impossible, Jason Bourne, Homeland imaginary kind of reality.			",37,1,0,4,6,0,7

												This game frequently gets compared to the famous Mass Effect Series. To be honest though, all the two have in common are the graphic engine, the 3rd person view and the fact, that you as a player get to choose the direction of your ingame conversations. Still, the comparison can be made in order to help people decide, if this game might be for them, or not. While Mass Effect is a lot more RPG (especially the first game) as it lets you wander around, talk to npcs and aquire quests, Alpha Protocol is a bit more linear in its storytelling, since only the order in which you complete your missions and the order of your missionhubs can be determined by the player. The missions itself are pretty action-oriented, even though you might want to take a stealthy approach from time to time in order to take out a few enemies without being noticed or to move into a more favorable position for your assault. It is possible to put lots of talent points into being 'stealthy' and playing almost exclusively like this, but it has to be said that the game is by no means a Splinter Cell and some direct confrontation especially during the last stages of the game is unavoidable. Mission locations are quite diversified, while the level design itself is very linear. During your missions you'll receive radio support by your 'handler', who updates you with the latest mission relevant information. In addition, you'll frequently encounter locked doors and password protected computers, which you'll be able to open or hack by beating one of the increasingly difficult mini-games. The graphics are decent, I especially liked the facial textures of the characters and the depth of field effects. The voice-acting is great, the writing is excellent, as it often offers you funny witty responses in dialogues and also features your expected conspiracy theories and the like. Another note on the subject of dialogue choices in this game: unlike Mass Effect, where you get to choose the exact response you want to give and have unlimited time in deciding on which one it is going to be, you can only choose the general tone and direction of your answer in Alpha Protocol, while at the same time being forced to make this decision within a few seconds. Responses include 'professional', 'threatening', 'suave', 'flirtatious' or a certain subject you want to touch upon. While initially this system felt irritating, once you get used to it, it feels rather dynamic and natural, since there are no pauses during dialogues and you are forced to make decisions on the fly. Decisions in this game have a real impact on the main plot aswell, as often you'll have to make meaningful choices between making allies or enemies, life and death or something of similar weight. Characters react differently to your approach during conversations, and since the game keeps track of your standing with each character, I often find myself reading up on a character's personal files before talking to them in order to get a better understanding of what said npc might react most positively to.So what can you expect from this game? Solid, but not spectacular 3rd person shooter gameplay in a spy setting with some stealth elemtents and gadgets, engaging cutscenes and conversations with meaningful decisionmaking wrapped in a rather complex storyline. Less depth than Mass Effect, less playtime and less production value - but by no means a bad game. The only thing the game really lacks because of this are the big, breathtaking moments. Nonetheless, Alpha Protocol has some pretty memorable scenes (including hook-ups, you perv!) and I am quite satisfied with my first playthrough. Especially if you like the spy-setting, want something tight and less drawn out and prefer a more action-oriented approach to the genre, Alpha Protocol is a must-have.			",207,20,12,26,5,0,23

												This game. It is fun. It can also be frustrating. What is fun? Why is it fun?You're a super secret spy sent by America to open a can of whoop♥♥♥♥♥on terrorists and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.You got guns. They're customizable and♥♥♥♥♥♥ You choose which kinds of guns you want to use on which kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.But hey, if you don't like guns, you can put skill points into martial arts and karate chop those mother ♥♥♥♥ers instead.You see this game seems like an action game. It is. But it is also an rpg. You have multiple differerent skills that you can put points into when you level up. So you can choose what type of bad♥♥♥♥♥super secret agent you want to be. Want to run around the whole time shooting ♥♥♥♥ers in the face with a shotgun? Whatever man do what you want. But a little side note, the combat mechanics isn't exactly straightforward. In this sense it's more like an rpg. When you shoot a guy, the game calculates hit percentages and crits and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. So when you line up your scoped pistol to the face of a guy three feet away from you who miraculously hasn't seen you yet, point it straight between that ♥♥♥♥ing dudes eyes, you pull the trigger...then somehow find out you missed and the dude has just stopped being blind long enough to riddle your♥♥♥♥♥with bullets. Yeah well, that's the game telling you to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. So just keep that in mind.But really the best part of the game is talking to people. Through your super spy social skills, you can choose things like whether or not you want to kill a guy. Or if you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously you choose how you want to behave or make important story decisions through dialogue. Also if you're super suave (or not) you could ♥♥♥♥ most of the chicks in this game. I myself ♥♥♥♥ed two chicks, however I probably could have had sex with another one, but I turned her down because I didn't think it was fair to the others. I'll check that out in my next playthough though.With that all being said, this game can be a fun game. However, the frustrating part comes into play with this games glitches. I've probably replayed levels over and over more than I should have because of these glitches. Sometimes after dying and starting at a checkpoint, it seems that every guard decides to just get up and ♥♥♥♥ing leave, with me running around not knowing what to do because every single guard decided to go on a lunch break. There are other random glitches that you will undoubtedly encounter during your time as America's super awesome spy.But I must say that however glitchy this game can be, it is not as bad as I was lead to believe before I bought it. Is this game fun? Yes. Is it frustrating? Yes. Is it more frustrating than fun? No. Is it worth 15 bucks? Maybe, but definitely worth 10 bucks. So I recommend you buying this game on sale at 10 bucks or under. Now excuse me while I replay this game and try to have sex with all three chicks.I nominated this game for ""The Villian In Most Need Of A Hug"" Award. Because it needs a hug...and a sequel.

												Alpha Protocol is one of the most responsive RPGs I have ever played. Even as the overall plot stays on course to take you through much the same set of levels, characters and circumstances react to your actions in ways you may not even appreciate without a second playthrough. Alpha Protocol's story isn't even that interesting from a wide perspective, honestly - what makes this game amazing is all the work Obsidian put into its execution, shaping a story whose interactivity blows so many other games out of the water.Many of the mechanics are roughly executed or even just ill-conceived, for which Alpha Protocol has been deservedly criticized. Even at release it was not a very good shooter or a very good stealth game, and those parts have certainly not improved with age. But at the end of the day, solid execution on the narrative end keeps things interesting and helps make the game more than just the sum of its parts.If you like branching narrative in your action RPGs, then you need to see what an amazing job this game does in both making its narrative threads reactive and in tying them all together. After playing Alpha Protocol, I always wish more games were like it.			",166,48,2,19,9,0,40

												Alpha Protocol is a bipolar title. If strictly estimated on the gameplay, you can not overlook the serious problems of balance in terms of character development (there are combinations that literally break the game in the later stages), while the stealth sessions and the AI ​​deficit are to be reviewed completely. However, assessed on the RPG side, the game is surprising for the vastness of the choices allowed, not only with regard to the growth of our pg and for the approach to missions, but it will also be possible to completely change the outcome of the events and characters, so that every game will never be the same as another. The dialogue system is as it should be in the last Bioware titles, especially if you wanted to bet on cinematograficity: there is a wheel, not the phrases severed but with the attitude to be taken, which obviously work differently depending dell'interlocutor, plus the ability to gather information to exploit. Everything is in time, a solution that, if at the beginning can be confusing, serves well to remain vigilant of the player and the pace of the narrative.Definitely recommended to all lovers of spy stories, as long as you close an eye on the technical side.

												Not recommendedEven though I thought this game sounded quite promising, and I really wanted to like it, I don't. It seems as if there was a lot of potential regarding what they wanted to do, but I don't think it was done well. GraphicsYes, the game is from 2010, so keep that in mind. However, I think that, even for 2010, the graphics aren't that good. Character editing (glasses, hat, hair) looks terrible, same for the movement in combat etc.GameplayI usually LIKE stealth games, but this one, I didn't. I am not sure whether it's just a higher difficulty or badly done game mechanics. Trying to sneak up on an enemy to take him out often ends up in frustration, as he notices you. However, it feels like the mechanics are just clunky, it's not some overly high AI or bad playing... I have played several stealth games and usually do ok, but here, I tried to sneak up on an enemy, and sometimes, the silent takedown works, sometimes he suddenly alerts everyone around him.AITerrible. On one hand, the second the alarm is raised, they know EXACTLY where you are and shoot at you, which I find HIGHLY unrealistic. I wouldn't mind if they had a general idea quickly and then search for you there, but the second an alarm is raised, it's like they have a hive intelligence and know where you are. At the same time, I have seen some moonwalking, and you can just run towards them and take them down with meleeCombatTerrible as well. If there are two obstacles, and you aim between them and aim PERFECTLY at the head of an enemy, you won't hit him. Let me get this straight - two obstacles, you aim between them (yes, there is room between them), and you won't hit him.Even when in range, and the dot in your targeting circle is aligned with someones head, you often miss. Having to shoot someone in the head (they wear a mask, or sometimes just a bandana, apparently these items generate a bullet proof forcefield) isn't exactly that realistic either. MinigamesThere is lockpicking, disabling alarms and hacking. The first two are... ok. The first one is even fun sometimes (balancing the cylinders of the lock, then releasing your lockpick, with a time limit). The second one is ok. The third one is horrible. Not going into details, the other commenters have commented on how terrible that one is many times. CharactersI didn't like the whole intro, the conversations, the character design. Apart from simply looking odd, I just didn't care for any character, and I didn't like the main character either, who looks like a mix between Shepherd from Mass Effect and some kind of cyborg. OverallSo much potential. I'd have liked to explore the game more and find all the things that those who liked the game praised... the decision-making, the email conversations or whatever. However, the intro went on for too long and didn't grab me at all, and the two missions I tried were simply not fun at all. It's not the very outdated (even for a 2010-game!) look, it's the clunky mechanics, bad AI, horrible sneaking mechanics (MGS V and even Sniper Elite 2 and 3 do this SO much better), bad animation, horrible combat/aiming and the minigames. It's sad, because I was looking forward to trying this, I was very much willing to give it a chance, but I have no interest at all to continue after these two missions. If you can get it on sale (I got it for like 3 or 4 bucks), maybe try it out, but unfortunately, I simply can't recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrific game.  Not sure how I didn't catch it when it first came out.  Good combat, meaningful RPG choices, fun character progression and a tight story with upper eschelon voice acting.  This, alongside the Deux Ex series makes me want a whole lot more of this type of non-D&D-style RPG. Sadly Sega owns Alpha Protocol as Obsidian only developed it.  Sega's a horrible publisher that only seems interested in making content-less games that they backfill via DLC for $150 (TW, DoW, CoH).  It's hard to offer a content-less story-driven, action RPG.  I hope we see a trilogy but I don't have high hopes.			",87,28,0,51,17,4,66

												I consider Alpha Protocol a guilty pleasure. Sure the gameplay isn't particularly great, and if you're not careful when you level up you can make some decisions with your character that make the rest of the game rather difficult, but all the drawbacks fall to the wayside when you get to the story and the character interactions.This game builds on the Bioware approach to storytelling and character development. Your choices aren't clearly Good/Bad/Funny/Jerk/Farewell. The choices you make will affect the storyline rather decently and sometimes you just won't get the full picture of the plot unless you go through it multiple times. ",321,64,5,79,22,6,52

												Dont trust the reviews. This game is very overlooked because people were expecting a third person shooter aka Mass Effect and got dissapointed. This game is a RPG first and a TPS second. If you keep that in mind, and raise your skills accordingly... to your weapons + playstyle then you will enjoy this game. This game has high replay value and a very dynamic story that changes through each playthrough. It's very hard to get the same ending/middle if you take different approaches. I have beaten this game 5 times so far and have learned more and more about the story line every single time. Very enjoyable RPG with action elements in it.Story is 9/10 and the most dynamic to date.

												This game is clearly made by people who don't care. The mini-games to interact with electronic devices are all tedious and frustrating, the computer hacking one will make you go crazy. There's no way around these if you want to play stealth. People magically hear tranquilizer guns and an alarm sounds immediately as if they had sensors everywhere that detected tranquilizer guns. It showed potential but everything is so poorly implemented. Stealth games are my favorite but this game requires you to put up with so much nonsense to play stealth.

TLDR VERDICTOverall, I can’t really objectively recommend Alpha Protocol. It has a wonderful premise that works well in some places, but ultimately fails in a lot more. If you value story over gameplay and you’re in the mood for a good espionage story, then buy this game on sale and breeze through it on easy to avoid frustration. If you’re looking for a good overall stealth action experience, then you won’t really find one here. Here’s hoping Obsidian actually get the time and resources to try a game like this again with a lot more polish.FULL REVIEW BELOW“The only thing I can say for sure, Mike, this business will change you.” – Yancy WestridgeMike Thorton is the newest recruit in for the top secret US government agency known as Alpha Protocol. His first assignment for the agency seems to be stopping a standard terrorist plot, which rapidly evolves into a globe-trotting conspiracy hunt. This review is written from the perspective of a fan of stealth action games with an emphasis on multiple approaches. Also a fan of story driven RPGs.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNAlpha Protocol’s gameplay is not its best asset. The level designs are largely linear stealth action arenas that don’t offer a lot of room for natural exploration or experimentation. There sometimes are hidden rooms that offer loot or alternate routes, but they are few and far between. If you want accurate expectations, you need to dismiss the notion that Alpha Protocol can be played as a pure stealth game from start to finish. Despite the tagline “the espionage RPG”, there are missions clearly designed for stealth, combat and mixtures of the two. If you try to employ combat in a stealth section or stealth in a combat section you’re just going to get frustrated. The problem is that game doesn’t exactly make clear what’s coming, requiring the player to employ some forethought, versatility and adaptability. It sounds neat, but can get frustrating when you show up in full combat gear to a stealth mission or vice versa.The combat and stealth mechanics are a mixed bag. It employs are variation on Deus Ex 1s gunplay, where you basically can’t aim at all until you put enough points into that guns skill. It’s sounds cool, but at the end you basically end up with these horribly over-powered cooldown based weapon abilities that can 1 or 2 shot bosses. The bosses are another negative point for the game. A few of them can be beaten with stealth, but most of them are bullet sponges that you have to take on directly. It reminds me of a similar frustration I had in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, where you would manage your inventory and skills for one playstyle, only to run into a boss that demands another. These inconsistent difficulty spikes are irritatingly prevalent throughout the whole game. Sometimes it seems like the AI has a field of view of 45 degrees in front of them and sometimes it’s like they have eyes on the backs of their heads. The obstacles that enemies can and can’t see through are also inconsistent. The combat AI is smart enough, taking cover and using grenades etc. The stealth AI is less so. They like to stick to predictable paths, can’t hear anything and bodies can’t be moved so they hardly ever spot them.The character progression system is very Mass Effect 1-esque. There are skills that are weapon based and the rest help with other aspects of the game (stealth, hacking etc.). Points can award you with passive abilities and active abilities. The progression starts pretty steady, but as mentioned before, by the end if you specialised correctly you can run around invisible, one shotting everything. Not an exaggeration.STORY AND NARRATIVEThe story and the way Alpha Protocol handles conversations is easily my favourite aspect of it. The conversation options are timed and almost always boil down to 3 responses. You can be a James Bond style suave guy; an Agent 47 professional guy; or just an all-out aggressive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nozzle. Different characters will respond to different tones accordingly and this can affect how much they like or dislike you. You can use this to your advantage, making your handlers and potential assets like you for information and perks and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off enemies to make them easier to beat. The game provides loads of dossiers with two distinct categories: individuals and organisations. Organisation dossiers are pretty straight forward, and are mostly used to give you a rundown of opposition tactics. Individual dossiers are more interesting, as you can exploit the information in them to find out what sort of responses people would like/dislike and times use secret facts in a conversation which have varying special results. For example, you can actually use dossier information in conversations to make two bosses turn on each other later making the fight a breeze. Of course, these options only appear if you actually read the dossiers, which feels pretty damn cool for a spy game.The story itself is structured pretty similarly to your standard Deus Ex game. You have a straightforward prologue that introduces you to the world and then spans into a globetrotting conspiracy hunt. The game does a good job of conveying the feeling of unravelling the plot as you progress, discovering (or even predicting) plot twists as they are thrown at you. There are plenty of choices in the game that are all very morally ambiguous and open-ended in true Obsidian fashion. The factions you side with and♥♥♥♥♥♥off can have fairly significant effects on the rest of the game both during gameplay and in the story. You can try to be good or evil, but most choices boil down to picking between two awful things, which is great.The actual voice acting in this game is surprisingly not half bad for the most part. This is surprising, considering the rough patches the rest of the game has. Aside from a few specific moments, the voice acting holds up for the most part.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEAlpha Protocol is a rough looking game, even for its time (2010). The character models and animations are pretty terrible, texture work is very mediocre, and relying on lighting and shadow effects to stay hidden will almost always backfire. The animations in general are pretty laughable. This especially stands out when patrolling enemies freak out for a second when changing direction. The martial arts moves look pretty janky as well. A very average looking game, not dated enough to deter me, but not exactly anything to marvel at either.Performance-wise, Alpha Protocol is an Obsidian game. What this usually means, is there are a lot of bugs, cut content and a few performance hitches. Alpha Protocol is not a stranger to any of these issues. As mentioned before, the AI is horribly inconsistent, a lot of missions like to bug out when reloading checkpoints (which are designed terribly, no manual saves), and you get punished for breaking stealth or rules of engagement when you know you didn’t. The bugs and technical problems combined with the poor gameplay mechanics make a very frustrating pile of game to get through the gems for the story content, which is a damn shame because those gems can be brilliant at times.

												Good ideas but horrible execution, everything outside of the story/dialouge choices is broken/unbalanced/glitched. It becomes tedious and repetative and for some reason all the voice actors are top notch except for the main character. Unless you can overlook broken shooting mechanics and unbalanced gameplay then don't buy this, and if you do buy this play it on the easiest difficulty for the story and choices.

												One of the greatest RPGs I've had the fortune to play. The combat/stealth (Yes, a main selling point) leaves a lot to be desired, but as for the rest of the game, it couldn't be more spot on. It plays somewhat like Mass Effect, but I thought the story was much, much nicer, and the choices you make in this game actually impact the route that the rest of the game takes, instead of just giving you a different ending depending on X% of nice paths chosen vs X% of evil paths chosen.I'd say this game could go for $40-45. $60 would be a bit much, seeing as the combat/stealth portion is quite flawed, but I'd agree with up to $45. And guess what? It's only $15. You're getting an absolute steal here. (Note: I have multiple playthroughs of this, but for some reason time tracking didn't start until the end of my last playthrough. I probably have nearly 35-40 hours in it at the moment.)			",240,17,3,23,21,5,35

												I rly wanted to like this game, I wish it was that hidden gem that some people say it is. But sadly, it really isn't. The game isn't well known for a reason and that reason is that it sucks, like really really sucks. And I will tell you why it sucks:- the gunplay is terrible - the game looks terrible- the facial animations are bad- the port is bad- the animations are bad- the dialog system (which is the games biggest selling point) is horrible implemented, the game doesn't tell you the full sentence that your character is going to say and some freedom of choice moments are just out right bad designed and confusing- the plot is like a bad james bond film- the controlls are clunky- the bossfights are horrible designed and only really doable with using exploits - the minigames,oh god the minigames ,they are everywhere and they are horrible, both to control and in design.- the sounddesign and music is bad and often out of sync I really can't recommend this game in any means, I'm going to play Deus Ex now to wash out the bad taste this game left in my mouth. Ugh absolutely not recommended.			",220,17,1,23,18,3,28

												Don't bother with this. I'd heard it was pretty poor, but since it was cheap I decided to give it a go due to it's interesting spy espionage theme. Basically everything is just badly executed. Stealth is too easy due to the braindead AI who will sit and stare at you for about 10 seconds before walking off. Combat is just boring because of it's generic structure and fairly odd aiming system. You can basically get around most of the areas with the standard grunt enemy through bugs and glitches - I know I did. Then you go up against a boss. These are pretty unfair and the only way you'll win is by hiding behind cover, slowly picking off each of the boss's goons and then shooting the boss in the face for about 20 minutes until their stupidly large health bar is empty. The only thing this game really has going for it is it's storytelling, with all that choices and branching stuff, ya know what I mean? It was alright I guess, but since all the characters are cardboard cutouts of generic spy movie stereotypes I found it hard to be invested in the story at all. So yeah, don't bother with this game, unless you're willing to devote some time into it. Personally, I couldn't be bothered to play more than 4 hours because it just had too many floors for my taste. However, I can appreciate why people do defend this game.			",248,24,3,10,13,1,17

												Overall score: 5/10The game isn´t that bad, in fact it seems really awesome at the beginning. It feels like a Mass Effect 2 with better controls, more content and more interaction possibilities. At the beginning, that is.As soon as you get into your HQ and start doing missions, the game becomes extremely boring because its very repetitive.Here a summary of the first two hours:Arrive in HQ, look around and explore the rooms in your HQ, buy stuff for your inventory/gear, go into a mission in mid east, kill bad guys, return to HQ, buy stuff for your inventory, go into mission in mid east, kill bad guys, return to HQ, ...and so on.After two hours I was fed up with the game, and uninstalled it.The teammates seemed rather dull and boring, I didnt feel any obligation or interest to listen to the stuff they wanted to tell me, so I just tl;dr´d 75% of the conversations as soon as I noticed that it was going to be a boring dialogue.The many ways to kill or not kill and move or sneak around the maps are there, but not necessary nor effective. There hasnt been a single scenario where sneaking around the whole map and silently killing enemies would have been as efficient as just going full Rambo-mode on them.The weapons feel weird. Extremely inaccurate even when you crouch and aim down the sights. So I mostly took them out with stationed MGs.Overall... meh. Its kind of okay, but it gets boring very quickly.

												I had such high hopes for this game, I don't know why. Uninspired and cumbersome design, annoying glitches and characters that range from the dull to downright offensive make this game a chore to play. The fact that players need to keep their reticules perfectly still for several agonizing seconds to gain accuracy while the opponents bob and weave through cover is frustrating. The decision to force players to specialize and force them into cookie cutter situations anyway is pants-crappingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥, because it forces the player to completely respec their stealth specialist into an assault trooper every time a boss rolls around. Sticky cover ruins the gunfights. The writing suggests a mind-numbingly simple view of world politics where the question whether the ends justify the means doesn't even come up. The illusion of choice basically comes down to what kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you want to be. The plot doesn't connect to any sense of impact or urgency, because characters run a gamut of paperthin stereotypes. Women in particular seem to have little depth, with boosting the male player's ego as their main function. A comparison with old school Bond movies is apt, except that Alpha Protocol seems to take itself more seriously. maybe it's that AP takes place in a realistic setting, but I can't shake the thought that protagonist Mike Thornton is a sociopath no matter how you play him. I tried to play him as a decent human being but the game just doesn't allow that. Some of the dialogue options are openly misogynistic, despite being labeled 'joking'. If that is how the writers think, then that's ♥♥♥♥ed up. Even at a discount, this was a mistake to buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha Protocol is a bit of a buggy mess. I was never actually able to complete the game due to a crash that I could never get past in one of the levels. For what it is, I guess it's alright. The shooting is average, the RPG elements are uninspired, the level design is bland and feels like a cookie cutter example of what a default stealth shooter should look like. Nothing is extraordinary and a lot is broken. At this point, just skip this game. It's was outdated practically the day after it came out... and it has not aged well since.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												Worth the 4$ I paid for it when it was on sale. Never worth 15$.This game tries to heavily imitate Splinter Cell with additional elements of The Witcher (branching story, team-building).What I enjoyed:- decisions affect the future, even something as simple as those during training runs in the beginning- different attitudes affect different teammates differenty, so one must understand their temper- the story branches out based on previous actions and there are tons of scenes for all kinds of combinations of previous actions, the more I play the better it getsWhat I hated:- stealth mechanics: some of the worst in a stealth game- shooting: clunky, unnatural and has crippling timed functions. too many features, none work great.- melee: actually not bad, especially with additional skills- ""hacking"" minigames are stipid, especially number-matching- saving: no quicksaves, only savepoints which is sickening- story: your average spy story with lots of twists but unfortunately often very naive- getting accustomed: it took me an hour or two to get used to how bad the above-mentioned things areIt's like an early beta version of a game that was never finished or polished. It's an ok game to kill a little time if it's on sale.			",28,3,1,1,3,0,3

												I have to say, I really wanted to like this game.There certainly are a lot of compelling, well done mechanics of the game, but they don't seem to flow together very well.The combat is incredibly repetitve, the cover and aiming systems are occasionally finnicky and annoying. My biggest concern with combat is the viewport. The field of view makes it very difficult to scan the area and locate all of the enemies. Meanwhile, the all know your exact location if there is an alarm going off. Part of a stealth game is the ability to have information about your environment and the enemy, and I can't tell you how many times I set off an alarm because I couldn't see a guard walking around a corner as I climbed some stairs. The story was somewhat derivative, but the choices effects on the storyline were very well done. That said, the dialogue system feels a bit clunky. First of all, you usually have to make your decision before the other person has even finished talking, so it doesn't feel like you're responding, but rather choosing a stance before you know what's happening. There is also a perk you get for choosing one of each stance in a conversation. Interestingly, the left, top, and right choices seem to be hard coded to a type,  there are a few times where the three options are not related to a personality but are just collecting various intel about the upcoming mission, but you can still get the perk that way. There are also many characters who show up once and seem super important and then never have any effect on the story.Lastly, the main character's writing/voiceacting is AWFUL. I can't stress enough how forced all of his lines were and how his tone failed to fit the moment. Very often I regretted some of my dialogue choices not because of what they were but because of how dull the character was saying them. When you choose to execute Nasri in Saudi Arabia, Mike says, in such a dull voice ""Ooops, looks like the comm line is dead"" or something equally stupid. This is the first time I realized how bad the voice acting was. ",156,61,0,26,11,0,18

												I really wanted to like this game, as a Modern Espionage action RPG it fills a niche that no other game before or since has tried to. But the controls are so broken and the combat mechanics so terrible that I simply could not.The story is compelling, the game's concept is interesting, but the execution falls flat.The hacking mini-game, the mastering of which is critical to the game, is nearly impossible to do with the keyboard and mouse combo; fortunately this game does support gamepads as clearly this game was designed for consoles and the PC port was a sloppy after thought.Every now and then I look for mods for this game, something to un-♥♥♥♥ the gameplay, but I have yet to find anything that fixes the gameplay. Which is a damn shame: the first mission really drew me in to this game's story, but Alpha Protocol's broken game mechanics pushed me right back out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has the most profound and in-depth morality/decisions system I've ever seen in any game. Unlike games like Mass Effect where it's ""good"" or ""bad"" decisions, every single character in the game have different outcomes depending on how you threat them.  Want somebody to be unable to think straight?♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. You can even treat a russian chick like♥♥♥♥♥♥and she bangs you. This game destroys games like The Walking Dead in terms of story, but not in gameplay. The gameplay is clunky as hell but still enjoyable. ",247,46,6,29,19,3,21

												This is one of those games I've begged Steam support to wipe from my account history. I'm not satisfied with just ticking the ""hidden"" box - I have to destroy any record I ever played it. Alpha Protocol is really lame. It's like distilled lame. It's like watching Marvel: Agents of Shield or something on TV, and breaking down how lame and hokey it is and incorporating those elements into a game.  The lifeblood of Alpha Protocol, your character Michael Thorton, BLOWS. He sucks as a martial arts expert. He sucks as an infiltrator. He sucks as a John Woo ™ gunslinger. He's not charming, or intimidating, or insightful. His agent loadout looks like the ""My First Spy"" playsets you see at the dollar store. His weapons handle like popguns. His outfits look like Halloween costumes. Basically, this game is so singularly terrible at fulfilling the power fantasy of being a worldclass secret agent, it seems like it could only exist by way of a genie who would grant your wish for a spy RPG and vindictively make it the worst spy RPG possible. This flabby, childish, uninteresting mess, designed to put you off spy-related media for the rest of your life.Sound design is the definition of average. 5/10. Controls are there. 4/10. Gameplay is a whopping 3/10. Art direction is like a bad comic book. Like the ones made by Sears to teach their employees how important loss prevention is. 2/10. Story ""exists"". 2/10. Supporting characters? They almost exist. 1/10. Michael Thorton is a well earned 0. Really, it's an accomplishment.Seriously, Steam, please. I will pay you to take this game off my history.

												I typically love Obsidian but this game is by no means a gem of the past. It is not a bad game.... but I am playing it for the first time 7 years after its release and its pretty meh. Honestly my biggest complaint is how garbage you start out being with firearms. Im sorry but if you have had ANY training with a hangun (or even none), you can hit something at 5 yards EASY. If you are bored and its on sale for a few dollars, sure why not.Combat is pretty bleh - AI is crap. Gunplay early on is very frustrating, as I know I can make these shots in real life...mini games are bleh- hacking is okay, lockpicking is stupidstory is bleh - Sent to invade an airport solo and can barely operate a handgun, lol.

												TL;DR - Clunky interface, don't recommend.It took me 75 minutes to get through the tutorial and one of the training missions.  I spent about 20 of those 75 minutes trying to figure out the awful hacking mini-game.  How someone could design a mess like that and then think it's a good idea is baffling.I should have quit after the hacking tutorial, but I had heard this was a good RPG, so I pressed on.  The next thing I know I'm doing the grenade training mission and getting beat up by all the guards I had knocked out during the tutorial.  I tried fighting back but I couldn't figure out the magic keys on my keyboard to throw a punch.  Spacebar?  F key? RMB?  Don't know.There is also apparently some kind of reputation system, however the dialog options are only on the screen for about 2 seconds giving you no time to read and process what option to choose.  Again, how can a designer think this is a good idea.I finally gave up and went back to XCOM 2.			",67,3,1,6,7,0,13

												After have just finished this game on hard as a recruit/spy I am just glad to be done with the game.Sure it has the positive part where all your decisions affects your missions and such.The controls are really annoying sometimes when you wanna get out of cover or how you wanna throw grenades at times.Enemies can sometimes shoot through cover and kill you that way. Yes, certain things are breakable and that is fine but when getting shot through walls and behind cover is annoying and frustrating.Some boss fights are very hard. All depends on how you build your character but without certain ones it makes it almost insanely hard. Picking some skills makes it way easy to get through the game.I was hoping for more stealth and sneak but sometimes that was no option at all.The dialogs sometimes made me cringe so badly I almost wanted to mute it. There is one allied I liked in the game and he is craaaazy but funny. Made it somewhat fun at least.Graphics and sound were fine for the type of game it is.I can't recommend this game on my experience of the game thou.			",208,50,1,27,4,0,10

												This game was in my opinion missed due to all the great RPGs that came out last year. Despite it's FPS interface, it is an RPG similar in style to Mass Effect. Unlike other RPGs and Stealth FPS games, the action doesn't stop when the conversations start. Conversations are battles themselves because you are given only a short time to decide how to respond and your repsonses make a difference from mission to mission, not just the end game.

												Buggy, linear, and generally not as open as it advertises. The game says you can solve problems with any number of different approaches, from Stealth, to gadet use, to open combat. However, in reality the game is obviously meant to be a stealth game. If you try playing it like a shooter (running around, using cover, shotgunning it up) you can beat the game, but you will fail a ton of secondary objectives. Almost every mission the game is telling you to sneak around and not be seen, so why are shotguns, uzis, and assault rifles available to the player when the game really, really wants you to use a silenced pistol (or fists I suppose)?All-in-all a mediocre game with very little room for customization and character building. I never felt like I was the Agent, I just felt like I was watching his story.			",42,15,0,20,7,0,16

												Oh damn you Obsidian for the hate/love relationship I have with your games.49% of me wants to recommend this game and 51% not to. I will do the democratic thing and not recommend it, but I will list some of the pros and cons which constitute these numbers below:Pros - why 49% of me would recommend it- Well written story, characters, dialogue- It really manages to make you feel like a spy most of the times- It has some really interesting and original ideas- It has some great RPG mechanics- You should play it at least to see that Obsidian can come up with some cool stuffCons- why 51% of me would not recommend it- Buggy- Gameplay is terrible... in an age of third person shooters... Obsidian failed to pull off decent basic 3rd person shooter mechanics- Mechanics are not really balanced- Some loose ends... aka you don't see the consequences of some of your decisions- I found the ending to be really badAll in all, if you are curious, you should definitelly pick it up for a sale. At the very least it might help Obidian hire some programmers and designers who can actually design a game around what I think are some very cool ideas they have. You can't make a good game with just good writing tho'.			",107,11,0,13,9,0,17

												I can't recommend this sadly. I want to. and I want to keep playing, but not for all,  but for many ( I have been reading forums) this game is  unplayable. I have over 100 games in my steam account, newer and older, I run those games at higher settings than this game. every time  I'm playing every instance, I rotate the camera, it turns very painfully slow, when facing a close blank wall, but as soon as it turns to the more open environment, the camera speeds by so fast when moving the mouse. I can't even aim the gun. I tried to lower all the settings, even manually with the Nvidia settings, nothing works. I for one can't play this game as bad as I want to. I progressed through the first level, and I can't even get this to remotely be playable now at all, especially in this map of the desert.  i turn and face the wall again, and the camera moves normally, then the same movement of the mouse that BARELY turns the camera, all of a sudden rockets so fast, that I try to aim at an enemy, and I keep zooming passed him from one side to the other, while barely moving the mouse at all. for me (and many others I read also) this makes this game absolutely unplayable. how said.  I truly wantyed to play this one, especially with the stealth. I love stealth type games. so if you buy this game anyways, and get the above described problem, don't say I didn't warn you. However there are others., who claim this game works fine for them, so.. it's a risk you will have to weigh yourselves. for me this game is broken as a result of unplayable camera control.. terribly bad			",96,3,2,15,3,0,7

												I played this back in the ps3 and it wasent very good, Saw it on sale a while ago and bought it. just recently i got to it, While i definitly enjoyed it way more than i remember i still cant reccommended. First of all the hacking mini game is horrible, dosent help the controls on keyboard and mouse are bad. There are quite a few buggs and some of the dumbest and most inconsistent enemy AI ever. There were times i would get spotted from very far and other times i would walk right in front of them and nothing. I put a lot of points into stealth and pistols and it was fun. I think the strongs part of this game is the story and the gameplay the weakest. I would defnitly reccommended if you can get it for .99 like i did otherwise i wouldent bother.			",109,8,0,14,3,0,2

												The ultimate spy-fiction game. It's the James Bond: 007, Mission Impossible, you-name-it of Video Games and the best use of plot-impacting choice/consequence I have seen in a modern AAA game. The game is also very mature and the writing is amazing in almost every way. Don't mind the♥♥♥♥♥♥shooting mechanics, just go stealth and have a blast and if that's not good enough for you, there's SEX in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recommended but ,read some details below.Overall, this game looks like if it was made ten years ago.Somewhat an RPG, 3rd person action and stealth game, which sounds really interesting, right?.In the ballpark of splinter cell.In the positive side, story is interesting and deep. Missions are variated. Each dialogue has several alternative attitudes to answer, which directly impacts in relationships with main characters. Black Market to personalize your equipment and to gather some info, is also a good thing.It's somewhat similar to early Splinter Cell games, including door lock cracking, digital pannels, PC and survilance cameras control.So, the overall design of the game is interesting enough.In the negative side, controls are a tad sloppy and, particularly, camera (or head) rotation. Enemies IA lacks the I, they suddenly attack you (even if you are stealthing and they are far away) or, they ignore you while killing one enemy beside other. That's weird and, probably the two things that rest points to a game that, otherwise, would be a great one.Difficulty is easy, in normal mode. It's really difficult to dead during fights. Stealth has not so much importance. You end killing everybody, at the end.But the few bosss are really hard to bate.Game has hours of playing so, you will be entertained for a while.The balance in relationships between your character and other main characters is difficult to achieve and, depends on which attitude you are selecting for each conversation chunk. This helps to increase that sensation that you  don't know who to trust and, who are the good boys.			",337,279,13,32,18,2,32

Why when I played on my Xbox everything works correctly and why here with the same controller I don't have all option necessaries to play it correctly ? I know, video games are better on keyboard and mouse but sorry for this kind of game, I need my gamepad, I'm such an old school gamer but I tried on the other way and don't found it playable.Too bad, just for that only thing, the game is not what I expected.

												This game is always praised for two things: it's story and its interesting take on rpg convention. To be clear if you want the story of the caliber this game has to offer go to any story, literally any store and buy a Tom Clancy novel. They sell them everywhere and even Clancy at his worse was at least as good as this game at its best. The stealth and action mechanics are a loud clear fart that drowns out the interesting ideas that the game does well. This game is worth a rent or a steam sale 5 dollar impulse buy to see those few good ideas that you really will wish someone who makes stealth games will pick up and run with, but not much more.

												By far, one of the best Obsidian games I've ever played. Definitely the buggiest, glitchiest game I have ever played... so far... Yet this game still manages to be amazing. Truly an espionage RPG and truly an RPG worth having. If a sequel were on Kickstarter, I would donate all money I could spare just to ensure it would reach PCs and consoles. I loved every minute of this game. The spy action-RPG we all deserve.+ Great espionage game+ Action RPG elements are solid+ Fun stealth+ Superb story+ Graphics are pretty good+ Great soundtrack+ Terrific voice acting+ Decisions feel imactful+ All the sex Michael (and you) desire in a totally PG-13 James Bond fashion- Controls aren't that good- Hacking minigame- Not enough customization options to make your Michael stand out- Pistol is the only thing you need- One of the glitchiest games I've ever had the honor of playing- Enemy AI is pretty bad more often than not			",422,26,5,57,7,2,20

												An overwrought, undercooked spy action RPG choose your own adventure. Written by people who have absolutely no idea how real human beings talk but like to dazzle you with constant back and forth half answers so you get confused and think you're watching clever people joust verbally.Still worth trucking through the lack of polish and the dour writing because, hey, when you're trying so, SO hard to be clever, you actually end up sometimes being clever despite yourself. The bosses are more interesting than you'd expect in a Syphon Filter-esque TPS baked with RPG. The array of characters each with different personalities and motivations and schemes to keep straight is dizzying and you are constantly making friends, enemies, and choices. The plot itself may be limp and boring but the way you navigate is far more interesting than anything that actually happens.I could count the memorable scenes in this game on one hand, and the memorable lines of dialogue with the remaining fingers, but the ones that stick out are definitely interesting.

												When I got the game from a bundle, I was not expecting much from it and thought it would be a medicore game. Oh god, I was so wrong and I ain't even complaining about it. AP is a TPS-RPG hybrid like Mass Effect series but unlike ME it takes place in today's world. It leaves us to take control of a spy and go on missions all across the world. If I told anything about the story I'd probably spoil something unintentionall so I'll just leave pros and consPros:-Dialogue system is pretty nice and gives you a few seconds to make your choice, makes it more realistic IMO-The game lets you decide entirely how you're gonna play it. You can be a stealth assassin and catch people unaware, go Rambo against an army, run to people and punch them to death etc etc-Weapon/armor variety and upgrades are nice and enables you to custimize your weapons/armor to suit your playstyle-Can be finished multiple times to see all parts of story(long playability time)-Great story filled with betrayals, treasons, revenge, love and lots of interesting stuff-Things like lockpicking and bypassing stays enjoyable through your playthtrough-Watching the news and hearing whatever you've done on the broadcast is a fun detail, and also everything you do on a mission effects the(close or far) future onesCons:-Hacking. Honestly it is so stressing and tiring that I found myself wishing it didn't exist. It was fun in the first 2-3 time but having it as the most frequent minigame and making it harder and harder just killed the magic.-Camera can be a bit messy sometimes.-Some people say they encountered many bugs on internet but throughout my playththrough I only faced literally 2 bugs-Sometimes guns require too much accuracy(stat). Eventhough you point your gun to the other person's head and wait for it to be in critical state it may not even leave a scratch on them-AI can screw hard during combats-Skills make the game too easy(trying to play it without skills is fun though but challanging)That's all I can say, I guess. I think this game is criminally underrated and even though I got it from a bundle, I'd happily pay the original price to play it. P.S: I reccomend playing the game as stealth assassin as it is more fun and AI is much better during the stealth times			",89,17,0,16,2,0,2

Strangely, opinions on this game differ, with most media outlets despising it, while the typical unaffiliated reviewer, such as myself, finding it worth of praise. All in all, if you like a game with decent shooter elements and an above average story where your actions hold some (but not enough, IMO) weight in the outcome, you should check this game out.6.5/10- above average.

												Started a game on hard and painstakingly stealthed my way through most of the game. A random boss fight occurs. Bosses are immune to being stabbed in the throat, because a$$holes don't have throats (or something). A fully charged shotgun blast point blank to the face (yes you can charge a shotgun, put your hand down) took away 1/4 of his REGENERATING ARMOR which was roughly 1/20 the size of his health. He could kill me with four shots from his pistol and could summon troops from the janitor's closet. So I thought to myself, fine, I've been beaten, I'll lower the difficulty OH WAIT NO I ♥♥♥♥ING WON'T because you can't change difficulty mid-story. So, I guess what I'm saying is...NEVER EVER PLAY THIS			",156,22,0,11,6,1,10

												Before Alpha Protocol, I didn't know Obsidian Entertainment existed. I didn't know they developed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, I didn't know they made Fallout: New Vegas, and I didn't know they created the Neverwinter Nights series. Heck, it wasn't until my second playthrough of Alpha Protcol almost half a year later that I discovered how much I really, really like this game.Obsidian Entertainment is best known for being the developer other developers hand their franchises to when they hit a creative rut. Bioware handed them Knights of the Old Republic, and Bethesda handed them Fallout. In both cases, Obsidian took those franchises and surpassed the original games.Alpha Protocol, while technically released after Fallout: New Vegas, could be seen as Obsidian's first original IP since Neverwinter Nights, and boy is it an ambitious one. Alpha Protocol is an action-y/stealth-y/gadget-y/spy-y with aspirations to being everything that Mass Effect promised to be. It plays like a movie, emphasizes player choice, and offers a diverse number of playstyles.It comes within micrometers of being one of my favorite games. It's so close to being perfect that I can almost smell it. With some tweaking, the stealth could be great, the shooting fun, and the storyline fascinating. Unfortunately, small things muck up the gameplay. Stealth is hampered by the lack of attention the boss battles pay to it, alongside inconsistent NPC fields of view. The story is... well, while it's very nicely presented, it tends to be an incomprehensible mess. I didn't have much of an idea what was going on until my second playthrough.But despite the flaws, Alpha Protocol is very, very good. For all its flaws, it's an ambitious game, and it earns an easy recommendation from me.			",178,61,1,34,7,2,16

												TL;DR i can't stand play this game more than 1 hour.First: after spending few minutes completing the first stage and it's tutorial to getting used with this game. I just realised this game have option to play with joystick. WTF!!Second: stealth/crouching movement kinda creepy. Not cool at all. and moving from one hiding spot into another kinda confusing,Third: Guard alerted kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Yups, when guard see you, the alarm trigerred instanly but when you want to turn off the alarm, you need to play the boring minigame which will stress you if you do it often.Conclusion: this is not a game if you're looking into stealth, i felt this game more into action shooter.This game is not something i expected remembering this game released at 2010, i will expect more better graphic and animation :|Gonna ask for refund, hopefully accepted :)			",84,21,0,23,10,0,6

												In this game, you play as Michael Jackson Thorton who easily convinces Italian gelato salesmen that there's mad viruses on the loose that download nasty images on your computer via insults and a couple of gunshot wounds, or everything goes fine and you install ""security"" on the computer, and many other options.Initially, you can play the game with many different playstyles and dialog choices, though the combat is difficult to get used to at first, and ingame perks help decrease the difficulty in such things, in exchange for making the time limits on minigames way too short.

												Before Alpha Protocol, I didn't know Obsidian Entertainment existed. I didn't know they developed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, I didn't know they made Fallout: New Vegas, and I didn't know they created the Neverwinter Nights series. Heck, it wasn't until my second playthrough of Alpha Protcol almost half a year later that I discovered how much I really, really like this game.Obsidian Entertainment is best known for being the developer other developers hand their franchises to when they hit a creative rut. Bioware handed them Knights of the Old Republic, and Bethesda handed them Fallout. In both cases, Obsidian took those franchises and surpassed the original games.Alpha Protocol, while technically released after Fallout: New Vegas, could be seen as Obsidian's first original IP since Neverwinter Nights, and boy is it an ambitious one. Alpha Protocol is an action-y/stealth-y/gadget-y/spy-y with aspirations to being everything that Mass Effect promised to be. It plays like a movie, emphasizes player choice, and offers a diverse number of playstyles.It comes within micrometers of being one of my favorite games. It's so close to being perfect that I can almost smell it. With some tweaking, the stealth could be great, the shooting fun, and the storyline fascinating. Unfortunately, small things muck up the gameplay. Stealth is hampered by the lack of attention the boss battles pay to it, alongside inconsistent NPC fields of view. The story is... well, while it's very nicely presented, it tends to be an incomprehensible mess. I didn't have much of an idea what was going on until my second playthrough.But despite the flaws, Alpha Protocol is very, very good. For all its flaws, it's an ambitious game, and it earns an easy recommendation from me.			",178,61,1,34,7,2,16

												A pretty good spy action RPG by the legends themselves, Obsidian. Strangely, opinions on this game differ, with most media outlets despising it, while the typical unaffiliated reviewer, such as myself, finding it worth of praise. All in all, if you like a game with decent shooter elements and an above average story where your actions hold some (but not enough, IMO) weight in the outcome, you should check this game out.6.5/10- above average.

												A wicked good story-based game. It pays a lot of attention to detail and really goes the distance in terms of changing stuff based on what you do in game. Not to mention the game will track stuff like ""orphans created"" and ""hospital bills"". The gameplay is pretty alright, not much to brag about but perfectly servicable for the most part.It's not without it's flaws though. The dialogue system, which is a really important part of the game, is even more vague than the mass effect dialogue wheel with a time limit. You're stuck chosing words based on stances (Professional, suave) and sometimes it'll only give you a second to choose when you actually hear the question itself. Plus I ran into a few bugs, one in particular was because I ran into a door at the wrong time, causing the game to think I did something that I did not, and it was brought up several times in game.But still, I had fun with it and the story system makes up for those flaws. I recommend getting it while it's on sale.			",261,35,6,11,16,4,17

												This would have been a great espionage RPG, but unfortunately, it simply isn't anything good gameplay-wise.Pros:1. nice story premise so far since I haven't finished the game yet2. some very generic protrayals of characters but reasonably good voice acting3. the leveling system and skills are kinda fun4. in-game soundtracks are not dull and some are actually very intensely intriguing at timesCons:1. the extremely outdated graphics: obsidian made two RPG games in 2010, one is Fallout: New Vegas which looked like it was from 2006, another was called Alpha Protocol that looked like it was from 2004. Seriously, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory looks a lot better than this2. I've seen much cleverer enemy AI in mobile games3. as if the enemies annoying patterns of behavior didn't ruin the game's realism enough, tons of terrible game design choices managed to make it even worse for the players. seriously, does anybody know how to vault a FU-CK-ING waist-high obstacle in this game?4. speaking of game design choices, this is a mother-loving stealth game in nature! even players are given the choices to go into every frickin mission gun-blazing, a lot of us still want some honest-to-god satisfying stealth action! meaning not just to stick into any cover possible while encountering enemy patrols, and in many instances, thanks to the game's brilliant AI and level designs, you still get spotted while doing that, or won't get spotted even if you are virtually right in the middle of an enemy's line of sight, depending on your luck. And of course, thanks to the game's fu-gly lighting and shadow effects, definitely no light and darkness element included in this game's concept of stealth, right, maybe it wanted to be something like Metal Gear Solid 4 oh and by the way when I write this review MGS series already started introducing this element since the release of Ground Zero far as I know.5. at least this game managed to exceed what MGS was capable of doing in one aspect: the total clunkiness and awkwardness of all the aspects of combat system. Before playing this game I thought MGS series action and shooting and basically everything concerning its core stealth-action-based gameplay was a clunky mess (which thankfully seems to have been improved a LOT in MGSV), but after playing this game............................... I can only say that I basically impatiently rushed through every single part of the game that REQUIRES ME PLAYING just to see how the plot was going to develop, and this is probably the first time I actually want to stay longer in the cutscenes and conversation sequences in an Action Role Playing Game...No idea why so many users on steam would recommend this game, calling it 'gem of an RPG', this whole game was a bloody MESS of an RPG resulting from a series of awfully poor design choices and development executions, though the initial concept was very innovative and the actual story of this game is quite intriguing.My score for this game 6/10, NOT RECOMMENDED unless you really think you can stomach whatever nasty things this game shoves down your throat during your unenjoyable playthrough.P.s. Maybe Obsidian Entertainment should go back and develop more spin-offs or sequals for some already successful franchises instead of obtaining and working on their own IPs, it has been proven they're simply not cut out for this, at least not yet.

Posted: April 10
												Alpha Protocol is a polarizing game, and rightly so. It's janky, not quite balanced, and has some miserably bad voice acting. It's also one of my favorite games of all time. Have I gone crazy? Well...To begin with, there are over a dozen different types of items to find, customize, and use in missions. Nearly everything in the game that you can equip can be upgraded, and all of the upgrading is optional. Importantly, there's no one item or item type that you must use to progress. You could finish the entire main storyline with your starting guns and punch the vast majority of hostiles with your fists, which can be upgraded. And your character's durability can be upgraded in much the same way, which is important if you want to start a bunch of boxing matches with armed gaurds. You can play stealthily, loudly, loudly like a fox (trick the guards into activating an alarm panel that's rigged up with a sticky grenade, for example), or any combination of approaches that suits your playstyle. The difficulty comes from the enemies and hazards directly, and not from the all too common ""everything-proof shield"" that most developers of action games lazily rely on.The level design is excellent, for the most part. You'll rarely be completely lost, guard placement is optimal, items aren't too densely packed to be challenging, nor too sparse, and turrets and the like aren't common enough to be infuriating, but not so rare as to make a technology-focused build less powerful than the others. Your decisions in previous missions, and in the sequences between them, will even open some paths and block others, but it isn't overdone enough to become tedious. And it's quite rare to be without cover and alternate paths simultaneously.The levelling system is quite good, for my tastes, but will certainly bother others. If you focus on putting all your points into a skill, your character will become quite overpowered in that skill by the end of the game. Stealth skill will eventually give you a cloak on a cooldown, pistols can be aimed in slow motion and fired cartoonishly rapidly, shotguns are eventually able to keep bosses almost permanently knocked down, and so on. On the one hand, this means that the skill points you spend are going somewhere useful, regadless of what you prefer to level up. On the other hand, if you're looking for something brutally difficult, or even realistically difficult to overcome, you won't be satisfied by Alpha Protocol. By the end of the game you're basically a superhero fighting large hordes of well-armed goons and the occasional supervillain. Or sneaking past the ones that aren't bosses... but still. The characters in the main cast are boring, forgettable cliches. Their voice actors put forth as little effort as possible and the writers didn't try very hard with them, either. The secondary characters, though, are often very endearing and well-acted. James Hong makes a delightful cameo. Stephen Heck, Sie, Albatross, and too many more to mention are also greatly more entertaining characters than the main ones. It's fair to say that the more central a character is to the plot, the worse their writing and voice acting gets, with Mike Thorton (the main character) easily being the worst.The main plot isn't a strong point. It's about secret agents trying to stop an evil CEO from starting a world war. Fortunately, though, it frequently takes a back seat to the secondary plot arcs and doesn't get much more than (jarringly frequent) lipservice throughout most of the game. You'll have to put up with some characters bringing up the main plot every chance they get, but it's mercifully rare for gameplay to be impacted by it.The dialogue itself is of drastically varying quality (see above), but the user interface that directs your character's responses in conversation is an unmitigated disaster. If you've played Fallout 4 you know what to expect - you can push one of four buttons to make your character say something, but it's impossible to know what precisely you're making him say without prior knowledge. You get a vague indication of the tone and topic you're going to be responding with and a very limited time to peruse your options. And some characters will only like you if you mash the B button [(for example) (Xbox360 controller)], while others will hate you if you mash the B button, which is as dumb as it sounds.So who do I recommend this game to? If you thoroughly enjoyed Deus Ex 1, bought a copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and it made you facepalm so hard that it sounded like a gun went off, you'll find Alpha Protocol a much needed relief. If you're looking for a believable spy thriller in an original setting, you'll probably find this game painful to play. If you're the type that played Fallout: New Vegas as an angry, drugged-up whackjob that goes around starting fights with everything that moves (or did so at least once and enjoyed it), and want something that brings that catharsis back now that you've played F:NV to death, you'll be amply able to scratch that itch in Alpha Protocol. If you prefer your stealth games to have high-tension, highly difficult stealth like Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Alpha Protocol will certainly dissapoint you. To me, it's incredibly fun in spite of most of its flaws, and partly because of its other flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game a long time before i finally bought it on sale for pc.Yeah the combat and AI are iffy and the graphics aren't amazing BUTDialogue and choices in this game are hands down the most interesting and meaningful I""ve seen in a long time.   Every person you deal with has a unique personality and character WOW! like in real life and things that would work with one person (compliments, being nice) etc wouldn't work with another person.  WHICH I LOVE.  You have to treat everyone differently and they have bonuses and consequences for how each relationship works out.  THere are time sensitive events and other things which you can MISS which adds REPLAYABILITY to the game and multiple ending paths.  I don't know why games want to coddle gamers so you can get everything on the first playthrough, if your game is fun and there is something new to explore the next time I'll play it again!I love this game even through all its flaws, I wish they would've made another game that was even close to as interesting as this title was to me.

												Alpha Protocol is a buggy, unpolished mess. The gameplay is very poorly designed (fun, don't get me wrong, but not well-designed). But I still recommend it to anyone who likes ""choose your own adventure"" type games because Alpha Protocol is a shining example of how to write in the genre. Everything you do has an affect throughout the game and it's interesting to see how it all plays out. Definitely try it out if you can catch it on sale.			",200,29,1,14,10,3,11

												This is like an early season of the show 24. Reminds me a lot of the old PS2 game too in some ways. Except this is a lot better. Im not really into stealth games and some people have said you dont have to play it like one. You can play it like a typical third-person shooter game, which i did. Works fine. I like that the levels are mostly linear too. The star of the show is the story, characters, and the decisions you make. Its a lot like Mass Effect in that way. Upgrading weapons and armor is fun too. And also adding a certain perk to your character is a nice touch too. 8.5/10 ",328,20,8,2,6,1,0

												Yes, it has flaws but I can't help but love this game so far.Firstly, IT WORKS. No need for RadeonPro tweaking, no stuttering, no FPS drops, no noticeable glitches or bugs (so far). To be honest, I'd forgotten the difference it makes to have a game that just immediately functions as it should after download to my enjoyment of it. If every game worked this straightforwardly, I'd be a truly happy gamer.Secondly, it's just fun. Just fun. In terms of combat, not epically challenging, it seems (depending on what character build you use; stealth and hand-to-hand seem to hands down beat firearms in almost all situations).Thirdly, the dialogue system is really intriguing. Some other reviewers have criticised the vagueness of the dialogue choices, but it hasn't seemed that problematic to me. The voice acting is epic. I love the loadout customisation options too.BUT, use an Xbox controller to play it. The hacking minigame is frustrating WITH a controller, and basically impossible without. That minigame is my only gripe really. It seems to require 20-20 vision and has a timer that clearly has a dinner appointment after finishing work, its that fast.I bought the game on sale and it was totally worth it. If you don't have an Xbox controller, you'll have to factor in that cost to be able to enjoy it, to be honest. But as a game, it's fun, intriguing, pretty good looking and best of all...IT WORKS. :):):)			",48,7,2,11,4,0,3

												Alpha Protocol is a polarizing game, and rightly so. It's janky, not quite balanced, and has some miserably bad voice acting. It's also one of my favorite games of all time. Have I gone crazy? Well...To begin with, there are over a dozen different types of items to find, customize, and use in missions. Nearly everything in the game that you can equip can be upgraded, and all of the upgrading is optional. Importantly, there's no one item or item type that you must use to progress. You could finish the entire main storyline with your starting guns and punch the vast majority of hostiles with your fists, which can be upgraded. And your character's durability can be upgraded in much the same way, which is important if you want to start a bunch of boxing matches with armed gaurds. You can play stealthily, loudly, loudly like a fox (trick the guards into activating an alarm panel that's rigged up with a sticky grenade, for example), or any combination of approaches that suits your playstyle. The difficulty comes from the enemies and hazards directly, and not from the all too common ""everything-proof shield"" that most developers of action games lazily rely on.The level design is excellent, for the most part. You'll rarely be completely lost, guard placement is optimal, items aren't too densely packed to be challenging, nor too sparse, and turrets and the like aren't common enough to be infuriating, but not so rare as to make a technology-focused build less powerful than the others. Your decisions in previous missions, and in the sequences between them, will even open some paths and block others, but it isn't overdone enough to become tedious. And it's quite rare to be without cover and alternate paths simultaneously.The levelling system is quite good, for my tastes, but will certainly bother others. If you focus on putting all your points into a skill, your character will become quite overpowered in that skill by the end of the game. Stealth skill will eventually give you a cloak on a cooldown, pistols can be aimed in slow motion and fired cartoonishly rapidly, shotguns are eventually able to keep bosses almost permanently knocked down, and so on. On the one hand, this means that the skill points you spend are going somewhere useful, regadless of what you prefer to level up. On the other hand, if you're looking for something brutally difficult, or even realistically difficult to overcome, you won't be satisfied by Alpha Protocol. By the end of the game you're basically a superhero fighting large hordes of well-armed goons and the occasional supervillain. Or sneaking past the ones that aren't bosses... but still. The characters in the main cast are boring, forgettable cliches. Their voice actors put forth as little effort as possible and the writers didn't try very hard with them, either. The secondary characters, though, are often very endearing and well-acted. James Hong makes a delightful cameo. Stephen Heck, Sie, Albatross, and too many more to mention are also greatly more entertaining characters than the main ones. It's fair to say that the more central a character is to the plot, the worse their writing and voice acting gets, with Mike Thorton (the main character) easily being the worst.The main plot isn't a strong point. It's about secret agents trying to stop an evil CEO from starting a world war. Fortunately, though, it frequently takes a back seat to the secondary plot arcs and doesn't get much more than (jarringly frequent) lipservice throughout most of the game. You'll have to put up with some characters bringing up the main plot every chance they get, but it's mercifully rare for gameplay to be impacted by it.The dialogue itself is of drastically varying quality (see above), but the user interface that directs your character's responses in conversation is an unmitigated disaster. If you've played Fallout 4 you know what to expect - you can push one of four buttons to make your character say something, but it's impossible to know what precisely you're making him say without prior knowledge. You get a vague indication of the tone and topic you're going to be responding with and a very limited time to peruse your options. And some characters will only like you if you mash the B button [(for example) (Xbox360 controller)], while others will hate you if you mash the B button, which is as dumb as it sounds.So who do I recommend this game to? If you thoroughly enjoyed Deus Ex 1, bought a copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and it made you facepalm so hard that it sounded like a gun went off, you'll find Alpha Protocol a much needed relief. If you're looking for a believable spy thriller in an original setting, you'll probably find this game painful to play. If you're the type that played Fallout: New Vegas as an angry, drugged-up whackjob that goes around starting fights with everything that moves (or did so at least once and enjoyed it), and want something that brings that catharsis back now that you've played F:NV to death, you'll be amply able to scratch that itch in Alpha Protocol. If you prefer your stealth games to have high-tension, highly difficult stealth like Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Alpha Protocol will certainly dissapoint you. To me, it's incredibly fun in spite of most of its flaws, and partly because of its other flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha Protocol is a game that I really wanted to like. I tried to look past the flaws that this game had, but I honestly couldn't. The best thing I can say about Alpha Protocol is that it at least tried to be something different, but even if you try to do something different, it doesn't mean that it will always be good.Alpha Protocol has a unique concept, an espionage RPG. I was surprised to see that this sort of idea, hadn't been done that often in gaming and that is one thing that I respect this game for doing. The main problem with this however is that in my opinion, Alpha Protocol doesn't really use any of the unique ideas it brings to the table that well and the basic stuff that are required to make a good game (like gameplay, playability and graphics) aren't really focused on as they put most of their thought, time and care into trying to implement these ideas to try and live up to it's name ""an espionage RPG.""One of the biggest problems Alpha Protocol has is in it's gameplay. Nearly everything in the gameplay falls flat. While the training section at the beginning of the game, does show off some great ideas for an espionage RPG like sneaking mechanics, combat and gadgets, I didn't feel like I was having any fun playing this or doing any of these ideas for gameplay because in the end, that's what I was thinking they were, just some ideas. I felt like these ideas were only half executed. The ideas are there, but they just stopped after that. Sneaking is basically useless because the AI is really bad. Gun combat feels restricted an the sensitivity never feels right no matter what you set it to. Melee combat, while it's better than gun combat, feels slippery for the majority of the time, but at least it was more controllable than the gun Gadgets are basically useless in combat because you can't really tell where they'll land. There's no targeting ridicule for them so you just need to predict where they'll land.Graphics are for the most part good however there are several flaws with them. There is quite a lot of slow loading textures from time to time and the longer I played, the more frequently these occurred. There is also a bit of pop in going on quite a bit. Apart from that there isn't much to say about the graphics. They're decent but they could have gotten more polish before release like the rest of the game.The sound seemed to repeatedly cutting out randomly for some reason throughout my play time as well. However, this didn't affect my overall feeling towards the game in any way and I easily ignored it as it wasn't too big of a deal.In this review, it might come off like I hate Alpha Protocol and even though that's true, there's still some good ideas that are put into Alpha Protocol, which might have been good if they developed these ideas further. The stuff that is common to see and expect in an RPG is present in Alpha Protocol but these things we have seen done a bunch of times are exactly that. Alpha Protocol does nothing to change the styles that are common in RPGs except for the dialogue options, which is one of the best I've seen.Overall, Alpha Protocol is buggy and generic. It barely does anything to stand out from the crowd and when it tries to do this, it usually falls flat. However, it still uses some ideas which I hope to see in RPGs in a future and if the developers of this game were to make a sequel, maybe tweaking the game a bit, I would definitely buy the sequel to see if these ideas are developed more.Pros+ Some good ideas+ Great concept+ Good mechanics+ OK graphicsCons- Underdeveloped ideas- Terrible AI- Restricted/slippery combat- Slow loading texturesFinal verdict: 3/10Steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews ",312,88,2,34,26,3,20

												So I got this game in a Humble Bundle last week and after watching the trailer it looked like a decent game. But after playing through almost half of the campaign I can say that I honestly can't stand the game. The shooting dynamic for this game I feel is really screwy. The story line is kinda genric, but still good though. Might be worth a try but I would not pay the $15 for it, maybe if you could catch it on sale sometime.			",88,6,0,9,10,1,13

												I bought this game expecting a tense spy drama like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy or The Americans. After spending 10 minutes preparing the perfect disguise for my initial mission, the arms dealer's henchmen immediately read me as American and opened fire. So much for spying. Well, perhaps i could at least sneak? Nope. Aside from the janky controls and flaky stealth mechanics, the game repeatedly forces you into frontal assaults anyway. The most appalling part, for me, is when it proudly sums up all your kills at the end of the mission, and awards you perks for them, which really drives home just how messed up the story is. Running around killing (or even ""just"" disabling) hundreds of foreign nationals without any rules of engagement made me feel a lot more like a terrorist than an operative.And it's a shame because there is some good dialog in there. The story is in the vein of Nikita, conspiracy on top of conspiracy, and it is fun to choose alliances and watch the drama unfold. Just fun enough for me to complete the game. But the boss battles, the waves of enemies, the woefully linear levels... At some points in the game you have to make life or death decisions, but i just didn't care because the majority of the game is built around you killing people with no consequence at all. If there had been more dialog, undercover missions, an open world to explore, any opportunity to downshift and become invested in the places i visited, then the poor decisions i made may have had some emotional resonance. Instead i was sent straight on to the next mission with more faceless bad guys and superhuman bosses to kill. Hard to recommend unless you are really craving a spy fix and are willing to put up with a lot of mindless shooting.			",65,94,0,3,2,0,3

												If you picked the Bug (right, bugs) the Airfield mission as your first mission out of three, you WILL think this game sucks:-Enemies sometimes can see you even though you are behind a cover. This happened to me twice in that mission. What's the point of encouraging stealth approach while the gunner can see you through the cover and pull the alarm?-The game has checkpoints while it also allows you to save/load at anytime during a mission. However when I reloaded the checkpoint in the Bug the Airfield mission, all the enemies in the area disappeared. This bug is helpful for me to explore the area, but it completely ruins the fun of the game. However those issues are not that severe in the later missions.Also, sometimes you can't climb ladders or get behind the cover unless you adjust your camera position or simply ""try again"". Such problems are quite devastating if you want to go for a stealth approach.Besides the technical issues, Alpha Protocol is full of dialogues and text if you like narrative elements in a game.I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend, because the bugs are ruining the gameplay experience. If you are curious about the game, feel free to pick it up.			",126,61,3,43,29,0,16

												This might seriously be one of the worst games I've ever played. The controls feel clunky as all mess using K/M and the game itself is just riddled with bugs. I played this for two days, no problem. I start it up today and it will run the launcher, but not actually start the game. I tried like four times! The gamepaly itself is pretty awful, as the stealth mechanics are just broken beyond my comprehension. If a guard is staring right at you without any cover, you will remain unspotted. But hide behind some boxes with tons of cover and crouched, across a room? Guaranteed alarm going off. The other thing that frustrates me about this game is that it forces you to either listen to the entirety of spoken cutscenes or skip everything completely. I can read faster than they talk, why not just let me advance the dialog line-by-line like most other modern RPGs of this type? The graphics are passable, but sometimes it seems like they glitch out. Watching Mike's face during a lot of conversations, his grin overextends to like his ear and it's almost as cringeworthy to behold as the ME: Andromeda facial animations. Final thoughts: I've tried to like this game for a long time and every time I pick it up, it's just not fun and feels dreadful to play. I think I got it on sale for like $1.50, so not a lot of money lost, but still too much for such a turd. Deleting from my collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poor controls. In fact they are garbage. Training level, completely not needed. Feels like it was put in simply to try and explain a bad story that is so cliche it is almost funny. Almost, only because you didn't get the game for free so it isn't really that funny given that you wasted money on it. Getting alcohol and getting drunk would have been a better use of the money and the enjoyment would have lasted longer. It doesn't suck as deep and hard as The Division but it certainly feels like it could have been made by the same group of village idiots. Too cliche, controls suck, random AI issues with NPC, tries to be a jack of all trades without actually being an expert in anything. Uninstalled.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to recommend Alpha Protocol purely on the unqiueness of premise: no other game (that I know of) so effectely attempts to combine stealth and RPG gameplay. I've never enountered anything so close to D&D + 007. At the same time, Alpha Protocol is buggy, poorly-written, and suffers from lackluster combat. The AI is pathetic, and is easily outwitted when it's not doing something completely random or ridiculously stupid. The only positive is the depth to which the game attempts to provoke your interaction and remember your choices, even if those choices don't come out to much in the end.Buy on sale.

												Poor controls. In fact they are garbage. Training level, completely not needed. Feels like it was put in simply to try and explain a bad story that is so cliche it is almost funny. Almost, only because you didn't get the game for free so it isn't really that funny given that you wasted money on it. Getting alcohol and getting drunk would have been a better use of the money and the enjoyment would have lasted longer. It doesn't suck as deep and hard as The Division but it certainly feels like it could have been made by the same group of village idiots. Too cliche, controls suck, random AI issues with NPC, tries to be a jack of all trades without actually being an expert in anything. Uninstalled.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has a very interesting premise, but fails its potential utterly. The gameplay fells clunky, unpolished and generally boring. The interface is not particularly good either. Oh, let's not forget the much praised dialog system. The dialogs themselves are not bad, characters are interesting and the story looks engaging. But the gameplaywise the system is a mess. Firstly, it's even worse than in Mass Effect, not giving you a slightest idea what your character is going to say. Secondly, the awful timer that does not allow to choose your dialog option carefully and thoughtfully. You see, The Walking Dead gave the example how a time limit in choosing a dialog response could be done properly. There you had plenty of time to choose your response for the most part. And in those cases where you had a very short time limit to choose it was done to give a feeling of intensity of a situation. Here, in Alpha Protocol, you always have a very tight time limit regardless of situation, which does not provide for player anything but constant irritation.			",208,33,12,59,27,1,58

												I never quit a game. Even if I don't like it a whole lot, I push through and finish.Alpha Protocol made me give up. On the last dang mission. After level after level of poor design, terrible aiming, weird characters, and glitches galore, I quit. The random difficulty spikes, the average story, and the absolute worst set of hacking mini-games ever created all made this game mostly an unpleasant experience.There were some fun characters (and I got my dude to bang the 3 hot chicks in the story so thats fun) and an occasional fun level or two, but for the most part, this game was absolute bullcrap.There is a boss level in the final level that I finally gave up on because I experienced 3 seperate glitches that made me restart each time. So yea, I am not reccomending this game for you.			",124,10,1,24,1,0,5

												That gunplay is some of the worst I have seen in a game to date. It controls worse than The Last of Us (origonal) Its so frustrating to be spoted so easily and have to resort to using such a crap gunplay system. The mechanic where you have to hold the cursor over the target for 4 or 5 seconds to get a shot on them is downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The dialouge is so dry and boring that I found myself daydreaming while I was talking to someone. It also suffers from the, ""Lets give the player dialouge options but force them to pick in 3 seconds and only give them a vauge one word descriptor of what the player character is going to respond with."" virus. Theres a reputation system with each character and you are told that it doesnt matter if they end up liking or hating you as you get different outcomes and ""there isnt a right way."" This pisses me off however, because you have no idea what the outcomes will be so you might as well just let the dialouge try auto finish. One could argue that you are supposed to roleplay but I would respond with, ""How?"" How the ♥♥♥♥ am i supposed to roleplay when the options for most dialouge trees are ""Professional"", ""Suave"", or ""Angry?"" The game very much feels like a lazy console port. You have to individually equip skills to use them (instead of using the 100 keys on my keyboard) and the menus are frustratingly designed.The computer hacking with mouse and keyboard is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible and I cant figure out how this game was released like that. You have a computer screen full of a word search grid where all the letters are changing. You have 2 codes on the right and left that you have to find in the word search and match up. You controll the left code with wasd and space to confirm and the right with the mouse (moveing left with the mouse will move it left ect.) and left clicking to confirm. I wanted to shoot myself in the♥♥♥♥♥♥trying to use this system.To top it off, I died in the first mission and clicked to reload my last checkpoint and the game crashed. -.-Im told this laid the groundwork for games like mass effect and i just cant see how. I doubt I will be revisiting this game in the future as I have roughly 200 more games untouched in my library and a few of them have to be good.			",271,45,1,57,28,2,30

												This game blends RPG with Action/Stealth elements, and is at its best on the RPG side of things. THe action/stealth parts, unfortunately, are too unpolished and really subpar. From poor AI to guns that are laughably imprecise, stealth that doesn't quite work (many portions force you out of stealth and into combar so stealth is not that useful in the end). This game would have been a lot more enjoyable just sticking with the RPG parts, which Obsidian is good at - or otherwise spend a lot more time polishing the actiony part of the game. There are a lot of good ideas in this game, but in the end I can't quite recommend this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a game that has some good ideas and then the worst execution of those ideas. It gives skills to build your character, but you can't just get around as a stealth character if you want to. You will be forced into multiple combat situations with no stealth option to get out of that. This game reminds me of Deus Ex, except that Deus Ex was awesome and this game fails on every front. Poor AI, poor gameplay, extremely cheesy dialogue. Well, all in all a disappointment.			",139,11,2,4,1,1,7

												In almost every aspect attributable to a videogame, Alpha Protocol fails to impress. The graphics are ugly, the artstyle is generic, the gunplay is tripe and the AI borderline schizophrenic.It is a testament, then, to Obisdian's writing staff that this game is merely mediocre.The game has a solid RPG heritage and this shows, with the RPG elements arguably being the game's only true strength. There are some solid choice and consequences here and the leveling system is basic, but functional (operating on a hybrid of perks and number-based attribute upgrades). The story the game weaves between flashbacks is not in itself ground-breaking nor is it free from a number of tried and tested spy clichés, but the influence the game allows you to have on the story is commendable. There's no TW2-tier decision here, but characters will reflect on how you played a level and this will result in other characters reacting accordingly. For example, playing steathily throughout will mean characters that respect stealthy-operators are more likely to respect you and your methods, perhaps resulting in an allegiance several levels later. These are relatively minor touches, but they permeate the game's writing, with the game itself having a number of different endings depending on who you allied with and how friendly you were with them.The gunplay is heavily influenced by the RPG mechanics of old, with the reticule taking some time to focus on weapons you are not trained for. However, even when your character is maxed out on a weapon's skill, the gunplay fails to feel anything better than floaty and ill-equipped. I ended up playing as a sneaky spy in an effort to avoid the gunplay.Stealth in this game is hampered by the AI. It's laughably stupid in some cases and borderline psychic in others. The game gets around this in later levels by allowing your character to become invisible (with no in-game reasoning as to why) but this quickly becomes over-powered as your pour more points into stealth.To be sure, I found Alpha Protocol a deeply unsatisfying experience, but I found myself constantly wanting to like it as I progressed, there's a distinct lack of good RPGs set in the spy mythos. This is a game that was clearly crafted with a small budget and unlike other budget games (such as DMC1) which inspire a certain cheap charm to them, you can't help but lament the lost potential with Alpha Protocol.

												Take a game with a great dialog system, an interesting story, and no morality system but rather meaningful choices and what do you get?A game I can't recommend.   I'm a little shocked at this game, because on the surface it's everything I should want.  The game has a very innovative gameplay system, where conversations matter, and the game doesn't rely on a basic morality, but rather what you say and what you do. On paper, this is an incredible game, and honestly I'd love to love it I just can't.   The problem with this game is essentially, I've tried to play it three times, and I've failed to get involved.  The first time I didn't give the game a real try, so we can forget about that. The second one I played three levels, and I started the game as a ""Recruit"" putting my points into weapons skill to try to make weapons better.  It didn't so I gave up.  About a week after that I heard if you put the points into stealth the game becomes incredibly easy.  I tried that, and ran into a third problem. The first thing to say is this game's dialog choices are incredible.  It reminds me of Catherine a little in that EVERY thing you do feels important and matters.  The difference from Catherine is instead of a morality system, there's just important dialogs everywhere.The downside of this for the third playthrough is none of these dialogs are that different or skippable.  And there are some long dialogs in this game, and while there's a decision how the player will respond, most of the time, it only gives a ""relationship"" point and continues the same dry dialog with minimal acknowledgement.   Did I want to sit through 4 hours of hearing the same dialog a second time with no way to skip?  I chose no.  But it wasn't only that. The other major problem with this game is the combat.  Dear god, that combat is SO bad.   I realize Obsidian was trying to make the combat weaker so stealth became a viable option but often I feel the player can't even aim a gun and can only get a solid firing reticule by standing around for solid minutes.  It's BAD.   Watch a video and you can see why. I don't understand this design decision because it takes what is actually a really good game, down to the bad game territory.  There's a number of games that have figured this out.  Metal Gear Solid 5 heavily pushes stealth but when you make a mistake you can go in guns blazing and save your life most of the time, or hide again.  But a SINGLE mistake here, and you're either going guns blazing for the rest of the level (poorly) or you're reloading from the last checkpoint which is usually far away. I can't really complain about the combat enough, because it's one of the core gameplay in the game, and it really ruined my love for the game. There's one final issue that people have with this game and I agree with it.  The game is NOT made for PC.  It's a port and I'll accept that most of the time.  I get it.   However in this game, there's three mini games.  A game where you clip and trace paths works great.  A game where you lock pick is quite annoying but still can mostly work, especially if you have a gamepad.     But the game where you hack just seems almost unplayable on the computer, maybe it's always that bad but it's annoying as hell. I gave this game a solid try, three solid tries in my opinion.  And I could never get far.  It's not the worst game in the world, but there's no way I can recommend it as the combat is just painful.Here's the final thought.  Maybe in the future I'll try this game again and get through the entire game and love it.  That's possible, but I won't change my recommendation because NO game should take four attempts to get into.  No game should make loving it this hard.   I might turn around and say ""I love you"" to the game one day soon but that will be an abusive love.  And that's not ok!			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

Sometimes your checkpoints will vanish, or you won't be able to start a level, or your saves will disappear, and stuff like that.If you were looking for anything like a game about being a spy, sneaking around killing in the night, this really is not it. You can pretty much spend your skill points on speed and martial arts, run towards armed enemies and just kick them in the face until they die, no sneaking required.Actually, you find it extremely difficult to do anything except running towards enemies and kick them on the face because it's so ill designed. Being a ""spy"" in these levels require neither cover, silence or strategy but just plain luck. Enemies will just randomly discover you, shot you, kill you, and then the level won't restart anymore because of some random bug.Don't buy this.			",77,22,2,7,8,0,15

												In the hour that I've played this game, I wasn't appealed by it. Alpha Protocol boxes with the greater spy-espionage games by entering itself into the genre with its elements. The potential is there, but I couldn't recommend it because of the fact the gameplay itself is unrefined. The graphics are beautiful, as well as the controls. The story line is your typical run-of-the-mill type which everybody can basically predict. There will be a lot of places where you get stuck if you don't memorize basically the whole layout of the game, which will easily aggrivate even the most seasoned of espionage veterans to a hightened extent. Your movements and timing have to be very intricate, as if you're playing a deep game of chess. Having to reload your checkpoints and redo whole sections of the game over and over again because you missed one tiny detail gets menotonous and dull very quickly.As I previously stated, the game has serious potential, but in my eyes, it's unfinished at best. If you're a hardcore espionage veteran, then I could recommend this game to you. If not, then I'd stay on the tracks of Syphon Filter or games such as. I wouldn't recommend this game for casual players at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was...okay. I'm not sure what happened with this game. The recommended game requirements suggested my computer had what it took to run this with no problem but I jump in and it's choppy, the aiming took hours to adapt to the way the crosshairs jumped around, it's buggy as all hell and at times the dialog could be downright corny as the worse B-movie you've ever seen; plus it is truly the type of game you need a strategy guide open at all times if you want things to go the way you want them to. But it was different, the story was at least half-way interesting and the narrative can change depending on your choices throughout the game. There's a lot to complain about but if there was a part two in the future I would consider it depending on what the reviews say about what has been improved. In summary, buyer beware.

												The best way I can describe Alpha Protocol is for me, to describe what it feels like. It's a concerted and deliberate knockoff of another game. It has very flat and often outrageously immature and ridiculous dialogue. THe gameplay feels like someone really badly wanted an espionage game that played like Bioshock and Half-Life 2. The premise is thin and barely even attempted, let alone executed. Alpha Protocol in summary is one company's attempt to make a knockoff of Deus Ex - which is in many ways a vastly superior game, and on far more than just the grounds of technological development. I found this game crass, needlessly overthought in many cases, and skin-peelingly bad for characters and character development.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Garbage. Another poorly done port. Good luck fighting controls as you work through the turorial. Oh and the minigames suffer from the same issue. Got stuck on the TUTORIAL in a mingame and gave up. Oh and there is no way to skip this and just play the GAME. Adding a skip or easy feature for the hacking mini game would make the geme playable.

												Good, Awesome, Perfect...? NO! It's a crappy ""RPG"" game or they just tell you that, but rly wtf?!-Only RPG element i saw in the game was that you can level up, use ""AP"" which you get by leveling up and then you can buy skills which aren't bad, but they won't help you through the game. You don't need them at all.-Graphics aren't too bad, but there were some graphic busd, like you could see through a wall, or the light of the other room gets trough the wall, and stuff like that.-AI is crappy, once there was a firefight, and an enemy guy was just standing next to me like: -Hey there What'ya Doin'?-There were some good ideas, but why the hell did they made such a bad aiming system?! Even if you target the guy and get a ""RED CRITICAL CROSS THINGY"" mostly you can't hit them, and if the enemy comes like: -""SURPRISE MODAFAKA"" You don1t have a chance to fight back, because if you don't aim, then you won't hit anything, and to shoot the target, you need to fire like 100 bullets with aiming, OR you can wait like 5-10 seconds to target the enemy, and get that ""RED CRITICAL CROSS THINGY"", but you can't because you're dead!-Story is...  BULLSH*T! !!!!SPOILER!!!!  First mission you need to ""get out"" of a base, first you won't get out, Second you kill like a lot of people, and then they say this was normal come you work for us... And F*CK Those guys you killed i don't give a damn...-Friend system? RLY?  If you interact with people you can choose what to say. And even if you say something like F*CK YOU! , they will only be angry with you, but i don't see why this would be bad for me...-QUICK TIME EVENTS!  The only good thing... is when you don't need to do theese. Theese quick time events are hard, and if you miss something, then you loose time and if you fail then you do them again. Theres hacking, lockpicking, and alarm disarming. Lockpicking is easy, alarm disarming isn't too bad, BUT HACKING IS LIKE HELL!So if you want to buy this game, buy it, and then KILL YOURSELF!

												This could have been a killer annual IP. They just screwed up the progression system beyond all belief. You literally have to level yourself up to stop being a spaghetti-armed 4 year-old who can't shoot someone literally 3 feet away from you. It's ridiculous how low this spy's default abilities were. Had this come out AFTER Mass Effect 2, they would have seen how to do this type of game properly and made a ton. As is, I suggest finding some cheats and turning the character up to 11. Then just play it as a spy game in which you are ALREADY James Bond from the word go.			",226,50,4,63,15,3,47

												If the game isn't worth 50% of its price, I won't recommend it at all, and that is the case here.Good:+ Timed dialogue keeps you involved in the story+ The missions are decently varied+ You can go either full lethal or full nonlethal+ Decent variation in character builds+ Decent variation in roleplaying options in dialogueBad:- Levels balanced horribly: some builds completely unviable for certain levels- Checkpoint system with no manual save for no other reason than Halo and consolitis- Checkpoints are way too far apart: hope you can do everything right the first time- Dialogue horribly cheesy- Story utterly banal, Clancyesque, perhaps on the level of Army of Two, about PMCs and the military-industrial complex- Numerous bugs: often after reloading a checkpoint because you died from poor level design, enemies and the opportunity to collect their XP will vanish- Not open world and hardly even a hub; the safehouses just exist as extended inventory screens- Attempts Deus Ex-style gameplay variation but without the numerous routes and proper scaling you would expect- Graphics about as awful as you could expect of Unreal Engine 3- Reputation gain/loss dialogue options sometimes are unpredictable, even after reading dossiers- Weapons absurdly inaccurate for a supposedly trained agent (hearkens back to DX where you basically have to master firearms skills to be using them)- Quite short: even if it were padded out with open world retreading it would still be less than 15 hours long- Ridiculously strong, ""GTA"" bosses with giant health pools that you have to pour hundreds of rounds into, including an emo teen girl- Keyboard + mouse controls completely terrible: hacking next to impossible in this setup (consider gamepad required)- For a game about espionage, stealth is totally naff with enemies that can see in the dark across unlit fields, few avoidance routes and mechanics that are between Zelda 64 and Metal Gear Solid chronologically (1998 or so; of course less detailed than Thief 1)- For a game where stealth is terrible, the shooting mechanics are not very good either. Cover is slightly more useful than in Mass Effect 1, but mainly because you are much more killable. Magnetic cover is sloppy and will leave you exposed, solution: better master a firearm skill, especially for the boss fights which frequently take place in arenas- As is often paraphrased from TS Eliot, ""Good writers borrow, great writers steal."" In this game, the designers borrow rather than steal; the same can be said for the programmers and writers. The game is obviously ""heavily inspired"" by Mass Effect (skill tree configuration, combat style, dialogue wheel, even specific skills) and Army of Two (mission selection, lack of hub, ragdoll-style slapstick combat, comical enemies, PMC-based military-industrial-complex story). These games are the only reason this one exists at all. The engine is licensed and the game progression is sterile and controlled and yet still has bugs. This is par for the course for Obsidian, though: they have made their careers out of making sequels and derivative IPs of ""discount"" quality.I got the game for $2.99. I would rate it at about $5. Until that's its price, I can't recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the idea here, a mass effect style splinter cell game has a TON of potential.  Sadly, for me, it just isn't found here.  Splinter cell Blacklist is about as close as you will get to a solid Espionage RPG.  Even though it's not really an rpg.  It does have Mass Effect esque moments scattared about though.  Anyway, this game has good ideas, but the gameplay is a complete joke.  I literely can not force myself to play any furthor the gameplay is that bad.  I stood in one spot with 4 guys shooting at me and they never touched me for about 20 seconds.  I thought about bumping it up from medium to hard but in the end I just quit and regreted spending $3 bucks on this game, $2 more bucks and I could have bought a six pack of bud-light.

												impressions so far after completing saudi arabia missions: stealh combat is a joke, like the rest of the combat in the game. its got allt he ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Console Shooter trappings, unrealistically inertial aim, mushy movement, FOV more appropraite for increasing sales of headache medicine than playing a third ♥♥♥♥ing person shooter.dialogue/RPG♥♥♥♥♥♥sucks too so far, the dialogue options aren't really as motivated as the hype led me to believe; maybe its just because the shtity story hasnt been developed much yet, but i feel that, basically, not enough background is provided on the main character for me to make informed dialogue choices without Projecting. oh, you mean minimal background was provided on him precisely so the game could just serve as a vehicle for the player's own ego? sorry, i already have real life for taht.$7.50 probably better spent on a single, overpriced, normally $.99 cheeseburger that i then forget about and leave in the bus/train on the way home			",249,42,8,25,23,2,28

												Play through Alpha Protocol twice and it's clear how much the ""branching storyline"" is just smoke and mirrors. Also despite the ability to choose dialogue, the main character always reverts to being an insufferable smirking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't listen to the gaming press that said this game sucked. Don't listen to the people that said this game was a beautifully crafted work of narrative choices and moral decisions.Everybody is wrong. It's just a mediocre Mass Effect knockoff.

												I recently finished this game.I think the game really is not as good as it is being said here. I don't see the whole ""first espionage RPG"" slogan either because it is really just a low budget deus ex (I have played first and second one through).The story is not special: At the end it goes down to save the world cliche. Not gonna spoil anything so you should try yourself and see. I failed to see any interesting twists though, everything was pretty much obvious from get go as the game plays ""in the past"".The production value is rather low. Aside from the things like weak graphics and controls, there are some very annoying stuff too. For example: If you take the ""wrong"" door out of two options, you might advance and the door you took just permanently closes behind you, giving you no chance to explore/finish side objectives.I really would not bother. In this time and age there are so many good, affordable options out there that deserve to be seen more than alpha protocol. By no means is the game ""terrible"" but at the end it will leave a bad taste in my opinion over the time spent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I appreciate time sensitive tasks but this is a kick in the sack. I literally miss half of the dialogue option because I have the audacity to look away from the screen during long voiceovers for more than a fraction of a second. I hope the game doesn't take those choises too seriously because I bet by the end I'm only catching 5% of them.I also take issue with the hacker game, a wide grid of ever changing numbers in which you have to spot two non-changing strings. It's like wordsearch on crack in a bad way.I have reinstalled this game three times and couldn't make it through the tutorial without deciding that I don't care enough about any story they could write to play these mini-games.

												An exercise in frustration!!!  I REALLY wanted to love this game and bought it when it first came out, because I thought the story was intriguing and there were choices in dialog etc.  I love Deus Ex, so when I saw this game I thought yeah this is gonna be a great game with a different story line, different type of character and menu system.  I'm a completionist type player, and if you aren't a completionist then this review won't be any use to you. Let me start with the hacking...  the tutorial at the beginning of the game is useless, and it took me several tries over the years to eventually get past it.  I'd try and then get annoyed then stop playing, then I picked up the game up again and give it another try, and so on.  Use google and read the endless amount of people who hate the hacking as much as I do.  One guy says look for the string that doesn't move, which does work! I can get the right string set, however I can't activate the left string EVER even when I find it because for some stupid reason the  key that the instructions on the bottom to set it doesn't work.  Each string uses a different key to set it the string for left and right.Now after endless reading on what others have tried to make the hacking simpler, with the string hacks and some even say avoid hacking and move on.  Okay I could do that, skip hacking all together.  However if you are a completionist type player who's aim is to earn as much exp as possible to develop the character to the max this is going to be an irritating feeling of leaving things undone!Also if you are a completionist aiming to get the most exp pts per mission/dialog etc the checkpoints are going to be an irritation as well.  For instance if you accidentally chose the wrong thing in dialog and lost a reputation point with someone too bad.  This happened to me during a dialog and my phone rang and well let's just say the game forces you to be chained to your chair and disregard what goes on in real life.  If this doesn't bother you, then no worries.. however I like the feeling of physical freedom.  When the dialog gets screwed up because I am addressing something in real life like answering the phone, it's like I'm being punished.  To me it's a design flaw in the game, and the devs didn't take any consideration to real life when the game is on.  True you could reload a checkpoint, yay you get to do the section all over again.. kinda like punishment. IMO there should not be a checkpoint save systems in this type of game, with dialog choices.I play with a keyboard and mouse and I read on the forums that this game isn't too friendly with them.  Maybe that's my problem with the hacking, who knows?  I know the mouse and keyboard work fine with combat movement, and the combat is kinda ABC 123/no brainer.I bought this game when it first came out over 3 years ago and then tried it again over 3 years later and I am still having issues.  I don't want to give it a thumbs down, but I feel I have to as not to confuse people because of the irritating features of the game.  The story  development I think I would like if I ever was able to play the game long enough to experience it.  However I've got a completionist type mentality, in any game I want to explore every area, I want to hone my choices to get the maximum expierience, if I don't then I feel like I'm missing parts of the game and have failed.  That's just me, I know there are plenty of people who are satisfied with not doing that.  Until I can change who I am, and lower my standards then I'll not be able to play the game to the end so I'm shelving it again.If you don't think these things will bother you that I mentioned, then great.  I do suggest checking the forums on Steam and other sites to get a census of what experiences others had, before you buy.   I think the game would have had great potential as a series, irritating design mechanics aside. I guess there's a reason why there was never a follow up game to it, because maybe the hacking, and mach speed dialog chosing peaved too many people off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't believe the hype. Somehow, this clunky game became a cult classic, despite lacking in atmosphere, characters, a coherent narrative or enjoyable gameplay. The timed dialog response system feels great and the game does a great job at making you feel your choices are meaningful. Sadly they aren't and sadly the game convinces you of this by breaking down something as interesting as interpersonal relationships into +1s and -1s. But nonetheless they feel important and cool when you make them. So I'd really appreciate it if someone could build a game around that mechanic that was interesting in some way and didn't rely on such tired tropes for characters.			",422,106,13,59,47,4,85

												I'm usually a giant fan of Obsidian games, but I just can't play another second of this one.I understand that the game is from 2010, but this is just bad.  Controlling with keyboard and mouse is pretty splotchy at best, and just clunky as hell to try and move your guy around.  But I lost all interest in the hacking portion of the game.10 minutes.  10 minutes I spent working on trying to figure out what the hell was going on with the hacking, and when I finally figured it out, it took another 7 tries to hack the first computer.  Given the nature of the game I figured that this was going to come up later and this is where I stopped.  Hacking, ironically enough, broke this game for me.  I will not play another moment of this game due to the fact that I will probably miss something important later, or get to the point where hacking is dire to continue and I summon an entire battalion to wipe me out due to my inept ability to hack a computer within 6 seconds.  Nope, sorry Obsidian, I'm rating you a negative for the first time ever.			",209,60,2,24,24,1,18

Alpha Protocol fails to impress on any level.Pros:  Sound, StoryCons:  Graphics, Control, Gameplay, BugsFrom the voice acting to the ambient sounds, Alpha Protocol, even in name, sounds good.  The story follows a more realistic route than most other games in the genre, which can be refreshing.However, Alpha Protocol's graphics and animations appear dull and wooden, trailing behind even its 2010 peers.  Control is poor with both the controller and keyboard/mouse, though this is partly because of the biggest flaw: gameplay.  The gameplay is absolutely atrocious in every aspect.  The minigames irritate at first but later become so frustrating that bypass gadgets are a godsend.  The gunplay is poor; our 'elite' agent takes seconds to hit a still, unaware target.  The choices are misrepresented: 'suave' can be cheeky or it can be arrogant jerk, whatever the developer decided at the time.Overall, Alpha Protocol is a mediocre port of a mediocre game.6/10			",174,41,0,29,7,0,9

												The game has a nice potential and reminds a bit Deus Ex Human Revolution (just a bit), but weird controls and lack of quicksave make it a torture to play. And where is pleasure in that.I gave up pretty early, when I had to hack into a terminal by moving two passwords around an array of changing characters - one password is moved with keyboard keys, the other with mouse (!) and then you're supposed to press mouse keys to fix it, but it doesn't fix. It triggered an alarm, and I was brought back to the place with 3 guards that I have to go through again. When there is a hint on the screen, like ""press Z to [...] and X to [...]"" - you can't exit to menu. Escape just doesn't bring the menu, or exit a menu... I just don't understand sometimes, how can a company spend millions on making a game, and not spend 2 hours to check things like that and see how bad it is.			",197,132,5,19,11,2,15

												In the tutorial, your black support character (who oddly enough doesn't speak with a wacky ethnic dialogue nor does he get himself killed 10 minutes into the game, way to drop the ball, Obsidian) tells you that the way you talk to people can change how they view you, and that your CHOICES MATTER. Deus Ex had the same thing but you learned that through playing the game, not having the game tell you what the it offers.I bought this for $2 back in 2011 and left it untouched before finally installing it out of pity. The only thing on my mind was how long I needed to play this game before I got at least $2 worth of enjoyment. My 2011-self wishes he bought a Mountain Dew instead.			",369,77,6,41,18,2,46

The gameplay is kind of wonky, intentionally so however to make it more ""RPG"" ish.  The real good thing about the game though is the nuance in the way the story can turn out, while it basically always ends in prettymuch the same way the amount of effect you have on it playing out is pretty nice.

												Alpha Protocol is a flawed game - It has a lot of balancing problems for a mixed play style and only a few of the weapons are actually effective.The story is generic at best and the choices have little effect on the actual narative of the story - Just love interest and ""handler"" character availablilty.

												Alpha Protocol made me think – what does a shoddy game have to do to get a free pass despite all of its flaws? Even the worst of the bunch sometimes have redeemable qualities, right?Well, Alpha Protocol definitely has a cool premise going for it. It's inspired by futuristic superspy flicks, and if only it had slightly more personality and charm, I might say it's worth overlooking boring gameplay, throwaway RPG mechanics, linear level design and other issues that plague the game. But Alpha Protocol has no charm. Everything about it is plain, bland, lifeless and uninteresting. The writing is only ""okay"". The story is merely ""passable"". Same with voice acting. It's the definition of mediocrity, like a James Bond movie reenacted in a school theatre play (come to think of it, that might actually be a fun thing to watch).I've played quite a few bad games that were enjoyable regardless, as I'm sure many people have. Deadly Premonition, for example, got away with terrible design largely because of its wild story and superb atmosphere. Games like Oblivion got away with questionable gameplay mechanics because of their deep and intricate world building. This game has none of those qualities. It starts with a promising setup and never does anything meaningful with it. As you can see, I've only played it for 5 hours. Despite the fact that it's not even a double digit, I still consider it a long time and would happily get those hours back if it was possible. But it's not. So don't repeat my mistake. Play the old Deus Ex instead. Or Splinter Cell. Anything, but not this.Oh, and whoever designed that hacking minigame deserves to have a stroboscope taped to their eyes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good game that is heavily hampered by one crappy element, hacking secure consoles. It uses a combination of mouse and keyboard and is confusing, provides insufficent time to do.I think I only did it twice or three times after about 5 or 6 missions and being able to so this is a major part of the game. You can get around it using emp devices but this has drawbacks. When I checked on the net many people have a problem with this. Just wrecks the game for me.If it wasn't for this prolly would have continued playing till end.If it's on sale for $10 or less worth a gamble otherwise no			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No, no, no, no, no. This game is so badly designed, where do I even begin. By far the worst feature is a sort of ""soft difficulty level"" that they impose that seems to be based solely on your level. The effect of this is that you can never actually get good at any of the puzzles in the game - because as you invest in your character, the puzzles get harder at a much faster rate. Particularly if you are playing the game with a gamepad (which this style of game is well suited to, normally), at level 14 or so you will simply not physically be able to solve some of the puzzles in time.This wouldn't be a deal-breaker by itself, but combined with how much of the game's content (in the form of intel) is behind these puzzles, and how many of them in a row you have to pass before your next checkpoint, the game eventually becomes a nightmare for anyone who actually wants to experience the content.Also, there is way too much mandatory combat for a game that let's you invest almost exclusively in stealth.Also, the writing is like a male adolescent sex fantasy.There are some interesting bits - the intel system and the dialog system have potential, but they are utterly wasted in a game that becomes unplayable the more you play it in a certain play style.

												This game is a piece of crap!... I bought it because a lot of people compared it to Deus Ex: HR, which is one of my favorite games of all time, but it is nothing like that game.  The game really looks like it would be good via video clips and with all the big talk and hype, that is IF you can maneuver ""the clunky hacking system!!!""  Even in the tutorial it's unclear what you are supposed to do.  I tried to hack via Xbox controller and even mouse and keyboard, watched several Youtube videos, and even the braggarts can't show you how it's done properly.  The game is also supposed to be all about stealth?!  Funny, because you can't even get through the first level (auto-save) without being caught up in an all out crossfire.  I mean, this game is a complete waste of money, even if it's on sale, so don't waste your time or money...  Remember, you were warned here!!!			",68,15,0,9,1,0,4

												Well to be honest there isnt anything special here. The graphics, story, mechanics & every other aspect besides the skill tree is barely at moderate standards. A big point about this game is suppose to be the RPG element. Which with most games that means you have a decent amount of decisions to determine what type of roll you want to play. For example: stealthy or all out assualt mode. However this game forces you to either pick a door, safe or lock every other minute or 2, forcing a more stealthy character dynamic then I would prefer. And if you dont take the time to pick, crack or unlock. You literally can't finish the game. And its the same puzzles just over and over again. Not sure how this game has received so many positive reviews. I would recommend spending your money on a game thats more unique and less cookie cutter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game sucks. The controls are unresponsive, the gameplay is boring, the story and dialogue are poorly written, and there's no fun factor. It's just slogs of linear gameplay which make the player go ""oh great, this again,"" making the game more of a chore to play than entertaining. I think the worst part is that when I tried to refund this they immediately closed my ticket without ever telling me, refusing to give me back my money for this atrocity. I could've bought a hamburger with the money I used to buy this game and not only have money left over, but I would have had a more enjoyable experience than playing this bargain bin game. So instead of getting a refund, I decided to warn people against buying it; chances are you won't enjoy this game when you play it, so I cannot recommend it.			",327,55,3,18,18,2,14

												There is a lot of RPG out there but this one is quite different.Right now it is the only one Espionage RPG in the world.Critics from all over the world weren't impressed by this game and gave it mixed rating.But I really enjoyed this game. The whole concept of several secret agencies and how they fight with each other is unique and, more importantly, very interesting.The game has several distinct traits which differ her from other RPG:1.	During the game you will have a chance to meet many different people who can become your curator. Curators in this game do not participate in the missions but they help you providing information and bonuses. The better your relationship with your curator the larger bonuses you get. You can affect your relationships with curators during the missions.2.	Before a mission you have a chance to buy some useful information about the mission or even affect it somehow (for example, you can hire a person to drop a sniper rifle on the roof or poison a boss, which will make him weaker)3.	The conversations in the game often time-limited. The game doesn’t give your time to think carefully about your answers because, you know, when you are being interrogated you don’t have a chance to think about possible outcomes of your answer.The game has some flaws but I loved it, I loved the setting, the RPG system, the characters and the story.I recommend it to anyone who likes RPG.

It is a fun game with good custom weapons and it is really fun to build up relationships with other characters. It really feels like you have control over where the game is going.

												Recommended, but with some caveat.If you have liked games from the Assassin's Creed, Batman-Arkham, or the Mass Effect series, chances are high you will like this infiltration/action/social interaction game (important: this is not a pure FPS game).That being said, this game would be second choice. I don't regret buying it, but I will very likely get tired of it before finishing it.On the pros side:The developers went out of their way to make the player feels that his choices have repercussions, be it from a tactical standpoint (rushing in all guns blazing is rarely a good choice, at least for my style of play, except when this is the better choice) or during the dialogues with other NPCs. More importantly, there is no real ""good"" choice. They have all potentially good or bad consequences, and you will have to live with them.The skill point system is somewhat unforgiving: in order to succeed at something, from hacking a computer to simply shooting a gun, the more points you have in the related skill, the better. So you have better to specialize. Except that sometimes, the needed action is not the action you specialized into. So you will have to reach a balance between specialization and versatility, with the few skill points you get awarded when your character level-up. This makes the game harder, but it helps with the immersion.There is a system of perks given as a reward for doing the same thing correctly many times (e.g. 20 hackings), or for having tried different things (e.g. answered someone in all 3 styles), or for having created a good relationship with your mission handler (or a bad relationship - it works, too). Each perk is either a one-time reward (100 XP, 1 skill point), or a permanent small benefit (5% discount on the black market), and even if each perk is a minor reward, by their quick accumulation it's making the game more enjoyable. It feels very rewarding, because the game is basically telling you, you are doing something right.This is a game where it is theoritically possible to do a ""pacifist run"", albeit that could be a wee bit challenging at time. The game is compiling two helpful values to judge your agressiveness: hospital bills (for non-lethal neutralisations) and number of orphans (yep, for hard kills). Feel free to maximize whichever value you prefer. Choices and consequences, as I said.There is a definite gritty aspect in the atmosphere of the game. You are playing an operativegood at manipulating others (the ""manipulating"" is right there in your dossier, said your boss) in a ""the end justifies the means"" shadow agency, and your allies are certainly no angels (from coldly practical to downright sadists). For many players who are looking for a ""realistic"" spy/infiltration game, this has a strong appeal.Which brings me to the cons side.The occasional sadistic choices will sometimes leave me with a very bad feeling; if you prefer to play goodie characters, this game may not be for you.An extreme example is when you catch an arm dealer in the first chapter. You can either kill him on the spot, arrest him, or let him bribe you and escape. With the first two, you lose access to some weapons and mods on the black market until the next chapter (and apparently, the baddies as well, so it's not that bad). If you let him go, you get a discount on the local black market, but the baddies are better equiped and the TV news will hammer you with the body count of a terrorist attack on a local US army base. But, eh, choices and consequences, deal with it. So far, so good.That got under my skin in this instance is that happened when I decided to arrest him (in a first game, I let him go). My choice decreased the local terrorist activities, my operative got congratulations from his handlers and I got a ""Due process"" perk as a reward. And then the game told me repeatedly, in no uncertain terms, that the poor sod I arrested was headed for the torture chamber. And this godamnit operative I have been guiding for a few hours to sneak in and minimize casualties was totally unapolegetic about it. Quite cheerful about it, he was, actually. It thrashed my good feelings over an otherwise successful mission. And talk about ""due process"". The expression ""bitter ashes of victory"" comes to mind.Storywise, it is a good reminder of the context and the ""game"" being played. As I said, gritty atmosphere and hard choices, the spy business is no job for the meek. One damning point is that, still storywise, this bout of torture is totally un-necessary: you get the info you need and around $15,000 in cash with whichever choice you made. If making the player aware of all of the amoral/immoral subtext in the spy business was the objective of the developers, I should commend them on this. Gamewise, my point is that this sort of situation may result in divorcing you from your character. If you want to play a somewhat moral character trying to do a clean job, forget it. It's a messy job about to get messier, and he is a jerk in a world of jerks.Another big default of this game is the aphazard mouse control. Regularly, when combat starts, I found myself aiming at the sky or the opposite direction because the mouse overreacted to my frantic attempts at aiming. Similarly, during hacking minigames, the code I'm busy slotting in a precise spot will go sideway when I click it home, often trigering the alarm. Conversely, in the lockpicking minigame, I will spend a good 10 s (out of the 15-20 alloted) pushing the mouse up again and again until the first part of the lock deigns to move up in the right position.Part of these controlling issues may actually be a designed part of the game, as my mouse control gets better as I pour more skill points in the relevant skill (see the skill point section above); and in this case having no point in a skill is harshly punitive indeed. And part of these issues may just be me being me, a player of average skill and motor control. Still, I feel that the mouse sensitivity could have been better adjusted between the different parts of the game.My difficulties at controlling the mouse during gunfight is actually one big reason why I prefer the silent, close-combat approach.

												I'd reccommend buying this game only if it's on sale because it's just not worth a full price purchase.With that being said, it's a decent game with a likeable dialogue system and a humorously engaging stealth gameplay. Unfortunately, it feels unfinished most of the time and it's way too short.Buy it if you like feeling like a spy with the ability to go invisible and use bullet time while occasionally talking to some people. Multiple endings too.			",22,1,0,3,4,0,6

												It took me some time to like this game since the animation was so clunky and dialogue was ridged as a porn shoot.This game is clearly a console port, but since it was a RPG where choices matter I kept playing and I’ll say once you get a hang of it then it’s a cool game. The customization from character and loadout is nice so I was always eager to tinker with the weapon attachments making them specialized for a specific mission.The dialogue system was interesting and different from any RPG game I’ve played. In Alpha Protocol all your responses are done in “real-time”. This means when NPC’s are done talking you’re meant to spontaneously respond to their statement. It confused me in the beginning, but since it forces you to select a response within 10 seconds you’ll have to go with your gut reaction making the communication between NPC’s more realistic.When you need to hack a computer you’re meant use the mouse and keyboard to drag some numbers over each other, it’s difficult to explain – but my point is that in this case the developers couldn’t be bothered to port this properly for the PC. When you’re hacking with the mouse it’s the clumsiest user experience you’ve experienced. I was close to uninstall it at that point, but gave it a chance!I still recommend this game!Peace.

												I first heard about this game from a list that was titled, ""Best games you've (probably) never played"". So naturally, I came into this game with mixed expectations. That said Alpha protocol has pleasantly surprised me. This is a stealth infiltration game. It's not a shooter, it's not even a traditional rpg per se. If you come expecting a shooter with great shooting mechanics or a deep RPG you will be dissapointed. On the other hand if you want a game that lets you play out your fantasies of being a modern day ninja, with a branching ""choose your own adventure"" style story. This game is right up your alley. It's core gameplay revolves around stealth, with minigames that involve keypad splicing, cracking safes, hacking pc terminals for various secret agenty reasons (gain intel, shut off surveillance cameras etc). It honestly reminds me of an American version of Metal Gear Solid with RPG lite elements that was never born. I liked it so much that I played it twice, back to back (I wanted to see how the story branches).If you've played everything else and are looking for something a little different. I highly recommend this gem.Edit: One thing I forgot. No support for 21:9 ultra widescreen monitors. At that resolution the UI is cut off on the top and bottom. After I changed my desktop resolution to a 16:9 ratio (1920x1080) it worked fine. That's the only bug/problem I encountered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is considerably underrated considering the lack of press coverage it received. While it's probably been compared to Deus Ex: Human Revolution far too much, it's an apt comparison - it's not quite at the same production value as Deus Ex, but if you enjoy Deus Ex, chances are pretty good you'll enjoy this. The stealth works reasonably well, and the game is much more forgiving if you do choose to shoot everyone in sight. Your time in Alpha Protocol is spent almost entirely on taking out enemies and navigating the level, with little to no data collection required. A decent 5-7 hours gameplay if you choose to stealth it, though you could probably blast your way through a lot faster, in a more generic shooter playthrough.			",524,203,30,91,63,5,136

												Alpha Protocol was an amazing surprise. You’d expect a game that got savaged by most reviewers to be bad, or at least only average. But Alpha Protocol is an amazing RPG, and a passable third-person shooter.The Good:This is one of the few RPGs that offers actual choices, instead of illusionary choices that have no effect on the rest of the game. Every choice you make could come back to haunt you or benefit you. And most of those choices are shades of grey. The game won’t directly tell you whether your choice was good or bad, you’re left to judge that for yourself. On that note, the sheer amount of characters that can be killed in the course of the game is staggering. If there’s a major character, odds are that there’s some event that could result in their deaths.  This is a game where you can’t save everyone. You can’t pull a Mass Effect 2 and have everyone walk away from the suicide mission. You have to make hard choices, and those choices will get people killed.What makes that more interesting is that the characters you have to make decisions on are, with few exceptions, very well-developed characters. Everyone has their own personalities and agendas, and it’s up to you to decide how you interact with them.  You can ally with almost anyone – or stand against them. The main limits are your relationships with the characters, the intel you have on them, and your own creativity. But there is literally nothing stopping you from doing things that other games wouldn’t even think about letting you try.The Bad:In typical Obsidian fashion, the game suffers from bugs. Reloading checkpoints, in particular, can cause some strange behavior with enemy spawns. They may behave normally, reposition, or even vanish entirely. Very, very rarely, a reload of a checkpoint can cause a black screen that forces you to quit.While most of the minigames are well-designed and even enjoyable, the hacking minigame appears to have been designed by a sadist. Hacking the wall panel in the tutorial may be the most difficult part of the game for some people. However, it’s not that difficult once you get used to the initially confusing controls. The game also allows you to ignore hacking entirely with a single-point investment in the Sabotage skill and a supply of EMP bombs.The shooting, while more than passable for a third-person shooter, could have benefited from a bit more work. Some weapons (such as the pistol and SMG) are much better choices, while others (the shotgun and the assault rifle) are not. That’s not to say you can’t succeed with any weapon – you can – but some are clearly better choices. Additionally, the controls for mounted weapons like the sniper rifle and the heavy machine gun have an absurdly high degree of sensitivity. However, all of these are minor issues that shouldn't stop you from buying a criminally underrated RPG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that slides right under the radar of most gamers' detection sensors.  When this game came out it was sandwiched right in the middle of the year and surrounded by other big name titles that stole any attention this title would have received.It's has me thinking that this was sort of a bridge between the KOTOR games and the Mass Effect franchise.  Mixing RPG elements with combat.The game is far from being perfect.  The combat system could use some refinements, but there's a very entertaining package hidden down below, if you can look past the outdated graphics.There's a pretty decent espionage story and the dialogue / decision trees end up with some meaningful consequences that can affect later gameplay.If you enjoy the KOTOR / Mass Effect / Bioware / Obsidian style story telling and interactions and enjoy the spy genres like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear, then this should be on your list of games to play.

												""This is the best spy movie I have ever played.""The world is incredibly fluid, and changes and reacts to your choice in a way no other game I've ever played has. The shooting is definitely clunky, but It's much more of an RPG than a third-person shooter, regardless of how it looks. The conversations have a timer for you to pick a response, which sounds like a complaint; It's not. This gives all dialog a very organic feel, much more like a real conversation. The reaction to your dialog is also very realistic, with characters even reacting if, say, you choose a suave dialog option followed by an aggressive one. They note the mood whiplash. Pretty much everything flows together and NPCs even seem to remember how you acted in your previous conversations.The missions themselves are very well done, and although the combat is sometimes hampered by clunky controls, they are very open, with many different approaches and solutions to most things, complimenting multiple playthroughs well.

From the wonky gameplay mechanics to the poor A.I., Alpha Protocol had an image of a rushed game. Though these problems do arise there is one thing that I have to admit, this game possessed some of the best interactive dialogs I have ever played.Truth be told I had alot of fun with this one. Yes, this is no shooter. The controls are slow and melee combat is awkward, but even with these faults I found my self becoming a slave to this game. The dialog and story, though cookie cutter in the 'spy genre', were amazing! I felt that every choice mattered, each momment I chose to pursue acctually changed the course of the game and how other characters viewed the protaganist. In the end I got to experience the satisfaction of ending the life of a character I truelly despised, such chills ran down my spine.It may be a pipe dream, but I do hope that one day an AP2 will come out.

												Has some glaring flaws but are made up for with interesting conversations and multiple paths in the game with consequences depending on what choices you make.   Overall was it good? Eh. It wasn't bad and it wasn't a good game. Worth a play if you enjoy Mass Effect style games in a somewhat modern era timeframe.			",416,119,2,117,46,3,118

Everything feels hollow, like there is just no substance. I know that is abstract as ♥♥♥♥, but it's the only way to explain it.

												This game is buggy, the animations are mediocre, the combat can be repetitive, and the AI can be quite dumb at times. That said, Alpha Protocol comes extremely close to being an almost perfect game, and this is carried in large part due to it's incredible branching storyline. I find that too many games these days give a false sense of choice, and their impacts to the narrative. In this game, your choices matter, you have very little time to make these choices, and every choice you make impacts the story greatly. It's a shame we may never see a sequel to this game. Overall, I would give Alpha Protocol a solid 8/10, and that's with all of it's baggage.			",222,25,3,51,17,0,18

This is definitely worthwhile at $5.			",203,52,0,46,32,2,34

												Possibly the greatest single character RPG of all time if not the best RPG, especially among the modern real time action breed. Nothing handles character choice & consequence better and nothing comes close to handling stealth better.I include New Vegas, Deus Ex and V:TM - Bloodlines in that comparison, which amount for most of the competition. So if you're a fan of any of those games you might like Alpha Protocol. It definitely has ""cult classic"" written all over it and like Deus Ex it's way ahead of its time (or just too retro for its own good, depending on how you view the industry) with the way it integrates story with choice.The developers got slammed back when it released for their track record of buggy games, but there really isn't anything here worth complaining about if you're used to playing and appreciating western games that aren't published by Activision, EA and 2k games. A lot of the criticism was ignorant and misplaced blame on stealth and combat systems that reward investing skill points over raw player skill.			",158,11,1,27,3,0,15

												Alpha Protocol is a unique and very fun game. It's caught a lot of flak for the bugs that so often plague Obsidian products, but almost all of those have been patched out at this point; the experience has improved a lot. The game has a modern setting, so you get to play with all kinds of familiar looking but renamed guns, and a wide variety of armors, gadgets, and weapon and armor modifications. The skill tree works like Mass Effect 1, which the game resembles in the other ways you'd want it to as well. The combat is smoothly controlled third person with cover, the dialogue choices are made from a circular menu with option positions reflecting the conversational tactic, and the story is branching with many ways to change the outcome and the events on the way there. The maps are often more vertical than ME, though, and even the brown ones look beautiful. The game can get pretty easy if you ignore the stealthy achievements and just gun everything down, but has challenge if you want it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half of the guns are useless and if you don't put any points into hacking you might actually get stuck because of the time limits later on. The controls in the minigames are abysmal and you need to be a contortionist to advance to cover in front of you using the keyboard. About two thirds of the (back)story takes place in non-voiced emails and other documents and the visual customization options for your character can be considered a joke at best.On a side note it's also really really good.

												I usually am willing to sit down and fight through the bad parts of certain games. I didn't need to spend much time to realize that this was a bad game all around. It has unique and cool ideas, yet is still broken after around 2-3 years of it being released. It's playable but it's not enjoyable. This game is just not worth playing on a PC at all. This game is just crap. I'm glad i only paid a dollar for it when i got it from humble bundle but still. It's not even worth a dollar. I strongly dislike this game.			",275,99,8,24,25,5,17

												This was a real buried gem of a game. I grabbed it during a sale for less than $5 on the thin promise of ""Mass Effect with Super-Spies,"" and that turned out to be more or less exactly what was delivered. For all the negative press this game received, I found few flaws worth spiting the game for, and after two playthroughs I'm only disappointed I didn't find Alpha Protocol earlier.AP is a great find for people who enjoy RPGs with an emphasis on 3rd person action - not the other way around. The combat is fairly simple with a few nice twists, though certain combat styles are a touch overpowered while others feel heavily handicapped. If you're a gamer who looks for deep, challenging 3rd person combat, this isn't really what you're looking for. But it does offer rewards for people who are heavily into role-playing characters and only enjoy the action as a means to that end. Once I got a few of my combat skills ranked up enough, I started to feel like a serious Bond-level super-agent, which is exactly how I wanted to feel while playing.What Alpha Protocol brings to the table is a solid narrative with a few twists, a rich cast of interesting characters to inetract with, and a series of complicated moral quandries to navigate. The way you shape your character and his reactions makes a real difference in how the game feels - even if the levels you fight through are the same either way. Characters react to you differently depending on how you treat them (and others). I played through twice; once as a suave rookie agent in over his head, the next as a hard♥♥♥♥♥veteran willing to go to any lengths to get results. Each character felt unique, and my interactions with the NPCs felt different each time. My favorite parts of a great RPG are being able to shape a character, being surrounded by NPCs I care about or are interested in, and taking part in a story that grips me - or at least holds my interest while delivering enough surprises to keep me guessing. Alpha Protocol delivered that experience, along with a combat system that was fun and streamlined and made me feel like I was playing the kind of big screen super-spy I was hoping to create. So long as you go in without high expectations, but willing to overlook previous reviewers' complaints and have a fun time, I think you will. It was well worth it for me.			",26,9,0,12,2,0,9

												This is probably the most inconsistent game I have ever played. It has its highlight moments where it's fantastic, but then it dumps total garbage moments on your lap and says 'deal with it'. I haven't finished the game yet (because I struggle - with what? you'll find out later) but so far the story is really tight. Global balance is at stake and it's your job to try and save the world from the imminent confilict. Alpha Protocol features a great Mass Effect-like dialogue wheel with limited time to response. This system forces you to make quick and usually hard decisions on the spot, which in turn makes converstations exciting and believable. There is also a system of reactions - the dialogue choices directly affect relationships with other characters - each individual is unique and responds vastly different to your actions. The relationships are meaningful and very useful where you are in the field - they have a genuine impact on the mission. In between missions you are in your hideout, where you can buy/sell equipments, trade valuable and sensitive intel (for instant embarassing information found during one of the missions concerning high ranking political figure - you can blackmail, sell to the highest bidder or hand over to the press), buy intel and help on your current mission and so forth. All of the above, this is where Alpha Protocol truly shines. Building your conntact networks, manipulating data, trying to find out as much as you can, talking with your partners - it all has its consequences and effects.Now for the bad part. The controls in this game are probably the poorest I have ever experienced. They are just a pain. Anyone who knows stealth games knows this - the controls have to be tight. In Alpha Protocol they are not. They are simply broken. That's why I strugle in this game. Unfortunately, it came to a point where I pretty much know how this game works and I sometimes have to exploit the game's wonkiness to advance. The AI acts weird. You can approach guard who is pretty much facing you and deliver a swift strike. Other times, the same guard would miraculously spot you and raise an alarm. But you know what the worst part of it is? The animations. To say the guards walk awkwardly is an understatment. They patrol areas and when they turn they occasionally pull off some unbelievable herky-jerky 360 move and spot you sneaking behind them. It's extremely frustrating. The level design is sometimes good, sometimes rather bad. In some areas (probably in general) the game favors certain paths of development (RPG-like skill points and abilities are here) and now I'm in a point where I have to use my martial arts skills, but I have none. Especially at the end of 'chapters' the game pits you against 'bosses' so to speak, and you have to engage them in an all-out gunfight. I was disappointed at this juncture, because it throws the whole 'stealth game' thing into a dumpster and becomes an unrefined shooter. Sadly, all of the negatives break the immersion and erase the joy of playing.This is a game with a great, albeit wasted potential. I'd really like to recommend it, because of a lot of superb ideas, but I cannot do this - Alpho Protocol will bring you more frustration than amusement and that's a shame. The thin stealth games market could have had a gem under its belt. TL;DR.If you are a diehard stealth-espionage fan, buy this, but be warned - Alpha Protocol is badly executed.

												Simply...uhm no...complex...awesome. Combining FPS with RPG and some deductive reasoning you take the role of a secret agent.I've seen more games like this, but what makes this my favourite is how you have to gather intel yourself before you go on a mission (corruption at the higher levels of your organization basically turns you into a fugitive), buy your hardware on the black market and apply your strategy.Sounds easy, but it really isn't, since you WILL encounter missions where you need to infiltrate allied organizations. They don't like that for obvious reasons, so all you can really do is make sure you kill nobody.I use a lot of tranquilizers for that but I can imagine a more experienced player can just sneak around unnoticed.Good music, great and DEEP storyline that makes the Bourne movies fade into nothing and a lot of flexibility in your approach. Too bad its built on the Unreal 3 engine...but I guess on Steam most FPS are either Source or Unreal 3.... ",333,99,6,45,106,2,55

												Alpha Protocol is the best spy RPG I've ever played (not that there are a ton of those games out there).The shooting is pretty good, and melee is a viable option unlike a lot of other shooter games. Stealth is a more challenging option, although the shooting is more fun.The game really shines with the dialog system, similar to Mass Effect but on a timer. The whole setup really makes you feel like you're actually Michael Thorton, actually talking to real people and making decisions based on how you interact with them. I'd go so far as to say it's the best dialog system I've ever seen in any game, let alone an action game.The visual character customization is ok. I like to stylize Mike for each type of mission I do. So when I go to Russia I look like a euotrash hipster. When I go to Saudi Arabia I look like a wealthy warlord prince, etc. Not a lot of action games give you that option.Probably the only negative thing I would say about it is that the mini-games (hacking, picking locks) get repetitive after a while, but still adds to the tension of the game, trying to hack into a computer and if you mess up, an alarm will sound.The closest game I can compare it to would be XIII. Playing with a gamepad is recommended.			",403,28,5,44,8,4,43

The dialouges worked well and i like the gameplay as well, allowing you to choose between sneaking and fighting makes the game more fun. The boss fights are sometimes a little problematic (as in you can pretty much camp somewhere and shoot him till he drops without any fight.

												Alpha Protocol is a hard game to recommend: it carries many of the hallmarks of a really good game but is ultimately let down by a series of hugely frustrating bugs and gameplay decisions.Alpha Protocol featuring detailed skills progression, branching dialogue, and choices during the progression of the story that ultimately shape the outcome to your style of play. All great stuff, but the barrier to enjoying all that is running the gauntlet of psychic enemy AI, baffling checkpoint placement, and wonky keyboard and mouse controls (especially during the hacking minigame).By far the most annoying of these issues is the AI. Various enemies randomly vanish between loads, characters will spot you from across the map and immediately raise the alarm, patrol points will be arranged in a way that makes it almost impossible to ghost your way through most areas, and guard behaviour is often wildly inconsistent: you'll shoot a guard in the head and everyone will suddenly be alerted; reload and do the exact same thing and suddenly nobody notices. Even cover hides you from view one minute and makes you visible to every enemy in the room the next.It's a real shame: if the AI issues alone were fixed this game would be an instant recommendation. As it stands, it's only worth getting if it's cheap and you love Obsidian.			",563,178,8,96,41,1,77

												If James Bond kept a harem, you would get Alpha Protocol, a brilliantly designed game with a few small flaws, which are easily overlooked by the very well written dynamic dialog. This game was just a really good feel for me, it has great stealth elements and I have to say that Sis was a brilliantly written character expecially for a mute. Just remember there is a special bonus for ninja'n a level (aka no kills, no dectections) and the game takes on a whole new level of difficulty. ~9/10~			",427,173,6,141,73,3,146

												Hidden behind the short-sighted masses and their quest to try and promote ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games instead of enjoyable ones, this game was a surprise to me.I loved the many many kills I racked up as I rampaged across the world as some super spy dude who gets betrayed by his agency, who also was killed because they failed to see that I'm a total badass.You can use different approaches, but I prefer heavy armor and assault rifles.Also, dibs on the mute chick.

												Honestly, I was ready to give up just a couple hours into this game: the camera was constantly zooming in and out when I walked by nearby objects (which is the entire time), the controls felt off no matter how I set the sensitivity, and the stealth mechanics seemed inconsistent.It's a shame that this game makes a terrible first impression, cause the first 2 problems can be fixed off the bat (look in community guides for the 'Camera Jerking Fix') with a little text file editing. The dev team should have done that for us PC users anyway. With those initial nags out of the way, I could focus on the gameplay better and got a grip on the stealth mechanics after a couple missions.Don't expect a really tight action game (this is an action RPG after all), but DO expect the action to be fun on its own terms. I beat the game twice; taking a stealth route the first time, then a guns-blazing route the second time. Both approaches worked well and were almost equally satisfying. Generally, the levels were easier playing as a stealthy character, but the boss fights were much easier as a walking tank character. I haven't even touched on the story which is the meat and potatoes of this game: it is AWESOME. You have a limited time to answer to other characters in a 'suave', 'aggressive', or 'professional' manner. As far as I know, this game originated the type of dialogue system also found in The Walking Dead. Your timed responses actively shape the story and you must deal with the (sometimes serious) consequences. Occasionally you don't get enough time to think things through but it's usually timed in such a way to make the conversations flow naturally. I won't ruin anything, but will mention that I immediately started a new game after the first go-around to try and uncover more of the story. Can't think of the last game I was that eager to play though again.Overall it has rough but enjoyable gameplay, and a great story with high replay value. 8/10  ",289,65,5,19,27,3,37

												This game reminds me a lot of the Mission: Impossible series. (Oddly enough, the Ghost Protocol movie came out AFTER this game, and has a very similar story line... hmm...)I find this game to be very underrated. The gameplay is 8/10 for jerky camera movements, but has a great combat system. Stealth actually plays a key role in this game, and dialogue options actually require both quick thinking, and strategy. With multiple endings, and NPC partner possibilities, this game definitely has replay value. I myself have played it through a few times. Overall, I recommend it to fans of mass effect, splinter cell, etc.			",193,27,0,35,2,0,36

												Alpha Protocol is an espionage RPG that does a few things pretty well.  The conversation mechanic is pretty good for a  port, and the story was interesting enough to keep me interested through my first playthrough.  Its biggest strength is how flexible the game is regarding your choices and style.  There are consequences to certain choices, to be sure, but none that should make you throw up your hands and reload due to missed content.  The combat and stealth are serviceable--nothing great if you're used to smooth stealth games like the original Splinter Cell trilogy.  I definitely recommend playing with a 360 controller over K+M.The glaring problem with this console-to-PC port is the HORRENDOUS loading bugs.  They are well-established across multiple operating systems.  If you die, you can either choose ""Reload Last Save"" with a high liklihood of game-killing bugs or manually choose a save with an approximately 70% chance that you will get a black screen that you must Alt-Tab and close.  This alone leads me to recommend that you get in on a compatible console if you own one or only buy it when deeply discounted.			",116,23,2,16,7,2,21

												EDIT: After chatting with some of you I gave this game another chance and managed to finish it... I still think the combat is bad bad bad but the story more than made up for it. Thanks for pushing me to finish it, it was worth it. I now recommend this game =)Story - Good, terrorist missions with multiple paths to choose. I was excited to play the game based on the initial missionsGraphics - Decent. Some of the animations are clunky but I feel that they met the narrative so it all worked. Lots of times enemies will herp derp when you're shooting, they'll fall to the ground and the animation gets weirdCombat - Bad. What works for you once will somehow fail the next time. I don't like having aim mixed with in game experience. Why have the crosshairs? Why not just have me click a random button and hope the shot connects? Boss encounters are maddening. I think my friend mentioned it took him over 15 times to beat one encounter, only to have the same happen in the next encounter. Those 15 tries hardly involve skill since you can get shot while ducking behind objects and your carefully aimed shots miss. Maybe it's better with a console controller/difficulty?- who knows. There are strange AI glitches all the time as well.If it had a sequel that fixed the technical issues and jerky combat, it would be huge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Uhh. I have been reading the reviews under this game, both positive and negative ones and I have to say that both sides have reason. This game sometimes buggy as hell, it can crash, sometimes glitchy as well, but it compensates with other things, such as the good ""spy-savetheworldinjamesbondandsamfisherstyle"" story, a very well developed rpg mechanic and awesome dialogues interpreted with good and very good voice actors who fit in their characters very well. The real value in this game is it's replayability. Every conversastion influences the story somehow and if you play the game again and again you can always make out the same conversation in a different way. I know that this won't pull in the hardcore FPS fans, but if you like RPGs, with good story and game mechanics, you should buy it despite all it's backdraws.			",176,16,1,15,20,1,43

												Obsidian continues their excellence in story and manage to make a somewhat linear game come alive with the repercussions of actual, non-black-and-white decisions. The gameplay lags behind somewhat, being at best good, at worst unbalanced. If you do play this, I recommend high-difficulty settings to best represent the story and characterization. You can play run-and-gun, but it is much more satisfying to challenge oneself to stealth as much as possible.Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants an experience that goes beyond combat. The story and characters make this game a diamond in the rough.			",63,2,0,16,2,0,5

												Alpha Protocol is a unique and very fun game. It's caught a lot of flak for the bugs that so often plague Obsidian products, but almost all of those have been patched out at this point; the experience has improved a lot. The game has a modern setting, so you get to play with all kinds of familiar looking but renamed guns, and a wide variety of armors, gadgets, and weapon and armor modifications. The skill tree works like Mass Effect 1, which the game resembles in the other ways you'd want it to as well. The combat is smoothly controlled third person with cover, the dialogue choices are made from a circular menu with option positions reflecting the conversational tactic, and the story is branching with many ways to change the outcome and the events on the way there. The maps are often more vertical than ME, though, and even the brown ones look beautiful. The game can get pretty easy if you ignore the stealthy achievements and just gun everything down, but has challenge if you want it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10 is the Best rating i can give this game, its succeeds with flying colors, the combat is fluid for the most part (a few hiccups where you can shoot the enemies at times but they can't shoot you) in skill system is good and well balanced but even with doing every side objective and mission you won't be able to max out the 3 skill trees you choose to expand on after the first mission is successful (Operation Desert Spear) the characters are likeable, and you have to STAY ON YOUR TOES. How you treat characters can be used against you for both good and ill, wether you go in Guns a blazing or you prefer to do stealth,  it is a fanstastic game, while there would be a few different things i would change (adding in a NEW GAME+ option would be nice so you could experiment with the different tiers of guns 0*-3*, adding in a few extra missions in each of the 4 areas would be nice too.) Other than that though i honestly have no regrets about the game it is by FAR a great example of 3rd person spy RPG though and it is well worth the money to pick it up, will last you about 16 hours the first time.A side note, i use pistols and rifles, mainly due to the fact that the Silencer Mk3 has no damage drop off, and the first 2* pistol except damage has some of the higher stats in the game for the pistols (i prefer Recoil control, Accuracy, Stability, etc. over just Damage as you can easily boost Damage with equipment) I choose Freelancer and Operative as i like to customize my play experience from the begining rather than having my skills pre chosen for me.

Well you get the picture the game would be otherwise great, if it not for the awful gameplay where you cant step over a ledge or go on seemingly unobstructed terrain. You cant even jump down from an elevated position unless there is a jump down point. In a stealth featuring game this sucks. The stability is also sub standard. Regular freezes during loads are facts of life, other gliches and bugs are frequent too.Its a shame, i do like the conversations and some little things, and i like the genere.

If you value a good story, solid moral choices that have an impact on that story's progression, and a fairly decent shooting mechanic, you will dig it. The stealth actually works decently in this game, and I completed it with a stealth/pistol build. My biggest complaint is that the protagonist looks like he's got a stick up his♥♥♥♥♥when he sneaks.

												Alpha Protocol is an enjoyable game but not without its flaws. The game is made by Obsidian and it would probably be fair to call it a sort of ""James Bond Mass Effect."" An interesting thing about the game is the way dialogue plays out. Unlike most RPGs that have a system where you can choose your own dialogue, you don't have an unlimited amount of time to pick your responses. You must choose to be one of the three ""JB"" prototypes the designers based the main character off of - Suave, like James Bond, Professional, like Jason Bourne, or Aggressive like Jack Bauer. Your choices feel like they impact the story more than similar choices in other games, though there are (I think) only three endings.As for actually carrying out your missions, the game plays like a third person shooter. Ultimately, there is little point in investing in skills outside of stealth and pistols for your first play through, as those are the over powered skills in the game. In fact, some bosses you might find near impossible without the pistol's special skill. Even with stealth skills, you might find it difficult to perfectly stealth certain missions. Running and gunning isn't really a very viable option on a first playthrough because most of the weapons require you to focus your aim on a target to get a critical hit (it kind of reminds me of the first Deus Ex, where you stay stationary with your reticle over a target until your shot lines up perfectly). There are a couple different minigames for hacking, lock picking, and disabling alarms and the like. The only one that kinda gave me problems was the hacking mini game, back when I first tried this game on the XBox 360. The way it works is, you have two sequences of alpha numeric characters that must be lined up on a screen of constantly changing alpha numerics (it kinda looks like the ""code"" in the Matrix movies, if that makes any sense). The bit you're trying to match will be static, so it's kind of a test of your eyesight and almost like a ""Where's Waldo"" thing. If you don't do it fast enough, the static bit of code will randomly change to another location, and then if you completely run down the timer you set off an alarm. It's been a LITTLE while since I played the game but I believe if you abort the hack before the timer runs down you can get another attempt or two depending on your skill and the difficulty of the hack.The game is fairly nonlinear, even from the start. You have the option of completing the tutorial missions for bonus XP, perks, etc or going straight into the missions. In the first locale you are given the choice of what missions to tackle when, and you can complete the ""main"" mission before finishing up all the side missions. Once the game branches out after the first mission, you can globe trot and handle the missions in any order you please, which can impact your relations with characters and change the parameters for other missions and unlock certain boss fights and so on. You definitely won't see all there is to see in the game in a single play through. If you beat the game on ""Recruit"" difficulty you unlock ""Veteran"" mode which gives you a whole slew of skill points at the start to play around with. It's not quite a New Game + but fairly similar.Alpha Protocol seems to be a love it or hate it kind of a game. If you can get past the gameplay quirks it's very enjoyable, and I'd definitely recommend picking it up. It seems to go on sale often so throw it on your wishlist and snag it at a good price!Final Score = 7.5/10			",437,65,3,118,22,0,62

												I don't care what the reviews say, Alpha Protocol is a good game. Its like mass effect without a party, and set in modern day. The plot, while convoluted is great in that its all but impossible to discover everything thats going on in a single playthrough, choices are made that open one door while closing another. Possibly the best followthrough on the choice consequence system I've seen in a video game.			",156,36,0,39,15,2,40

												I found this game completely unplayable. Issue #1 Combat is totaly worthless. While i understand the idea of nerfing one area of a caracter so that the player can be gently guided to a playstyle that the game is truly intended for, but when the bullets are flying landing a shot feels like threading a needle from 20 yards every time. Devs totally dropped the ball on this one.Issue #2 Playing this game with wsad and mouse is hard at best and sucidal at worst. Playing with an xbox controller is only marginally better.If I if i had bought this by it's self i'd be extremely upset. Thankfully however, I picked this up in a humble bundle that also included bioshock infinate so I'll settle for giving it a bad review here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Game!  Wow, I never even heard of this game and not sure how I bought it, I'm assuming it was part of a humble bundle like so many games in my steam collection are.  But I'm glad I gave it a chance.  It's a little hard to describe, more of an RPG than Action Game, but a good combo of both.  My game playing style is to go slow and explore the environment for hidden goodies and power-ups and this game has that done really well.  One tip is as most PC games to do some reseach online for some optimum graphic settings and I would definitly add the one to enlarge the field of view, because the default FOV is just too close in and made me nautious.  One peculiarity was when you are using the X360 controller you cannot use the keyboard/mouse at all, and vice-versa - only noticed this because I mapped the increased FOV setting to a keyboard key, and would have to flip back from joystick to keyboard to activate it every level.  In summary I can see where not everybody would like this game especially if they were coming into it thinking it was a pure shooter, but I loved it.  Sad to read they will never think about making another, hope they change their mind someday.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												mmmmm.... so secret agents, 007 like moments, girls from around the world, and a corporation that is planning to control the world through fear of a cold war and now your agent is the only person who can stop them. Yeah Alpha Protocol has all these things, but jokes aside AP is actually a pretty fun game to play. AP's combat is not very unique but yet still satisfying to go through an area without anyone seeing you. But the combat is not what the heart of the game is; instead it's actually the choice's your character makes that defines the game. There is no good or bad choice only result's and it's these choices that defines who your character is by the end of the game. Every character you meet has a different personality and therefor reacts differently towards what you say, this in turn will affect how your 'handler' works with you on missions but the game can explain all of this better than me. If you haven't guessed this already Alpha Protocol is a must buy for anyone who's tired of these stupid Bond games and instead want to be an agent. While there are a few frustrating moments like the checkpoints or the wired loading thing how it affects the camera but these are a very small things that should not turn you off from buying this game. Overall Alpha Protocol is game that will make you enjoy your time while playing the game.			",103,20,0,53,1,0,7

												Say what you might about Alpha Protocol, but I found it immensely entertaining. It's a bit of a corny storyline, and our protagonist seems to have no feeling other than snarky, but it all just fits. Very much reminds me of the SEGA games of old in the way the gameplay is set up. A bit like Deus Ex in terms of gameplay but much simpler and you're unlikely to get completely messed up if you trip up security. The many pathways and roles you can take adds to replayability.Great for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't get this game. Remember when I said Sniper: Ghost Warrior was bad? Well, it was and still is. But this game is almost as bad. It wouldn't be, if the hacking minigame was such utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You know how hacking doors in ME was a game of follow the pattern in time? Or in Deus Ex where it was all about percentage chance probability and most efficient routes and time management? Or in Skyrim where locking picking meant gently finding the sweet spot?Well this game says ""♥♥♥♥ YOU"" to nice, enjoyable minigames and tells you to go find a series of unmemorizable letters and numbers in a constantly shifting grid of letters and numbers. But it has you do that with both the mouse, and on the keyboard... at the same time.♥♥♥♥ you Alpha Protocol. I'm glad you tanked. I hope the designer behind that particular decision dies in a fire.

												Alpha Protocol can be frustrating as hell at times but it’s well worth a play through. The story is very reactive to the player’s choices as far as I can tell, with your alliances and the outcomes of your missions drastically altering how the story plays out. Your actions outside of dialogues carry weight too; even how you deal with enemies can lead to different outcomes.The combat is decent. It’s a little clunky and could have done with a bit more polish, but it does get the job done. And I have to admit there’s a certain level of satisfaction when you manage to stealth your way through an area by using the Chain Shot ability. Speaking of the abilities, there isn’t much variety in them. I think the game could have done with some more skills to use.The character customization also isn't very good. You're stuck with a specific character and can barely alter his appearance, only being able to change his hair, beard, skin tone, eye color, glasses, and hat, all of which only have a few options. I think more customization of Thorton would have been good. All in all, it’s worth a look. Just don’t pay more than $10 for it, don’t expect some AAA Mass Effect quality, and keep in mind it's a stealth/action game first and an RPG second.			",124,11,1,12,5,1,5

												Alpha Protocol suffered from numerous delays and was still released very buggy, which at the time made playing the game rather frustrating. The current build is stable, resource-lean and largely bug-free, however.The game has three major focuses: Stealth, combat, and dialogue. The first two are serviceable, though games like Thief or Deus Ex leave AP far in the dust. Players familiar with more comprehensive stealth games will likely be weirded out by some of the design choices, such as the linear area designs, or the guards in a given sub-area disappearing once you've moved onto the next, even if you can go back to the first -- though often you can't, as doors mysteriously lock up behind you. Combat likewise feels rather clunky, though I myself usually prefer the stealthy approach, anyhow -- almost all combat aside from boss fights can be avoided, as can be killing enemies even when you DO decide to engage them. The game offers various lethal and nonlethal methods of dealing with enemies.It's in story and dialogue where the game, which is first and foremost an RPG, really shines. Many missions consist of nothing but dialogue, and virtually every choice you make therein has some consequence in gameplay, as do the actions you take. The effect might be slight, such as increasing or decreasing a character's opinion of you (something that may well come into play later on), or it might open up or close off entire story paths. How the end game plays out very much depends on the choices you made and how you interacted with the various characters you meet along the way.The dialogue is witty and flows along effortlessly, and the characters are interesting, varied and written in depth. Beside the dialogue, there's also tons of documents for the player to uncover and delve into, and acquiring this extra data often offers all kinds of story benefits as well. In short, it is a real treat for anyone fond of story-driven RPGs.			",53,40,0,19,4,0,1

												So to be blunt with this review, the graphics aint up to date but this game is damn enjoyableI love the splinter cell styled stealth but with optional convosation choices like dragon age or half life - So it has that RPG element indeedUpgradable stats and skills which varies between different people, badass jujitsu artist? - trigger happy egotistical Maniac? or maybe the professional cloak and dagger type of guy? I went for the mixture of both.I would say the downside to this game is no female choice of main character and stuck with the not so customisable Michael Thorton. Aiming is very not accurate unless you stop still and aim for a couple seconds before hand (resulted in me going for close up stealth knockouts that shooting as much) and its MASSIVE size of 10gb (this shocked me more) - But if you can deal with this go for it.Gameplay - 8/10 (enjoyed putting the first couple hours into, looking forward to more)Uniqueness - 9/10 (very unique game, not very similar to anything really)Quality - 7/10 (the way some npc's walk... hillarious and spotted a T-pose before a cutscene once or twice)Funny - 8/10 (there are some hillarious parts to this with silly responses to which can keep someone entertained)Difficulty - 6/10 (it becomes easy once you learn the buttons through tutorials)Underated - 10/10Overall 8/10 for me... I recommend someone with a bit of time on their hands and enjoys stealthly games...but you can go guns blazing but even on normal dont expect to live without taking cover too)   ",131,5,4,18,16,2,19

												Alpha Protocol is the best spy RPG I've ever played (not that there are a ton of those games out there).The shooting is pretty good, and melee is a viable option unlike a lot of other shooter games. Stealth is a more challenging option, although the shooting is more fun.The game really shines with the dialog system, similar to Mass Effect but on a timer. The whole setup really makes you feel like you're actually Michael Thorton, actually talking to real people and making decisions based on how you interact with them. I'd go so far as to say it's the best dialog system I've ever seen in any game, let alone an action game.The visual character customization is ok. I like to stylize Mike for each type of mission I do. So when I go to Russia I look like a euotrash hipster. When I go to Saudi Arabia I look like a wealthy warlord prince, etc. Not a lot of action games give you that option.Probably the only negative thing I would say about it is that the mini-games (hacking, picking locks) get repetitive after a while, but still adds to the tension of the game, trying to hack into a computer and if you mess up, an alarm will sound.The closest game I can compare it to would be XIII. Playing with a gamepad is recommended.			",403,28,5,44,8,4,43

												When this game was released, I paid way too much attention to the criticism. I passed it over.What a mistake!- for anyone who has played A LOT of video games and gets tired of the repetitive and derivative nature of most big releases (and even a lot of smaller titles), this game offers something pretty unique.If you like stealth games, if you like story-driven games, if you like the concept of branching paths that don't necessarily offer the usual dichotomy of simply good or evil, ""winning"" or ""losing"" a conversation, YOU NEED TO GIVE THIS A SHOT! And if you're like me, you'll be disappointed you let something unique go ignored for so long.There is a reason people who play Alpha Protocol speak so highly of it. It's bargain-priced these days so pick it up and play.			",123,46,0,23,4,1,13

												This is probably the most inconsistent game I have ever played. It has its highlight moments where it's fantastic, but then it dumps total garbage moments on your lap and says 'deal with it'. I haven't finished the game yet (because I struggle - with what? you'll find out later) but so far the story is really tight. Global balance is at stake and it's your job to try and save the world from the imminent confilict. Alpha Protocol features a great Mass Effect-like dialogue wheel with limited time to response. This system forces you to make quick and usually hard decisions on the spot, which in turn makes converstations exciting and believable. There is also a system of reactions - the dialogue choices directly affect relationships with other characters - each individual is unique and responds vastly different to your actions. The relationships are meaningful and very useful where you are in the field - they have a genuine impact on the mission. In between missions you are in your hideout, where you can buy/sell equipments, trade valuable and sensitive intel (for instant embarassing information found during one of the missions concerning high ranking political figure - you can blackmail, sell to the highest bidder or hand over to the press), buy intel and help on your current mission and so forth. All of the above, this is where Alpha Protocol truly shines. Building your conntact networks, manipulating data, trying to find out as much as you can, talking with your partners - it all has its consequences and effects.Now for the bad part. The controls in this game are probably the poorest I have ever experienced. They are just a pain. Anyone who knows stealth games knows this - the controls have to be tight. In Alpha Protocol they are not. They are simply broken. That's why I strugle in this game. Unfortunately, it came to a point where I pretty much know how this game works and I sometimes have to exploit the game's wonkiness to advance. The AI acts weird. You can approach guard who is pretty much facing you and deliver a swift strike. Other times, the same guard would miraculously spot you and raise an alarm. But you know what the worst part of it is? The animations. To say the guards walk awkwardly is an understatment. They patrol areas and when they turn they occasionally pull off some unbelievable herky-jerky 360 move and spot you sneaking behind them. It's extremely frustrating. The level design is sometimes good, sometimes rather bad. In some areas (probably in general) the game favors certain paths of development (RPG-like skill points and abilities are here) and now I'm in a point where I have to use my martial arts skills, but I have none. Especially at the end of 'chapters' the game pits you against 'bosses' so to speak, and you have to engage them in an all-out gunfight. I was disappointed at this juncture, because it throws the whole 'stealth game' thing into a dumpster and becomes an unrefined shooter. Sadly, all of the negatives break the immersion and erase the joy of playing.This is a game with a great, albeit wasted potential. I'd really like to recommend it, because of a lot of superb ideas, but I cannot do this - Alpho Protocol will bring you more frustration than amusement and that's a shame. The thin stealth games market could have had a gem under its belt. TL;DR.If you are a diehard stealth-espionage fan, buy this, but be warned - Alpha Protocol is badly executed.

												Alpha Protocol is deceptively good. A lot like Deus Ex with way better boss fights, and much lower production values (compared to hr at least). Standard Obsidian quality characters, that is to say, far more interesting and complex than the standard fare.Also, apparently people in coke-berserk mode are immune to fire and punching, but not cardio.I think this game will suprise you, you have about as much control over the final outcome as I've ever seen in a game. If you appreciate Obsidian's marvelous writing, you've no reason to pass up this diamond in the rough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alpha Protocol is the failed masterpiece of 2010, a game you want to like so much that you'll probably be willing to forgive it a lot of its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Lord knows I have.

												Although critically panned for the most part, Alpha Protocol is one of the most pleasant suprises in my gaming library. The AI needs work, the level design is not the best, and the writing can sometimes be simultaneously frustrating and awesome, but the game shines in its true ability to make you think about the decisions you make. They have more than an aesthetic impact in Alpha Protocol.  Your actions don't simply replace one NPC with another in some cutscene. They effect the gameplay in large ways and as far as I can tell have a strong impact on your experience of the story as well. The game is rough and needs polish but I don't regret this purchase one bit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first game I've heard deemed a ""classic"" that I hadn't played around the time it came out where I still ended up enjoying it. The style reminds me of if Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory was an ARPG. It definitely went for the cool Hollywood feeling over realism but it doesn't go over the top.The characters all felt unique and learning about them and trying to persuade them to do things your way really grabbed me in a way I find hard to explain. It felt like what I said and how I approached things actually mattered. You have your usual bunch of options on how to handle /most/ of the game. There are spots with bosses that require you to take the conventional beating-the-snot-out-of route, but for the most part you're free to sneak past people rather than knock them out or kill them. Gun selection isn't great; you've got pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, and aside from better/worse stats here and there they all feel mostly the same. It never bothered me that much.Around the end the upgrades felt kind of overpowered, especially stealth. I might as well have been a ghost. I guess that's kind of the point of a high stealth stat, though, so whatever.This being a PC port shows at times (those sniper rifles!) but I didn't notice it for the most part. A boss near the end of the game proved really difficult because the sniper rifles handle like garbage and that was practically the only way to deal with him.There are a few bugs. One of the bosses ran into a wall and I could beat him with melee attacks while he didn't fight back. In another part Mike exploded into some otherworldly mass of polygons that would've given Lovecraft a wet dream. Again, nothing too terrible. I found these two bugs more funny than annoying.The story isn't spectacular. It's pretty stock. You'll likely see where most of it's going if you're familiar with the genre. It held up well enough though.I'm decently impressed, which, admittedly, is a rarity for me. 7/10, well worth the money.			",138,14,1,20,25,3,24

												Alpha Protocol is an incredibly peculiar blend of unbelievably awesome and utter crap. Think of it as James Bond by way of Mass Effect. Unlike Mass Effect, however, choice actually matters. This is one of the only games I can think of that provides a genuine reactive storyline: Literally every choice in the game alters the story in a profound sense. ""No two playthroughs will be alike"" gets bandied about, but Alpha Protocol is one of the only times where that's actually true. As per the usual, Obsidian puts every other RPG developer to shame as far as the ""RP"" part goes.Unfortunately, that's really all there is to recommend it. The production values are passable, but far from outstanding. The protagonist's voice in particular grates, and while there are options to customize your appearance, they are so limited as to not even be worth the time.Where the game really falls flat, however, is the gameplay. The level design is dull, the shooting is weak (particularly in the early levels), and the stealth system is a joke. Easily the worst parts of the game are the boss levels, which, unless you spec a very specific way, range from near-impossible to just tedious. Unfortunately, this means that for the most part, non-combat builds will have a very, very hard time progressing past the Taipei sections.Ultimately, whether or not Alpha Protocol is worth your money depends entirely on your patience and how much mileage you can get out of the story. I'd say it's worth at least one playthrough, as the story, while not great, is entertaining, and the reactive storytelling is a beauty to behold. However, this one is to be avoided if mediocre gameplay is a turn off. I'll recommend it, but with reservations.			",170,12,4,31,24,0,39

												This game pretends to be shooter, but it isn't. Tries to be rpg, but something isn't right. Scenario is torn, so it's hard to follow it. The good thing about storyline is it's variability. Several times you will have to choose: spare or execute characters, or you have limited time and two goals, and you have to choose which one should be completed. Saved person could help you in future.Sometimes everything looks so interesting and dramatic, but all of it falls prey of very, very, very poor movement animation. It's hard to be serious, when guard walks, than turn around, takes T-pose (or something like that), stumbles and continues walking. Dialogue system reminds of one from Mass Effect, but answer shows you only attitude or emotion your character would apply to his answer. From time to time option to act will show up. Game is full of different characters. For every person you had met, your ""journal"" will show you basic dossier. Further, you could find some additional information about them. In game there is relationship meter. People approve or disapprove of your actions, and could provide you assistance in certain missions.With leveling up you purchase some perks, and I used them only on late levels or against bosses. On mission, you could carry with you grenades, medicine and etc. They are of great help, so don't forget to purchase them after every mission.Gameplay is not bad or good. At first, enemies will die quickly only after headshots, or just immense amount of bullets shot into torso. Accuracy depends on how long you are aiming and on your movement. It sounds ridiculous, but I eliminated more opponents hand-to-hand, even those who were armed to teeth with long-ranged weapons.There are several points in game, where you should use stealth. Stealth here is completely useless and stupid. When enemies or cameras spots you, alarm raises. You could crack it and turn off. Also, you could open locks and crack computer systems. I really hate computer cracking. You get two lines of numbers, and you have to find matching patterns on screen, full of changing numbers. When you find combinations you need (they don't move), you have to move your lines till they match similar lines on screen. My eyes scream in terror! and of course, time is severely limited. But, there is an upgrade, making cracking easier. I bought it immediately as I saw it.Graphics. For game from 2010, they are pretty good.Conclusion. If you like espionage theme, this game is for you. Interesting dialogues, not bad graphics, short intense missions, ability to make important choices that influence story. I beated game in 21 hour, so you could not get tired or bored of it.

Checkpoint system instead of free saves. There's a good action RPG hidden somewhere underneath all this, but somehow I doubt they'll ever dig it out.			",199,29,1,20,18,1,18

												The game engine is simply broken, and not designed for the PC whatsoever.Camera is clunky, movement is quite bad and not fluid. The combat is plain abysmal - I fired 3 shots at someone at point blank, and apparently the bullets went straight through him. He then fires a single pistol shot and my corpse starts flying in the air.I could live with the clunky camera and movement, but after dying 3 times in the same spot to the broken combat engine - it's bye bye from me.

												I picked this up because of the positive reviews around here and while they might be right, I wish someone warned me about the mini games.The game starts out like Mass Effect 2 and throws three different types of mini games in your face almost right away. There's lock picking, hacking and alarm disarming. And there might be more. I didn't find out because I just couldn't stand it. All three mini games were annoying. I played around 20 minutes, didn't even finish the starting mission and had already encountered at least 3 instances of alarm hacking and 1 each of the other two - too much for my taste.Distaste for mini games like this is of course very subjective. But I just can't see any game flow developing with this kind of constant interruption.If you can get past the mini games or if you even enjoy them, you might really enjoy this game.

Pros:-Various gameplay styles-Multiple storyline experiences-Surprising and intriguing plot twists-Choices have far-reaching consequences-Fantastic character cast-Dossiers give the story a great deal of depth beyond the surface plotline-Phenomenal replay valueCons:-Controls sometimes clunky-Main character's voice-Need more Sis; a small number of characters really need further developmentOverall: I have never played a game where my choices impacting the game on this scale.  Who your allies are, what solutions are available, who lives and dies, even shop inventory... all of these are tied to choices made during the plot.  Conversation choices, yes, but also choices on how to complete missions - sometimes completing a mission undetected yields very valuable rewards and opens up choices for later plot points.  One different choice, or performing missions in a different order, will almost always guarantee a different outcome later on.  This is an espionage RPG done right.  The gameplay is mostly smooth with some clunky moments, particularly when it comes to gunfighting, but it's almost unnoticeable.  And while the core cast is very well developed, and most everyone has a dossier that gives their backstory, two or three characters could use some more development.  Still, the gameplay is fun, and the storyline RPG elements are flawlessly executed.Bottom Line: The best $14.99 you'll spend.			",189,38,0,72,11,0,30

												Great game. It's a bit like Mass Effect on the dialogue and RPG end, except better. Choices you make during the dialogue actually have consequences later on; sometimes even little things like the gear you're wearing, your class, etc affect conversations as well. It's kind of a diamond in the rough, as it does have some issues with awkward controls, such as hacking things, but it's well worth it for the great story.			",476,39,3,71,26,3,48

My only advice though are on rifles.. I dont like them and i recommend not using them. they are good for range combat but the way your aim works with them takes some getting use to.

												Forget what the reviews say. Sure, it's an Obsidian game, so there are bound to be a few bugs. But: it's an Obsidian game, and that means it's excellently written, and tons of fun to play. It really deserves a sequel, even though it's an excellent game in its own right (and no, there's no cliffhanger ending; it's wrapped up at the end). Think of it this way: it combines the brilliant writing/dialogue of Planescape, with the gameplay of Deus Ex, in third person. For the most part, it pulls this off brilliantly. Keep in mind that one playthrough of this game is going to be different from the next: how you interact with people determines how the story plays out, and will open up various different missions and plots, so multiple playthroughs are definitely worth it. After reading the reviews, I went into this game a bit skeptical, but I've become a convert. Buy this game!!			",657,237,2,117,25,0,62

												Don't recommend unless you really like odd shooting mechanics and preset death animations that make some awkwardly hilarious deaths.  RPG elements seem like they would be good later on and the bypassing/lockpicking feel great.  I didn't care for the hacking method but it wasn't as off-putting as the shooting mechanics.  I tried both a stealth using almost entirely melee and a full on soldier character and nether were enough to be enjoyable.  Too bad, the story seems like it might actually be worthwhile but the overall gameplay just isn't there.			",420,85,8,45,42,4,59

The dialog system is fun, and I liked the story and characters. If you're a person that gets annoyed by clipping issues, dumb AI, and some bad balancing (The stealth skill tree will literally let you disappear right in front of someone) then you shouldn't' get this game. If you like the espionage genre and just want a fun globe spanning story filled with lies within lies; where you never know who to trust, then give it a try.			",36,8,0,11,5,0,4

												Alpha Protocol.  Alright, this game was pretty much raked over the coals when it came out.  Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first: the game is buggy.  There are some bugs that make gameplay a bit more difficult than it should be, however, nothing is gamebreaking and I never had to re-load the game because something bugged out to where I couldn't do something.  For me, I had a bit of a camera-jerkiness problem that was easily fixed in the Engine.ini file. Quite honestly, I'm not too sure what the big deal was about this game being so bad when it was released.  I experienced no game-breaking issues at all.  Now, for the good: this story is as interesting as you want to make it. The timed dialogue choices are awesome, and this game has ridiculous replay value.  I played as the ""nice and professional"" guy, which landed expected results, but there are three or even four other choices at times that will drastically change your experience.  You can go through the game at your own pace and to whichever place you want first - which also impacts your game.  (Unless you write down everything you do, I doubt you'll have a run that is EXACTLY the same.)  The story is neat, and what I liked most is that I never truly knew who to trust.  At times I thought a certain person had my back, just to find out they sold me out and then tried to kill me.  The twists were interesting and the game is quite good.  I played on Normal and it took me about 17 hours, exploring everywhere, experimenting with the Black Market, etc.  I would recommend you guys to get this guy as it's the only game like this that I know of.  Deus Ex is the general comparison, but this game is nothing like DE:HR, so it's not fair to compare it.  Next time it's on sale, be sure to grab it.			",219,16,1,13,8,1,38

												Although I have not played this for the PC, Ive played through it three our four times on the 360. This game has everything it needs for a perfect rpg. Made before dragon age, this game has romances, hatreds, and customizations. Depending on your relationship with different people you get different perks that help up your game. Through out the game you get funds inwhich you can upgrade weapons armor and components on each. Mass effect has a very similar custization technique. The game is a modern warfare/ secret operations rpg. Its not called the sabatoge rpg for nothing. You have several different strategies to go about missions including stealth, bombs, and assault. Pretty much eveything you do in the game changes the gameplay in some way. If you make someone hate you it could change a way one mission goes completely. It is a very direction oriented game, in which i mean there is not really open world. You do missions and build relationships. Yet somehow, its fun, invigorating, and playable over and over.

												Alpha Protocol is a much maligned gem of a game. I'll not deny that it's rough around the edges; the controls are sub-par, and the level design is occasionally just bad.But the dialogue, the choices, and above all the consequences of those choices, these are all gold. The leveling system is comprehensive and covers a whole lot of options. The choices you make genuinely have repercussions; treat your handler well and they'll be good to you, but if they get too attached you might miss out on imprtant mission details. How you deal with enemies early on will impact what they do for (or to) you later. The story is extremely well put together and I think it makes up for the flaws.It's well worth a look.

												Right now this game is £1.50. Buy it. There may be some holes to be picked- hacking stuff and the stealth late in the game (you can activate an ability and run around punching everyone in the face without anyone noticing)- but it's brilliant.The conversation system is closest to Mass Effect but it's an order of magnitude better. You don't just exhaust all the information options and pick good/bad/neutral. You have a limited time to pick what sort of response you want, professional or suave for example. Based on those responses people will like you or you'll just♥♥♥♥♥♥them off (there's no morality bar hiding here.)... I'm waffling. Buy this game- you won't regret it.			",149,30,3,20,4,1,30

												This is one of those games that got lost in the shuffle. Possibly overshadowed by another release or maybe poor advertising campaign.  Pay no attention to the fact that I've played it for a mere 5hrs - I OWN this on DVD from a while ago and have beaten the game several times. In fact it's the first game I've played since Never Winter Nights that inspired me to replay immediately after the end. Literally I started over when it ended.  --  The replayability comes from the fact that you can never know the true intentions of ANY of the people you deal with unless you have gathered all the Intel on them... and you can NEVER get all the intel on everyone in one playthrough.   (To clearify: You can get ALL the intel on one person but you'll sacrifice the option to get intel on another person in doing so) It was interesting finding out that I supported the wrong people for what I *thought* were the right reasons on my second time through (by making different choices from the first playthrough and gathering different Intel)The Game mechanics are NOT all that great and it lends itself to possible exploitation when chosing skill sets -- If you max out Pistols and a couple other skills you can actually shoot ""blind"" (without aiming) from cover and get headshots about 80% of the time.  --  You can compensate for this flaw by playing on a harder level or diversifying your skillset to include other weapons thereby reducing the possibility of maxing a skill.Overall I recommend this to anyone who likes a cool spy story.

												While it doesnt live up to its potential, it is at the very least a decent game.  Character customization is very limited visually, but as far as playstyle goes it is pretty diverse. Players can customize their skill points and equipment to suit Full Stealth, Full frontal assault and everything inbetween.  AI is rather buggy but not in the way most stealth games are, they dont randomly see you through walls or across the map, they do however occasionally completely stop their assigned patrol route and just stand still until aggro'd or killed. Enemies will attempt to flank you if you stay in cover too long and throw grenades to force you out of cover.  Bosses for the most part are rather straightforward, but some are overpowered if you do not buy certain intel on them(a certain boss ignores knockback effects and brushes off punches while sprinting at you...)   Visually this game is not impressive, but it's not so out of date that it's glaring. Characters mouth movement feels natural enough that you dont feel the need to focus on it or attempt to ignore it *cough*life is strange*cough*   Combat is fairly balanced around range, headshots and time, though spread on guns is rather frustrating at times, it can be compensated for with various skill points/perks and upgraded weaponry. Melee is rather fun and reasonably strong, but often pointless vs bosses.If I were to rate this game out of 10?   Graphics 6/10Fun 7/10Story 4/10Gameplay 7/10   Overall: 6/10			",298,47,3,39,17,2,19

												I first heard about this game from a list that was titled, ""Best games you've (probably) never played"". So naturally, I came into this game with mixed expectations. That said Alpha protocol has pleasantly surprised me. This is a stealth infiltration game. It's not a shooter, it's not even a traditional rpg per se. If you come expecting a shooter with great shooting mechanics or a deep RPG you will be dissapointed. On the other hand if you want a game that lets you play out your fantasies of being a modern day ninja, with a branching ""choose your own adventure"" style story. This game is right up your alley. It's core gameplay revolves around stealth, with minigames that involve keypad splicing, cracking safes, hacking pc terminals for various secret agenty reasons (gain intel, shut off surveillance cameras etc). It honestly reminds me of an American version of Metal Gear Solid with RPG lite elements that was never born. I liked it so much that I played it twice, back to back (I wanted to see how the story branches).If you've played everything else and are looking for something a little different. I highly recommend this gem.Edit: One thing I forgot. No support for 21:9 ultra widescreen monitors. At that resolution the UI is cut off on the top and bottom. After I changed my desktop resolution to a 16:9 ratio (1920x1080) it worked fine. That's the only bug/problem I encountered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story of the man who would go on to be James Bond, or who would go on to be Solid Snake, or the man who would end up dead on foreign soil with his headstone marked ""Foreigner"".Contains all pertinent elements of stealth, social engineering, and gunplay. Do what you need to to survive as a single entrant combatant; recruit other combatants, pay informants, engage in power brokerage, and expose inconvenient truths about the allegiance of people who oppose you, or truth, or ""truth"", or ""Not blowing everything I possibly can up with tanks"".Just... don't bring a fist to a gun fight.

												It's the Vampire: Bloodlines story all over again: an ambitious action RPG with a cool premise, clever plotting and great voice acting got released with major bugs and noticable missing content. It's much less shambolic than Bloodlines though, and in places it's tight as hell. Alpha Protocol is the failed masterpiece of 2010, a game you want to like so much that you'll probably be willing to forgive it a lot of its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Lord knows I have. Maybe it's the slick hand-to-hand combat animation, or maybe I just get off on shooting guys in the brain with a silenced 5.7mm handgun. THUP THUP			",253,79,2,46,18,5,42

												Story of the game was great, Game play is very nice. Graphics more than fantastic. And the steve character is very funny. More of that in the next Alpha protocol.In the next version more modern wapens should be nice. And the mixing of the story more different every time you play the game over and over again. And since i am a sniper player more snipers opertunity's.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No idea why this game got bad reviews when it was first released. Sure the controls are a little clunky at times, and using anything similar to the turret or sniper rifle leaves you with a mouse sensitivity of around 100, but the gameplay is pretty fun. I enjoyed the stealth aspect of the game (made a spy type character) and the hacking/lockpicking/security ""minigames""/puzzles were challenging at times, but not too difficult. If you have ~6-8 hours to waste, and can get this game for sale or in a Humble Bundle, I definitely recommend it.			",501,110,3,86,24,6,44

												Alpha Protocol is one of the few games I would label as a jack of all trades. The game lets you live out an adventure in the life of a secret agent, providing ample opportunities to play as you see fit. The gameplay varies playthrough to playthrough, and allows you to complete a level with either heavy firepower or the more difficult and rewarding stealth approach. It falls short in that while it does provide a huge variety of ways to play the game, the parts that you do end up picking lead up to an average to mediocre third person shooter. The storyline is very similar to Mass Effect as in you pick dialogue choices which effect the story later on. It isn't actually too bad if you enjoy the sort of over the top Bond-esque action adventure. This game is good for those who enjoy a non-linear first person shooter, or those that are fans of the Splinter Cell franchise.			",453,84,10,58,40,4,52

												Although critically panned for the most part, Alpha Protocol is one of the most pleasant suprises in my gaming library. The AI needs work, the level design is not the best, and the writing can sometimes be simultaneously frustrating and awesome, but the game shines in its true ability to make you think about the decisions you make. They have more than an aesthetic impact in Alpha Protocol.  Your actions don't simply replace one NPC with another in some cutscene. They effect the gameplay in large ways and as far as I can tell have a strong impact on your experience of the story as well. The game is rough and needs polish but I don't regret this purchase one bit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alpha Protocol is an incredibly peculiar blend of unbelievably awesome and utter crap. Think of it as James Bond by way of Mass Effect. Unlike Mass Effect, however, choice actually matters. This is one of the only games I can think of that provides a genuine reactive storyline: Literally every choice in the game alters the story in a profound sense. ""No two playthroughs will be alike"" gets bandied about, but Alpha Protocol is one of the only times where that's actually true. As per the usual, Obsidian puts every other RPG developer to shame as far as the ""RP"" part goes.Unfortunately, that's really all there is to recommend it. The production values are passable, but far from outstanding. The protagonist's voice in particular grates, and while there are options to customize your appearance, they are so limited as to not even be worth the time.Where the game really falls flat, however, is the gameplay. The level design is dull, the shooting is weak (particularly in the early levels), and the stealth system is a joke. Easily the worst parts of the game are the boss levels, which, unless you spec a very specific way, range from near-impossible to just tedious. Unfortunately, this means that for the most part, non-combat builds will have a very, very hard time progressing past the Taipei sections.Ultimately, whether or not Alpha Protocol is worth your money depends entirely on your patience and how much mileage you can get out of the story. I'd say it's worth at least one playthrough, as the story, while not great, is entertaining, and the reactive storytelling is a beauty to behold. However, this one is to be avoided if mediocre gameplay is a turn off. I'll recommend it, but with reservations.			",170,12,4,31,24,0,39

												This is the first game I've heard deemed a ""classic"" that I hadn't played around the time it came out where I still ended up enjoying it. The style reminds me of if Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory was an ARPG. It definitely went for the cool Hollywood feeling over realism but it doesn't go over the top.The characters all felt unique and learning about them and trying to persuade them to do things your way really grabbed me in a way I find hard to explain. It felt like what I said and how I approached things actually mattered. You have your usual bunch of options on how to handle /most/ of the game. There are spots with bosses that require you to take the conventional beating-the-snot-out-of route, but for the most part you're free to sneak past people rather than knock them out or kill them. Gun selection isn't great; you've got pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, and aside from better/worse stats here and there they all feel mostly the same. It never bothered me that much.Around the end the upgrades felt kind of overpowered, especially stealth. I might as well have been a ghost. I guess that's kind of the point of a high stealth stat, though, so whatever.This being a PC port shows at times (those sniper rifles!) but I didn't notice it for the most part. A boss near the end of the game proved really difficult because the sniper rifles handle like garbage and that was practically the only way to deal with him.There are a few bugs. One of the bosses ran into a wall and I could beat him with melee attacks while he didn't fight back. In another part Mike exploded into some otherworldly mass of polygons that would've given Lovecraft a wet dream. Again, nothing too terrible. I found these two bugs more funny than annoying.The story isn't spectacular. It's pretty stock. You'll likely see where most of it's going if you're familiar with the genre. It held up well enough though.I'm decently impressed, which, admittedly, is a rarity for me. 7/10, well worth the money.			",138,14,1,20,25,3,24

												An absolutely amazing RPG, one of the best ones in years, and one I enjoyed almost as much as Mass Effect 2. The combat is decent, not particularly outstanding, but where Alpha Protocol really shines is the conversation system and choices you can make. Playing an ""aggressive"" character and a ""professional"" character is like two different games. Who you decide to kill or save will have a big impact on later missions.I would recommend playing this with a 360 controller if possible. The hacking minigame especially feels much better.

												Polarised with reviewers, Alpha Protocol is a game that is meant to be played with skill focus in mind. Your starting abilities are poor, including weapons (the common complaint of reviewers). But by adding points in the abilities you desire those skills and abilities increase dramatically, making this a highly enjoyable Action RPG. The choice/morale system is also detailed with your actions both in conversation and in missions having repercussions for the rest of the game, encouraging replayability to see the possibilities of alternate actions and choices.

Game overview:  A less serious Splinter cell with phenominal voice acting and hilarious hijinks. Add in dialogue choices that affect missions, who you can trust, and ultimately the game experience, as well as skill levelling (similar to Mass effect) and a wide variety of beautiful missions (Moscow, Taipai, Rome). Oh, and the secondary character of Steven Heck is icing on the cake.Problems with the game: AI can be wonky at times. Animations are unpolished. Game is unbalanced to the point of hilarity. There is also a level that almost requires two skills to be able to complete it (TV Killed the Radio Star). Completionists will hate that you can not hit 100% on some dossiers due to branching dialogue/action choices that you make.Bottom line: If you find it on sale for $5, give it a whirl ",13,1,0,3,4,0,2

You may come away from it either loving or hating it, but I can promise you this, there is nothing else like it out there. It has a lot of rough edges (who the f*** approved that fast walking animation?) but it has a LOT of heart, which goes miles for me.Take this recommendation with a grain of salt. If you are going to buy this, please make sure you know what you are getting into. It's buggy, ugly, and has a lot of moments where you can upgrade wrong and end up screwing yourself out of a boss battle or cut off a lot of content for yourself.I bought it for the curiosity, and I was satiated quickly.

Playing for the dialogue choices alone is worth it. If you want to play the game in super-easy mode, just level Pistols+Stealth. Leveling any skill pretty much makes you Agent Badass.

												The Steam desc for this game does not really describe this game well. This is an espionage RPG where you are a Micheal Thorton and you are employed by a secret agency named ""Alpha Protocol"". Any more would be spoilers, but I would describe this as a sort of James Bond kind of experience. I always have fun with this game overall. The story is interesting and the character are very well made if not a bit predictable sometimes. Also, there is a lot of talking in very short spans of time, but you can skip all the dialog if you want. The game is definitely designed to be played stealthed, but you by no means have to. The stealth is pretty standard, with a few interesting skills in the stealth skill tree to spice things up. The other tree's are pretty basic and can even be boring, but the upside is that those trees cost less AP to go through then the stealth tree. The UI for this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's wonky and odd to deal with and the crosshair does not accurately display where your shots are going. The camera is also way too close to Thorton all the damn time. Honestly, other than that I had a lot of fun with this game though I would pick it up during a summer sale or something as it's pretty old, and $20.00 is probably a little much for this game.

												Great game. I have not really bumped into any bugs like I see all of the reviews mention. My only complaint is the mouse sensitivity. I have to set it way down in the options menu and then crank it up on my mouse by setting up dpi. The sensitivity when you are trying to shoot with the sniper riffle and pick locks is really high too and during those times I have to dial back the settings on my mouse. I really like how the game has options between saving a girl you have fallen in love with and saving the lives of innocent citizens from a bomb. The game seems to have a good RPG aspect to it.

												How many espionage RPGs are there? Not that many, and this one is pretty good too.Not triple gold star brilliant maybe, but well worth a budget price purchase and your time if you fancy being an internation al spy for a while. The RPG elements and customisation of your character work well too.A fun diversion in an under served genre.			",548,265,25,90,74,9,140

												When this game came out, the general review from official venues were negative, highlighting the awful gameplay. But I have to say this is such an underrated game; I actually had fun playing it despite the laughable gameplay and enemy AI (the worst aspect that stands out imo). The story is typical spy action thriller one would easily find in a silver screen - but this is a video game. The story is actually great (I was suprised, too). Mind you, it's quite typical since it follows the spy genre pretty close. This game is pretty fun and it's not bad. Highly recommend it to those who enjoy story in games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You have to break this game down into 2 parts:1) the gunplay levels are really shoddy and play like a 'my first stealth' game.2) Conversations and choices are great. If you like choices that acutally affect things, this is it.The end boss can change, who helps you can change, who dies, etc. Well worth the muddled action parts, i'm not kidding.(also the first place i saw the 'run out of time' convo picker thing)			",273,127,3,50,48,5,60

												A pretty bad stealth-action game blu-tacked onto one of the best narrative RPGs ever made, and THE best spy game ever made. Seriously, the story stuff in this is out of this world. Just make it through the first terrible mission.			",283,85,6,37,39,3,52

												It may lack of nice graphic, it may lack of cool rag-dolls, physics, animations... But what drives RPG is the character customisation and the story. Well i mean the story of this game is very well told and that is captivating... other small issues become invisible, when you dive deep into story. And this game has big replayability potential, it responds to your actions and rewards them.			",89,13,1,19,35,0,40

												If you're into stories involving secret organizations, spies and an international conspiracy then this game might be for you. The story is where this game shines if it's your thing, it's just a shame that the gameplay itself is somewhat a letdown.GameplayYou would expect from a game about spying that you walk around sneaking around silently killing your enemies similar to the Hitman games. Unfortunately it's pretty hard if not impossible to finish a level without ending up shooting everyone with your machine gun. It's much easier to just start shooting everyone, the game doesn't leave you much of a choice most of the time. You can also use martial arts but it's simplified to hitting one button at the right time, there is no way to block punches which can suck because there's one level boss that runs at you with a knife and the only thing you can do is run away.Speaking of bosses, they feel out of place, for a game about spies you suddenly stand in front of a heavily armoured guy that shoots bullets with pinpoint accuracy. They require a lot of bullets to take down and it's too easy for you to die. I've had fights where I died a few seconds after the fight starts. At the end of the game the bosses are just ridiculously overpowered and the game stops being fun while the rest of the game is actually pretty easy. I tried it on normal difficulty as a recruit and I never felt challenged.StoryThe story is good, although sometimes it felt too much like ""USA: world police"" where you as a patriotic secret agent have to single-handedly save the world by going to several places in the world, killing everyone you meet. The conversations in the game are good and you're often given choices that affect the progress of the game. You are given choices on how to respond while being talked, the moment they stop talking you respond, it sounds smooth but it means that sometimes you're given a choice on how to respond to a question while they're asking it and the moment they finish there's no time to select your choice. Also the choices you're given are vague, you can select ""honest"", ""agressive"", ""avoid"" and sometimes some other choices. I don't know what my character will confess when I select honest and I don't know how agressive he will be or how he will avoid the question.GraphicsThe characters look good but don't expect facial animations like LA Noire, they're quite the opposite of the spectrum, graphically the game looks good if you don't expect the latest graphical fidelity. Because of this the game runs good on older systems. If you're not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ you won't mind it.ControlsThis game is an obvious console port and you feel it in the controls, melee combat is one button, navigating through menus can be unresponsive to key input, I've had times I constantly closed my load-out menu while I just wanted to go back a screen, in the game you also have to hack certain devices like finding 2 strings of characters in a list, one string you control with your keyboard and the other with your mouse and a lot of times you try to navigate your mouses string, which is hard to do because the sensitivity is very low and when you click it on the right place you accidentally move your mouse and the game counts it as a fault. If you make a mistake while hacking the alarm goes off and the enemies know where you are. Aiming with your weapon is ok, there are certain places you can use a sniper rifle but it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to control it, it's very floaty.I can't recommend this game, it has some good ideas but with everything it tries to do there are problems, you can make choices that matter in the story but sometimes you don't have the time to hear the question completely before choosing your reaction. Sneaking around is fun but it always ends up with you shooting everyone with a machine gun. Hacking can be pain, The story is the best part if you don't mind the ""USA nr.1"" attitude everyone in the game seems to have but even then  the whole story seems too far-fetched with a typical evil corporation trying to cause a cold war so they can profit from it. During the last cold war the world leaders were all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants constantly and the earth got almost destroyed several times. There's a reason why it ended, even politicians knew it was going to end badly for everyone if the cold war lasted.			",423,96,34,37,42,4,64

												Alpha Protocol is one of those games that I have a kind of hate-love-relationship with. On one hand, this game has fantastic voice-acting (especially compared to some of the stuff thrown at gamers these days), a non-linear, thrilling story, interesting, complex characters, and a lot more. Some of these points are so strong that there are not even a handful of games able to compete with Alpha Protocol in those regards.However, on the other side, Alpha Protocol has it's bugs and flaws. The controls are, at best, mediocre, and sometimes to be considered an atrocity. The overall graphics are sub-par considering what the Unreal Engine 3 is capable of. Despite this, UE3-typical issues like textures that are loaded far too late are still noticeable.All in all, the story of Alpha Protocol is a sad one. Not because it's bad - no, in fact, I really do recommend this game to everyone looking for a thrilling espionage-action-game - but because it was confirmed that there won't be a sequel.

												I honestly wish I could put a thumbs up AND a thumbs down. For one thing, there are so few games like this with both action and story-driven dialogue and your choices ACTUALLY MATTER.  The characters are nice and the dossiers and information is well done. The romanceable characters are pretty varied with a nice well-balanced ending. The hacking and lock picking system was unique and well-balanced. Unfortunately, SEGA+Obsidian = bad game. Let's just throw that out there. From what I've read this game was released in 2010, but it feels much older- like a pre- deus ex human revolution game. The cover system needs a lot of work and the skill tree and boss fights- eh. I'd mention enemy AI, but that's not the problem so much as the enemies will occassionally just stand blankly or shoot in the opposite direction of you (still trying to figure that one out).  The dialogue does that thing where you have like half a second to read and decide and some of those decision are very diifficult. I dislike this about this game and TellTale franchise and...a lot of story games these days. Lastly, the save/check points are few and far between and figuring out exactly when to save is frustrating. JIT does auto save checkpoints, but when they're like 30 minutes to an hour between why bother repeating? I did it once when I mispressed an important decision. I was very unhappy ;(. That said, I refuse to throw this game under the bus mostly because everyone else already has. I will gladly climb under that bus and enjoy this game over and over!			",95,23,1,28,15,0,8
