												Completed: 8/25/14 in 13 hrs on Cardinal (Hard) Diffculty.I decided to up the difficulty for the playthough of this expansion and let me tell you it was much more difficult then expected. The worst enemies are those damn Swamp Stalkers. They hide in the water and in doing so they are untargetable and likely to ambush you. One map also had 4 Death Wyverns in it and the first game had it was a boss. They really tried to up the difficulty this time around.Deathkings as well as the original Hexen included an inventory system and character selection. They should have added some new mobs or a new playable character in the expansion as they did with Hexen II but I forgive you guys. :)Deathkings is a fun game if you don't mind the retro PC graphics and gameplay. It tells you how far we have come in the genre, why some newer titles have failed. Because you don't need high resolution textures for a game it just needs to be fun and Deathkings does that. Incredibly difficult.I fear the art of Hexen will never again be replicated. The 90s are over.			",111,16,1,31,13,0,18

												Good old Hexen and its Add Ons.  Me and my friends played this for hours and hours killing each other, playing COOP ect.  I think the atmosphere survived the ages, but for some reason the gameplay/graphics feel so poor I cannot bring myself to go back and play it again... yet Duke Nukem and DOOM I can easily play again.This game was not made for those faint at heart.  It was difficult, dark, and strange.  You can get stuck on some level for hours that would normally only take 10 minutes because they would hide buttons, hidden triggers, or just the requirement of killing a monster hidden behind a glass window you can only shoot from a distance.The three chars to choose from are very very different and add a interesting element to the game that old school games really didn't have.  I would only get it for Nastagia, for those that never played it... you will not like this game.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												At first, it seemed like a sloppy mod rather than an expansion, but over time it grew on me as I noticed everything it had to offer. This is more of what the first game offered, but I have to say that the level design here is a lot more impressive, with tons of subtle details. The moving floors, the earthquakes, the objects that talk back, the way the ground has a more natural flow, such as the ice in the caves merging with the rock, all are good creative steps forward from the original and seem genuinely inspired.My only complaint is that most of the time, it only uses assets from the original game. Same textures, same enemies, same classes, same items. It's still really fun, but I can't see why the only new things here are the levels. I would have loved to at least fight a new final boss, rather than an endurance run of monsters and all the classes. Oh well.			",120,19,3,24,14,0,4

												HeXen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel is an expansion pack for Hexen, released in 1996. It doesn't feature any new gameplay elements, instead it adds more hard levels for single player and adds more levels and improvements for Multiplayer and Deathmatch. But since everybody uses Zandronum for multiplayer in Doom engine games anyway, it's only just more levels.Now, if you will try to play the game right as it was installed by Steam you will be met by disaster. It really got to be the worst out of all games that id software published here.Most importantly, the game is unpatched. It's original release. A flawed original release, where develoeprs somehow forgot to link music of Hexen to new levels. So, unless you download and patch the game up, you will have to enjoy some silence. Amazing. Check community guides on how to do that.Then, as usual, DosBox isn't configured good. It lags and so you have to go to game's directory, open the needed .conf file and edit ""ddraw"" output to ""opengl"" one.And then if you want to choose your control and music device, then you will have to go to game's folder again and drag ""setup"" file over ""dosbox"" to launch it.Expansion pack pulls quite an excuse plot twist to justify action: The evil or the sphere teleported you away into land of the dead where you have to defeat Deathkings before being able to return. Who are they anwyay. Ah, right, they just reuse end bosses from Hexen.So, game adds three new hubs to conquer.  Which totals in around 30 levels. They don't use any new textures. Though there are some interesting inviroments anyway. But it's more of Hexen but harder.The thing is, Hexen was already too dragged. It didn't had enough of variety in combat and weapons for each class. It had tedious part. And bringing even more levels that are also harder and bring no new gameplay elements, well, it's not a good idea. At all.Yes, it has a sin of using bosses of Hexen as tough enemy. You fight big mage demon at the first level of the second hub already.It doesn't help that I had glitch two different glitches on the first hub. First, there weren't enough of fire masks, key items, in the first world. Yes, I checked with walkthrough on all spots. Somehow, there wasn't. Somehow. And then on another level magic bridge just didn't appear either. And wyverns, bosses of Hexen, got stuck in walls too. So, watch out on first hub.And main problem and difference in difficulty is monster respawn.Original Hexen would spawn Ettins, common melee weak enemies, after each 10 minutes. Or at least it feels so. It was there just so player will not get lonely while being lost.Dark Citadel rushes you down and beats you up. It can spawn hordes of any kind of enemy more often. And shielding centaurs that are incredibly annoying or flying imps that shoot fireballs at you aren't good enemies to respawn.What it means is that you will have to rush levels down, having to solve ""puzzles"", saving/loading and doing other things while being rushed down and under constant heavy pressure. Killing enemies in this game doesn't bring any benefit, there is no leveling or such. You only waste mana and time. A lot of them. So you will have to try not to pay attention to them as you have to rush rush rush your way. And if you get lost, like everybody does in Hexen, then it will not be pretty.It gets really bad on the main level of the last hub, Citadel itself. It's pretty much a hall with teleporters and switches. With water pools for no reason. And enemies not only respawn all time there, they also teleport around when reaching water pools for some reason, with without any special effect. You will be telefragged at least once.Actually, perhaps it's easier to play as Mage here. His basic weapon, that don't require mana, is a ranged one.So, Deathkings isn't good expansion pack It feels like it just milks on Hexen more. It's hard not in a good way, it's buggy, it brings nothing new outside of levels and it just makes Hexen outstay it's welcome. You miss nothing.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

Hexen: Deathkings of the dark citadels		*7/10Developed by Raven Software, This Hexen expansion adds three more Hubs to play in. It's an immidiate sequel of the original first chapter. Actually there's not much to say, this expansion shares all the goods and the bads of the original title, besides the fact that all the levels results Tougher than the original game. You don't have any new monster and there's not really a Final boss as scary as the Second Serpent Rider Korax, yet ther's a nice final surprise.Sharing the same aspects of the original title means we will be able again to choose our class before beginning our game. Warrior, Cleric And Mage are still the three classes we might choose, affecting our gameplay in the same way as the classic Hexen. You still have the inventory system with the pleasant improvement where you keep all your items quantity in your inventory instead of just loosing all backups but one per each item once you proceed to the next hub.As usual this game is released with DosBox to launch with. Fortunately they didn't even try to clumsily implement any mouse configuration as done in the horrible DooM releases.Since this is an expansion with no significative innovations I'll keep the same PROs And CONs.+++PROs+++ STRUCTURE. Clearly the all new structure of the levels is an innovation that, paired with puzzles in the minor levels, gives the game a big playability by making the player moving back and forth from more maps. This way, even though you will end up re-visiting the same place many times you have the illusion of a bigger world. Honestly this always had the look of a maze to me, but I've never really tried that much. In this expansion even though there's less Hubs and levels it is structured to be more complicated and difficult, representing a bigger challenge for the Classic title fans. FANTASY. Following the fantasy atmosphere from its predecessor Hexen does a bigger job by renewing the locations and making the game with a bit darker tones. in my opinions it's a bit scarier and ominous than Heretic.  GAMEPLAY. Besides the ability to look up and down already introduced in Heretic, Now you can jump as well. Nothing too useful but at least that's a step forward XD. And just like Heretic you still have the inventory system with some old items already seen in Heretic and other useful and interesting tools. Note that some of these tools have a different functions according to the class you choose. MODS & COMMUNITY. You can find mods, and other stuff. But most importantly, there are custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with tricks and advices on replacing DosBox with better ports and implementing the Steam Overlay.---CONs--- MUSIC. Unfortunately i didn't enjoy that much almost any of the tracks in the game, unlike its predecessor Heretic. STEAM OVERLAY. As usual, like on every other old steam release running on DosBox, there's no Steam Overlay. STRUCTURE.  Even though this is a new kind of structure I personally didn't enjoy it too much because it forces me to visit and revisit the same leves again and again before proceeding to the next hub, resulting in a repetitive gameplay.

!!Important note!! To have the best experience with Hexen Deathkings of the Dark citadel I highly recommend you download a source port called zdoom, which provides loads of customization and you won't have to play this game with dosbox. (Link below for zdoom)   What I liked about the game 	I like the concept behind Hexen, its not level to level, instead you get a hub and sub-levels, you have to solve one big puzzle to move on to the next hub. Something completely different, especially at a time were there were loads of level to level games. 	Awesome new hubs and sub-levels.    	This time round I choose the Mage class and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot more than the warrior class; in fact, I am considering playing Hexen beyond heretic again, but this time round playing as the Mage.	Challenging and fun to solve puzzles. This time I managed to solve all three hubs without looking on the internet for help.	Replayability; three classes to choose from; Fighter, Cleric and Mage. What I disliked or was disappointed with 	No new weapons, no new enemies, and no new power ups. 	Enemy respawn is just insane. Killing enemies felt like a chore sometimes.	No soundtrack. Conclusion  I really enjoyed it this time round; probably because I choose a different class. If you enjoyed Hexen and you want more, then I highly recommend you buy this expansion pack. 80/100zdoom  http://zdoom.org/Download ",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

												This is an expansion pack for Hexen - it adds more levels for the singleplayer and the multiplayer.This game still suffers from the same problems the original Hexen suffers from – The really annoying puzzles, so if you enjoyed Hexen then you'll enjoy this expansion.The version that is on Steam as it is, is a disaster -  the game version is the unpatched one (1.0) which means that music is not working. To fix that you will need to download and patch the game up (Check community guides for instruction), even though it's id software job to do this from the beginning before releasing the game in that state.Also because the DosBox version is outdated and isn't configured to modern systems, then the game will lag – to fix that download the ZDOOM or configure it yourself (again check the community guides).

												For those who played Hexen: Beyond Heretic and wanted to play more, Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel is right up your alley.Deathkings of the Dark Citadel is an expansion pack that contains 3 new sizable hub worlds and increased challenge compared to that of Hexen: Beyond Heretic.Much else can't really be said than what I already said about Hexen: Beyond Heretic.You can use GZDoom to play this expansion pack, although before doing so, it would be wise to read one of the guides that tell you how to fix the ""no music"" issue through a patch. Other than that, you should have no huge problems.I thoroughly enjoyed this expansion pack and, as I previously mentioned, would recommend it to people who enjoyed Hexen: Beyond Heretic.

 Deathkings of the Artificial Difficulty HeXen was already a pretty hard game, but Deathkings of the Dark Citadel managed to make an even harder game, and with methods that are far from being fun: enemy respawning.Yes, the original game let Ettins respawn, but just that. DotDC, however, allows the respawning of any kind of enemy (with the exception of Wyverns, thank God) so you will find yourself rushing everywhere trying to solve the puzzles as fast as possible, leaving you with a sense of Nightmare! DOOM difficulty, but far easier (unless you play in the higher difficulties).But even with the flaws it has, Deathkings of the Dark Citadel is still a fun experience, just a little annoying and less enjoyable than the original game.P.S: Some people complain that if you play with the Fighter you will have to go through a map with four Wyverns without any ranged weapon. In the same map you can find the Hammer of Retribution before that encounter. Just explore! (and jump!)			",48,0,0,1,1,0,0

												This is a follow-up review for Hexen. If you haven't read it I'd recommend doing so to get the gist of what it's all about in order to get the most out of this one. Thank you!Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel is the only official expansion pack for Hexen and developed once again by Raven Software, released a year after the base game. Unlike most expansions released for shooters around this time period Raven don't outsource theirs to third parties but prefer to create their own. As such the quality of the expansion is more or less on par with the original title, which will either be a good or a bad thing depending on how much you enjoyed or loathed Hexen overall.Deathkings continues the story of Hexen, shortly after the defeat of Korax, the three heroes come upon the source of Korax's power: the Chaos Sphere, an ancient artifact that can create new worlds or destroy them, and appears to be kept inside its own pocket dimension. During the ending sequence of the original game the player is poised to take the Chaos Sphere for their own use, but is warned that there still exists other beings more powerful than them, foreshadowing Hexen II. However in Deathkings it's revealed that when the player takes the Chaos Sphere they are whisked away to the Realm of the Dead, which is occupied by Korax's broken armies, and the heroes must find their way back home. This is very similar to what happens to Corvus in Heretic when D'Sparil dies but not before uttering a curse to condemn Corvus to a similar fate in the game's fourth and fifth episodes. It's never mentioned whether this was a result of the Chaos Sphere's own power or a curse laid by Korax in Deathkings' scenario, but according to the game box description the Chaos Sphere is powerless in the Realm of the Dead and the heroes must overcome the Deathkings, the rulers of this forsaken place who reside in the Dark Citadel.Whereas Hexen had five hubs to complete Deathkings has roughly half that at three (technically there's four but the latter's reserved for deathmatch only and cannot be visited in single player) at around twenty levels and contain pretty much every theme visited in the original game, like swamps and wilderness areas, castle and seminary themed locations, only re-envisioned and mixed up. Even all the puzzle items and keys used in the base game are back and recycled but handled in a different order. It's almost as if the Realm of the Dead mocks all your efforts to get to this point and makes you do them all over again, only in traditional expansion pack fashion: it's going to be a lot harder now. I'd argue that the first hub Blight is the most difficult to endure and definitely the most confusing to navigate, with the remaining hubs Constable's Gate and Nave being less of a headache and a bit more streamlined.Combat was never a huge focus in Hexen like it was in Heretic (unless you were on the highest difficulties) due to the stronger emphasis on puzzle solving and exploration, but here you'll be doing a lot more fighting, as it appears that every foe you've slain in Hexen has come back to get even with you plus more and they're more heavily concentrated and in greater numbers. You will not be afforded a single breather this time around, and the occasional Ettin spawning into the level was replaced by practically an entire battalion of monsters spawning in after a while if you take too long to get things done. The Death Wyvern, a pitiful boss in Hexen was brought back and now there's four of them flying around in a level early on and each one must be killed in order to progress the hub. This is very difficult to pull off with the Fighter and Cleric until you find their third weapon and even then the Fighter is guaranteed to have the hardest time as none of his weapons have hitscan properties like the Cleric and Mage have access to. You'll also be dealing with a couple Heresiarchs later on again just the same as in Hexen but if you've developed a good strategy against them they won't be any harder.As for the final encounter the 'Deathkings' are your former Masters again, as Korax's gift of Unlife has allowed them to continue their reign of power in the Realm of the Dead, and they must be slain once again in order to return to the world of the living. Heretic's extra episodes also recycled the Iron Lich and Maulotaur boss fights as it wouldn't make sense to see the Serpent Riders alive again. Still a lazy ending and makes me wish Raven would've considered adding actual new content beyond just another set of levels.That's really the biggest flaw with this expansion is that it's nothing you haven't already seen before and exists solely to sate appetites for diehard fans of the original. There's no new textures, no new music, no new enemies, no new weapons, no new items, nothing new to really talk about in this review, just a collection of maps that as a whole I think is a weaker campaign than the original's, but ultimately they're not too awful. The levels are for the most part fairly well designed and there can be some pretty cool moments and if you really enjoyed Hexen and want more this is essentially the most you'll ever get again as there's very little user made content available for it. Another issue I can cite is the strange lack of music, while it re-uses Hexen's the soundtrack in version 1.0 of Deathkings is still associated with the levels of the original game, not those of the expansion. There's a small patch (dkpatch.zip) that was released and updates HexDD.wad re-enabling the music and upgrades it to version 1.1.Once again if you're a diehard fan of Hexen I'll still recommend it but if not then there's nothing to see here.3.0/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing via Doomsday engine 1.15.8, mainly for the mouse look function and graphics upgrades.As much as I enjoy and respect Hexen as an oldschool FPS, this version is unplayable for me without cheats. Here are some bugs I ran into:-Sump: Cannot obtain the third fire mask, as the second pair of moving pillars aren't moving. I have to noclip through them to obtain the mask.-Locus Requiescat: Cannot place Yorick's skulls onto the statues. This function is broken, so the trees remain blocking the path through. I have to noclip, once again.-Constable's Gate: Cannot place the heart of D'Sparil onto the mantle, triggering the script for the switch to appear. It seems like the ability to place items in certain locations is broken, though I had no trouble going through Blight and placing fire masks. At this point, I must cheat to get into the next area.Not sure if it's the Steam version of the game, the Doomsday engine, or a combination of both.			",71,8,0,4,8,2,10

												An absolute obnoxius ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game.  It offers nothing new over Hexen.  No new weapons or enemies, just 3 new map hubs.  I can't even recommend it even if you liked the original Hexen.  It's not just 'More of the same' but the difficulty is lazily increased by enemies continuously spawning into the map - constantly interrupting your ability to focus and find the required switch or key.  Enemies jump and spawn from anywhere endlessly, but ammo is still limited.  Environmental traps are impossible to intuit so you will regularly killed out of the blue when fighting endless waves of monsters.  I had to quit by the end of the first hub, it was clear that the completion of the game depended on attrition tactics - constantly die until the combination of luck and switch memorization gets you through.You probably already have this game if you have Hexen, as I believe it's just the one bundle, but if you dont, then don't buy it.  Its the same game as hexen but designed to punish with almost no enjoyment.http://theboilingpot.net/?p=260 ",176,15,1,23,1,0,3

												Oh Hexen, how I love thee. Bar none, my favorite FPS. How its expansion pack fails to live up to the original. Long story short, the balancing issues are obnoxious and it really takes away from the enjoyment of the game; for the sake of cranking up the difficulty, now ALL monsters respawn instead of just Ettins, which as pointed out by another user, renders much of the game an unbalanced pain in the @$$ instead of making it more challenging due to constantly draining you of ammo and supplies. Imagine having to play Doom with constantly respawning Cacodemons and Mancubi, that's how it feels to have respawning Chaos Serpents when your Fighter is low on green mana (trying to do Brackenwood as the Fighter, without even your Hammer of Retribution yet while FOUR Death Wyverns are flying around, is tantamount to only having your fists and chainsaw while being hounded by 4 Cyberdemons). By comparison, the expansion to Heretic (Shadow of the Serpent Riders) manages to up the difficulty while not making it seem far too cheap. And speaking of Shadow of the Serpent Riders, it comes packaged with the vanilla Heretic when you buy it, why couldn't they simply add Deathkings to the original Hexen port? Then it would make sense to buy them both as one package deal. So that being said, only pay money for this if you're buying it as part of a Heretic/Hexen bundle, if not, save your money for Hexen 2 instead. At least it provdes some novelty instead of an underwhelming rehash of a classic.			",7,1,0,7,0,0,5
