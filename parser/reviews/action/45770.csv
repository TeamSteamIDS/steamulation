												This is one of those games you have laying around your place, and your friend boots it up while he's waiting for you to get ready to go somewhere. Cheap laughs, fun to play, with lots of gore, but after watching crowds of zombies be cut up by a lawn mower blade for the 150th time, the game can lose its charm. Being able to pick up anything off the ground and use it as a weapon is definitly fun, but you slowly start to realise really how little of them actually benefit you. You'd think having hundreds of ways to kill a zombie would be good for some mindeless fun, and it is for the first few hours... but soon enough it grows tedious, and soon you find the zombies are just a bunch of traffic cones that you can easily kick over as they constantly get in your way. They add little challenge to the game, and are literally just walking manaquins for you to unleash your boyhood fantasies of drawing dead stick figuers a hundred times on a blank sheet of paper with a red marker. Its fun, but don't expect something perminant, the gimic of zombie killing wears down quickly, and as soon as you run out of objects to play around with, mowing down zombies is about as exciting as mowing down a lawn, tedious and just a lot of work.  Fortunatly when you get to that point, (and believe me you will) There are several unique and challenging boss fights or psychopaths to take on with your aresonal of orange juice and brooms with a machetes duct taped to the ends. Each one shows signs of multiple psychiatric discorders to reflect the grievance of whatever situation they are cought in. These psychopaths easily steal the show, and I found myself attempting to hunt down each one of them, as each of them were unique, varied, with different weapons and personalities.      I can't exactly say the same for the main story though... This time around in contrast to dead rising 2, you play as Frank West in an alternate story line where he is lazily strapped into the same scenes as Chuck Greene was in from the main game. All the side characters basicaly share almost exactly the same diologue, while Frank might change up a few of Chuck Greene's original lines. You'll more then likely play the main story once then blow it off completely in future attempts of the game as its nothing special, and you probably didn't pick this game up for an enthralling story in the first place. Sorry Frank,, but you're little crysis is as lame as your cheezy one liners. At least with this incardnation of Dead Rising 2, it comes with several DLCs free of charge, and a whole section of the map that was previously blocked off in the vanilla game. Other then that, its nearly the exact same game, just with an alternate story line.If you enjoy violance with all the blood and gore to bath yourself with, then you'll enjoy all your common household objects duct tapped to pointy things as you mindlessly slay walking targets in as multiple ways as the game allows. Fun and cheap, you might come back to it every once in a while for some mindless zombie killing, but without real challenge, it' won't be long before the fun of zombie slaying soon becomes a chore and this game drifts back into your library and remains untouched in till that one bored friend comes over and boots it up. 7.5/10			",316,29,7,21,17,2,20

												Dead Rising 2: Off The Record is a hard game to judge.  Dead Rising 2 was a good game, the problem with Dead Rising 2 is that it's the same game.  By that I don't mean ""Oh they reused the assets"" or ""They used the same map"".  Both of those are acceptable.  No Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, literally did a character swap and changed less than a third of the story. To be honest, this should not have been it's own game.  This is almost DLC masquerading as a full release.  There is some other changes (a few more survivors, a few changes to survivors, I think a few new psychopaths)  but if you've played Dead Rising 2 right before this game, this is going to be like a second playthrough of Dead Rising. As for the story, there's really two major changes that I noticed.  Instead of Chuck being blamed for releasing zombies, another person is blamed.  (A character that appears in the original game).  And the ending.  The final boss, (literally the final scene) is different, with a significantly change to the ending. There is one new (and rather large) area that is added to the game, that is a nice addition, but it's just that, an addition, not a whole new world. Other than that, the game, majority of psychopathes and majority of the mall is the same.  You're seeing similar people doing similar things, and fighting similar enemies. So there's really three ways to look at it. If you played Dead Rising 1 and want to play Dead Rising 2, I would recommend Off The Record, over Dead Rising 2. If you played Dead Rising 2, you likely will not want to play Off The Record. If you played Dead Rising 2 but the whole time thought ""I want to play as Frank West"" Then Dead Rising 2 Off the Record is for you. It's not a BAD game, it's fully functional, vastly improves on Dead Rising 2 (You don't have to stand still to talk to Otis, who is not in this version, you get a really functional ear piece as well).  The achievements are better as well, the game works well, and you don't have to constantly return to the hideout to give Zombrex to Katie (what an awful gameplay element that was). If you don't have Dead Rising 2, this is the better version.  If you do... I find it hard to recommend this version as you already have a working game.  It's not a bad, and I can't not recommend Dead Rising 2: Off the Record because it does nothing wrong.  But it is quite a bit of a cash grab for Capcom, and honestly they could have told an all new story.  A shame, because this is a rather fun series.  Still I had a blast replaying Dead Rising 2 as I played it when it first came out, and for that.  Off the Record delivered exactly what it promised.  A retelling of Dead Rising 2 with a new main character.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

 Dead Rising 2: Off the Record Review  Summary  Pretty much this game is still amazing.  You will have plenty of content here to play with compared to Dead Rising 2.  With this you will have Sandbox Mode, a new area to explore, and more combo weapons.  The story may not be canon to the main story but it is still amazing and worth your time.  Even with the game's performance and optimization problems you will still have a great time with it.  Although if you have played Dead Rising 2 and beat it already, it may not be the best value.  Also avoid coop at all costs unless you want frustration.   Pros and Cons   Pros   Great alternative (But non-canon) story with a great twist near the end!  Worth paying attention too.  Still the same amazing Dead Rising 2 base gameplay, but with a new area to explore and more combo weapons. Sandbox mode was added for more challenges to do and a unlimited amount of time to slaughter zombies!  This feels like a more complete experience than Dead Rising 2, having way more options, taking out the non-popular Terror is Reality gamemode and adding in Sandbox Mode and a more complete story.  You won't need to play any of the side games or even the first game to realize what happens after the story or before.  Cons   Poorly optimized, I lag a LOT in the Platinum and Silver strip, going down to 25-30FPS when indoors I get a solid 60. Laughable graphics options, only having the ability to change shadows, atmospheric filtering, and zombie quality. Crashes EVERYWHERE.  The game crashes when you have the wrong audio settings on your PC, it crashes if you have a long name or name with weird characters on Steam.   This may not even be worth the money to you if you have played Dead Rising 2 to death already. Terrible coop.  You will constantly get disconnected and you will be hard pressed to play this game with a friend.Also if you are curious, yes Games for Windows live is gone.Updated for Nomination Badge Thing			",304,70,9,26,23,3,14

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is a stand-alone expansion to Dead Rising 2. It is essentially a response to fans of the series who loved the second game but weren't big fans of the protagonist Chuck Greene and wanted a return of Frank West. In Off the Record you play as Frank West, the protagonist of the original Dead Rising. There are a lot of notable differences the two characters have compared to each other. Frank is a lovable charismatic scoundrel who largely looks out for his own self interest above all else. His animations are also different given how he's much pudgier. You go through mostly the same story and missions as the original, just with Frank instead of Chuck. Frank being the protagonist greatly improves the quality of the story to this game, and it feels like a more natural continuation of the original Dead Rising.The biggest differences between Off the Record and 2 is in the sidequests. The photography minigame from the original returns, alongside a very much improved endless mode. The endless mode is the biggest reason to pick this game up since Dead Rising 2 lacked it. It allows the player to explore Fortune City with no time limit and additional challenges. The user interface is also much improved.If you are a fan of the original Dead Rising 2 I guarantee you'll love Off the Record even more. It's exactly what fans of the series originally wanted and delivers in almost every way. I would even recommend it over the original release due to how similar the two experiences are to each other.One last thing to note is that Capcom graciously patched Games For Windows Live out of both this game and the original Dead Rising 2. So I would greatly recommend the Steam release for it is now the definitive version of the game.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Played this on Xbox and then got it here. I have been doing story mode in CO-OP. This is by far a better game than DR2. This is cannon as far as i am concerned. As I feel Frank is better than Chuck all around. Or they decided to just write him better. But also no get the Zombrix to Katey every day which is annoying. Its also an improvement on the other game as far as the way that you play. Inviting friends does not require the mystic gods to favor you. it works off the steam list. So far no crashing which happened in DR2. But then i played sandbox mode. It has improved so much. No more health ticking down its just a giant world of fun. everything respawns and you just have fun playing whatever you want in the game. Also playable in CO-OP. there are also challenges if you get bored but so far...i don't see it happening. This is worth the 19.99. The sandbox could just be an entire game in itself...now if you don't mind...I'M GOING TO URANUS ZONE!			",298,47,7,39,14,3,13

Taking special photos will earn you exp and in some cases, achievements. The plot is quite similar, except for the endings.Good thing they removed the dead multiplayer TIR and replaced with sandbox mode. This sandbox mode gives infinite time for you to explore the game, in which the original game lacks of.This game also have better UI, an extra area, some extra weapons, and a way better final boss.One thing to note though, I like the original game's protagonist better, especially his appearance and personality.Gameplay-wise, this is better. Plot-wise, I think the original Dead Rising 2 is better.My score: 8/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												This version of Dead Rising 2 prety much includes everything form the original Dead Rising 2 except you play with Frank West, the protagonist of the first one, and the story and events are somewhat different from DR2's protagonist, Chuck.  The feel of the original and second installments are retained but there are several extras in this version including more weapons, outfits, missions, areas to explore and perhaps most important, the return of the Camera function! The only thing missing from the other DR2 game is the TIR mode (which allowed for competition in a Zombie arena against other players to earn cash); In exchange, an unlimited time open sandbox mode has been added where you can complete several objectives all over the map or just have fun exploring, collecting, leveling up, completing achievements, etc. I wouldn't pay much attention to the ratings, this version is the best of the two and IMO definitely worth getting.

												Sanbox much is incredibly fun, no time limit, no obtaining Zombrex for Frank, just pure unhindered fun.If you have a friend, it can be much more fun.The story mode is the exact same from the original Dead Rising 2, just with some minor differences, like the intro, rather than having Frank competing in TIR in the slicycle challenge, you're competing in a wrestling minigame which teaches you the basics of the game and other dialouge in cutscenes. A great change though is the co-op mode.In the original Dead Rising 2, if you had someone join, there would be 2 Chuck Greene's.In DR2 Off the Record, player one is Frank West, player 2 is Chuck Greene and like in Case West, they don't get on well on at all.Example. Frank tries on a new outfit ""I look hot"" and if Chuck is nearby ""You look stupid"".  I'd highly recommend it with a friend.  ",138,29,4,11,8,4,11

Should I buy Dead Rising 2 or Dead Rising 2: Off The Record?This was the question I asked myself and researched about before purchasing this title.  In short, Off The Record is essentially the original Dead Rising 2 with more content, so if you've yet to play the original Dead Rising 2, or simply wish to enjoy the somewhat altered storyline and additional features, choose this title over the original. Pros:+ Zombies. Lots and lots of zombies+ Loads of weapons and weapon combinations+ Leveling system that keeps you going and allows for multiple playthroughs+ A decent sized mall / casino to explore and, you guessed it, kill lots and lots of zombies in+ Sandbox Mode*+ A surprisingly good storyline*Sandbox Mode is a unique feature to the Dead Rising series.  The Storyline timer is removed, allowing for unlimited exploration of Fortune City.  Challenge icons are scattered around Fortune City, rewarding you with either a bronze, silver or gold medal, depending on how well you completed said challenge.  Examples are ""Kill as many zombies as you can in 3 minutes!"" - ""Get from point A to point B as fast as you can!"", or, ""Drink as much alcohol as you can in 5 minutes!"".Sandbox Mode also allows you to carry over your stats to and from Storyline Mode, so if you're having trouble defeating a boss you can simply hop over to Sandbox Mode, level up, and jump back with everything you've gained from Sandbox Mode still intact (other than weapons and items).Middle Ground:~ Controls: Honestly, I'm not too sure how the keyboard and mouse hold up in this title as I've only played with an official Microsoft Xbox 360 controller (wired).  So as far as I can say, the controls via a controller are pretty decent.  Some unique moves are a little tricky to pull off properly at first, requiring awkward combinations of buttons to be pressed.  But the longer you play around with them the easier they become to execute, so the game does have somewhat of a learning curve as far as that goes.~Vehicles: The driving in this game was something I could never get used to; cars specifically.  They seem to go 0 to 60 in a split second, which doesn't work very well in an enclosed area.  Also, as far as I could tell, there isn't a handbrake, which makes trying to hit any sharp turns result in just crashing into the wall in front of you.  But seeing that driving isn't a requirement to complete the game, it's not such a big deal (and it is a lot of fun mowing over hordes of zombies in a sports car!).Cons:- Optimization: One of the biggest complaints I see about this game is it's poor optimization from being ported over from consoles, so the one thing I can recommend that you have in order to play this game somewhat smoothly is a decent CPU.  My GPU is garbage, but because I have a pretty decent CPU, I've had almost no problems from start to finish (other than slight frame sutters in areas with tons of zombies).Additional Thoughts:There is no doubt that the major complaint in this series is the storyline's timer.  Some people either feel too rushed or make the assumption that the game is meant to be 100% completed in one playthrough - the timer is intended to make you feel rushed; it adds urgency that the Sandbox Mode actually takes away.  It keeps you on your toes and forces you to make quick decisions (i.e., should I save that survivor or that one?  Should I go fight that boss or that one?).  This way, each time you play through the game's storyline it will be altered depending on your choices (the game also has multiple endings).Conclusion:I might be a little bias on this title as I absolutely love George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (the Dead Rising series is heavily based off this movie); not only is it my absolute favorite zombie flick, it's also somewhere on my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  So, the concept of running around a zombie infested mall with dozens of weapons at one's disposal has always intrigued me, even before the original Dead Rising title was released.  If you're a fan of that movie, there is no reason for you not to pick up this game.			",149,35,1,18,7,3,12

												There's a certain charm is firing lasers from your eyes; launching fireworks from a lead pipe and slaughtering inordinate amounts of zombies while choosing whatever you want to wear. If you like the idea of a slightly overweight middle aged reporter wearing a summer dress and a mask reminiscent of a LEGO piece; you can do that!The joys of the game come from how stupid the game is. Unlike almost every other zombie game which seeks to take itself seriously, Dead Rising recognises the humour that you can bring to a dark scenario. They don't bother with morbidity in this variation of the story and instead kick it to the curb in favour of juvenile humour. This game might try to tell you it has a ""mature"" age rating; but in actuality that would be like saying that alcohol can only be enjoyed by ""mature"" people. Once you're old enough to buy it, you aren't necessarily wise. The sense of humour is crude and trashy, which is part of the charm. That being said, it isn't much of a game for kids either. There is a copious amount of blood, mutilation and things which some people would say are unsafe for children. But it isn't for ""adults"" either. This is one of those games which isn't overtly mature but isn't something you'd give to a five year old. It's stupid and immature; which is the charm of the series. Dead Rising 1 tried to be serious and was ""okay."" Dead Rising 2 tried to make you care about characters which honestly didn't work for anyone. Off The Record fixes that problem in the same way that Saints Row 2 did. It stops trying to make things serious and meaningful and just says ""why don't we make it fun instead?""Sandbox gives you the ability to just run around indefinitely and without consequence. You don't get forced to give a damn about giving Katie zombrex, you don't have to worry about survivors getting killed. Well, you kind of do but in a whole new way. You get to kill every survivor and you get paid for it. No more ""oh damn I lost that survivor so now I have to load the last save."" It becomes ""sweet, I melted that survivors face off with my god damned laser eyes!"" And in my opinion, that's all the series has needed. It NEEDED that stupidity and to stop caring about being meaningful and serious. If I had to recommend this game for one thing, it'd be for getting rid of any seriousness to it. It became stupid and that took away the thing I found most boring in it. So my advice is that if you're sick of Dead Rising being serious, this is the game you buy. If you want a meaningful and sensible zombie game, then look again. There are plenty of games that try to do that.			",830,199,24,105,88,8,144

												(NO LONGER USES GFWL)I absolutely love all of the Dead Rising games and this is no exception. After playing through Dead Rising 2 back on the 360 I've wanted to buy the PC version of both Dead Rising 2 and Off the Record for a while now. I held off from buying the PC version because of GFWL but now that they've finally removed it I can't recommend this game enough. The frame rate seems to stay at 60+ for the most part but occasionally drops slightly below in certain areas. If you don't mind that then I'd recommend picking both games up if you want a fun/silly zombie game that doesn’t focus on being too serious.  ",374,69,15,26,32,6,34

												I've spent hundreds of hours playing the Dead Rising series, and there are few games like it. Off the Record really has the most going for it. Dead Rising 2 fixed many issues that Dead Rising 1 had, and OtR polishes DR2 even further. It features all of DR2's famous weapons, plus the photography mechanic from DR1. Many dismiss photography as unnecessary to DR's gameplay, and I disagree. It's a comedic and gory game, and being able to take photos of the mayhem you cause and be rewarded for that turns that into a game mechanic. I can't count the times I wished I could have taken a photo of something unapologetically silly in vanilla DR2 and in DR3.Co-op mode is a lot of fun. Use the Invite button on the friends list from the in-game menu to ensure you get the partner you want, as the Play Online option on the main menu seems to be only for joining random people's games. The host player will be Frank West as in the single-player mode, while the client is Chuck Greene from vanilla DR2. Chuck's unarmed special moves are functionally similar to, but different from, Frank's, but that the only real difference to learn. He has a camera like Frank too, of course, so both players can take photos of each other doing outrageous things. There is no voice chat, however, so be ready to use Skype or something if you don't want to have to communicate by jumping and running around in circles. If you haven't played a Dead Rising before, are interested, but are unsure where to begin, I strongly recommend this one over any of the others, including DR3. Should you buy it if you already have DR2? I did, but only because I was buying the PC versions of the games I liked most on 360. For that I am glad it exists, but I wouldn't say there's a point to owning both if you wouldn't already have a reason to own two copies of the same game. It's a lot like when Pokémon comes out with the ""third version"" like Crystal that is both superior to, and essentially the same as, Gold and Silver.One last thing, though: getting it to support controllers is a pain. It has to be a specific version of x360ce. 2.0.2.158 is the one that's working for me and my wired 360 controller, but it doesn't work with my friend's Xbone controller even though it recognizes it.

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is an open world survival horror beat 'em up video game. It is developed by Capcom Vancouver and published by CapcomStory-First of the story is great it is almost exactly the same as Dead Rising 2's story but it has little changes that make it even better! With these little changes former a much bigger picture you uncover a great story that Frank will release to the public.Graphics- the graphics are the same as dead rising 2 which is not a bad thing because dead rising 2 had really good graphics.New stuff- there is a completely new zone called the uranus zone which is a theme park. the zone is really fun and good to explore. they added a new collectable of bank deposit box keys that you can find and open boxes containing money and good weapons with. you also have lots of new combo cards and normal weapons you can slay zombies with. you can battle three new physcopaths which all have a great backstory. you can now also take zombrex outside of the safe house due to you giving it to yourself. You also have the return of the camera which you cna now take photos with! On top of all this you have a new gamemode called sandbox mode where there is no timer and no story just challenges that are unlocked by killing zombies! this mode is great fun! I love it!Sountrack-The soundtrack is perfect in this game. It is one of the best soundtracks in game history!Overall this is not much different from dead rising 2 so if you liked dead rising 2 you will like this. It has jsut enough changes to make it worth buying and is a must buy for true dead rising fans!P.S the reason this review is so short is because I already reviewed dead rising 2 and most things are the same :)			",73,6,3,4,4,0,0

												so many zombies on screen!!!NOTE: this is the exact same thing as dead rising 2, but you play as frank west instead. they also added a free roam sandbox mode to this. the same story still takes place but it is 100% frank west. a few events seem to be mixed up/happen in a different order. a new area is added to the game to explore and perhaps a couple new side missions. there are minor differences in the story. still worth playing though. i own both dr2 and dr2 otr. i enjoy them both very much. if you are someone who doesnt like playing the same game again though, dont get this cause it really isnt different enough.if you havent played either but only want 1, it basically depends if you want fun or story. this version for the fun cause of the sandbox mode and new areas, but the other version (dead rising 2) for a better, more interesting story.this game is an amazing open-worldish zombie apoc survival horror game (minus the horror). grab random sh*t to use as a weapon, combine some of that random sh*t to create even more f**k'd up random sh*t! use this random sh*t to get through hordes of zombies faster and more easily, rescue helpless civilians and bring them back to the main base area, give them weapons (melee or guns) so they can help you out. play through the main game co-op with a friend!PROS:open wordishlots of zombiesgreat graphicscrazy boss fights (crazy humans that lost their marbles)use almost anything as a weaponcrazy combinations create even more crazy weaponsdrive vehiclesplay a grown a** man riding a tricyclebring your daughter toys and zombrex to keep her occupied and happy, and from eating your brainssave civilians and have them aid you in your missionsplay strip poker with in game characters you save (later on)i have not seen any glitches or bugs in this gamethe game runs very smooth even on newer systems (to bad other devs cant seem to pull this off)etcCONS:nothing, notta, none, zilch!PLAY THIS GAME! if you are a zombie fan, that is. 10/10. hope this was helpful to someone			",323,14,2,27,7,0,3

												THIS GAME HAS MANY REPORTS OF POOR PERFORMANCE AND DUBIOUS CONTROLLER COMPATIBILITY IF YOU USE MULTIPLE MONITORS YOU WILL NEED 3RD PARTY SOFTWARE FOR THIS GAME TO RUN REASONABLYI'm running GTX 1080, i7 6700k, 16gb DDR4 ram and on my first run I was getting 5-10 FPS.Was also unable to use controller. Many have reported similar issues with this game.After doing research installed ""Flawless Widescreen"" which has specific plugin for DR2:OTR. This fixed all issues immediately, including controller support. I reccomend that you make sure this program is accessible if you use multiple monitors and otherwise be aware of potential performance issues. Now for the actual reviewThis game is a reimagining of DR2, which is already a good game. The main difference is a new protagonist, Frank West, who also brings with him a new main storyline more in the vein of the first game, and a variety of new/changed encounters and bossfights. Engine imrpovements are good, more zombies on screen and the additional content really finishes up the experience.For those who havent played DR2 or any other DR game, DR2:OTR is vaguely action-RPG mostly about time management. You are put in a mall (leisure resort thing with casinos, theme park, etc) and there are many zombies, and you must survive. You can use most objects of scenery as weapons, although most are fairly ineffective. There are a variety of wacky and fun items but they tend to be least effective as weapons as a trade off for being gruesome or silly. Items can be combined into better weapons, but again the entertaining ones (rocket powered wheelchair) tend to be barely effective in terms of gameplay. Things like Knifegloves or Fire-axe-Sledgehammer will be your go-to. Weapons degrade over time which encourages you to seek out good weaponry or be forced to use impromptu scenery in a pinch.The game is on a time limit, and while you can just survive till it runs out, you'll be given a variety of calls and objectives to go rescue survivors and uncover the conspiracy behind the game. This is the funnest part of the game; getting 2-3 calls on opposite ends of the mall and then dashing between them with survivors in tow to try and get everything done before the calls (and the game) times out. There is a degree of inventory management too, as the best weapons can be hard to produce, and healing items and magazines which provide buffs will take up precious space for weapons.Bossfights are varied and challenging, and show up in just the right numbers to prevent the game from getting boring. Bosses have patterns that must be learned and also vulnerabilities, some of which require getting creative (flamethrower boss can be easily beaten by water which stops his guns, or by cooking oil that sets him alight, or marbles that make him fall over, etc). Bosses also have interesting, if gimmicky characters to them too which can be entertaining or terrifiying. Dead Rising does not take itself overly seriously. Although there are a lot of nasty events, it tends to be weaved with a dark humour throughout most of them. There are some genuinely disturbing scenes (Randy, for instance) but even those tend to be with some sort of wacky scenario.Controls are generally tight but sometimes can be a bit awkward. Unlockable moves have difficult commands on controller (LT, RT, B held for 3 seconds while unequipped) and there is only one attack button (press for standard move, hold for strong attack) which can lead to missed inputs. Attacks tend to auto target enemies too which can lead to missed attacks or accidentally attacking survivors. First person aiming for throwing and ranged weapons can be difficult to use also.Zombies are slow and shambling; no special infected or anything. They are very basic and after a while barely threatening, but the theme of the game is how Frank develops to become a master of improvised zombie fighting, so if anything that is actually really appropriate. Frank will level up from kills, and by taking photographs of zombies, psychopaths and survivors, and by also just completing missions and such. This unlocks new abilites, moves, inventory slots and health slots.Also Online Co-op, although i havent had the oppurtunity to play with a friend recently. It worked very well when the game first came out btu I've heard reports of bad connectivity post-steamworks integration. No promises.Overall, Dead Rising 2 and Off the Record are games close to my heart. They are not like any other game series I can think of, with a very unique gameplay formula that makes them hard to define as a particular genre: action-RPG is a very vague title, I will admit. It is absolutely an RPG and it's easy to put many hours into it, trying to come up with new weapon combos or optimise your times from one area to another. Despite the performance issues (which I have shown how to resolve) the game is fantastic and I can see myself replaying it once or twice in the coming weeks, and then probably some more way off into the future.You will like DR2:OTR if :you like hectic gameplay against the clockyou like rpg-based gameplayyou enjoy wiping out tons of zombiesyou fancy trying out lots of wacky weapon combosyou want a game you can (and will probably have to) replay at least once or twice ",123,22,2,18,11,3,28

												Dead Rising 2: Off The Record is basically Dead Rising 2 all over again (as the title suggests) but with some little changes here and there on how the story progresses, you can play as Frank West again, and in co-op your friends can play as Chuck Greene (the protagonist from the previous game).And even though the story and cutscenes are basically unchanged from the original game, Off The Record has some new content to offer, such as:- New weapons, new combo weapons, new clothes, new food items, new psychopaths, a new place to explore, a new ending and some rebalancing;- All the DLC from Dead Rising 2 is already included;- The re-addition of cameras so you can take funny pictures and share them with your co-op buddies;- A checkpoint system to remove even further the necessity of loading old save files; - Even more zombies on screen and some other minimal graphical changes.(These may actually decrease performance in some older PCs);- And last but not least, the ""Sandbox Mode"". This replaces the ""Terror is Reality"" game mode from Dead Rising 2. Sandbox Mode has absolutely no time limits, so you can do whatever you feel like doing! It also adds challenges for you to complete alone or with a friend, crazy survivors that attack you, and occasionally a psychopath will spawn just to keep things fresh.You're also able to share your progress directly with Story Mode, so if you're having a hard time progressing through some missions, you can just level up in Sandbox Mode and then go back to the main game.If you loved Dead Rising 2 and want more out of it or you just never even touched a game from this series, then this is certainly for you! But if you're looking for a completely different experience, then you might just pass on this one. PS: The game has been updated with trading cards, achievements, and now it uses Steamworks instead of Games For Windows Live.You can also import your older saves to this new version but unfortunately the achievements won't be carried over.If your save file is ""corrupted"" after importing to the new version, don't worry.Just follow the instructions presented in this discussion:https://steamcommunity.com/app/45770/discussions/0/615086038681380025/...And you should be good to go!

												Since Capcom will probably never release the first Dead Rising on PC this one will have to do. It has all the things that made Dead Rising great put into this Off the Record. Along with tweaks to animations, combat, and AI from the first. However, I do think this one lacks the charm and feel that the first one had. The atmosphere just isn't on par. The boss fights lack the unique characterization from DR1, the music seems to not have the same flair either; some tracks just come off generic sometimes. The combat retained the same kind of problems that one had, and getting stuck in a stun animation from a boss never felt more annoying; and the damage limiter that they implemented to how much bosses can get hurt from constant player attack is not a great thing either. Only about three bosses made me feel invested and not frustrated; and this was at higher player levels too. I can't help the feeling that anything interesting about this game is just a carry over from the first; but there are some meaningful additions that feel like natural and fit into the whole game. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great game and I had a lot of fun. It's still Dead Rising at heart, and still a unique and fun experience; there is just something missing, but that's just me. If you never got the chance to play Dead Rising on Xbox 360 and really wanna try it, but can't for whatever reason, then I suggest you pick this one up for sure. Sadly this one isn't canon to the story, but rather a ""what if"" unlike the original Dead Rising 2. However that shouldn't push you away from it.			",241,13,4,7,14,2,13

												(I played this on PS3.)If you are wondering which to buy, Dead Rising 2 or Dead Rising 2: Off The Record then go with this. Story is pretty much the same as  Dead Rising 2. There is a few diffrences but only minor.  It's a fun game, but does have problems. Off The Record does contain ""Sandbox"" mode which is pretty fun for a while, but dies down after a couple hours of play time. Killing zombies if lots of fun and so is exploring the world and the diffrent weapons and how they work. You can also craft weapons such as a baseball bat with nails ect. Overall I would recommend this game, but not at full price. Wait for it to go on sale.			",141,12,0,18,9,2,12

												A worthy and funny extension to the original game, that brings more to the table almost everywhere. More enjoyable narrative, a charismatic lead character, better narrative, more weapons and more madness. A long awaited and wanted sandbox mode, where time doesn't matter and you can just go around and fool with weapons and zombies.When playing with a friend it gets even better, since the second player controls Chuck that allows for several moments of memorable dialouges, funny remarks between the two characters.If you liked the original Dead Risign 2, this is a must get for you, you are going to find more content here. If you are hesitating between the original and off the record, forget the original one, go for this. And most importantly find a friend who is tagging along for the whole ride. You won't regret it.

												Wow, where do I start? I had this game on Xbox 360 and I saw that this game was on sale along with DR2 and DR3 I got everything Dead Rising and I played Dead Rising 1-3 on Xbox 360/One so back to this review. I totally fully recommend this game, especially if you also have a friend that plays it, you have countless hours of fun. Or you could play the story which is pretty fun too if Rebecca wouldn't take her sweet time getting to the gate on Case 1-3, the thing is though the story does not fit with the story what so ever. If you compare it with Dead Rising 2 SPOILER ALERT Katey dies from Zombrex withdraw if you don't get it which is not the official ending, Dead Rising 3 Katey is still alive so Dead Rising 2 Off The Record is in another universe. OK SPOILER ENDS HERE in sandbox mode you can explore and fight zombies to get prestige points and level up, and also test your skill by fighting different psycopaths and just have fun with friends, family, or just play this by yourself. Other than the story thing I totally recommend this game, oh and also... FRANK WEST IS THE PLAYABLE CHARACTER!!!!			",46,4,0,6,6,0,2

												He's covered wars y'know? Frank West is back, and he is fatter and more out of shape than ever! This game takes the prestine gameplay of Dead Rising 2, and spices it up with a bit of Frank West. In this game, you play in an alternate ""what if"" version of Dead Rising 2, where you play as everyones favorite fighting (ex-)photojournalist Frank West. It depicts Frank after the Willimette mall incident, having become overweight and bankrupt, due to the overexposure to the limelight. He is participating in the Terror Is Reality zombie killing game show, in order to net some cash, and get himself back on the map. Unfortunately, there seems to be trouble brewing in the bowels of Fortune City, as Frank finds himself in the middle of another Zombie outbreak. It is up to you, as Frank, to find the truth, and save as many survivors as you can. The gameplay is identical to that of Dead Rising 2, with a few improvements to animation, as well as more missions, bosses, and ways to kill. There is nothing but praise I can give to this game, try it out for yourself, you won't regret it. Dead Rising 2: Off The Record gets an 8.5/10. This game lost a point due to a few side missions that glitched for me, making them unplayable.			",64,3,2,2,0,0,0

												Basically just Dead Rising 2 with Frank West in it. But it is great they didn't just do a reskin and call it a day. They improved on the original game in which they added a whole new area redid the cutscenes created a semi new story in which Frank fits in and accurately depicts Franks downfall after fame. They made Frank fat and worndown and this is honestly perfect for the portrayal of this broken down character. Framerate can tank if you don't have a good PC and even with a good PC the framerate still doesn't like to stay at 60.They increased the amount of zombies on screen which you would think is a good thing but for smooth gameplay not so much.

												Never played a Dead Rising game before, only having watched videos and such, I felt I had what I needed to give this game a try.I spend hours just goofing around in the sandbox mode killing zombies in many hilarious ways as I was rushing to get to Uranus Zone. I had a huge grin on my face the entire time and could not find a single flaw.Feeling I had got the knowledge I needed to play the game properly I start up the story mode, ready to take it on only to have the difficulty curve hit, and I still loved it.This game has the perfect mix of challenge and fun; the time limits are not there as demands but more like suggestions of what you could be doing.As these time limits have been given the wrong impression that they all have to be done on the very first play though, and you have to do it all perfectly the first time.Missing a deadline besides the main case, and getting Zombrex has no consequences for the game or the story and everything can be played out regardless.Escorting survivors can be a bit frustrating, but when you finally get them to safety it’s a gratifying rush.When they die, you shrug it off and carry on as escorting the survivors does nothing for the games story in any way. (Ever really seen a zombie movie where all survivors make it?)You might miss out on some experience points but they can be gained in many other ways.If anything it gives you reasons to play again in new game plus to see if you can do better than last time.You can even grind a few levels in Sandbox mode and carry all of it over to the main game if you so desire.But if all else fails, Sandbox is still there giving you a chance to roam around at your leisure, just messing around with some zombies with no time constraints.This Dead Rising has everything it needs to be the best game.Challenges to keep you on your feet, sandbox mode to blow off some steam, combo weapons that are insanely fun to use, take pictures of it all.Talking about pictures, the very best part of this game, it has the Real Frank West in it.

My personal view over Dead Rising 2: Off the RecordHow should I start this review? I have literally nothing bad to say about this game.This must be one of my favorite game series so far, I've been playing a lot of different zombie games and nothing can beat this game. I always have so much fun when I play co-op, there's so much to do and play around with in sandbox mode. You can basically do whatever you wanna do, like me... eat all pies you can find and then throw it up.There's a lot to explore and there's so many funny ways to kill zombies/humans.I remember the first time playing this, I fell in love with it instantly. I've always been that kind of person that loves to mess around while killing zombie, so this is just perfect.The graphic is awesome, not like those simple animated creations you make in class.Everything is so detailed and I've never been bothered by it. The music is great as well, It was a bit intence but still enjoyable.Would I recommend it?Yeah, no doubt. Some people complain that the game doesn't support controllers.I don't really have a problem with it but If you do have a issue with it, sorry.I always find it intresting to try things out the hard way, some things might be difficult to do with a keyboard and mouse compared to a controller. But anyway, the game can be fun no matter how you decide to play it.This is a really good game to play with your friend if you like to be silly, create weapons and have a good laugh.That's what I've been experienced. The money you'll be spending on it is definitely worth it.9.5/10			",160,60,3,7,16,1,16

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record adds a lot of new content to what the original Dead Rising 2 brought to the table.  I think it's a great treat for fans of Frank West and arguably would've worked better had it been the canon game. One of the big things that urks me is the removal of the watch, which blends time telling/survivor missions with the map screen.  This isn't enough for me to say the game is bad in any respect, but it does forshadow the direction they took with Dead Rising 3 (which is a game I'm not a fan of, read my review of it if you like).There are a lot of good things too, like the Uranus Zone, a couple of awesome new psychopaths that make this game really worth it, and the return of the Camera feature from the first game.Overall it's a great game that, although seems like glorified DLC at times, is worth playing if you're a fan of the series.8/10			",299,60,8,27,26,4,10

												Basically just Dead Rising 2 with Frank West in it. But it is great they didn't just do a reskin and call it a day. They improved on the original game in which they added a whole new area redid the cutscenes created a semi new story in which Frank fits in and accurately depicts Franks downfall after fame. They made Frank fat and worndown and this is honestly perfect for the portrayal of this broken down character. Framerate can tank if you don't have a good PC and even with a good PC the framerate still doesn't like to stay at 60.They increased the amount of zombies on screen which you would think is a good thing but for smooth gameplay not so much.

												Quick! Take the closest thing to you and bash a zombies head in with it! A park bench? A cash register? maybe a clothes hanger? how about some boxing gloves? a box of nails? This can all be done with the creativity of Dead Rising 2: Off the Record.A quick way to describe this game: An open world sandbox game (with a story) where you can take anything from inside of a mall/casino city and use it to kill zombies! From guns, to swords, to potted plants. TVs, stuffed teddy bears, and yes... Even a vibrator. Use it all to kill kill kill!Out of all of the games in the series, this one feels the most polished and fun. It's a rehash of Dead Rising 2, but with the protagonist of the first game, Frank West (who I honestly prefer. Chuck is cool, but come on. Frank is FAAAANTASTIC.). This game basically takes Dead Rising 2 and expands upon it by adding a new area, a different plot twist, and fixes/tweaks the problems with Dead Rising 2. I cannot recommend Dead Rising 2: Off the Record enough! If it's on sale, do yourself a favor and get this game. You wont regret it!			",40,3,0,1,4,2,2

												This a long overdue review anyway This game is easily one of the best zombie coop games and best zombie game series Dead rising 1 being the best of course.There are only minor problems ones that dont even distrubt gameplay but everything else is amazing this is much more worth it then buying Dead rising 2 this game has much more content then Dead rising 2.More weapons,bigger map,more side missions and the coop is much more better also dont forget sandbox mode(made for people who suck at being timed to do a bunch of stuff).Overall this is and was one of the best Dead rising games on steam and i recommend any one to buy this game and the 1st dont waste your money on 3 or 2.

												Should you buy this or Dead Rising 2? well here are a few of the differences between the two:-In OTR you don't have to run back to the safehouse to give your daughter zombrex, since you don't have one. Instead you give it to yourself at any place on the map.-You're Frank West, he has more personality than Chuck Greene and he has a camera which you can use to help level up.-Bosses in OTR have damage peaks meaning that you can't just keep wailing away at a boss and have them die quickly. The damage you do now goes down by half every hit after the first one.-More combo weapons and a new area ""Uranus Zone"" also 2 new bosses which are pretty cool.-The story is different, especially around the end of the game.-Looking at your watch now pauses the game which it didn't do in DR2, and the map is on the same screen as your watch and you can now set waypoints, which makes things more convenient.-Money has more of a purpose now, not going to spoil why, but grab as much as you can!Other stuff to note:-From my experience, controllers do not work with OTR.-Runs good even on max settings.-Some people can't get co-op to work but I have never tried it so do some research on it if you plan on playing with a friend.Overall: great game, I would give it a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so much better than the original Dead Rising in pretty much every aspect. Gameplay is more fun because of the bigger variety in weapons, the combat feels less clunky overall, the game has a better setting making it more fun to explore the area and there is more variety to the environments visually and there is a much higher level of interaction with the world with just more items to interact with in general. The survivors ai is by far the biggest improvement, it’s actually good. They follow you pretty well and their pathfinding is pretty good too. I hated Frank West in the original but In this game he is far less annoying and cringe worthy making him at least bearable. The dialogue, voiceacting and plot is also now bearable which it wasn’t in the original for me. It’s not a good story by any means but it is far better than the original. I think this is a good and very fun zombie game. It’s one of those sequels that does exactly what sequels should do which is improve on every aspect of the original. 7/10 (Good)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												After seeing the trailer for dead rising 4 I felt let down, the visuals were too murky and it all seemed so far removed from where the game started. However, due to Dead rising 1 not being available on steam, I decided I'd get Dead rising 2 instead, but then ofc I remembered that off the record existed and opted to purchase this as it retains the best content from both games as well as new areas to explore.If you, like me, played dead rising 1 and 2 to death to the point you can remember most of it, and want to re-live that bright, zombie filled carnage of an experience again, but with an air of freshness then Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is the ultimate Dead Rising Experience available to date.

												Is it Dead Rising 2 reloaded for $20? Yes. There is a fun twist that may or may not justify the purchase while it is heavily discounted, which is when I bought it. It also looks better than I remember. I would probably think of it a lot more negatively if I bought it for full price. If you ever think about replaying Dead Rising 2 it is different enough while being essentially the same exact thing.P.S. If you are using the windows 360 controller, or any controller possibly, make sure it is on before you initiate the program. It registers X as pressed for some reason when turned on after. Automatic weapons, or percentage weapons (e.g. fire extinguisher or spray paint), will fire until empty and you will do a power attack after coming back from every pause or load screen.

												The game is slow to start, but for a reason.  It takes some time to figure out how best to progress but this game is pretty good ridiculous fun.  A motorized wheelchair with assault rifles attached?  Yes please.  I didn't figure out that the sandbox mode rewards carry over to your single player game, if I had I may not have restarted the story (which allows you to carry all skills and your level back to the beginning, making for a faster run).  At the same time, restarting the story is actually a necessity to finishing all the sidequests in the story.If you like zombie smashers with a sense of humor, this is for you.

												This game is a stand-alone expansion to Dead Rising 2, and it comes with some welcome improvements. It brings back an option to take photos to gain XP, and many of Frank's wrestling moves from Dead Rising 1 return in OTR. The one area that takes a hit is the seriousness of the plot, but if you're playing Dead Rising for a gritty realistic plot, you're probably doing it wrong. Some of the jokes in this game only work if you're familiar with the plot of DR2, but I wouldn't really advise playing both DR2 and DR2 OTR.OTR also has some different boss battles, new combo weapons, new costumes, and a few small new areas.If you want to play a DR2, buy this one, not DR2. Of course, while this is an improved DR2, DR3 is leaps and bounds ahead of it in terms of gameplay, storytelling, and overall fun.As a sidenote: This got ported from GFWL, for which I applaud Capcom. That made it playable. That said, I don't think the keyboard and mouse configuration is at all playable with the quicktime events in this game, and it failed to recognize my MS Xbox 360 wireless controller (which worked fine with DR3), so... maybe wait until they patch that.

												So far, I've gotten a good way through this game. Admittedly, I've enjoyed it. It's certainly a spoof off of Dead Rising 2, as there are certainly nods and hints in many ways that Chuck is certainly not the hero of this game. Rather, Frank West is. And it's a fun, welcomed addition. Combat is still the same, and some of the same bosses and enemies return. The game does follow a similar route to that of Dead Rising 2, but there are enough little tweeks and add ons that keep the game fun and interesting.Especially if you're playing co-op. Sitting back with a good buddy and having a good ole time smashing zombies never gets old!			",143,24,2,14,13,0,11

												(8 out of 10)Dead Rising 1 is besides Left 4 Dead 1, my most favorite zombie game. Dead Rising 1 is only available on Xbox360, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record (an expanded alternate version of DR2) is the next best thing to it. If you love wacky openworld games like Saints Row, you can certainly enjoy this one too. There are hundreds of silly weapon combinations to maw down the shambling undead horde.

												Make whatever the hell weapon you want and either beat a zombie to death with it or shove it up its♥♥♥♥♥ This is the zombie genre at it's finest, a game that doesn't take itself seriously at all and lets you kill thousands of zombies with a ""vibrator"" if you want to. Add a few of psychopathic bosses, the ability to make hundreds of ridiculous weapons, a main character who makes the cheesiest lines imaginable, wrestling moves, strip poker, a big world full of interactable little morsels, infinite zombies, a sandbox mode and co-op to top it all off, you get the perfect arcade zombie game that will last you hours!However I have a few of gripes:- The main story is Timed, that includes each individual mission, don't complete a main mission in time and the game is over. There is a sandbox mode but all you can do in that mode is kill zombies and do some crappy challenges. - There are a few glitches, if you have a soundcard in your system you may need to lower your sound quality in the control panel to start the game up, why? Capcom that's why. (Search the fix on google if your game crashes on startup) - There are also some odd graphical glitches that don't affect gameplay but just look weird and sometimes your character will decide to move in a certain direction until you press that direction on your keyboard. - Unfortunately this game has a few QTE's, you'll have to deal with them, at least they don't kill you instantly.- Finally the last boss fight is terrible, a badly placed checkpoint if you fail, you can only use the weapons and health items you pick up, you have to constantly heal someone otherwise you fail and more QTE's, QTE's everywhere! Seriously it sucks.But hey, at least you know what you are getting yourself into now. Hopefully you won't find these problems too annoying and you can get back to attaching chainsaws to your motorcycle and mowing down hundreds of zombies in the Silver Strip. Also, fear not, this game uses Steamworks now not Games For Windows Live.10/10 would play again, multiple times.			",350,45,4,29,17,3,32

												This game is a stand-alone expansion to Dead Rising 2, and it comes with some welcome improvements. It brings back an option to take photos to gain XP, and many of Frank's wrestling moves from Dead Rising 1 return in OTR. The one area that takes a hit is the seriousness of the plot, but if you're playing Dead Rising for a gritty realistic plot, you're probably doing it wrong. Some of the jokes in this game only work if you're familiar with the plot of DR2, but I wouldn't really advise playing both DR2 and DR2 OTR.OTR also has some different boss battles, new combo weapons, new costumes, and a few small new areas.If you want to play a DR2, buy this one, not DR2. Of course, while this is an improved DR2, DR3 is leaps and bounds ahead of it in terms of gameplay, storytelling, and overall fun.As a sidenote: This got ported from GFWL, for which I applaud Capcom. That made it playable.

												This is a fairly good update to Dead Rising 2 and arguable the best entry in the series next to Dead Rising 1. It's my favourite entry and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves killing zombies. Be warned that the co-op is still spotty so getting those co-op achievements may not be possible for you.If you're worried about choosing between regular Dead Rising 2 or Off The Record, you're much better off going with Off The Record as it has received several gameplay enhancements. This ranges from the addition/return of photography, new weapons, a new area to explore down to little things such as removing a few of the minor annoyances. 2's only real advantage is that it is canon while OTR is a ""what if"" game so you might want to play it before 3. The two are put on sale together in a bundle fairly often so you may just want to grab both anyway. If you already own Dead Rising 2 and can't decide if it's worth the upgrade, I'd say it's worth the $5-$10 it usually goes for if you got a good amount of hours out of 2 and if you want more.

												Great game but OCD types need not apply. Just accept that you'll never save everyone or do everything in one playthrough and you'll be fine. Some people don't like the time limits, but it adds urgency to the game. If you lose the story due to a timer, you probably deserved it so don't worry about that. They're much more lenient than DR1.Sandbox mode is nice. You can do challenges and earn money and experience that transfers over to your story mode game. And you're going to need it.If you're looking for a humorous zombie flick, you can't go wrong here, though I like Chuck Green's story better. It was far more personal. ",223,32,2,45,10,0,13

												I have played all the Dead Rising games. After I played the first one on the Xbox 360, I have loved Frank West as a character. When Dead Rising 2 came out, a part of me was sad that Frank wasn't in it, but Chuck Greene was a great protaganist also. When I heard that they made a Dead Rising 2 with Frank West as the protagnist, I thought Capcom was high on something tropical. The game itself is Dead Rising 2 with small changes and fixes and all new kinky Alien amusement park. Frank is now your protagnist, with Chuck being your co-op partner and having a part in a side-mission as well. Certian Characters have changed roles but in all much hasn't changed. You can still tell its Dead Rising 2 but enough has changed to keep you going.The game is great if you wanted more slapping zombies with adult toys and wanting to take pictures of you throwing said adult toys at a midget clown on stilts.The game is great if you don't care for Dead Rising 3 all that much but don't want to keep playing Dead Rising 2.

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is fun game, same as Dead Rising 2, but with Frank West as the character you play from Dead Rising 1. A few new combo weapson, a few differences in story, but still the same fun game, and you get to kill Chuck Green from Dead Rising 2, ha. There are a ton of reviews that go into detail, but if you a fun game that you can kills zombies with normal weapons like a bat, combo weapons such knife gloves, some funny, some pointless, some very descrutive, drive a motocylce, car, a hummer, a motocycle with chainsaws attached, a golf cart, eat food for health, make mixed drinks for different options, very fun, story mode, sandbox mode, co op mode, different things you can break, people you can recuse or not. Also you level up from earning PP by doing things, carry quite a few items once you have leveled up. etc read a better review if you want, but I recommend this game.			",12,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some misconceptions I want to immediately clear up.Yes, this game DOES have working co-op.Yes, this game DOES support controllers, with a bit of tweaking.But no, the DLC does NOT work.A lot of people are either lying in their reviews, or aren't setting their game up properly. This is just a pretty crappy port, is all. A bit of tweaking here and there, and it runs perfectly.I'm playing with an Xbox One controller, with my friend in Co-op allot recently. So the whole ""No controllers, and no Co-op"" thing is just completely subjective on whether or not you're competent enough to get the game working properly.However, I'm not reviewing the port, I'm reviewing the game, and the game is the best Dead Rising there is.

												A pretty bad port of the console version.The game itself was awesome and I had a blast with it.However even though it was developed primarily for consoles, it has no controller support for windows, and the keys can't be changed without editing some config files. Also some keys are bound in the code to specific keys, so even though you may have changed the config file, they still may not work as expected.The photo mechanic that was in the original Dead Rising is back, however it seems kind of tacked on as the PP amounts have been nerfed hard vs the original game.Fortunately the volume issue present in the normal Dead Rising 2 has been fixed.It has a coop mode that still has the odd person around to play with, although everyone I managed to play with was kind of laggy.I'm sad that Capcom won't rerelease it without GFWL, but considering how lazy of a port it was, I totally understand their position.Play it while you still can!

												This game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing great.I can't accurately compare it to the normal version of Dead Rising 2 because I've only seen a small amount of gameplay, from what I gather it's almost identical to Dead Rising 2 but you play as Frank ""I've Covered Wars, You Know"" West, and there's also less dark and gritty nonsense. Also you don't need to grab Zombrex and then trail all the way back to the safehouse to give it to someone else, because in this game you're the one who's infected, so you can take Zombrex wherever you want.However it doesn't natively recognise unofficial xinput controllers, and you need to jump through a few hoops to get them working (there's a topic about it in the forums), and people also claim to be having issues with the downloadable content, but I havn't bought any so it doesn't matter to me.Wear womens clothes if you ♥♥♥♥ing want to / 10			",429,79,10,64,71,4,55

												>takes picture of 4 toy anal probes>gets 1800 erotica picture points and 2 achievementsez pz-------------------------------------------------------------~SERIOUS REVIEW~Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is a great game, with only a few flaws that keep it from being the best game ever.NOTE: this review is for the Xbox 360 version since my pc is incredibly laggy while playing, and I have put many, many hours into the Xbox port. So, i'm just going to assume that both versions are identical.-PLOT-You are Frank West, hero and survivor of the infamous Willamette zombie outbrreak.  Having written a book about it, and  getting YOUR OWN FUC**** TV SHOW, just about you, you are very famous. But one day, that fame is lost, your show has had the plug pulled. You are watching TV, when you see a show called ''Terror Is Reality'' in which contestants earn money for killing thousands of zombies. You think to yourself ''This is my chance to get back in the game!''.So, for the very beginning of the game, you are pitted against zombies in a wrestling ring and have to kill as many as you can. Once you have won and collected ''THA BIG MONAYYY'', you decide to grab some Zombrex (a drug that stops you from becoming a zombie, spoilers) and head home. However, when you take the elevator, there is a nasty tumble and you pass out. When you awake from your sleep , there are alarms and sirens going off ,screams, and groans. You attempt to wedge open the lift door with all your strength. You can see... *sarcastic gasp* Zombies! To which Frank replies, ''Oh no.'' Just as a certain zombie comes towards you, a running man fortunately runs in front of the zombie, and dies, saving your life. You run out of the arena, into a shelter, along with other survivors. A woman, Stacey, tells you that there is some Zombrex in a nearby plaza. After teaching some looters a lesson, you find a pharmacist (which you take back to the shelter) and some Zombrex. At about 8pm, you go back to the shelter and watch a news report about the incident. Feeling inspired, you must uncover the truth about the outbreak (while brutally murdering thousands upon thousands of zombies), escort innocent survivors, find Zombrex (or buy it for 25 grand) and (hopefully) get back in the game!-PRESENTATION-The game looks relatively good. Survivors look like survivors, and Frank looks like, well, Frank West at the age of fourty-one. Where the graphics are mixed, though are the zombies. They look okay at first, but when you play the game more and more, it seems like you've killed a zombie's 119th COMPLETELY IDENTICAL twin. But where the zombies shine, though, are the amount there are. I mean, JESUS, if you have a powerful pc, you can have a thousand zombies on screen before it even drops 1 frame. Even the console ports look good, but i'm saying ''good'' becuz #pcmasterrace :B1: .-GAMEPLAY-There are two modes: Story Mode, the mode where♥♥♥♥♥♥actually happens, and Sandbox Mode, which has no plot (kinda), complete freedom,and NO ♥♥♥♥ING DRAINING HEALTH BAR FROM INFINITY MODE MY GOD THAT WAS COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T IN THE FIRST GAM- *cough* and no draining health bar.New to the mix, are combo weapons. Rather simple, but COMPLETELY NECCESSARY. Examples: Baseball bat+ box o' nails = Spikey bat, Torch + Gems= HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥A LIGHTSABER. Simple. Other than that, it's the same run of the mill as the first game: escort idiotic (but slightly better in this game) survivors to a safehouse, get PP, woohoo, do a case mission, get progression in the capcom-tier story, woohoo.Like the first game, there are Psychopaths, which are the game's bosses. Some are easy, some are hard, some are required, some are optional, some are disgusting, some you want a statue of, lar lar lar, lar.There's one thing that bugs me though. The same as the first game. THE DIFFICULTY. While it's the complete opposite of  the first game, it's still a problem. Dead Rising 1: OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS THE 2006 VERSION OF SUPER MEAT BOY ON STEROIDS. Dead Rising 2: Off the Record: *grooooooooooooooooooooooooooooan* tooooooooooo easyyyyyyyy. psychopaths are ok though.-CONCLUSION- Look past the incredibly easy difficulty, and you have a great game. Don't like plots and time limits like me? There's Sandbox Mode, the godsend from Capcom's usually faulty brain. Want something to do?  There's challenges and the normal story mode. I'll also note that I wouldn't buy this if you have the original DR2.On a scale of one to ten, this gets a well deserved eight out of ten.  Get it if you have a great PC, it'll be worth the money. Don't have a powerful pc? Get the console port for PS3 and Xbox 360.I hope you enjoyed my review, and it  made you make up your mind about purchasing the game or not.-pixar900			",97,11,5,6,4,4,5

												amazing game. best game in deadrising series in my opinion. an improvment on the origional dead rising 2 in terms of gameplay but a downgrade in terms of story. the game does become a million more times fun in co op but not at all required. other than some very mild optimization issues with the graphics and some non game breaking bugs (mostly just funny ones) the game is the best and most entertaining zombie game to date.note: i have played all dead rising games just on console, and i would estimate my total time on this title accross all consoles would be about 20 hours			",66,6,4,8,5,1,0

												I thought this was going to be another Short Dead Rising ""spin-off"" type of thing like Case West or whatever. This is kinda like that, but it is actually a full scale Dead Rising 2, but if Frank West took Chuck's place. You should play Dead Rising 2 first and then play this.

												This is my first foray into the Dead Rising series, so I can't really compare it to the others. I am also writing this review as I nominated it for the ""Villain most in need of a hug"" award, because there are so many characters in this game that need to find Jesus (or equivalent) haha!This particular game is a 3rd person adventure that takes place in Fortune City, a fictionalised place loosely based on Las Vegas with casinos, lights, and odd characters galore. Unfortunately however, a zombie outbreak occurs! Curiously, this is one of the few zombie games I've played where the zombies themselves are known about and already exist in the in-game world. So much so, that there is even a pharmaceutical drug called Zombrex that infected people in everyday life have to take to avoid becoming a zombie. However like I said, it gets a bit out of hand and the zombie situation spills beyond containable levels in the city. You being reporter Frank West, need to get to the bottom of this by getting out and about, leaving the sanctuary of your shelter.The game itself is very fun, with a semi-cliche, but serviceable plot. The slighty cheesiness of the plot actually adds to the game, given it's one that clearly doesn't take itself too seriously. One of the trademarks of this game is that you can craft a huge variety of sometimes ridiculous weapons from materials found around the map. Your character will eventually collect new recipes as you progress, but you can also discover them by just experimenting. You can hit a zombie with a bucket, or use an electric powerdrill on it, or you can combine them to create a 'brain bucket' that minces any unfortunate zombie you make wear it. There's also a wide variety of different clothing combinations your character can pick up around the map.There's also LOTS of zombies, but on the whole, they're quite docile. You, and more likely your NPC partners that follow you in parts of the game, can still get mobbed, but the massive hoard of zombies (at least initially) are fairly slow compared to some other games. At least initially anyway...There's also quite a number of boss-like fights either as part of the main story or side-plots or events (known as Psychopaths). I found there to be a good variety between them, and some of the Psychopaths in particular are hilarious (my favourite being the Postman and Randy). Unfortunately, the game isn't exactly without issues. It sometimes feels a bit clunky, and while technically open world, you actually get put under time pressure in the story mode if you want to do everything that comes up (and there's quite a few things). There is a sandbox mode to address this somewhat though which is nice, but not quite the same as a story mode with slightly more flexible timing in my opinion.Also, apparently this game used to rely on GWFL, and when it was moved off that, all the DLC stopped working/appearing and this issue was never fixed. While the DLC doesn't seem to be a big deal, this kind of laziness doesn't really put the game in good light.Overall though, I had fun with this game and would still recommend it. It usually falls to quite low prices, so be sure to get it on sale!			",357,78,12,46,44,10,57

												Essentially the ultimate version of Dead Rising 2 with extra areas, weapons, physcopaths and a slightly new story, and what I consider the best Dead Rising game in the series, more polished than Dead Rising 1, and less serious and more fun than Dead Rising 3. While not the perfect game a lot of fun can be had between the decent size story mode and the challenges in sandbox mode especially if you can play co-op with a friend, with the drop in/out mode working very well most of the time.Overall if you enjoy crazy combo weapons, insane boss fights and mowing down countless zombies with whatever you can get your hands on you will enjoy Dead Rising 2: Off The Record.Edit: Nominated game for test of time award as I believe this game is really fun to come back too and play over and over.

												So, I have been a fan of the series for quite some time. When I was younger, I had a PS3 and really wanted to get an Xbox 360 just to play Dead Rising 1. Dead Rising 1 was absolutely amazing and I loved everything about it. I also pre-ordered Dead Rising 2 for the PS3 when it came out. Dead Rising 2 was good and added a larger mall, combo weapons, and many more secrets and hidden items. And it all comes down to this game, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record. This has improved a bit from Dead Rising 2 by including even more combo weapons, a new vehicle, and my favorite feature, the protagonist as Frank West. Frank actually put on a few pounds after the 5-6 years between the Willamette outbreak and the second Fortune City outbreak. But, this game is a great game to get even for its old release date. If you want to get a good idea about the story, you should maybe start out with Dead Rising 1 or 2. But buy this game if you want to have a lot of fun killing zombies and playing co-op. What is also a great reason to purchase this game is that yesterday it got Steamworks!!!! So you can just join your friends through Steam instead of GFWL (Games for Windows Live). Overall, this is amazing game to get started on the series with, and I will give it a 9/10 because of how much it improved switching to Steamworks. Buy this game whenever it goes on sale and you will have A LOT of fun.			",193,14,9,8,9,2,3

												first problem out of the way : ''full controller support'' doesnt support ps4 buttons, liarthe game is updated to run at higher visuals than the ps3 version and higher FPS,it looks nice but other than that is the EXACT SAME.pro's :1) the weird weapon combinations and creative ways you can kill zombies with2) has a sandbox mode to just mess around in, but story is co-op much like the sandbox3) has a story mode with some nice concepts you would expect in a zombie setting, like psycho's, people in distress. liars, exposition, money hungry villain, and simply a duo that refuses to join you untill you decide who made the better joke.4) leveling up gives you nice rewards like inventory space,health, and skills you can use to make yourself better equipped for fighting everything out there.5) the co-op mode is where the real fun is for me, just cause mayhem in all the ways possible and kill everything in sight,though repetetive, still funcons :1) after you've used all the weapon combinations in sandbox mode with your friend, the meat and bones of the game is done. so try storymode, its not as dragging on as most games are.2) repetetive, but stays fun longer thanks to the story mode and objectives you can do on the map, i reset game if i fail to escort a survivor since i want to save them all.3) the start of the game is rather slow and frank moves rather sluggishstill a fun game, and if you've played it on console and want to give it a go with better graphic settings, id recommend it7/10			",176,12,0,18,9,2,7

												Had this since release on XBox, and on PC, it's soooooo much better. Not to mention, when you beat the game, hit 50 and start to get bored, you can always mod and create your own weapons! Modding this game for simple things, such as custom weapon placements, custom doors/teleports, modding weapon damage + ammo is easy, and fun as sin.Personally, I threw an unbreakable skateboard and a skating magazine in my safehouse. Skating is fun as balls.Next up: Filling my inventory with orange juice and a battleaxe and Dark Souls invading innocent playersNo but in all seriousness, I figured I should update this: It appears that there is a glitch where purchased DLC does not appear in yoru DLC locker in your safe house. I've only met one person with this problem, out of all my friends who play (and own the DLC.)  I will update this later with a possible fix. If anyone reads this and happens to know anything, post below! Thanks!			",317,71,7,36,14,6,21

Dead Rising 2: Off the RecordThe game is a 'what-if' version of the original Dead Rising 2. What if Frank West took over the place of Chuck Greene?Well this game will give you the answer!Frank West, the main protagonist of Dead Rising 1 will return and save the fortune city whilst uncovering the truth behind the outbreak. Review✓ It's not a simple model swap. This is like a game on it's own, offering somewhat major differences with Dead Rising 2✓ Whole new storyline and endings!✓ 3 New psychopaths with 3 new themes!✓  A whole new map area called 'Uranus zone'✓ Most soundtracks from Dead Rising 2 has been remixed to fit the style of the Dead Rising 1 soundtrack✓ Some of the psychopath themes now include singing✓ New combo cards for extra carnage!✓ Camera feature - Includes categories, points for style ; OH and your friend also have a camera✓ DLC that makes the game alot more fun!✓ No game issues (From my experience)✓ Frank WestOverall GREAT!Think that Dead Rising 2 didn't bring up enough Dead Rising 1? Look no further, Frank is ready to get back in the game! ",166,18,1,19,12,3,13

												Dead Rising 2: OTR (SP Only) *** Combining DR2 and DR2:OTR ***Story (5/10): DR2: OTR's story is largely the same as the other two DR installments. A somewhat bland story, sometimes perked by Capcom's characteristically silly character interactions. Overall, not a strong point of the game.Gameplay (7/10): DR2: OTR delivers the same Dead Rising experience that fans of the series have come to know, and sometimes love. Hordes of zombies flood the screen, and as usual, your job is to smite them using a variety of crazy weapons, ranging from laser shooting masks to chainsaw-tipped kayak paddles. DR2 and DR2:OTR really picked up from DR in the sense that they added a LOT of new weapons, which helps the game keep fresh throughout its duration. It personally never got old to smash through piles of enemies using an ever-expanding arsenal of ridiculous armaments. The added infinite mode is worth looking into, since you are unbound by the time constraints of the normal game, and given challenges to complete for money and xp, which carries over into the main game. This can be helpful if you are stuck in the main storyline.Unfortunately, this is where the fun ends. As with previous DR installments, boss fights are tedious and cheap, escorts are constant and frustrating, and many parts of the game feel drawn out and devoid of content or direction. If you are not satisfied with killing zombies, you will find little else of value in this game.Mechanics (6/10):DR2/DR2:OTR's new mechanic is the weapon combination mechanic, which allows you to combine weapons into new devastating combinations. This system is unfortunately limited by your need to find/unlock blueprints to use combo weapons to their full potentional, as well as the need to find specific ""maintenance rooms"" where the combos can be made. A more on-the-fly system may have been easier. Otherwise, mechanics remain somewhat unchanged from DR1, and are as usual, buggy and unforgiving.Visuals (7/10): DR2:OTR looks decent, probably mediocre, by today's standards. Edges are clean, textures are not obviously stretched out or degraded, and lighting effects are present to some degree. The technical prowess of the game comes from its ability to maintain hundreds of enemies on-screen at the same time, which still remains impressive, and a trademark of the series.Sound (7/10): The only comment I have about the sound is the game's tendency to have the constant moan of zombies drown out all other noise. It gets tiresome. Otherwise, the game does not have any noticeable sound achievements or problems.Replayability (9/10): DR2:OTR are both strong contenders in the ""Replayability"" category. There are a lot of weapons to unlock, skills to upgrade, and powerful costumes to unlock (especially the famous Zero armor, from Megaman). After beating the main game, I went through a second time, in order to beat down my opponents using a souped-up Frank West, complete with overpowered weapon combinations. Very satisfying.OVERALL: DR2:OTR is a fun, satisfying game, held back by poorly implemented mechanics, a buggy nature (see: Capcom games), and perhaps a lack of foresight. Do you like zombies? Do you like killing them? Tons of them? PILES of them? Yes? Then you'll love this game.7/10 ",411,57,7,28,23,3,46

												It's a very lovely photographer simulator with good old Frank West. It's a extremely good game with lots of fun things to do in a beautiful casino wonderland. It reminds me of the last time i went to Nevada, Only with less military soldiers and looters.			",59,5,0,2,2,2,1

												Dead Rising 2: OTR (SP Only) *** Combining DR2 and DR2:OTR ***Story (5/10): DR2: OTR's story is largely the same as the other two DR installments. A somewhat bland story, sometimes perked by Capcom's characteristically silly character interactions. Overall, not a strong point of the game.Gameplay (7/10): DR2: OTR delivers the same Dead Rising experience that fans of the series have come to know, and sometimes love. Hordes of zombies flood the screen, and as usual, your job is to smite them using a variety of crazy weapons, ranging from laser shooting masks to chainsaw-tipped kayak paddles. DR2 and DR2:OTR really picked up from DR in the sense that they added a LOT of new weapons, which helps the game keep fresh throughout its duration. It personally never got old to smash through piles of enemies using an ever-expanding arsenal of ridiculous armaments. The added infinite mode is worth looking into, since you are unbound by the time constraints of the normal game, and given challenges to complete for money and xp, which carries over into the main game. This can be helpful if you are stuck in the main storyline.Unfortunately, this is where the fun ends. As with previous DR installments, boss fights are tedious and cheap, escorts are constant and frustrating, and many parts of the game feel drawn out and devoid of content or direction. If you are not satisfied with killing zombies, you will find little else of value in this game.Mechanics (6/10):DR2/DR2:OTR's new mechanic is the weapon combination mechanic, which allows you to combine weapons into new devastating combinations. This system is unfortunately limited by your need to find/unlock blueprints to use combo weapons to their full potentional, as well as the need to find specific ""maintenance rooms"" where the combos can be made. A more on-the-fly system may have been easier. Otherwise, mechanics remain somewhat unchanged from DR1, and are as usual, buggy and unforgiving.Visuals (7/10): DR2:OTR looks decent, probably mediocre, by today's standards. Edges are clean, textures are not obviously stretched out or degraded, and lighting effects are present to some degree. The technical prowess of the game comes from its ability to maintain hundreds of enemies on-screen at the same time, which still remains impressive, and a trademark of the series.Sound (7/10): The only comment I have about the sound is the game's tendency to have the constant moan of zombies drown out all other noise. It gets tiresome. Otherwise, the game does not have any noticeable sound achievements or problems.Replayability (9/10): DR2:OTR are both strong contenders in the ""Replayability"" category. There are a lot of weapons to unlock, skills to upgrade, and powerful costumes to unlock (especially the famous Zero armor, from Megaman). After beating the main game, I went through a second time, in order to beat down my opponents using a souped-up Frank West, complete with overpowered weapon combinations. Very satisfying.OVERALL: DR2:OTR is a fun, satisfying game, held back by poorly implemented mechanics, a buggy nature (see: Capcom games), and perhaps a lack of foresight. Do you like zombies? Do you like killing them? Tons of them? PILES of them? Yes? Then you'll love this game.7/10 ",411,57,7,28,23,3,46

												I bought Dead Rising 2 but never really got around to playing it much.  I figured I'd waste another $20 and buy Off the Record while it's on sale.  It's pretty much the exact same game as Dead Rising 2 with a few tweaks, slightly different story, and new main character, whom I prefer.  I think it's it a little better, I'm enjoying it so far.

""Attempting to join game..."" simulator. We've tried a fair amount of time trying to get co-op to work with no success. If you plan to buy this game so that you can run around slaying zombies with a friend (which was a lot of fun in Dead Rising 2), consider steering clear until a patch becomes available. There are also folks experiencing similar issues in the forums with suggestions we've tried, but nothing works. My time spent in this game, apart from the part before you reach the safehouse, was mostly staring at an ""Attempting to join game"" dialog.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is a fantastic game complete with an interesting story and unexpected twists. If you expect it to be exactly like the original Dead Rising 2, you're wrong. This game replaces some psychopaths, as well as survivors. Though the case files are very similar to those in the original, it's also unique. In addition to these changes, there's also a new part of the map to explore and have even more fun! If you loved playing as Frank West in Dead Rising and the story in Dead Rising 2, I guarantee you'll love this game. If you're worried about it being boring for the reason of it being too similar to the original, don't even worry. Like said, it may be similar but also very unique. The altered storyline will definitely surprise you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not enough content different from the original DR2 to recommend a purchase, unless it's 75% off and you really love DR.  Coop challenges are fun except for the hardest of all challenges...Capcom programming.  More crashes than 9/11.			",85,10,4,14,3,0,1

												Dead rising 2 off thr record is dead rising 2 but with Frank. The hero from the first game it adds new items Reverses some characters around and adds some cool. Ideas. However. This is a garbage port. Another win for the ""PC master race"" there's no customizable controls whatsoever the controller support is broken. I would recommend the proper version on console and be able to enjoy yourself -_-  overall the game is amazing. Frank in fortune city is great but the lack of controls  hold it back. From what it really is a small addition is sandbox mode where you just run around and  do whatever. There's challenges and crazed survivors. This actually makes me happy and makes this crap port somewhat enjoyable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was really looking forward to playing this game having really enjoyed the first.  However upon setting it up I discovered it does not support controllers. It is horrible to play with a keyboard and mouse.  Apparently this is an on going issue, yet it clearly says on the store page, partial controller support.  Thankfully I bought the game in a sale so didn't throw to much money down the drain.  This is a poor performance on the parts of both Steam and Capcom.  Why has it not and will it, if ever, be fixed?			",49,10,0,6,8,0,5

												It has Sandbox mode, Uranus Zone and a little bit different plot. Other than that it`s the same Dead Rising 2. Few new psychos, weapons. A matter of taste. Like with original DR2, it has cons. Lack of time is the biggest con. You can easily fail mission because of it. If you failed one story mission - chain will be broken. NPC`s are too weak and dumb.

												It's not for everyone.There is a sort of story more, but most of the game you are forced to rush past stuff you'd rather stop to look at otherwise the quest timers run out.You can let the quest timers run out if you want to, except for the main case quests.Managed to complete the first 4 case quests and then gave up since it just was not fun to rush around any more.I got to level 5 (pretty much nothing), and my coop partner reached a staggering level 4 since her character was not saved when we reached checkpoints, and the game crashed when she got to level 4 and forced us to reconnect.All in all, it's probably a decent game if you like the time limited quests mentioned above, but I just can't recommend the game because of this.

												Dead Rising 2: Off the Record is a great game for those out to revisit Dead Rising 2 and those who avoided the series until now. It fixes or at least improves on several major issues with the series, making Capcom’s zombie slayer more fun than ever. It may not be perfect and we’re intrigued to see how the developers build on these improvements in the inevitable Dead Rising 3, but for whatever it’s worth, Off the Record is the best Dead Rising game to date.

												The game ""Has"" Controller support that is broken, which can only be reactivated via 3rd party programs (non the reviews mentinoned this) and I only checked the DLC reviews AFTER I purchased one, to which I found out it litterally doesnt even work it just TAKES YOUR MONEY FOR FREE. This may very well be my first Steam Refund after a little more consideration, I dont understand how Capcom has the gal to sell their ""Dead Rising bundle"" (coming soon) for 105$ when both Dead Rising 2 and Off the Records DLC DONT WORK, as well as controller support being busted on both of them. or how Steam even still allows EITHER of their DLC to be sellable as this is unacceptable. (also keep in mind the lack of options wont really let you flex your PC here)If you dont buy ANY DLC and are fine the Keyboard and Mouse controls this fun, albeit noncannon, Dead Rising 2 edit is still worth the purchase for people not as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about it as me. It is a return to form and has a lot of the ""Japanese-isms"" that were in the first Dead Rising but made 2 feel bland, IMO, without. (I know this because I still have the 360 version I just wanted this version for an ugrade since I was going to start over anyways)If you want the weirdness about this series that I enjoy, I would recommend the Way of The Samurai Games instead (granted ive only played the PS3 and 360 verions of 4 and 3, the only two on steam, respectively so I dont know how the PC versions are) They have a ""Day cycle"" where the game will ""expire"" without the main story being comlete, just like Deadrising, as well as that same akward, yet funny, ""acting style"" you get in this game and Deadrising 1. Not a zombie game and pretty jank to be honest but they are strangely similar to these games, hemce my recommendation.

												I always thought the dead rising games looked too goofy for me... Then I played the third one... and that was one of the most hardcore gaming experiences ever... so I came and bought this one since 3 will sadly be xbox exclusive (I cant blame em either)Now, this one is not in anyway as good as the third one... but it's still a pretty good game...It's really how you let yourself experience the game. There is some system that determines what kinda weapons you unlock, maybe how you play, idk... the multiplayer is touchy (maybe because of the off the record part of it less people own it) I have yet to be able to join a game, but if I'm playing for an hour or so someone usually joins my game... which is such a sweet suprise when your playing and suddenly someone else is there. It's kinda neat that way... This one's story is a little wonky but its basically a DLC add content... but its still pretty good. The story is good, just sometimes during a cutscene or something some survivor made you strip all your clothes off to save them and of course youre at the serious moment of a cutscene when that happens... soo... that always happens...I'll let you know what the best experience is in this game. You find some awesome mask, some kool shirt... you look like some zombie apocolypse ninja dude... you got a weapon made out of two fireaxes and a sledgehammer... a bunch of other insane things... youre standing on top of a flipped over truck surrounded by hundreds of zombies... you got an online buddy dropping in wearing a tux... and you guys go to town. You fight and fight and fight... you end up having to scournge for food on your last leg... get back out and fight and fight... ah man...The goofyness is what deterred me before but it needs to be there simply because of the insanity and violence of the game... for the entire series... the overall story is actually really good. Probably better than resident evil has been in a long time.If you get a chance tho... play the third one... that game is amazing.			",200,31,0,24,7,0,4

												A reskinned Dead Rising 2, slight changes to everything. But overall the exact same as Dead Rising 2. 0 replayability especially if you already played through the origional DR2. Frank west doesn't add anything, this also disturbs the origional lore from the prequel mini-series. The game constantly breaks the third wall, trying to be humourous but really the comedic side is just an annoyance.My save games corrupted when the GFWL remover was patched in. GFWL matchmaking was also much better. GFWL was easily crackable so there was many more people in multiplayer.			",556,90,21,51,47,7,79

												Okay, I'm just going flat out say it: CAPCOM, FIX YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥! because this game is a horrible port of the original console version!    The game LITERALLY crashed within ten seconds of opening it, turns out its because of a defunct program option it uses that is no longer used by anyone? What? how exactly does that make a lick of sense, I don't know. Second, once I actually got it to finally run on my laptop, it seemed to be okay and a pretty decent game, and then while I was in the menu, and wanted to exit out by using the Games set key (which was ESC btw) it would decide to tab out of the ENTIRE game; and if I Just so happened to be playing it Co-operatively (which I was) I would have my connection to the game be lost and I would have to get re-invited to that game and then have to find the spot in a Zombie, looter, Mercenary, and Psychotic filled Mall/Casino, and then have to pick everything back up. Another issue I had, was when Myself and my Co-op Partner *SPOILER ALERT* fighting Chuck Greene on his motorcycle and then lost, when the previous checkpoint loaded, somehow we were seperated  into two games while still somehow in a co-op game, in my instance, the host's character model AND Chuck's(The Boss, not the second player's model) stood completely still, in which I was able to just run over and beat the snot out of the Boss Chuck, which granted me the achievement, but Chuck just sat there in the bike and his ""death cutscene"" didn't play. and when I had to leave the game to try that whole section again. I lost 5 whole levels of EXP. Another major issue I had to deal with in-game was for whatever reason, if you looked up at the ceiling, or down at the floor, your character would actually run slightly faster with a perfect frame rate, I don't know why looking at the zombies slowed the game down (might have to do with the amount maybe?) but it was quite bothersome when you're on a short time limit to get your missions done. And that's not all, Steam itself doesn't even recognize that I own the game outside of my personal Library, look up my games through my profile, and this game doesn't show up, nor am I allowed to check my progress of Achievements, nor see the ones I've earned so far. I can still unlock them, but outside of that, I can't do anything. What I've listed is by far NOT ALL of the problems I've had, but were the biggest issues that I hate to frustratedly deal with while playing the game.however, despite the heavy glitches and huge bugs that infuriated my beyond end, I will say that the gameplay and story were alot of fun. graphics were okay, but I had to turn them lower for my laptop. if I were to recommend this game just on gameplay and story, then yes, go buy it. but honestly, buy the console version, it doesn't have terrible port issues and  until Capcom fixes the issues, I say don't get it here.

												I like this game. I played a lot of it on console. I can't recommend it though, because it has problems that SHOULD be fixed, but aren't. Lots of bugs exist, some small and acceptable and other big ones. The game can crash randomly, and with so many zombies at once things can glitch easily.Controller support is completely broken, a problem many people have. The game has an option in the menus to enable controller use, but the option is always greyed out and never works. I've tried many different types of controllers, not a single type worked for me. My wired 360 controller works instantly on most games, but even with 3rd party programs Dead Rising 2: Off the Record refuses to let me use it, and the same applies to every controller I own. This is unacceptable for a game that says it has controller support, has a button in the options for controller support, and exists on consoles.DLC has problems as well, often you buy DLC and it just won't appear in the game. If they're going to charge money for extra content, they better actually give it to you without a hassle.Save yourself the trouble, don't buy games that have no support from the developers. The lack of controller support on a game that REALLY needs it is a shame, because under all of the flaws this is a pretty good game.			",136,71,4,16,12,2,12

												I really like this game, but it is terrible trying to play it with the terrible optimization. True you do get to play as frank west which is always a plus, and you get some extra cotent like more psychos and weapons, but it nots really worth it when the game is super laggy unless you play it on minimum settings, and it is still a little laggy.I recommend just buying the original deadrising 2, because I hear it works a lot better and is almost the exact same.(7/10) Wish I bought the other version instead.

												I tried playing this game as coop, at first it looked like it had some good potential, but unfortunately I got disappointed. I played as the guest (I didn't host the session), I experienced some issues after cutscenes when the host was able to save the game, my game crashed and had to perform a restart of the games. I therefore lost all my character progression, which was very annoying. I also didn't like the timer we've got on all our missions. I really like to walk around exploring the stores and ambient, but this caused us til eventually save the game, and not having time to finish the mission. We basically ended in an evil loop. The mechanics feels like, as way too many games today are, that it's portet from console. I didn't finish the game and don't feel like the story was good enough to make me want to try the game again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story is intentionally stupid. It's something like a B Sci Fi made for TV movie. It's intention is to be wacky and gruesome at the same time. This is not a bad thing. It's just campy. At some moments it's funny at others it can be trying to hard. It all depends on how campy you enjoy things to be. The real issue I take with the game is that it's become formulaic and dumbed down since Dead Rising 1. The challenge of the series is gone and it's become more about flash and spectacle. It feels empty like the franchise has lost it's heart and is now meant to be one more franchise that can be churned out every couple years. The gameplay is simple just pick up an item in the mall and start hitting things. Find survivors on the way and fight bosses who are caricatures of one form or another with a disgusting or psychotic twist to their personality. Very rarely will you be in a situation where you can't handle yourself. As soon as you get out of the prologue area you get powerful enough weapons that you shouldn't have much issue with bosses or large hordes of enemies.  ",281,75,4,39,25,4,53

												Don't buy this game. Get DR2 instead. Game is a mess and the DLC won't always work!So first off, let me say that I absolutely loved and enjoyed my time with Dead Rising 2. Dead Rising 2 is a stable, well-running, non-crashing game that I have played for over 100 hours and counting with ZERO issues. It can easily run at 1080p/60fps and is a great port. Go ahead and buy it right now. It is worth it and so is the DLC. Get it on a sale, have fun with it!Whatever you do, stay as far away from this game as possible. Off the Record has given me nothing but headaches and in addition it has practically stolen my money. Let me just go ahead and list the issues I have encountered in my time with this game, and I repeat, none of these things occur in Dead Rising 2:Game runs at least 20 frames below DR2 in open areas.Random crashes during the game. Just random. It's a mess.New weapons can cause glitches and crashes (Alien Helmet + Gems Combo -> Hold X attack can crash the game)PC Settings -> Blur Effects option is glitched and no longer turns off what it should.Alt Tabbing can crash the gameDLC may appear as CORRUPTED and cannot be accessed. IF YOU BUY THE DLC YOUR MONEY MAY BE GONE AND YOU MIGHT GET NOTHINGNew glitches in picking up items, especially near a crafting table. Its annoying.Swords, katanas and other blade weapons have glitches now. The jump + x attack can randomly not work anymore and always miss by 45 degrees.Essential items are locked out of Sandbox modeThe save sound effect is way louder than any other sounds and makes me jump every timeSaving takes forever now, since the game needs 10 seconds to 'Check for saves'.Glitches weapons can randomly appear in the game, like a non-functioning AK-47 that was never finished.I could go on but you get the point. It's not worth it, the developers are NEVER going to fix all of these issues so stick to Dead Rising 2, enjoy it for the great game that it is and skip Off The Record. They took a fantastic, stable, well-running game and turned it into a pile of garbage with nothing but issues after issues. I hope I saved you some money. Instead, spend that money on the original, well-made Dead RIsing 2.			",243,47,1,18,13,0,23

												Oh the problems with this one. Sadly this game runs through GFWL, and unless you are logged in, you cannot load or save your game. Also, for whatever reason, this game does not regognise controlers, at all. It is supposed to but you can look all over the internet about it, 90% of people cannot get thier controlers to work with this game. It's a bit laggy at times, and trying to play with the keyboard just feels unnatural. The modding scene is also pretty small, nothing more than reskins for the most part. If you love dead rising, then buy this game on console, it just doesn't work on PC. Good game, terrible port, 'nuff said.			",117,9,2,4,4,0,2

												Ok this game is a really fun game and its a hard game to beat but, everytime I try to go onto it, it will come up saying Dead Rising OTR has crashed. When I first got the dead rising pack I installed dead rising 2 otr first as i wanted to play that more and it worked as i got fast the fighting zombies part but then one of my friends wanted me to play dead rising 2 with them so i went off OTR and installed Dead Rising 2 and we played that. Soon later he went off so i went to go back on to OTR but it started to come up with the crash and I have tried everything. I dont think it is GFWL ( Games For Windows Live ) because i have Batman Arkham City with Dead Rising 2 and they both work fine but OTR dont work. If you can tell me how to fix it please that would help thanks. Btw i have changed the sound on it and that dont work.			",221,26,5,13,5,4,3

												This game should be good. I mean, it has so much good in it, but it isn't for me, because it's horribly optimized.My computer is a mid-range 2012 laptop. This game was released in 2011. Hypothetically, the game should run perfectly fine on lowest settings, but in some zones it drops to a framerate of 15, sometimes even 10. I see no reason for it to do this. If it's cause of the zombies, then I'll point to Sleeping Dogs, a game that runs perfectly fine at about 40-50 fps without hiccup, and it's a GTA clone, with the millions of things going on. It also looks a whole lot better.If you're on a laptop, don't get this game. Only get it if you know your computer is a monster machine.			",281,40,4,32,38,1,25

												Look. I LOVE this game, I love the series and I am pretty much a fanboy for it. Which is why it hurts to say, do not buy this game unless you have a steam controller (I think that works, not sure, will update) or some sort of gamepad software, because this game just will NOT detect any gamepad I own. XBO, Xbox 360, PS4 Dualshock-wtfever and none can be detected by this game. And it's just NOT one of those games that is playable on mouse and keyboard, in my experience at least. Controlling Frank is like driving a boat on dry land. Attacking is...Okay, just click like mad and hope for the best aim wise. Again, great game, fun game...Impossible to play for me.

												Biggest waste of Capcom's resources I've ever seen... please, continue to listen to fanboys, it's doing your company wonders. Frank West was a good character, I'll admit, but reskinning Chuck, altering a few lines of dialog and twisting a few story boards around just doesn't justify this ""re-make"" at all. The struggle that Chuck faced having to rescue his daughter in the original game was much more satisfying than listening to this fat Dan Akroyd looking jack♥♥♥♥♥spew childish non-sensical (downright idiotic and lame) one liners the entire game...Frank had no business or purpose being here and this game shows exactly why... it's like sticking a very round peg in to a square hole... doesn't work. Although some of the jabs the developers threw in to make fun of the people craving Frank West was quite satisfying and comical. It probably went over most of their heads and they thought it was a clever reference or fanservice but I can tell you that Capcom hates you for making them do this... and so do I. :)I take solace in knowing these events never transpired and is just some basement dwellers wet dream come true...So yeah, get ready for zombie fetch-quest inconvenient time attack shopping simulator V2.5... At least they put Protoman's outfit in the game, after♥♥♥♥♥♥teasing us with the posters in the original DR2... It's one thing I can admit was a worthwhile addition to this version. It's still Dead Rising though, a clunky disaster of a game and frustratingly obnoxious. Cheers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am trying hard to like this game, but there's a dozen little annoyances that keep it held back from being a reccomendation to anyone except Dead Rising fans.  I hate to say this game is garbage, but I've been screaming at the monitor for all its gameplay flaws after 10+ hours.1.  The Survivor AI is terrible and they're a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to manage.  It's every nightmare you always think of with Escort Missions.  Almost half the characters you find can't use a gun, 1/8 of all of them can't use melee and take up an inventory slot for you to carry them.  You get surrounded by zombies way too easily even if you give them a gun.  Don't even try if you have a group of survivors because they'll just shoot through and even kill other survivors.  (The Leadership Buff didn't help either.)  If they get grabbed, it stops the entire pace of you running through the constant thick crowd of zombies and you have to rescue them.  If you didn't notice them getting grabbed, hit the restart checkpoint option becaues they'll definitely die with how fast their health goes down.  (You WILL hit Restart Checkpoint A LOT.)2.  You take damage too easily from the bosses.  You will constantly try to find or keep health items during any boss fight because they can take off half your life bar in seconds.  You will have to constantly pick at them because several can regen their health.  And ♥♥♥♥ those Militia Hunters in the central plaza.  Rapid firing sniper rifle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who you WILL have to lame it out with eather going for rapid melee or peek shooting from behind the air vents.  Seriously, as soon as you see their introductory cutscene (they're the group of sterotypical rednecks with Berrett Jacksons), go to the Dead Rising Wikia entry on Hunters for their Locations.  You will have to take them out immediately since you go through the central plaza all the time and survivors will be shot too.  Each bullet takes off 1/4 survivor health and you can't stop them.Then I got to the sheriff after them who could shoot guns out of my hands.  This gimmick boss♥♥♥♥♥♥is super frustrating and is the one time I'd recommend to anybody of finding a way to cheat to get infinite health JUST for the bosses.  You really do have to find a way to lame it out or read the Wikia on tactics to beat them.  Their AI is pretty exploitable at times, but the cheap gimmicks make them frustrating.3.  It's increidbly hard to enjoy the environment or exploring because of the constant time sensitive objectives.  I'd recommend Sanbox mode first just to memorize the locations, finding the secret caches of good weapons, and read how to unlock the shortcuts.  There is a gunshop on the right side of the map called High Noon Something.4.  The zombies should have thinned out.  I know it's part of the game franchise, but the zombie hordes are THICK.  You will have a tough time just trying to avoid getting swiped or grabbed because they're everywhere, unavoidable, and using weapons slows you down, making you even more of a target.  Try getting any powerful rapid fire and AOE weapons like the Rocket Launcher, the parasol blower combo, or Queens.  Don't use normal melee weapons for anything except as a last resort.5.  There seems to be a lot of engine optimization failures and it's inherent in the series.  There's a lot of fade in as you move from one area to the next things faze out of existence all the time.  It's either because of the team that designed this series isn't experienced enough to optimize well, or it's just part of the sub par PC port.  (The same problem is within DR3 as well.)  The framerate doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥itself hard like it does in DR3, but it can be noticable in thick areas.  I haven't had that problem since I have a powerful PC, but there are other problems like lack of a Windowed mode.  The blanking of both my PC monitors for 5 seconds going into and out of DR2 along with the lag and potential crashing is the reason why I always support PC games having a Windowed mode.  This is inexcusable.For the positives, what can I say, it's a Dead Rising game and a spin-off title that takes place in the same universe as the normal DR2, except this one has Frank West as the main protagonist.  Surprisingly, there are people who still play in co-op in this game, but I haven't been able to join or receive someone.  I'm not sure if it's the probelm with Games For Windows Live API or something, but it's a little screwy.  This is really one of those games that needs a difficulty setting because I feel like I'm playing on Hard Mode the entire time and it's kicking my♥♥♥♥♥  I'm not sure how long I can play this, but I'm not coming back after this.

												At first I tried this game on Windows 8 - had Problems with Games for Windows life so it did not work.A few months later I reinstalled everything on my computer with windows 7. So tried this game again. I was very disappointed. In the trailer it looked like the game would be a fun, fast paced zombie game. The Dead Rising 2 has neither a good story nor good gameplay... so no, can't recommend it.			",123,37,0,82,10,0,14

												First off I want to mention that the PC version of this game is a garbage port. No controller support, terrible optimization, and the DLC got magically deleted.But! The game itself is fantastic and it's still playable. Coop in this game makes it shine out among the rest and turns this into an extremely enjoyable experience when playing with a friend. You'll find yourself laughing at the game's ridiculous weapons, outfits, and characters.Even with the negatives with the PC version, I still recommend you play this game.			",83,3,0,0,2,1,2

												To be honest, I always stayed away from Dead Rising series because of the time-limited camaign style. You usually had a limited amount of time to do main missions and side-missions happen to appear usually at the worst time possible. I dislike that really.But this one has an additional sandbox mode with no time limit to let you enjoy the sillyness, gore and dark humor. I bought it for that and do not regret it. It was worth the money. If you just want to kill zombies with a different than usual ways, go for it. There is no other game that allows you to build a gattling gun that throws fireworks! Or mount machineguns to wheelchair. YAY!			",260,21,11,24,48,1,28

												If you had to get one Dead Rising game on PC, it would be this one.  Not for the storyline, but for the gameplay improvements.  The storyline for Dead Rising 2 is significantly better and canon in the series.  Dead Rising 2: Off the Record basically takes Dead Rising 2 and replaces Chuck with Frank storywise.  Online co-op is fixed in this version.  They included an endless mode where you can complete around 50 challenges.  There is a new amusement park area, weapons, and combo cards to collect.

												Didn't play DR2 so no comparisons to the original can be made.Played co-op online with my boyfriend and this game is a good 15 hours for a single playthough.  Many silly items can be combined and much zombies are there to be killed.  The game ran just fine on my 3.2ghz *6 / HD6850 / 8gb RAM system.  No hiccups despite tons of zombies, and environments looked fine..  Netplay handled lag quite well.  Controls are slightly weird and can't be rebound but the defaults were not troublesome enough to make me gripe.The game does a good job of giving you pacing with optional quests to save survivors.  You dont have a moment to easily breathe unless you are okay with letting a survivor die or missing a bossfight (but they are only worth EXP, so not completely necessary).  I'd say the theme of the first game was more interesting, but this one was fun to play and of course had co-op unlike the prequel.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												Dead Rising 2: Off The Record.It's basically Dead Rising 2 spiced up with an extra area, replaced Chuck with Frank (but you can play him in co-op) and extra goodies.NOTE: Don't buy this game if you're German. Dunno why but it has a note on it's page to not install using a German IP.What this game does right:- The Story may stay the same but since it's YOU that needs Zombrex you can take it while out so you don't have to backtrack all the way to the safehouse (thank god).- Frank has a camera so you can take pictures for extra PP and even take selfies with zombies.- The game has a wider variety of items to combine making it more open and funny.- You play as Frank West. He's covered wars y'know.- As you level up Frank loses weight.- Sandbox mode so you don't have to follow the story.What this game does wrong:- On lower Zombie Textures their models stretch and expand making it look like a horrible mesh of flesh.- The story is exactly the same. Not much difference except for the end.- You kill Chuck Greene.- The 4 special outfits are all just DLC from the original DR2- The best special outfit (The Sports Fan) is easier the get than the worst (Military)I do recommend this game due to its Dead Rising charm but if you want the ACTUAL story of DR2 and the extra story DLC you should stick with the default DR2.

Essentially the same game... Originally posted by DR2 review:Dumb & simple zombie killing fun. Like the first game, weapons and health are generally all around you only this time around you can combine two specific items to make another weapon that's possibly cooler, sillier, practical, or a combination of a number of those. You can find out what item goes with what via Combo Cards which are unlocked through general progression of the game such as examining certain posters, leveling, defeating psychopaths, etc. You can combine items without the specific card however the item produced won't be as effective and rewarding. It's highly encouraging to produce the Combo Weapons because using them generally nets you PP for leveling and curiosity in how they'll work will become pretty high.You're free to run around the world as you please (aside from some areas that can only unlocked from doing certain missions) though its criticized time limit makes a return so you only have so much time to get to doing the missions. If you stick to doing missions, not be as distracted, and perhaps if you're at a decent level it won't feel like it's rushing you to go do something so much. Even if you fail a task no matter how important and until the timer runs out or you choose to restart the story you're free to run around freely doing whatever. Restarting the specific save file's story allows you to keep your level, money, and Combo Cards for that next playthrough.The plot & dialogue is full of cheese, especially with the psychopaths. I think it's for the better that that's the case.There isn't much depth to the actual zombie killing aside from just having good weapons for the situation and the psychopath fights. The psychopaths can be extremely cheap in their own special way but at least for most of the fights you're free to leave and return to the area in case you don't feel ready for the boss fight. The co-op's overall doable. A bit easier (if no lag is present) but adds enjoyment to the game. The money and level you've earned anywhere in a save file can be used in both single player and co-op where the only thing that doesn't carry over for either is the story if you're not hosting the game. The entire thing could have probably used an implemented in-game chat and give-item-to-partner feature as opposed to dropping or chucking the item for them to pick it up.Fetch quests, escorts, and just messing around. Probably better with a controller since keys are unrebindable....but now it's slightly not as optimized, there's a new area for you to explore, some new items & Combo Weapons, some new survivors, many familiar items and survivors have been relocated for better or worse, the story's a teensy bit altered, there's a ""Sandbox Mode"" for you to run amok in without fear of a timer where your progress in it carries over to the story mode and vice versa, and now you take control of a photojournalist who's covered wars.

Оптимизация стала лучше. За Френка играть на много интереснее. Да и можно самого Чака с дочуркой убить.В общем пара вещей которые ты обязан сделать в этой игре :Убей Чака . Возьми пилу . Отпили голову его дочурке. Возьми ее голову и скорми зомби , после чего убей его плазмоганом из парка атракционов!Интересный sandbox мирового масштаба.9.8/10 ",518,71,19,47,26,4,43

												110 hours (of the time of this review) of zombies, crazy people, and straight up randomness.....So, I've completed the game three times in single player, once in co-op, five bosses defeated (not counting story relavant or  Evan), got to level fifty once, and so on and so forth.So, DR2:OTR, my favorite game in the series. Came to steamworks about a year or two ago. I don't think I can say anything bad about it.So, is it worth $20? Yes, very indeed yes.			",34,2,0,1,2,1,0

												Didn't play DR2 so no comparisons to the original can be made.Played co-op online with my boyfriend and this game is a good 15 hours for a single playthough.  Many silly items can be combined and much zombies are there to be killed.  The game ran just fine on my 3.2ghz *6 / HD6850 / 8gb RAM system.  No hiccups despite tons of zombies, and environments looked fine..  Netplay handled lag quite well.  Controls are slightly weird and can't be rebound but the defaults were not troublesome enough to make me gripe.The game does a good job of giving you pacing with optional quests to save survivors.  You dont have a moment to easily breathe unless you are okay with letting a survivor die or missing a bossfight (but they are only worth EXP, so not completely necessary).  I'd say the theme of the first game was more interesting, but this one was fun to play and of course had co-op unlike the prequel.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												Dead Rising 2: Off The Record.It's basically Dead Rising 2 spiced up with an extra area, replaced Chuck with Frank (but you can play him in co-op) and extra goodies.NOTE: Don't buy this game if you're German. Dunno why but it has a note on it's page to not install using a German IP.What this game does right:- The Story may stay the same but since it's YOU that needs Zombrex you can take it while out so you don't have to backtrack all the way to the safehouse (thank god).- Frank has a camera so you can take pictures for extra PP and even take selfies with zombies.- The game has a wider variety of items to combine making it more open and funny.- You play as Frank West. He's covered wars y'know.- As you level up Frank loses weight.- Sandbox mode so you don't have to follow the story.What this game does wrong:- On lower Zombie Textures their models stretch and expand making it look like a horrible mesh of flesh.- The story is exactly the same. Not much difference except for the end.- You kill Chuck Greene.- The 4 special outfits are all just DLC from the original DR2- The best special outfit (The Sports Fan) is easier the get than the worst (Military)I do recommend this game due to its Dead Rising charm but if you want the ACTUAL story of DR2 and the extra story DLC you should stick with the default DR2.

												I really don't find this any worse or any better than Dead Rising 2. If anything, buy this AND Dead Rising 2 (if you can). Dead Rising 2 is the canon one, so just play that first and then this. What makes Dead Rising 2: OTR a worthy recommendation, however, is, well, Frank West. He adds just that right amount of sass to every bit of story that makes it a little more enjoyable than mr. perfect scowly-face Chuck (who is a psycho in this one). There are more combo weapons, a new area to explore, a different narrative (that hits most of the same beats, but every cutscene has been redone for Frank and his dry humour), a SANDBOX MODE (which we had been clamoring for since the bonus of infinite mode in Dead Rising 1 was not present in 2), new Psychos, and the return of Frank's camera. With the return of photos is the ability to snap selfies with zombies (which, somehow, kills them... which is glorious).Overall, it's a worthy purchase. As worthy as Dead Rising 2.

												It's Dead Rising 2 again, except Frank West returns along with his own original move set and attack animations, the story is shuffled around a little and there's a whole new area in the city - a space-themed amusement park. There's also a couple of new weapons (including combo weapons), a couple of new bosses, and a handful of gameplay changes, the things I remember the most being:- Frank is infected and needs Zombrex every 24 hours, but he can inject himself no matter where he is, which removes the element of rushing back to the safehouse every day for Katey- Frank's picture-taking mechanic returns- If you're lightly damaged while holding a weapon you can't store in your inventory (say, a Gem Blower), you won't always drop it. You'll still drop it if you get knocked down, though.The co-op is even better than before, because Player 2 still plays as Chuck Greene (still using his own move set and attack animations) and him and Frank have a fair amount of dialogue for shouting at one another. They're really rude to each other for no reason at all, which is really funny.""Hey, zombie boy! I've got your drug!"" -Chuck (the actual reason being the dialogue was recorded for DR2: Case West - an X360-exclusive expansion (thanks capcom) - where the two of them start off on the wrong foot)Oh, and let's not forget about the Sandbox mode! In this mode, you're free to just goof off with no time limits to worry about. You're free to carry over levels, PP and money you earn in Sandbox to the 72-hour mode and vice versa. Most of the bosses will spawn in their usual places at certain times, but the friendly survivors are now hostile and will spawn in set places and attack you. There's also challenges around the map, with objectives like earning large numbers of PP, luring zombies to a specific area, racing to a finish point, or just plain killing zombies, so that gives you something to do besides just mucking around and exploring, which is still always fun.It's not as good of a port as the original DR2, which in itself was only an okay port, but it's still not too bad. The most notable thing is that you can't turn depth of field off without hex editing, but it runs a little better after you disable that.+ It's still DR2 - Still fun and funny, music's still good, the city still looks nice, co-op is still incredibly fun+ The new additions and subtractions are generally welcome, most notably Sandbox mode- It's still DR2 - Still kind of buggy and rickety and immature, having to earn speed upgrades by leveling up is still a huge pain- It really didn't need to be a seperate, full-priced game- DOF8/10This game (and the base game) have some of the most hilarious co-op action I've ever experienced. The single player experience is great, too.			",185,11,8,11,5,3,3

												Ok, listen, this game is EPIC, I mean, the weapons are fun, multyplayer is great, lot of zombies, lot of missions, cool places etc. but there are a LOT of problems, I won't bother making a list but these are not simple bugs, I'm talking about crashes on startup, error messages that you CAN'T find on the internet, the support is non-existant, the migration from GFWL to Steamworks didn't help at all, now it's just worse (The migration of savefiles corrupted the game, now I can't use old save files or start a new game, and also if you bought the DLCs, they aren't available on Steam so you loose them); I like this game, and i've played the first magicka (that game's got a lot of bugs too, but they aren't gamebreaking, so they are fun most of the time) so it's not like I (we) want a perfect game, but atleast PLAYABLE.

												this maybe late and old but thats what keeps it fresh. it makes an alternate universe where we play as frank west instead of chuck green. in this universe chuck turned pshyco after katey died because it looked like a closet fell on her or some♥♥♥♥♥♥  this game makes the best use of fighting. everything is your weapon unlike dr3 which you had certain things be weapons. so you can make barricades whereever your heart desires. this is the black and white 2 of games it lets you do whatever the hell you want if you want to kill zombies with jewerly go ahead i wont judge. if you wanted to kill a zombie with a wheel chair, do that to your hearts content.story is second to average as its like dead rising 2's only with more spin on it. the girl that helps you in this is evil and that guy that was evil is now good. and that annoying you need zombrex is back for you instead of katey but truly i should be able to take zombrex where ever the hell i want. otherwise i rate this game a good 9/10. it comes with multiplayer so if you and a friend want to have wheelchair zombie races you can.

												Around 2 years after Dead Rising 2 was released Capcom release this slightly edited version for full-price. (That will say 50 euro)With only some added weapons, some new features and completely having broken and porely edited some boss fights that obviously tried to kill you because you were before Chuck Greene who was believed to have started the zombie outbreak. Since you aren't Chuck Greene and neither you or him started the outbreak this time you'll get some horribly edited boss fights. Some pros with the game though is that they've fixed alot of things, such as -Checkpoints when you leave to a new area-More weapons and items-Free roam mode - Go free in fortune city with no timer, no quests, no need for zombrex and just kill alot of zombies and complete challenges for medal, money and PP earned in Free roam will also be shared with your story character.-Doesn't run on that ♥♥♥♥ing horrible Microsoft Live crap that some games used.If you have to pick from one of the two Dead Rising 2 games, pick this one.

												So yeah. This is my first review, but then, this is one of the games I know intimately well. I may only have about 16 hours on record here, but I've logged far more on the 360 version.The Dead Rising series seems a bit schlocky, and that's not surprising. It's meant to be a tongue-in-cheek take on zombie outbreaks. It remains serious enough to have a cohesive plot, but not so serious that a lot of the bosses and scenarios you encounter seem far-fetched or histrionic.The fun very much comes from having a whole playground of casinos, mall shops, and an added amusement park to formulate weapons and combat them. In addition to that, you'll encounter a lot of survivors who need to be brought back to the safehouse.Then there's the sandbox mode. It takes out the merciless clock and timer that often impeded your missions in Dead Rising 2 and the original Dead Rising. That really allows for it to be your playground.There's a bit of humor, a bit of sexy, a 'reality' TV show that glorifies zombie-killing in a WWE-type format. And what's more: Frank West returns in the Off the Record rendition.Some of its reviews both here and elsewhere tend to be a bit negatory because DR2:OTR took so very much from DR2... so much that, heck, a lot of it's exactly the same. But what OTR really does is fine-tune, improve, and give a little more freedom. It makes it a lot more fun. It's what kept me coming back. I've probably played through the story twenty to thirty times now... and I expect to keep going. The ride's that fun.Grab a weapon. Get creative. Explore. You'll find plenty of crazies along the way.			",37,38,0,39,8,0,15

												If you already own Dead Rising 2 then there's no real point in getting Off The Record as it doesn't really add enough to warrent an entirely seperate release.However if you don't own Dead Rising 2 and you like the thought of wading through a sea of zombies with a baseball bat with nails in then this game is for you.It reminds me of Dynasty Warriors or Ninety Nine Nights but with zombies and crazy craftable weapons from fairly mundane to ridiculous (such as robot teddy bears with machine guns, electric wheelchairs and chainsaws attached to each end of a canoe paddle).If this piqued your interest then you owe it to yourself to try this game.

												It's very easy to recommend now that GFWL isn't plaguing the game anymore.  The game seems to run better (at least in my case) and you don't have to deal with signing into LIVE.  The game itself really can just be described as a large open world playground with awesome, varied locations (casinos, large shopping malls, an amusement park, food court, etc.) to just screw around in and try out new weapons and combine them to make new awesome weapons.  Off the Record is a better deal than the regular DR2 for the same price.  It adds new locations, vehicles, weapons, and a sandbox mode where you can just play around forever without worrying about mission notifications.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Rising 2 was one of my favorite games back on the Xbox 360, and I spent weeks exploring it with my best friend and enjoying all of the hidden content and sillyness the game could provide.If I could, I'd take it all away and never have played Dead Rising 2.Off the Record is just that much better.Bringing back the old Picture-Taking system from the first Dead Rising but allowing for PP (The in game Experience points) gains through the same means as the original second game really helped to keep me speeding along and brought leveling to a very comfortable pace. As you level up your character becomes stronger and gains more health, but most importantly more inventory slots.Why is that important? Because there are just so many fun ways to take out a horde of Zombies in Dead Rising 2: Off the Record.  The story falls a bit flat of being something remarkable but the gameplay makes up for it in the sheer joy you can experience when driving a dirt bike with chainsaws duct taped onto it through a street of zombies.Where this game really shines is in it's cooperative gameplay. A friend can drop in and out at a moment's notice and continue playing the story alongside you. The fun of destroying hordes of zombies and battling pyschopaths was only amplified by having a friend running around alongside you.For $29.99, it's a hard offer to pass up. But Dead Rising 2: Off the Record should be experienced with a friend.			",197,27,7,23,48,3,20

												If you had to get one Dead Rising game on PC, it would be this one.  Not for the storyline, but for the gameplay improvements.  The storyline for Dead Rising 2 is significantly better and canon in the series.  Dead Rising 2: Off the Record basically takes Dead Rising 2 and replaces Chuck with Frank storywise.  Online co-op is fixed in this version.  They included an endless mode where you can complete around 50 challenges.  There is a new amusement park area, weapons, and combo cards to collect.

												A game so good I beat it and it's original over 4 times. (Not including the time's I've restarted) It's basically Managing Time: The Game Featuring Zombies. It's a hardcore title (Yes, it is actually categorized as hardcore) that encourages you to restart full games if you mess up time wise and It's sounds like something people would turn their heads to, but it's not that bad actually , mainly because you keep all your items and current stats and money ect ect. Managing your time wisely is always satisfying because doing so gives you more freedom.For those that have a phobia against time limit's, their is a ""Sandbox mode"" That allows you to do whatever you want in Fortune City, without having to worry about time limits, and you can bring a friend along for the ride. The Dead Rising games have always been my favorite Sandbox games, and for good reason. The ability to customize literally EVERYTHING about Frank or Chuck is truly a fun experience. Give me Dead Rising over GTA any day.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, YOU BETTER GET ALL THOSE SURVIVORS BEFORE THE GAS ZOMBIES COME. I'M SERIOUS. ♥♥♥♥ GAS ZOMBIES. ♥♥♥♥ THEM WITH 60 INCH POLES.

												If you get a version of dead rising, I recommend this one. It has extra content built in compared to the vanilla version of DR2, as well as all the content of DR2.I enjoy this game, killing zombies, leveling up, doing quests, combining weapons. Lots of intersting and imaginative bosses. Oh and when doing the story missions, you can decide what to do about survivors, save them or let them die, or even kill them.

												Disclaimer: This is a review I wrote when the game was new, copied from another site. It was based off my time with the Xbox 360 version and I've only put in a short time on the PC version. So issues with GFWL or it's removal are NOT taken into account. From 2011. *****************************************************************************************************************OK let me preface this by saying that I am a Dead Rising fanboy. A major one. I am well aware of all the games flaws and issues and I couldn't care less. I enjoyed the first Dead Rising like no game before it. As a huge fan of Romero films and zombie fiction of all kinds, Dead Rising was the first game I felt truly captured the feeling of an oppressive ""Zombie Event"". And of course the parallels to Dawn of the Dead didn't hurt it either. The original Dawn is a timeless classic that has been a high water mark for decades and it's remake holds the unique position of being just as good as the film that it's based on.Fast Forward from 2006 to 2010 and Dead Rising 2. I was initially shocked that Frank was not planned for the sequel of Dead Rising. But with time and some gameplay I warmed up to Chuck Green. The Combo Weapon system was great and the irreverant humor from the original was well intact. For my money, it was another success. But I never did stop missing Frank despite putting upwards of 30 hours into DR2 and even more into Case Zero and Case West.Now on to the reason for this write up, Off the Record (hereafter; 'OtR'). OtR is a curious title, even for me. Being the big fan of zombie games, of Dead Rising 1, and of Frank West, I was on board with this one from the word GO. The problem though, is who other than me would even consider this game a valid purchase? And releasing in one of the most cluttered fall release schedules since 2007? This game just doesn't seem to have an audience outside of the insane DR fans like myself, and even for us it's starting to feel like Capcom is pulling another Street FIghter 2 here with constant reiterations instead of moving on. And all in the span of 13 months.The game itself is pretty great. The same formula that made the other Dead Rising products enjoyable is still here with some nice new additions. Serious fans will enjoy the subtle changes to make the protagonist swap fit and there have been adjustments to the looters and the zombies seem more aggressive than in the other DR games. New combo weapons and the return of the camera mechanic round out a pretty impressive list of ""Pros"" for this game.The issue at hand though, is the list of ""Cons"". No matter how fun it may be, if you played DR2 proper, this is just not enough of an upgrade for the casual fan to embrace. The hardcore DR nut will love OtR but I wonder just how many of us there are and if we number high enough to make this game profitable?I've been a big supporter of this series. And I've always done my best to try and steer people to playing it. Forum posts asking ""What 360 games should I play?"" always see me trumpetting Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2's greatness. This game though, I just don't think I can be it's emmisary. I cannot ""sell"" this game to people. If you're on board, you were already on board and if you're on the fence, I'm not going to be trying to push you over. It is a good game. And on paper it's probably the best Dead Rising to date. But even with all the good stuff it has to offer (not the least of which is finally adding the checkpoint system fans have been wanting since 2006!), I just can't push a game like this. While it's a 5 star for me personally, I can't even imagine that anyone else would share that view of this one.To Bottom Line it, it's a great fun romp though a zombie outbreak with a charasmatic protagonist. It's just that the romp is basically the same one you took last year with DR2 proper. OtR can only truly be recommended to either those who never played DR2, or who are major Frank West fans who are willing to overlook the fact that they already played this game a year ago. It's definately a curious animal, but I doubt most people will feel the need to have it on their mantle.			",106,15,3,21,34,2,44

												One of the best games to play with friends. Theres no need to follow the plot in the slightest, since this is all about killing zombies in humourous ways.The weapon crafting adds so much to the game, and some of the combinations are awesome, such as sticking chainsaws onto a lawnmower!

												One of the funniest games I have ever played. There is nothing more entertaining than rampaging through the casinos with a friend whilst dressed as a woman, riding a tricycle, and other nonsensical shenanigans. However, I have experienced problems with save files and other bugs in the game, though I am not entirely sure if it's solely from the game or Games from Windows Live. If you like a sandbox game where you can goof off, get it.			",74,6,4,5,5,0,12

												Still one of my favorite childhood games and series. Dead Rising 2 Off The Record takes a what if story viewpoint of number 2. Basically Off The Record is the story of Dead Rising 2 with Frank West as the main character. Personally in my opinion this is far more better then the original Dead Rising 2, don't get me wrong I like Chuck Greene and his story in the original number 2 but Frank West is still my favorite character in the Dead Rising series and I really did enjoy the small little changes to the story line to make it Frank's own unique story. For most of the game the storyline is pretty similiar to number 2 just with Frank of course like I mentioned along with small little changes. There is now a really enjoyable sandbox mode where you can run around Fortune City and do whatever you want along with killing all the pyschopaths as well. Everything else is still the same basically like co-op mode and what not but there are a few new psychopaths and survivors in Off The Record along with Uranus Zone the newest add on to Fortune City. Overall this game is a hell lot of fun especially with a friend me personally went through the storyline with my girlfriend who never played Dead Rising so it was quite the adventure. Personally I think it's worth the $20 hell I would pay even more for it but if you are a cheap type of person I'd wait till it goes on sale.			",267,47,2,26,22,2,14

												Basically imo the better version of Dead Rising 2. Same story except for a little twist. The main good difference about this game is free mode that lets you play on the map without a time limit. So you dont have to worry about the 3 days expiring. You can just kill zombies or explore forever, with the random psycho spawning once in a great while. Makes it really fun and relaxing to just explore and kill zombies for an hour here, or an hour there, and watch as your kill count goes higher and higher without having to worry about starting a new game every five minutes like in the other dead rising games.

												This game is amazing.  It can be endless fun just goofing around by yourself or with a friend.  You can also have a great time following the story and leveling up.  If you like zombie games this is the game for you.  However, there is a game breaking bug in this version that makes it unbeatable.  At about 85% through the main story, there is an infinite loading screen that keeps you from continuing.  No fixes I have seen work, even though people report online that it does fix the issue.  I highly recommend this game as it is probably my favorite co-op game out there, however do not get it on steam.			",130,12,1,35,6,0,4

Other controller may have some issues from what I heard.And co-op is really fun, it wasn't crashing as many other people said.But one thing for sure, the god damn framerate!!If you r encounter numerous zombie(Especially outside of the mall), you will face serious frame drop like 15~20fps.I want to mention that my computer spec is not that ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I have gtx960m and i7 4720hq.Unless u have really great cpu like Intel i7(or i5) overclocked cpu(let's say more than 4.0ghz) and great gpu,you will see crazy frame fluctuation.Still I would recommend this game to you.

												If you liked Dead Rising 2 you'll enjoy this as well. Personally this feels like it should have been an add-on pack to DR2. It does change some gameplay and feels a little more difficult than the previous, so that's a plus, but it feels like a beta for DR3. The game is enjoyable, but I would really only recommend it for true DR fans who want to play all of the games in the series. I will be doing a full video review on this soon.

												The original DR2 was a good game, but Off the Record, in my opinion, proved to be superior game, Purchase it on sale with all the DLC, it'll be very cheap and you'll be able to enjoy the full experience.			",57,3,0,4,1,1,2

												Basically imo the better version of Dead Rising 2. Same story except for a little twist. The main good difference about this game is free mode that lets you play on the map without a time limit. So you dont have to worry about the 3 days expiring. You can just kill zombies or explore forever, with the random psycho spawning once in a great while. Makes it really fun and relaxing to just explore and kill zombies for an hour here, or an hour there, and watch as your kill count goes higher and higher without having to worry about starting a new game every five minutes like in the other dead rising games.

												Dead Rising is my favorite game series of all time with Dead Rising 1 being my all time favorite game. It was the type of game that really brought innovation and a FANTASTIC story, leading to future great games for the series. Dead Rising 1 is now finally after 10 years coming to pc 9/13/16. But i'll be damned if this game didn't keep it's seat warm. This may have only been a character swap from Dead Rising 2 with 3 fresh new Psychopaths, But the crazy old fun you could have with Frank West, Making some new weapons and taking great photos. I have 203 hours on this game for a reason, Give it a shot.			",229,36,1,23,13,2,9

												Just a warning, you can play this game fine with an OFFICIAL WIRED Microsoft 360 controller.Not a third party wired controller, or a wireless 360 controller with a charging cable. Or spend time doing a workaround. For whatever reason alot of these games for windows live titles wont allow 3rd party controllers...  Get one cheap at frys new, or used on Ebay. The other option is the steam controller (not as cheap) This game is a good redo of DR2 anyone who liked that game should like this too.			",59,15,1,11,11,1,4

												 A solid ""What if?"" spin on Dead Rising 2. If you haven't played the original, you can go ahead and just pick up Off the Record, but for the ultimate experience play them both! While it's almost identical, this expansion has some minor improvements including a tweaked storyline, a new area and a, much familiar to Frank, new boss.   Do get it when you can. It is a solid Dead Rising experience! ",140,27,3,11,10,1,6

												Very fun game, can be challenging or easy depending on how you play, can interact with almost anything you see, just overall feels like a satisfying game. There's a myriad of issues setting up a controller for the game, but PC controls are still very good. Overall a fantastic game, and personally I believe it to be the best Dead Rising game in the series.			",37,3,0,10,1,0,2

												This game is amazing.  It can be endless fun just goofing around by yourself or with a friend.  You can also have a great time following the story and leveling up.  If you like zombie games this is the game for you.  However, there is a game breaking bug in this version that makes it unbeatable.  At about 85% through the main story, there is an infinite loading screen that keeps you from continuing.  No fixes I have seen work, even though people report online that it does fix the issue.  I highly recommend this game as it is probably my favorite co-op game out there, however do not get it on steam.			",130,12,1,35,6,0,4

												4/5 stars.I got this game just for the sandbox mode and I have enjoyed it very much so far! Customizable weapon system that isnt afraid for you to explore your imagination, unlimited zombies for you to torcher and a big map for you to explore!The only problems I have with this game is that the keys are unbindable (but I used a controller) and the ""mad people"" bosses are too hard and frankly not as enjoyable to fight as one might think and the leveling system is (for me personally) too slow! I still recommend this for anyone wanting a sandbox zombie game with virtually no restrictions but can't afford a xbone with Dead Rising 3.			",100,11,2,1,13,3,8

												As somebody who owns and has played both Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, I will be comparing it to Dead Rising 2Pros:More Combo weaponsTaking PicturesNew BossesSandbox ModeFrank West's humourConcept art galleryCons:New Bosses: As much as I like the replacement for the Leon Bell fight (not saying who his replacement is), the new final boss is worse in all aspects. It feels like one big gimmick, and since all of the buildup for Dead Rising 2's twist boss is unchanged, the new boss just comes off as forced. Whereas the other new boss is just lame and annoying with bland music.More bugs, ranging from helpful (infinite paddlesaw) to irritating (Weapons clipping through the floor) to even horrendous (getting stuck on things)Online is worseNo graphics optionsRemoval of Terror is Reality (far from a dealbreaker imo)Overall, I prefer Dead Rising 2, but Off the Record from pure content is a better game. I prefer 2's storytelling, though Off the Record does have it's moments of great narrative (working Brandon into the main story was cool). If you just want story and some fun get 2, but if you want more ways to kill zombies and more time to kill zombies(or just even if you enjoyed 2) I recommend Off the Record.			",96,10,0,0,11,1,3
