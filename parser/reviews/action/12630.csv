												A decent Diablo clone. The combat animations look really nice, although sometimes enemies teleport to make contact with your strikes. I have had a few issues with it but nothing too bad. Just make sure you install the Nvidia Physx Legacy drivers before trying to play or you will most likley have issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
