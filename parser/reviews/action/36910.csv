												Its the ultimate game of all time, but poorly executed. however not as poorly executed by the one game that is similar to it ""Universal Combat"" which is just as much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥I dont reccomend buying this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, BUY THIS GAME!!!!! It is beyond terrible. If there was a rating under a 1, it would easily get it. I cannot put into words how terrible this game is... Just stay away!			",285,19,5,41,11,0,42

												I purchased this game when it first game out. That was my first mistake. This game is empty, broken, and virtually unplayable. There is no explanation about how to play or WHY to play the darn thing in the first place. At $20, this game might seem forgivable, but it is not. There are better things to spend your money on, and even if this game goes on sale for $1.00, DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY ON IT! Pretty much everything written about the game features is a lie. It plays terrible, it sounds terrible, and it looks terrible as well. Don't waste your time with it.			",356,53,1,50,31,0,48

												This could be great game, but it almost lacks everything what we expect from modern sandbox alike games. It has no army you can command, its hard and boring in many ways. If you enjoyed Battecruiser or Universal Combat, this is not even half of experience of these games in terms of wirtual life that takes place here.  All planet looks abandoned, nothing to do, and nothing to fight for, with no one at your side. BC or UC had living space, with some imagination You could have great fun. But this is just boring. Avoid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So - I bought this game a while back - All I have to say is that It is bad...Not even in a ""so bad that it is good"" kinda way... It is just plain bad.Here is why -1. Confusing - The game does not give you any form of orentiation and when it tries to it falls flat on its face in the attempt.2. Runs like crap - Long load screens for extremly low fedelity models and textures. 3. Multiplayer is non existant - There are no players on the servers.4. Crashes and lockups - The game tends to crash and lockup. This has to be my biggest gripe about All Aspect Warfare.In summary -This game feels like it was pushed out the door way to early. It is overall waste of money that I paid for it. Wish that I had not purchased this. My advice to any one else who is looking to buy this...***AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNTIL FIXED ***Advice for the developers to improve the game.1. Hire actual voice actors for the ""Training Videos"" and don't have the youngest member of the dev team do the voice overs. It honestly sounds like a 13 to 15 year old kid. Not to mention that he goes by a bunch of different names such as Lucas, Brad, etc. It is really awkward and this could directly hurt your sales. If you have to do it that way due to budget constraints. Then atleast do some audio editing so that she does not sound the same in each video.2. Spend more time on your games development - The game has its flaws, is bad in terms of performance, and prone to crashing/Lockup. Spend more time on Quality Assurance and Bug fixing.3. Host Community events to get more players in game - Lots of companies do this for their games. This also could help build a Community around your company and games.Anyways enough of my rambling for now.Peace out!			",301,38,8,32,36,2,66
