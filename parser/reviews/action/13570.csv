												First off, this is my favorite game of all time. I've had it for a long time in physical format, but due to it's drm it's unplayable on modern systems, so I bought the steam version. I was a bit afraid of how it would run based on some of the reviews that have reported problems, so I was ready to issue a steam refund just in case.So here's the score: this game is flawless. I've seen some negative reviews and let me address some of them. First of all, all those who say it's unplayable with keyboard and mouse are idiots, no two ways about it. You control your speed via the mouse wheel. It's that simple. Besides, you can customize the controls to your heart's content. Second off, no, it doesn't have checkpoints. And you know why? Because it doesn't need them! It has a quicksave function! I swear, some people...How about the game itself? It's the best stealth game of all time. Period. You have full feedback of how much noise you make and how much noise is in the environment, how visible you are, you get a lot of tools for dispatching or distracting your enemies, you have nightvision, thermal vision and even ""electric"" vision that let's you see objects that use electricity (useful when completing some of the objectives). It has a fairly intelligent AI. The game is a bit too easy if you just kill everyone in my opinion but it's damn fun. If you like the suspense of stealth, look no further.The graphics still hold up to this day in my opinion. Some of the round objects are a bit angular, but it doesn't take me out of the experience, and the textures still look great. There's also a surprising ammount of color that, compared to a lot of modern games, are a breath of fresh air. The sound design is superb and the soundtrack just ups the suspense. The music is low key and dynamic, changing to the gameplay.Some of the writing is a bit too convoluted for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but it's hard to follow, especially for the first time playing. You really have to invest your brain into the story or you'll get lost in it.All in all, if you even remotely like stealth games don't you dare miss out on this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, often considered the highlight of the Splinter Cell series. Chaos Theory has 3 complete modes in single-player, co-op, and versus, at the time of its release very unique. In particular, the Spies vs. Mercs multi-player was an insanely fun and revolutionary experience, that for some strange reason Ubisoft has never replicated in later titles. Unfortunately, the co-op and versus modes are dead online, so the only real content purchasing it now is in single-player. If you buy the game now, you're buying it only for the single-player experience. Still worthwhile in my opinion, but if you're looking for some multiplayer action, you're better off looking at the newest title (Blacklist at the time of writing).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily, this game can represent the beautiful gap between modern stealth games and the classic ones, difficulty, solid game design and beauty working together in perfect form.The animations and music in tandem change as you creep up to someone, a hard earned grab from behind being payed off with valuable information. The combat is incredibly hard if you get into it, but not impossible to get out of. The fundamentals are in full play, from noise level, to line of sight, to light levels, and gadgets that make your life a little easier.This game covers it all.If you can bring a friend in, do so, the coop campaign is still one of the finest in a long time (it has quick saves and mutual player pausing, and not crap netcode, something games today can't get right), and although the multiplayer is dead, I've heard nothing but good things about spies versus mercs.Signing up for coop may be a pain (unless you have a Uplay account, they seem to work off the same servers, oddly), but native 1080p support in a game this old and a lighting system that puts many modern games to shame more than makes up for any technical shortcomings this game might have for you.

												Rather than asking for twitch reflexes and an emphasis on mass murder, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory asks the player to be aware. This is not a game where the locales are merely canvases to spill blood - every inch of ever level is laden with multiple ways to progress through the mission. Shadows, vents, windows, pipes and balconies which can be hung off of... not only are you given a wide array of ways to avoid enemy detection, but these assets can be used to silently (and stylishly) take out enemies. Not only does the environment give an incredible amount of replay-friendly playstyle options, but it also reeks of atmosphere and immersion in a way that I've never seen in a video game since. Not only are the dark, glistening graphics and ambient sounds well-done, but the moody soundtrack by Amon Tobin serves as the syrupy glaze to the atmospheric pancake. Meanwhile, the level design has a realistic feel to it, as though every hallway that you enter could be a real place.Overall, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is a gameplay masterpeice and a technical marvel that still impresses today, over ten years after its release. Almost every aspect has such a great level of polish that, despite the game's relatively niche genre, I reccomend this game to everyone who has ever picked up a game controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me specify something- for 8 years, this has been my favorite game of all time. I played the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the xbox version of it- and while it may feel more suited to a controller, it can be handled just as well on a mouse and keyboard (though you may want to bind the keys to your liking). Since there's less of them- we'll start with the bad things, shall we?Stealth games NEED good, balanced cpu opponents. While the game gets the awareness of guards correct on a standard basis- the dudes you're sneaking past can be remarkably stupid, and occasionally even the converse of that, as it has its faults sometimes with twitchy/schizophrenic AI.The character models' faces can be REALLY ugly. Mainly, that comes from stretching in an exaggerated expression, as grabbing someone and holding a knife to their neck raises their eyebrows roughly 3 feet above their face, and their mouths even wider than the area aforementioned. Their eyelids are also triangles.Another fault for the PC version is that it doesn't quite have the sound design that the xbox version did- sound effects don't fade and echo like they should. Which is kind of bizarre! It's not often that the console counterpart ends up sounding better than PC master race's version.There are a few issues in the multiplayer modes:Co-op-Game can desync and completely ♥♥♥♥ up a mission that you and your partner had spent an hour on-Framerate is LOCKED TO 30 FRAMES FOR SYNCHRONIZATION PURPOSES-This game absolutely hates when you Alt+Tab and will kick you off the server for doing it too muchVersus-Opens separate program-Completely different (and less visually appealing) engine-Resolutions only offered in 4:3 format (but can be easily fixed by editing default.ini)-Some of the maps are so huge it boggles your ♥♥♥♥ing mind that ubi thought only 4 players could support itNow then- I've told you what isn't so hot about the game, and if all of that turns you off, that's okay. So what makes Chaos Theory so great?Make no mistake, gameplay is the breading AND the frosting on this delicious cake. The engine is completely revamped from its' predecessors, which is a magical thing that they were able to tear down what they had before that was already superb, and make something that is nearly perfect. There's a new sound meter, that lets you take a look at just how noisy you are in a situation, which makes for a better sense of immersion- rather than LOUD/NOT LOUD. The new engine the game runs on feels substantially smoother than SC or Pandora Tomorrow (which is still yet to see a steam release); All of your actions, as well as the AI's, both look and feel realistic. There's no half-hearted spring step like the original, nor do guards have to hug walls to get past eachother. All you have to worry about is coming up with the method to either stun your foe, eliminate him, or how to slip past him unnoticed. I often prefer the latter, but when in co-op, you can't really trust your partner, nor yourself to be this stealthy. You're better off quick-saving frequently or just knocking out whomever you encounter (or both!).Sound-wise, the game sounds awesome. Stellar voice acting, great sound effects, and some of the greatest music in a game ever. In fact, Ubisoft was so pleased by composer Amon Tobin's work, they released the soundtrack a MONTH before the game was due. Tobin was able to create the tense atmosphere of the game, all while retaining the feel that you're a ghost's shadow. You ARE what goes bump in the night. Needless to say, the game's OST has wound up on every different generation of an MP3 player I've had.Seriously. Just listen to it.

			El Cargo by Amon Tobin from the Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Original Soundtrack I Do Not Own Splinter Cell		

The voices in the game sound smooth and believable at every time. There's no forced lines like there were in Pandora Tomorrow, where there was that occasional young voice in the ambient audio tracks that absolutely did not fit the bill for the lines or the character he was given.""DON'T SHOOT, I'M AMERICAN""That line is going to haunt me til the day I die.Like I've explained before, the game still looks nice, visually. The environments look polished, with the lights shining in just the right spots that make the game still a pleasure to look at, nearly a decade after release. The character models are very nicely detailed in terms of both texture, and shape. With bumps and edges on not just their faces, but clothing as well. In a game about stealth, you could imagine how important shadows and lighting are- and the balancing of the light-index along with the visuals work great (although this excludes a few particular downloadable co-op levels). The Co-op looks just like the Singleplayer, and doesn't sacrifice the engine for the sake of performance. But the extra levels included in the v1.05 patch leave a LOT to be desired. It feels like there was a completely different designer who had absolutely no spatial awareness, and didn't even understand how lighting works- and that large, stretched blood textures serve no purpose when there is no body they are connected to. Stay away from those maps if you wish not for your partner and yourself to succumb to occular leprosy. How do I love thee, Versus? Let me count the ways.1. When I grabbed parker and threw him off a ledge, breaking his neck.2. Charging into and scaring the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Binary_2 right after the elevator doors opened on 'Club House'.3. Both Parker and I getting killed after bd648 fired a grenade into the rafters, taking the ceiling along with it.4. wwchicken running headlong into yet another proximity mine next to the VIDEO GAMES terminal in 'River Mall'.Versus makes its' return from Pandora Tomorrow, and with a vengeance. Gameplay is considerably more balanced, providing an easier challenge for the mercs. Mercs can now hit spies in the FACE, and knock them down- which levels the playing field, since spies have a tendency to sneak up and break your neck. You can also customize your loadouts for both classes, which is nice when you're trying to balance the game to fit your playstyle. Spies are still stuck with their shocker rifle, but mercs have the option to take either their default assault rifle, an SMG, or a shotgun. There's various things you can use on both sides as well, including spy traps, tracking bullets, and even stealth camouflage. It's all there, and it's a blast to play. I have no idea why there's so few people playing such a fantastic game. I mean, Counterstrike came out 13 years ago, and it's still one of the most played games on Steam.Where is the JUSTICE.TL;DR This game is fun as hell. If you haven't played it, and you love to be a stealthy SOB, get your hands on this delicious classic. Don't care about the multiplayer/ have no friends? The singleplayer tells a great story that can be beaten anywhere from 10-20 hours. A great deal that you can get on steam for an average 5-10 bucks. Wouldn't miss it for the world.-BP			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best entry in the series, even compared to the newer games.Story is excellent, with a number of twists and turns. The options to stealth or kill one's way through are actually present; unlike SOME games, with the right set-up I can get through 95% of SC:CT without killing anyone. If I do, whether on accident or on purpose, then I at least have the option of hiding the body or running away. Takedowns are similar, and the environment kills are nothing short of fantastic! Speaking of - its environments still look gorgeous even on modern systems - even if the character models are less-so. And the sound design and soundtrack? Absolutely brilliant; a perfect mix of background noise and high-tension BGM makes me almost crap myself if I accidentally blow my cover and the alarms start going off.The only downsides are that it may be difficult to run on some newer systems, and... well, not to spoil anything, but the last level was somewhat of a disappointment, as it turns into nothing short of a bloodbath, despite all my efforts to prevent that from happening. As well, it may be problematic to get used to the controls (it took me a few hours of play before I got them down), but once you do it becomes less of an issue.Overall, for anyone interested in a true stealth game and not just a short break from running and gunning, this is a must-have.

												Tom Clancy's: Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory: Featuring Tom Clancy is pretty cool, I guess. You play as Sam Fisher, the world's sneakiest dad. Sam works for an organization called Third Echelon, who's entire purpose is to spook the enemies of America and take their things. Over the course of a few missions, Sam discovers a conspiracy to do bad things to somebody or something and has to use all of his sneaky tricks to stop it. To be fair, I really like this game. Like, REALLY like this game. If I were to have to give a gold star to any game, it would probably be this one. Hurray, you did it! Mr. Clancy!Oh no, Mr. Clancy is dead! Bom Stancy's Stink Cell is one of those stealth games that actually focuses on stealth. Although you can go in loud and make a big scene, you are treated like a stinky idiot and penalized for it. In old games, if you got caught three times, the mission would end. The alarms are still there, but the missions don't end anymore, instead the enemies just get progressively more resistant to your presence. One alarm goes off and they know something is wrong, two alarms go off and they know something is definitely wrong and start packing heat, and on the third alarm they actually come looking for you. It's a pleasant difficulty spike that actually punishes you and spanks your bottom for playing like a Sally. Luckily, the stealth part of the game is the best part. You have two meters, the spook meter, and the loud noises meter. Stealth is based on line of sight and darkness, the darker it is, the harder you are to see, the spook meter actually shows how concealed you are in the dark, with the darkest meaning you can basically brush a guards beard sensually and whisper sweet nothings into his ear and he won't notice you, while if the meter is all the way to the light side you may as well be buying travel insurance and live in palm beach. Sound is also a big thing that can either aid or hinder your success. There is a cap that moves depending on how noisy your environments are. Like a thunderstorm or a loud engine can conceal the noise you make while a room with someone sleeping or a hollow cave will make you easier to hear. Your adversaries are usually guards, which is expected. The guards react to sound and when they think they saw something, but usually just bumble around until they realize something is amiss. What is pleasantly surprising is how the guards actually interact with one another. Outside of scripted conversations, they also coordinate with one another when they're looking around for something strange. While they're working together they usually have some kind of worried conversation about hoping not to find anything as well as mumbling to themselves if there's nobody looking with them. It really gives life to the guards in a genre that is usually void of any kind of personality for your opponents. You have a few ways of dispatching your foes. Outside of 007 style gadgets like the sticky camera and the shock shooty, you can also choose to either knock them out, whack em, or just bypass them all together. There really isn't a better feeling than getting into a area and out without anyone even knowing you were there to begin with. I am not going to continue to gush about this game.Back in the day, there was a big scene for Chaos Theory's multiplayer, and rightly so. There were two multiplayer modes, one where you yelled at your friend for alerting the guards in co-op mode. And one where you yelled at other people because they somehow saw you while you were across the hall in the dark behind a box in the competitive mode. Co-op mode was actually it's own game, where you and a friend took control of two freshly trained Splinter Cells as they went on missions that sometimes went on at the same time as Sam's outings. Each mission was built with team work in mind since the two agents had a set of moves they could perform like boosting each other on to high ledges, roping your partner down a deep pit, disrupting cameras with your microwave emitter while the other sneaks through the dark, and thinking about monster trucks and manly things while you climb your partner like a ladder and sensually rub against him. While Co-op was really cool, competitive was a beast all on it's own. The game was a two on two affair where a duo of spies part of an organization known as SHADOWNET infiltrated into facilities protected by a mercenary group known as ARGUS. When you play as Shadownet you play like a usual Splinter Cell with some extra moves and gadgets added in. But when you play as ARGUS, you play from a first person perspective and mostly rely on brute force and fire power. ARGUS patrols the map and guards the objectives while Shadownet has to sneak past them and steal the goodies without being spotted. Competitive is tense, like, poop in pants tense. You have very little offensive options as Shadownet and are forced to either run or get filled with new breathing holes when you get caught while ARGUS has no idea if a Shadownet agent is near unless he has his flashlight pointed directly at him, or his noise detector goes off. It's hide and seek but with more fire power. Both sides have enough options and gadgets to dispatch one another, like how Shadownet can break the necks of the ARGUS mercenaries they can sneak up on and how ARGUS can set up tripwires and mines to catch Shadownet spies off guard. It's an amazing mode and sadly has whittled over the years due to just how old the game is. But should you play Tem Sensy's Sneaky Guy: Math stuff? Its still one of my favorite games ever. Even though the multiplayer glory days are over, the single player is still top notch stuff. You can get your money's worth on single player alone, but if you can get a few friends together to spook one another, I would recommend that as well. I don't actually have a gold sticker, so I'm just going to thumb up the Xbox copy I have.Good on you, Xbox version of the game I reviewed.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Yeah, (I am) the real kind (of spy), not the tuxedo kind. I'm the kind that makes you bleed all over your Andretti unless you give me information."" Chaos Theory is a third-person stealth video game and the third installment in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series. It, again, puts you in the boots of NSA (and Third Echelon) special agent Sam Fisher as he undertakes missions around the world to avert the possibility of an all-out war between military superpowers.The single-player campaign is divided into ten missions with locations ranging from the America's to East Asia. The game was released almost ten years back but it definitely holds well from a visual point of view. Missions usually take place at night (or in the dark) which probably help mask a few of the game's graphical deficiencies. Chaos Theory has probably some of the best stealth mechanics in any game. A sliding light bar indicates whether Sam would be visible to the enemy or not while a noise bar shows how much noise is being produced as the protagonist moves around. Sam's pace of movement is tunable by scrolling the mouse-wheel, giving players a much greater control over how the character moves. Enemies can be sneaked upon from behind and knocked-out or put in the choke-hold to extract vital information. Apart from moving around in the shadows, the game provides you the option of traversing through vents, zip-lines, hang from ledges and overhead pipes; all the while avoiding enemy encounters.The game is designed around stealth so players would experience gun fights to be clunky in nature. Apart from the usual arsenal of silenced pistol, sticky cameras. stun grenades and assault rifles, there's a very useful EMI feature that allows you to remotely disable lights and electronics temporarily. It helps a lot in moving around the environment unscathed. Hacking is a fundamental portion of the game. Computers, keypads and security terminals can be hacked, with the mechanic favouring those with quick reaction times. Multi-vision goggles are once again an essential part of gameplay with Sam able to alternate between night-vision, thermal and EMF modes.The enemy AI is excellent with sentries coming to snoop around if they see open doors or turned-off lights. Enemies can also be distracted by whistling and flinging objects around the environment. Instances of direct combat are extremely rare but if such a scenario does crop up, enemies take cover and periodically change positions to improve their chances of winning gunfights. The plot was interesting but not something that hasn't be done already or since. The script is well-written and character voice-overs are extremely well done (Michael Ironside ftw!). But I felt character interactions felt a bit too formal and serious. Mission briefs involve relevant characters droning off about mission objectives, although there's some fun banter between Sam and his handlers during missions; but that's few and far between. The game could've done with more cutscenes, in my opinion.Chaos Theory is a definite recommendation if you're looking for a pure stealth experience. The SP campaign length is around 12-15 hours, subject to one's playing style of course. The game is definitely much much better than the p.o.s that was Splinter Cell: Conviction.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best stealth games ever created and in my opinion the strongest Splinter Cell game from them all. The gameplay offers so many opportunities to access an area and handle a situation. The game's atmosphere, setting and story wonderfully arouses the feeling of being a spy. I think that there aren't any other games on the market that can accomplish this successfully as Chaos Theory does. The formula has been tweaked to an almost perfect mix of story and engrossing gameplay that still requires more use of brain over brawn. The presentation is off the charts with mesmerizing visuals and audio production, both of which have a major impact on how you play. And it doesn't require Uplay (yay!).

												USEFUL INFO FIRST: in order to activate Steam interface, add a shortcut in Steam to splintercell3.exe and play from it. You won't track the time spend on it, but who cares about that?Now my review about Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory... That's a long♥♥♥♥♥name for a video game!When you think about stealth games, a few names come to mind: Hitman, Thief, Splinter Cell and MGS to an extent.Hailed as the best games in the series most of the time, this review is based on a game I consider to be the pinnacle in that genre, along with Hitman Blood Money.First of all, don't let the release date fool you. Chaos Theory hasn't aged one bit. It still looks good today, the mechanics are still top notch and mostly, it has tons of features you'd expect from a modern game, without all the flaws you can guess.I don't know if it's just me, but stealth in FPS view always felt awkward and unpractical to me. Good thing this one has a third person view, have fun looking behind walls! It also features various ways to kill/knock out: whether you'd rather do it in close-combat, shoot them from a distance, pull them from a platform or even jumping onto them.The environments are a bit varied, going from a jungle-like maze to the top of a lighthouse, cracking down the vault of the bank or retrieve information in city full of people not knowing any better... or even a god damn submarine if that's what you like. Granted, it's mostly close-quarters.Storywise, it's nothing revolutionnary but it fits well. You follow a linear line up to the bad guys and get em down one by one up until the end. Politicals, bureaucrats, bankers... they all wanted a piece of that cake.The OST ranges from forgettable to annoying, especially when you do a quick takedown and have to stand a minute or so of ""ACTION MUSIC"" for no reason. If there's one downside to the game, this may as well be the one. Nothing too irritating but it certainly ain't the soundtrack of Hitman: Blood Money.Though the game is a rather serious one (shouldn't come up as a surprise considering the protagonist is named Sam), I can garantee you a handful of chuckles to be had. Whether it comes from a stupid mistake you did and alerted all the guards, or one of those on the verge of wetting his pants while being interrogated with a huge knife up his throat.SO DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME? YOU BET YOUR♥♥♥♥♥I DO! Did I mention it also features a COOP CAMPAIGN?It lacks one thing though. Uplay isn't there. Oh wait that's a good thing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still the best game in the serie. It was made when AAA stealth games were actually challenging, and punished you hard for going full rambo. The plot isn't really memorable, it's your average action movie scenario involving really bad guys and your witty american hero saving the day. Nonetheless, Sam Fisher is a character you'll find easy to like, and can make you crack a smile.When it comes to gameplay, it's kinda frightnening to notice how rigid it is, how the game got old. It gives you everything you would expect for a good stealth game, a lot of possibilities, some alternate routes, and a heavy dose of ""waiting in the shadows hoping for that guy not to see you"".Graphics-wise, it's holding up. When the game came out, it was one of the most beautiful thing I had laid my eyes on, it really blew me. It was on par with all the AAA games that came out at this time, maybe better.Soundtrack was composed by Amon Tobin. Yep, Amon Tobin. As a result, Chaos Theory has an atmosphere no other Splinter Cell game has, and god, they wish they had it. It's a real pleasure to lurk in the dark, your knife ready to stab Generic soldier#54 with a stressful, sometimes a bit creepy, note from the wonderful soundtrack. And co-op has to be the best co-op experience I ever had on any game. It's challenging, it requires communication, and you can climb inside a vent by touching your partner in places you wouldn't even have thought about in the first place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nearing it's 12th year and still the king. And Ubisoft is still making imposter Tom Clancy games. I will update this every year until that changes. 10/10If I said SC 1 was better than SC Blacklist in every way, and SC2 is better than SC1, then how could I possibly describe how good Chaos Theory is? I'll try. -I have to constantly remind myself that this was an Xbox (gen 6) game, because it looks better than half the game that come out today. Look up the forums for some sweet graphic improvements as well, It looks absolutely stunning on my rig at 1440p. Nothing is overdone, nothing is neglected. It's a balance that is unheard of these days. -The controls and interface have been perfected, enemies are smart and have a great deal of dialogue, and the story is amazing because this was from back in a day when having ""Tom Clancy's"" before your title actually meant something. War breaking out in Korea is a pretty memorable moment, and I love how Sam talks about all the friends he has in the Army's 2rd Infantry Division, which is stationed right there at the DMZ. THAT IS CALLED IMMERSION Ubisoft.  -Going 100% Ghost is super satisfying, but the game also has moments where it's hard NOT to want to kill the enemies your facing when you see what they are up to. That's part of the job I guess, you have to put personal feelings aside. -If Ubisoft wants to make SC7 a Game of the Year again, all they have to do is thoroughly go back through CT, recreate those same mechanics, and start the rest from there. There is really no excuse for making another Conviction or Blacklist and trying to pass it as a Tom Clancy Splinter Cell game. Is it not enough that they've already ruined Ghost Recon and Rainbow 6?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Haven't played that far into the PC version, but I write as someone who played about half the game on PSN, and by far, this is the definite version of Splinter Cell Chaos Theory.Coming from PSN to PC is like night and day. Using the mouse wheel to control movement speed while crouched? Lightning fast load times and quick saves? Zero lag or framerate issues? Smoother animations and more precise controls? It's like playing a whole new game. Maybe I'll finally be able to ghost every level.As for the game itself, Hitman Blood Money introduced me to stealth, but Chaos Theory cemented the genre as one of my favorites. This is the best stealth game I've played on any platform, and nothing is more than thrilling than moving through the darkness as Sam Fisher, enemies mere inches away. Fantastic level design makes this is my favorite in the series			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a little bit of tinkering with the AA via the AMD Pro or Nvidia control panel. Also to play with a contoller follow these steps to a T.

												Probably best in SC series. This one is the most polished version of the classic splinter cells. It allows for more playstyles adding leathal and non-leathal takedowns and allowing player to take enemies more directly. You are still very vulnerable in a fight but you do have an option of quickly charging your opponent when discovered and hoping to stun or kill him before he shots you. The level design tries to give more options. While the game still is highly linear there are multiple paths to the same objective giving a bit more sense of freedom and choice. The side objective in every mission also add to the replayability.There is also coop mode which is quite fun, while far from perfect and multiplayer versus mod which I never had chance to try. Overall a really good package.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chaos Theory. Without any question my favorite Stealth Game of all times.It got everything you want in a game, an awesome Story, really good graphics (especially for 2005) and it just makes fun. You can play it a hundred times and it won't get boring.Sneaking with Sam Fisher around the world, from Peru to Tokyo, is extremely fun and I can't stop loving this game, with it's awesome lightning, great characters and a cool Soundtrack.Story:""In June 2007, tensions are running high between China, North Korea, South Korea and Japan, due to Japan's formation of an Information Self Defense Force (I-SDF). Considering this to be a violation of Article 9 of the post-World War II Constitution, and blaming the I-SDF for information warfare attacks against their countries, Chinese and North Korean forces establish a blockade in the Yellow Sea against Japanese shipping. Because Japan is an ally of the United States, and thus the NSA's Third Echelon, the U.S. Navy dispatches a highly-advanced warship, the USS Clarence E. Walsh (CG-80), to the Yellow Sea with the hopes that China and North Korea will back down at its presence.""If you are into Stealth Games...what am I saying...even if you're not, try it out. It is one of the best Games ever created. I love Ubisoft Montreal for that. It makes me happy, I love it.You have to buy it. It is worth every single penny. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As pretty much everyone has already said, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is by far the best Splinter Cell game in the series, beats out conviction and blacklist easy.To this date there has not been a stealth game that has surpassed this, just like there hasnt been a Ghost Recon game to surpass Ghost Recon 1 and 2, it was the last of the stealth games that didnt have any assists and were just pure gameplay without tutorials poppin up in your face every 2 seconds, not to mention the soundtrack by Amon Tobin is absoultely phenomenal, I really miss games like this, and I truly wish we had more of them.10/10 You would be doing yourself a disservice by not getting this game and playing it.

Perfect stealth gameChaos theory is the best splinter cell game and arguably one of the best stealth games ever created.The story is somewhat realistic and interesting. Tensions are running high as North Korea is threatening an all out war against America and her allies. You play as Sam Fisher, an ex-SEAL member now a 'cell' (spy) working for the a top secret sub-branch within the National Security Agency (NSA). It's your job to uncover who is behind jeopardising the relationship between the two countries and risking all out war.The gameplay is the best component of the game. Before each mission you get a briefing with other members of Third Eschalon and their allies telling you the task and situation of the mission. You then get to select your loadout based on 'Stealth' (more stealth equipment like smoke grenades and sticky cameras), 'Assault' (More assault rifle ammo and frag grenades) or 'Reddington' (Mixture of the other two) which affects the types of equipment you will have and how much of each item you carry with you. The three options of equipment speak for themselves on how you want to approach the mission. The equipment you may have include the sileneced assault rifle, silenced pistol, sticky cameras, smoke grenades, stun grenades, frags etc. The objectives in each mission will generally require you to steal, sabotage or eliminate a target. As a 'splinter cell game' stealth gameplay is highly recommended. Besides hiding in the shadows, a new element plays a role in in the gameplay, noise. Creating too much noise (more than the ambient sound in the area which is indicated by a bar on your hud) will now cause foes to detect you which may include gun noises, broken glass and movement. As such, you can control your walking speed (which increases noise as it increases) via the scrolling the mouse wheel. The final element to the gameply is manipulating electronics via your pistol. By aiming your pistol and pressing right mouse button you can turn off an electronic device for a few seconds. The purpose of this is to not destroy the item and hence, alerting the gaurds. You can go all guns blazing in most of the missions, but this is not recommended as it not only ruins the atmosphere of the game, but you  die very quickly in frontal combat. As per usual you can eliminate gaurd using lethal force or non-lethal force. Shooting gaurds is lethal as well as choosing the lethal option when grabing them from behind. Non-lethal involves choosing non-lethal ammo and knocking gaurds out after grabbing them. Another new element to the gampley is the ability to quickly walk up to gaurds and knock them out/kill them, which helps when your about to be spotted at close range.The level design is excellent. Each level is big and unique, spotting plenty of places places to hide in such as shadows. Furthermore, there are more than one route to reach objectives including vents, doors, tunnels etc. The graphics has also aged well and looks pleasant. Finally the levels are so well designed that you can go through the entire game without killing/knocking out anyone and not being detected either.The audio is good. Voice actors (especially Sam) do a great job at instilling the emotions of the current situation. Weapon sound are also good as well. Each level has a unique track that is played while stealthed and while being spotted. Each level has a unique soundtrack for the the previous two situations, so you won't get bored from hearing the same tarck over and over again.If you want one of the best stealth games ever made, chaos theory will not dissapoint you.

												Truly the most thorough and polished stealth game to date. Chaos Theory is a game for hardcore fans of the stealth genre and, frankly, not for the high-octane gamer. This game is slow, methodical, and punishing if you don't execute your stealth plan to a fine point. Controls are polished, graphics are great (for its time), likable main character, and some laughs along the way. Arguably the best in the Splinter Cell series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tom Calancy is probably spinning in his grave as he watches Ubisoft furiously ram their #girlwood down his vidya legacy's throat. This was arguably the last good Splinter Cell game depending on how you feel about Double Agent and one of the last passable games with Tom Clancy's name plastered on it for licensing shekels.Still holds up despite being over ten years old, the KB/M controls work fine but you should probably invest in a controller for this one because using the scroll wheel to control your walking speed is like letting a mouse trap clamp down on your nipples in sub-zero temperatures. Multiplayer still works natively on PC as far as I know and it beats Konami's Pachinko Gear Cashcow: Online any day. Co-Op campaign is great and had an interesting mechanic if you're using a microphone to distract guards, unfortunately unless you're still using Windows XP in-game voice chat doesn't work so you'll probably never use it.Overall its still one of the best stealth games out there. Support team banter thats self-aware and doesn't take itself too seriously despite the shlocky 'political intrigue' storyline thats in every TC game, great missions with multiple approaches, fantastic competitive multiplayer and co-operative campaign. If only Ubisoft still gave a damn about the quality of their products.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy this damn game. Seriously. Even if you have not tried or played many games in the genre, this would be a fantastic one to start with. I haven't even tried co-op or Versus yet but the singleplayer experience is easily above any other Splinter Cell out there and in general is one of the most engaging ones I've played through. The level design, environments, sound direction... everything about the single player is spot on. Hearing the enemies talk to themselves as you creep around with the phenomenal soundtrack really gets you pumped.This is a big step up from the previous two titles. In my opinion, all the other future SC titles strayed too much from its original playstyle and feel, especially at Conviction and Blacklist. While those may appeal more to some people, and may be great games in their own right, they do not come close to offering the most 'Splinter Cell-like' experience as they focus a little more on action.If you're looking for a great stealth game to play try this one out. The environments, the native language feature (which I love) and the fluid animations of Sam really immerse you in the situation, and the soundtrack only makes it better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really want to love this game. It's one of the best stealth driven games ever made. The other positive reviews can explain all the good points about this game.But there's just one problem: This game was designed for consoles, and the keyboard + mouse controls are ridiculously awkward. Where console players just need to tilt their analog sticks, you need to manually adjust your movement speed with the mouse wheel. Where console players can have context senstitive controls, you can only designate each key to one action. It's frustrating when the game can't be enjoyed due to technical problems like this, which begs the question: Why not enable full controller support to fix all this?Well, the lack of full controller support for this game really hurts, because now you have to go and install a bunch of other programs just to get the game to recognize controller input as if it was coming from a keyboard and mouse. It's a massive headache, especially when it doesn't work or requires programs that aren't free...To be clear, this negative review is NOT concerning the game itself. It is criticizing the fact that this is a very lazy port of a console game. No controller support and super awkward controls make an otherwise excellent game VERY frustrating.The day Ubisoft actually gives a damn about their games and enables controller support for this one I will change my review to positive.Sadly, knowing how Ubisoft operates, that day won't likely ever come.Edit: It seems the Xbox 360/One controller, as well as the PS4 controller (which is recognized as a 360 controller by programs such as DS4Windows) may give you more success than I did with a PS3 controller. Unfortunately I can no longer test that because I refunded the game after my initial review to avoid the hassle.I still believe full controller support would improve this game, but it seems that you may be able to get it to work with those controllers. I definitely recommend testing it before you keep this game to make sure it works as intended (because if you can get it to work, you will be treated to one of the best stealth games of all time :D )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best Splinter Cell game in the series, i would recommend it to everyone that loves stealth and mission impossible.Pros:Good LevelsStory is decent (You need to play the others to get it tho)Soundtracks are awsomeAlot of funCo-op is awsome and very nice designed for 2 playersCons:The controls are kinda hard but you will get used to itPlus you are forced to play on 4:3 because the hacking device would be to big and you can'tsee few codes.I am NOT a Splinter Cell expert but i am also not a beginner, i love the series and you will too if you like stuff like Hitman or such.The game is the best from all the Splinter Cell series with the levels, i also love Sam Fishers english voice because it sounds badass.If you are up for an challenge i would dare you to play it on expert and blind (Not looking stuff up).I would rate this game a 9.5/10 since its (G)old, also for people that want better graphics there is a Shader 3.0 support.For 10$ the game is pretty good and its worth the money, still i would recommend you to play also the first game ""Splinter Cell Stealth Action Redefined"" to get into the mechanics and controls.Since Ubisoft closed the Servers for the game (which is sad) you can only play via LAN with your buddy CO-OP or Versus using Tunngle or Hamachi.Thanks for reading this review this far and i hope i helped you to decide.

												What to say about Chaos Theory. This is the franchise favorite to date by fans. The 110% perfect mix of stealth, action, and graphics. Sam Fisher spares no expense. Weapons, loadout options, resources, and of course the three dot night vision goggles. This game was also the first to offer a coop story mode. I am a hardcore SC fan, and if you are on edge about getting involved in this franchise and don't want to spend the money on the newest installments without knowing what they are like. Choas Theory is the way to go. This game is new enough the graphics won't drive you nuts, and if you like stealth/action with lots of options for sneaking past or eliminating targets. This is the starting point for you. After you play this, you'll definately want the Conviction and Blacklist follow up games, and who knows maybe you'll say ""screw the graphics, I wanna know more about this guys story"" and go back to SC one and follow the whole story. Either way, this game is epic and no one will convince me otherwise. I rate this one EPIC A+++...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is considered my favorite game of all time, and to make sure I have your attention now I'll tell you why :-Awesome storyline-Chaos theory has the best multiplayer of any splinter cell -There are co-op missions that me and my cousin spent countless hours on (unfortunately the PC port doesn't have it... for some dumb reason). -The gameplay is amazing as there is never one way to get through a scenario-The graphics are still relevant to today's high tech worldNow the detailed explanation.The storyline is epic. Why is it epic? Splinter cell series has always been known to have a crazy or sort of conspiracy storyline, chaos theory delivers a lot more than that. Two lead programmers that cracked Philippe Masse's kernals from the first splinter cell have enhanced his algorithms and now could be used for any electronic warfare, be it military or economic. One of these programmers is discovered dead early in the game, and the other one on the loose... the story just begins to exponentially get better from there.The multiplayer was my favorite in this game as it gave me everything I wanted. I want to play online ... okay go ahead. I want to play with my friend on the same screen or at my house and he at his... fine go ahead. Want to play competitively as a spy? Fine. Want to play as a guard and take down spies with a first person view.... heck the devs cared so much they did this too. When someone really gives an effort to really allow any sort of play when it comes to multiplayer, it's greatly appreciated. I would say the gameplay of this game is arguably the best type out there. The physics/engine in this one is what would one expect from a third game of the series. I would argue that still to this day even though there are other Splinter Cell's out there, this one still has the best game engine. The soft body touches, the noise system, throwing of objects to make noise, ability to whistle, use the SC-20K it's sniping/assault attachment or it's launcher attachments, the grenade types (frag, flash, smoke), the three different goggle settings (heat, night vision, ECM), ability to either knock out or kill an opponent... there's quite a bit of things to mention. I like the fact you are given a choice of going through vents or alternate ways to avoid conflict or can go through conflict, or one by one slowly ""put to sleep and hide the bodies"" conflict. The greatest improvement though compared to the first splinter cell is that there is flexibility in the proximity system. When one is close to the enemy, they don't ultimately see/feel you just because they walked past you going through a doorway. This game is fantastic in how you are able to knock someone out or kill someone before they can react. This was a major breakthrough in the series.How are the graphics still good for an original x-box game? Well how's 1980X1080 sound? Probably the best we can get unless someone goes through the entire game and re-does it... but there wouldn't be much to redo. The cut scenes are still awesome, and the game play graphics are just as good as any game. You will not have an issue with graphics playing this. Sounds? Pshhh, probably the best of the series as well. Everything sounds accurate from gun shots to dialogue. Listen carefully to hear Sam make remarks as he moves about or the guards talking about some random topic. I would highly recommend this game, on sale or not as it is still to this day my favorite game. I'm not being biased in my rating as it being my favorite game, but this game is what took the gaming industry to another level. Thief, Assassins Creed or any of that wouldn't have been without Splinter Cell. Rocksolid 9.5/10. Gameplay A+ Story / Campaign A Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music A- Replay-ability B+ Overall  APS - Because I didn't know where to fit this - relevant characters from cutscenes also breif you before going on a misison on top of team members of the echelon. Not only that, Michael Ironside does the voice of Sam Fisher with perfection. He literally is Sam Fisher and makes the series what it is. The guy who played Fisher in conviction just stunk up the joint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game, On its own damn ground, IS THE BEST Splinter Cell you'll ever play, The atmosphere, voice acting, gameplay, story line, graphics and mechanics go so well togheter its like the meat in the ♥♥♥♥ing dinner. Alright now, being an ""old Splinter Cell veteran"", ever since the first Splinter Cell back in the days, I find this game the best of the series. Let me break it down for you. :) You are Sam Fisher a loving father ever so protective over his daughter, you got a dark sense of humour, and your character is voiced by Michael Ironside, and you literally scare the hell out of anyone you interrogate. You're working for the NSA's Sub Agency called Third Echelon (Later in Blacklist 4th Echelon). And you're under the program of field operatives or mind you Black Ops then I mean the blackest of the Black Ops, callsign code ""Splinter Cell"" Or refference from the game, you're also known as a ""Sigint Ninja"" in other words a Spy. You are the most secret asset the US Government have, If you get caught or killed you officially and unofficialy doesent exist.  The Year is 2007 June: Tensions are running high between China, North Korea, South Korea and Japan, due to Japan's formation of an Information Self Defense Force (I-SDF). It was and Is a considerate violation of Article 9 of the Post-World War II Constitution, and blaming the I-SDF for information warfare attacks against their countries, Chinese and North Korean forces establish a blockade in the Yellow Sea against Japanese shipping. Because Japan is an ally of the United States, and thus the NSA's Third Echelon, the U.S. Navy dispatches a highly advanced warship, the USS Clarence E. Walsh (CG-80), to the Yellow Sea with the hopes that China and North Korea will back down at its presence.Dont Worry No Spoilers here just giving you the same briefing as you will see in the first mission here. You are dispatched of to a Lighthouse on the Talara, Peru coastline, To locate Bruce Morgenholt, an American computer programmer who has been captured by a Peruvian separatist group called ""The People's Voice"", led by El Salvadorian revolutionary, Hugo Lacerda. Morgenholt was working on deciphering the Phillip Masse's weaponized algorithms, who had been assassinated by Fisher (in Splinter Cell). The resulting Masse Kernels are being touted as the superweapon of the 21st century. Fisher is tasked with making sure they do not fall into the wrong hands.Alright this is the very fist Splinter Cell game where the Tri-Vision Modes where introduced, WAIT, NOT Tri-Goggles but vision! In the 2 first Splinter Cell's (Splinter Cell and Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow), You had only two vision modes Black and White Night Vision and Thermal, However in this game it reintroduces the Night Vision capabilities with a updated, Green Shade Vision Night Vision, Pretty much the same Thermal Vision and lastly the real change the ElectroMagnetic Field Vision (EMF). EMF is used to spot Cameras and other electronical gear you can use for your advantage IE. Distractions. This is also the first title of the Series where you can use a Knife to kill your enemies with :D and also introducing certain kits you can grab with you, Foregrip Attachment (a More stable shot with your rifle) Shotgun Attachment (Secondary firing mode, ♥♥♥♥ing reks anyone near you) Sniper Attachment (High powered anti material attachment that will ONE hit anything from long range and even through certain walls!). and you can just as easily take off the attachment and go back to the Standard Launcher Attachment. Like you never had those attachments haha, But mind you gears are only presets you cant grab whatever you want of what quantity (sadly). More to the atmosphere of the game. This game HAS AMAZING music soundtracks made by Amon Tobin. Here let me give you a link to a playlist

 Listen to it and you can just sense the tensity and the need of UTTER Silence and Stealth, The Mysterious aspects of this game just amplifies up.  More on to voice acting. fantastic when you have Michael Ironside voicing Sam Fisher, and all of the other main characters have great voice acting, and not to mention the NPC's or Goons that you can Interrogate, hahaha alot of twisted humour here and reverse psychology and just plain trolling when Sam talks to them. Some panic and pee their pants, other tries to act tough but fails, and some are just stupid. You will have a Stealth rating in this game and also a Sound level that you emit when you walk around according to your surroundings, like if you're in thunder storm, the ambient sound will be alot higher meaning you can make more noise without being heard than you would when being inside in a room where the sound level is far less than outside, Of course if you run like a ♥♥♥♥ing retard past a guard despite the ambient sound HE WILL hear you. What kind of flooring or ground you walk on affects how much sound you produce, when walking around and it does affect it alot. This game also introduces a new difficulty Elite Mode, Where you only have your Knife, OCP and wits to beat the levels. ALSO Controls are TIGHT as♥♥♥♥, real pleasure to move about in this game! huge plus on that. Multiplayer? Well yes, Coop and Versus mode, in Coop you are Two Spies, dubbed ""Steve and Bob"", or Agent One and Agent Two, set in the same storyline as Official/Unofficial Splinter Cell's in Training you are inserted into War thorn Seol. Its in the same setting where Sam Fisher just independently played from the main campaign but you however assist Sam Fisher in completing his tasks and also taking on tasks where a lone Splinter Cell cant do the job. Versus Mode, (2vs2) You can more or less say its a rebooted version of the Pandora Tomorrow Versus, with slightly updated Graphics and new gadgets and gear and maps, However there are not many players left in the Official servers anymore or none at all, So if you want you can sign up for this Steam Group we do have a few nights where we play Versus. here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/intelectualproperty.  Graphics: Great for its time and it still has better Graphics than some modern games today. Okay enough ""Theory"" crafting is the game WORTH IT? Yes definently, One of the few games without a doubt straight from the box I can recommend. But sadly there are downsides to this game. It is not moddable, but thank lord there exist alot of Map Packs for the Versus mode, and workarounds on spesific problems you may bump into. The good side again you dont need UPlay to play this game (YOU WOOT MATE, THIS IS MADE BY UBISOFT!) I know m9, this game dont have cancer like the rest of the UPlay affected games. Pros and Cons: Pros                       -Fantastic Storyline-Coop and Versus Mode-Atmospheric Setting -Superb Voice Acting-Lots of Choices and Approaches you can do-LAST of the Legendary Splinter Cell title that lived up to its nameCons-Non Moddable-Almost no players in Versus modeWell there not many cons with this game, But they can limit the replayability value over the course of time. Thank you for reading my review and have a lovely day, Or atleast try to make it better if you have a bad day, Cheers!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
 Does it have a premise? You're Sam Fisher, at this point, veteran Third Echelon covert operative. Tensions are rising in Asia, mainly between Japan and North Korea. Do your job, sneak and defuse this situation. You're not going to earn a medal. Nobody knows what you did except for you and your handlers. How does it play? This is  one of the very best stealth games to ever exist , only second to the two original Thief series. The sound you make is properly emulated, accounted for and displayed. There are no obviously broken light levels, unlike the original Splinter Cell. It provides you with difficulty options that are tailored for the average stealth player, the type of person who knows the game by heart and the masochist. You have several ways of approaching each level. Maps are built like actual places, with several, unplanned ways in and out that you can utilize. You also have a choice between lethal and non-lethal, though killing people does take away from your overall score. Does it have music?  Why, yes. It's by far  the best soundtrack in a Splinter Cell title , each and every track is memorable and just fantastic. Does it have co-op? This game has great co-op, transporting the original solo experience to co-op almost perfectly. The only problem is that it is way too short. Given more levels, this would be a perfect co-op mode for one of the finest stealth games.Oh and also, servers are down, so you'll have to use a third-party service that emulates LAN servers. Does it have multiplayer? ...it's bad. It is far more about rushing out and killing your opponent than actual stealth. Also, you can't play it without the hassle of setting up. If you haven't played this and have no nostalgia for it, don't even bother. Who should play this? It's a must-play for any stealth game enthusiast. It's also a must-play for anyone who wants to get into stealth games. It's a must play for anyone who hasn't played it, for it is one of the video games that I would honestly call a master work. It has only one notable blemish, and it's more of a side addition you have the choice to skip completely. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is amazing how a 12 year old game can hold up for this long.For many including myself. Chaos Theory has been the defining chapter in this franchise. The one that all other chapters are compaired to. For me, Chaos Theory improved upon the concept from the first two titles and made a defining atmosphere in which we the player actually feel like a super spy when we play. Much like Theif and Metal Gear and how those franchises defined the genre, Chaos Theory added new elements that would help define future stealth gameplay.I think the reason why so many hold this title to be the best Splinter Cell is because it was followed by Double Agent which forked off into a more casual style of stealth. Which continued further up the line with Conviction. Blacklist, while still holding the causal aspect introduced with Double Agent. Did try to re-focus on the core of the franchise and what made it great.I remeber getting the demo disk in an issue of Xbox Magazine which consisted of the Lighthouse mission. I was so captivated by it that by the time the game actually released. I had played that mission hundreds of times. What really made this game for me though was the introduction of co-op. Something that I had always wanted to do in Splinter Cell. I enjoyed Chaos Theory so much that it was a staple in LAN parties with my group for several years.I bought this on Steam a few years ago and never got around to playing it. Having just recently garnered an interest in going back and playing all the old titles, I remembered that I had this in my library. While the game itself is 12 years old, I do like how it looks on PC. It's no Witcher 3, but for a 2005 title. It looks damn good in my opinion.Controls took some getting used to for me. I was so used to playing this game on a controller that it felt alien for me to play on mouse & keyboard. But I quickly got comfortable after 30 or so minutes. The story is the only thing that I feel to be dated. It's no masterpeice but it gets the job done in getting you hooked. Then again, the story wasn't really Chaos Theory's main driving point either in what made it popular.So far I have been enjoying it. That rush of nostalgia that I get with every favorable spot and event puts a smile on my face. The gameplay is something that I wish the following titles kept. I hope the next instalment goes back to the franchise's roots and brings back the Splinter Cell we all know and love.I highly recommend this game for anyone looking to get a feel on what Splinter Cell has been about. What once was a defining title in the stealth genre. It still looks, sounds, plays, and feels like a fun and enjoyable game even after all these years. It also has a good degree of difficulty if you want to achieve 100% Ghost statistics on the missions. So it will offer a nice challenge too if that's what you're looking for.You are also still able to play the co-op and Spy vs Merc MP by using Hamachi or Tunggle. So that's a plus as well.

												this was one of my favorite games on ps2, and i like it even better on pc. way better picture quality (obviously on a monitor rather than an old tv). same solid soundtrack by Amon Tobin. i've read in the forums that there's no controller support or buggy controls, this has not been the case for me, using a logitech f710 it is exactly the same as the ps2 controls. there's quite a few changes i wasn't expecting. some small, like random lights being missing or in a different spot, but some bigger ones (i'm assuming because they didn't need to seperate areas of the map with load screens for pc), it seems that some routes have been closed off and other ones opened up. even whole other areas you have to find to complete optional objectives that weren't there in the playstation version. also quicksave is a nice addition especially if you've already played the game a bunch of times and want to coast through it a bit.there are some issues with the game working at all, but check the forums if you need to. i had to temporarily opt out of the steam beta to get the game to load, and quite a few others have said the same.definitely recommended for any fan of stealth/tactical espionagebtw i never played the multiplayer in the ps2 or this version, so i can't comment on that...

												Where do I start with this masterpiece of a game?Well...There are not really any negatives aside from one thing but we will get to that later.Good thingsThe stealth elements in the game are amazingThe AI is good for an old gameThe voice acting is top notch and sometimes very funnyMission design is truly outstanding; you are able to approach the missions in any way you want e.g. non-lethal or lethalStory is fantastic gives you that espionage Mission Impossible/James Bond kind of vibe but way coolerSam Fisher (the protagonist) is just a complete legend with Michael Ironside voicing himPlaying on the normal difficulty alone is punishingly hard if you play carelessly so you are encouraged to be sneakyAnimations are greatGraphics are pretty good for it's timeDifferent loadouts to select in the pre-mission screen to fit your play styleAnd simply great character designThe ONE bad thingI used to play this on the original Xbox and therefore I used a controller. Hence, I would like to play it with a controller once again but just on the PC. However, the controller settings are absolutely screwed on the default game due to certain buttons not actually doing what they are supposed to do e.g. X (on a Xbox 360 controller) is performing the actions of A to select things in game. To counter this I had to download a gamepad profiler called Pinnacle Game Profiler to sort this out which to me is unnecessary and Ubisoft should of sorted this since it is after all, 11 years after release...However, saying all this I would definitely recommend this game! It's a 10/10 for me and simply one of the greatest stealth games ever made. Period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has always been and will always be my personal favorite in the Splinter Cell series. The stealth gameplay here is phenomenal, challenging, and has a greater sense of believability than later entries. If you have played Conviction and/or Blacklist, be warned: those games are much faster paced than Chaos Theory. Chaos Theory requires a great deal more patience and the action is less flashy, but you feel like a genuine badass picking off enemies from the shadows. This is only accented by the game's difficulty level; it is a challenging game, especially on harder difficulties, but I never found it to be unfair.The level design is very well done here across the board (single player, co-op, and versus modes all taken into consideration) and offer a variety of paths to complete your mission. There is also plenty of variety in the settings for these levels, from lighthouses to cruise ships to banks. The graphics for this game were phenomenal for the time and still hold up surprisingly well (particularly shadows and lighting effects), although character models can tend to look very ""blah"" compared to today's standards. The audio is honestly one of my favorite parts of the game. The music is great and fits the in-game tension perfectly, the voice actors  did a great job and have some funny dialogue, and Michael Ironside will ALWAYS be the true voice of Sam Fisher. Good lord, that voice.The multiplayer in this game is phenomenal too. The versus mode is a fun ""Spies vs. Mercenaries"" mode where spies, who sneak around in third-person, attempt to hack information from terminals while the more lethally equipped mercenaries (who are controlled like a first-person shooter) attempt to stop them. It's an entertaining game of cat and mouse. The co-op mode also has it's own completely separate campaign from the single player version; however, it upholds the same standards of level design, challenge, and fun. I'm a big fan of co-op games and this is among the very best, in my opinion.**An important note on the multiplayer: The Ubisoft servers for this game are down and you will be unable to play if you attempt to log in directly online through the game. There is a VERY easy workaround for this, however. I am currently using software called Evolve that allows you to create a virtual LAN connection with other friends, which allows you to play this game online through the LAN menu. I am mentioning this  because it's free and I truly think it is worth the time.**Honestly, there's a lot to love here. Over the years this quickly became one of my all-time favorite games and still is to this day. If you are a fan of stealth games or you're simply looking for a challenge, I am certain you will adore this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

First Impressions/Thoughtstldr; Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is not a perfect game - but as old as it is, you can find it surprisingly fun to play and fairly easy to get into.The Gameplay - Fundamental ChangesChaos Theory on is focused mainly on sneaking and getting from point A to D. You will occasionally be lockpicking doors, hacking, hiding bodies, interrogating enemies, etc. Killing isn't a necessity to progress, either. Feel free to speedrun through (most) levels as a pacifist!Graphical Fidelity - DirectX Support, Overall QualityThere are several video options regarding quality. It supports HDR, Shader Model 3.0, Anisotrophic Filtering, Anti-Aliasing, and such. This includes widescreen-monitor support as well. Unfortunately, Versus Mode is completely different - locked at 30 frames, only supports DirectX 8, no 16:9/16:10 ratio support, various missing or unincluded game options, and overall a huge disadvantage. It is most similiar to Pandora Tomorrow in terms of quality and gameplay elements.The Community - Servers, GamespyMy only problem with the game that remains is the lack of players. The modding community on the other hand is still fairly active. In another note, Gamespy servers have been long since shut down, and much of the fanbase has moved on, especially after Splinter Cell: Blacklist was released in 2013. You will likely notice less than 15 players a day in Versus lobbies, and an even smaller number of players in CO-OP lobbies. I recommend bringing some friends along to ease the stress of waiting and finding more games to join.Final Rating - What It DeservesThe game deserves my overall 9/10 rating. I've never given a game such a high rating, and my expectations have always been rather high for most games. It's worth it. Bear in mind that it isn't perfect, and it still has it's fair share of issues to this day. But it is *the* perfect stealth game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A few years ago I was going through an old footlocker and realized I had the box to this game (disc lost long ago) and plunked the key into Steam.  I was a PC gamer when Metal Gear was entering the 3D polygon era and while I did enjoy the VR Missions entry, I never had much interest in that series because while I owned the consoles for every generation, there were very few games I absolutely had to have.  The original Splinter Cell came out and I was amazed with how the stealth elements translated so well from games like Tenchu to the world of guns and electronic gadgets.  Pandora Tomorrow followed it up sort of well, but not many people loved it (including myself).  Chaos Theory is what I consider to be the final entry in the series- it took everything that made the first two games great and gave it a gorgeous graphics and mechanics update, and took the story in a direction that was compelling and interesting.  Every level has hundreds of different ways to play out, and you have 100% control over most of how that's decided.They lost me after this game, and it's sad.  I tried every game in the series after Chaos Theory but nobody really understands that it might be OK to stick with what works anymore.  A followup to any of the first 3 Splinter Cell games, even HD remasters, would be freakin amazing but sadly, I seriously doubt they'd be handled with care.Chaos Theory is probably the only game that I'd compare to the same enjoyment I got out of the first Tenchu.  It's a shame nobody picked up the core mechanics of this game with more than a haphazard spin of the wheel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some of the most fun I've ever had in the original Splinter Cell Series. Though the graphics may not be as flashy as the new one that is Blacklist, it certainly is much more fun and more challenging. Also I missed the interogations you could have with the guards you grab and having the weirdest responses from them. And that's only the single player part. Co-op is great if you have a friend to play along with. Overall a real fun stealth game, one of the best...if not the best in the entire series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The undisputed peak of stealth perfection in the Splinter Cell series. For every game series there is always one game that can be crowned as simply the best. This. Is. IT! This game has more stealth and tension in just one level than half the Metal Gear games combined. Reactive and realistic AI. Multiple ways to complete missions harkening back to the days of Deus Ex. Not to mention the game's unbelievable audio where in some instances the ambiance can actually mask the player's sound allowing for even richer gameplay. This game is the perfect spy simulator with a story that is worthy of the Tom Clancy name. If you want to see what good games Ubisoft used to make before running this franchise into the ground, look no further. What are you doing still reading this? Play the damn game already!!!!

												Remains one of the best stealth games ever made, and still one of the best games of all time really. Easily the best in the Splinter Cell series, this is in my top 5 favorite games ever. Every element this game aims for, it achieves perfectly. The graphics are amazing for the time, the gameplay is fantastic and requires patience and skill, and the map design actually allows some exploration but keeps things focused. It's pretty laughable at times when it drops dates ""this is 2008... the future!"" but as a game it works unbelievably well. It's the most balanced when it comes to combat vs stealth, in that it's very realistic in how it handles it. If someone catches you off guard, they can kill you pretty much instantly, but the same goes for all the enemies.Playing the newer installments, it's sad how simple they've become. It's not a simple ""it's new so it sucks thing"", this one is better than the older installments. It has just the right balance of skill requirement vs being accessible and holds up the best. You have to manage how well you're lit up or how loud you are compared to the environment masking your footsteps, but it's easy to do and incredibly rewarding once you master it. Some games like the Hitman series or the newer Splinter Cell installments don't really do the stealth elements well enough to really get into it, but this game achieves it perfectly. You do need to stay hidden but it's fun and worth it to get that badass feeling of coming out of the shadows with your knife, or whistling to get a guards attention and snap his neck from a pipe above as he nears you. Co-op missions are decent if you have a friend to play it with, but the story mode is the main focus as it should be. The soundtrack, dark visuals, and excellent stealth gameplay are just amazing. If you're into stealth games especially, I recommend this. It isn't an action shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Splinter Cell ever.I have all splinter cell.A Must play if you\'re a stealth games fan.WHY?This one is what splinter cell is meant to be.-Slow Pace Gameplay like what Stealth game should be, No Executions, no last position advantage like Conviction or Blacklist. When you\'re spotted you\'re as good as dead./-More Interrogation than Any of Splinter cell combined. It makes the game more immersive.-More Realistic enemy than SC1 and SCPT. Not like when you got attention of 1 enemy the whole base look at your position. -Story is more of a suspense and Spy-ish than Conviction and Blacklist where it\'s full of Melodrama and cliches.-Funny dialogues. Just LOLOnly problem now is this game aged too much. Nobody likes slow pace stealth game anymore.9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best Splinter Cell game in the series. The gameplay and controls work so well on the PC, which is surprising considering the fact that Ubisoft is notorious about porting to PC. This version of the game is the superior one as it has Shader Model 3 graphics effects, which isn't even present in the HD remaster version of the game on PS3 so you get stuff like parallax mapping, HDR, tone mapping, and high-quality shadow mapping (it's actually second best to Blacklist for those standards). I mean the graphics are just amazing like the original Splinter Cell on steroids and it still amazes me to this day that Sam's suit changes from a silhouette black to a reflective material when outside in rain. The story is like your typical Splinter Cell game where there is this super bad guy trying to hurt America and so you, Sam Fisher, have to save the world once again. This time there is a plot twist but I won't spoil it. In this game, there is now more interrogations than having to read boring data sticks from previous games. Some of them are actually pretty funny. Back in the day, there were more game modes available that include co-op and Versus mode but it's pretty much irrelevant at this point as I can no longer get a game going. For the price today I suggest you pick up this game as it's stealth at the finest level polish. To my surprise, half of the effects this game uses is not even present in double agent. It's like they just took this engine and just watered it down with higher resolution textures and higher poly models.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is an interactive erotic novel about Sam Fisher, a man in skintight rubbersuits who loves to get shouted at from his master Lambert and his assistant Grimsdottir.Together they travel to exotic locations like a japaneese bathhouse and cuddle with the armed men inside that would love to give Sam a nice reach around. But since Sam hasnt fully gotten out of the closet yet, he rather has intressting conversations with the lovely eastern men who will only give you information if you please them enough.I really enjoyed this game, although I wonder what Ubisoft has done to their Splinter Cell series, so far I havnt seen any espinage action in this game, I am also curious about the lustmeter because no matter how much I strangle the slaves they never seem to give in.I would recommend this game to everyone who is looking for an interactive documentary on the BDSM scene in Asia11/10 would wank again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

General GameplayTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is a third-person stealth game with a somewhat confusing Story in the beginning but wraps up nicely in the end.You'll need a few hours and lots of trial and error until you get a hang of the gameplay (unless you played previous titles), specially because there's no tutorial available.The Manual Saves option where we can save anywhere, make the game less frustrating.Unlike the first title in the series, this game has no major bugs that break the gameplay nor mission progress. The AI looks way more inteligent, and we got some new moves and toys.Gameplay Rating: 3/5EngineUnreal Engine 2.5Graphics OptionsFor a 2005 game it's impressive this game has widescreen support, and it scales nicely. We have have access to pixel shader options (something even modern games don't have), we can change between pixel shader 1, 2 and 3, meaning it supports a huge variety of GPUs.The developers disabled the console and windowed mode for some unknown reason.Graphics QualityThe game suffered a huge improvement in graphics compared to the previous title, the animations are awful though, the first game had way better animations.PerformancePerformance is solid, a toaster can run this game.Engine Rating: 3/5Overall Rating: 6/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs). If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is there an intruder??? (His friend doesn't respond) He dies, by my hand. Great multiplayer, great co-op, and a great single-player. A ♥♥♥♥♥ feels like a ghost, from Halo, when playing this game. Zoomin' and Shootin' n'♥♥♥♥♥♥ but reading this will most likely leave the average mind amazed... no-not really, more like confused. ANYWAY! Get this game, and don't try to shoot those communists in the head, most likely communists are from the matrix, and can weave bullets the way ♥♥♥♥♥ weaves water.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A stone cold classic, the best in the Splinter Cell series by far and I enjoy all those games. It's one of those games that transcend the series they're in and become well loved even by people who aren't fans of the series. The graphics and mechanics were ahead of their time for 2005, and the story is the perfect balance of seriousness without taking itself too seriously like titles later on in the series. Grab it when its on sale, it will be sure to put a smile on your face.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down one of the best stealth games ever made and the last great Splinter Cell game. The single player story isn't all that amazing but it does it's job. What you're here for is the levels and interactions in them. The game much like the two before it are centered around stealth, so you get the true experience, none of that third person shooter crap from later games. The co-op is also great having it's own campaign and you don't need uplay to play with a friend online! Plenty of fun to be had here. And make sure you pick up the original too! Sadly the second one Pandora Tomorrow isn't on here.Edit: Sadly Ubisoft like the terrible people they are got rid of the online finally for all of their old good games...sigh			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With 50 hours on record on pc,and 500+ on XBOX,i think it's safe to say that i can give a review for this game. :PChaos Theory,I didn't like when i first picked it up in 2005/2006.Due to me being a child and being nothing like Pandora Tomorrow or the first one.Back then i only played it for Spies vs Mercs,which hands down was the best multiplayer ever.(I know Pandora Tomorrow had multiplayer,but it wasn't popular) Around 2006/2007,I pressed A on Solo play,best decision i ever made.I never really gave singleplayer a chance,but when i played it,i was appalued.It replaced the past 2 games as my favorite!Around 2011,I bought it again for PC...Still hasn't changed.Although,I'm sad to say that multiplayer is offically dead :P (I still log in to see if people still play)Here is my review broken down.Pros:++Great story,It seems like the game has 2 stories,one about Criminals and the Masse Algothrims,and then Asia and the Masse Algorithms,but it all is collided around 6th mission.+Co-op and SVM is excellent,better than Pandora Tomorrow.++Dynamic Movement,almost has a sandbox feel.++Optimized for newer machines++Replay value if you want 100% ratings on every mission+Shader Model 3.0 supported+Low costCons:-Some resolutions are not supported (this is 2005 after all,so forgivable)-Multiplayer is somewhat dead-Some issues that are temporary ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chaos Theory is the proverbial second Spliner Cell game, and it shows. Like a lot of series, the second game is often the best. It perfected the system of the first, and it hasn't gone downhill yet. Kinda like Assassin's Creed 2 is still considered one of the best, if not the best. Games in that aspect, tends to follow the same rules as movies.Sure there was Pandora Tomorrow in between, but no one wants to remember Pandora Tomorrow... It could as well not exist seeing it's not in the bundle and it's apparently unplayable due to shadow issues.Thoses considerations aside, Chaos Theory pretty much improved on all aspects. Graphisms are nice, still good nowdays without being stellar, animations are fluid, Fisher got new moves, the HUD give more indications on the noise you emit and the lighting, missions are more intresting and involved, people you grab can be interrogated for some pretty hilarious, or sometimes meaningful dialogues, and controls are a lot more PC friendly.Scenario isn't really that much better than the first game, Fisher is going to save the US/Free World again, against a group of mooks no one really cares about and which are easyly forgetable.The game is more about its gameplay, which is pretty good at what it does, without being the miracle people would like it to be. You will probably enjoy your time playing it, bar some minor annoyances such as scripted events you have limited to no control on, then put the game on a shelf.A good purchase to get during a sale, at least, and a classic.

												I have always enjoyed the Tom Clancy series/games.  Splinter Cell is another stealth game that helped redefine the stealth genre in gaming.  This game will make your palms sweat as you sneak your way through each mission.  The controls are nice, textures and lighting is great, and voice acting is amazing.  Micheal Ironside really knows how to keep the players entertained.After the campaign, you have two extra modes to play around in.  You have a Co-Op mode, and a Multiplayer mode. I recommend playing the Co-Op first before the MP since it helps evolve the campaign.  The price for the game is really cheap...I do believe its $10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best stealth games.Certainly a classic, and the strongest entry in the Splinter Cell series imho.Also runs on a potato.Which is what I used when I first played it on release, ya know, back in the day with those high falutin cd rom devices.You can tackle most of the missions all guns blazing if you want, or opt for the classier stealth method - but with all the different weapons, tools, distractions, and environmental opportunities available to you both paths are generally viable.When using stealth, you will find that patience, observation of the enemy and exploration are rewarded. Taking the time to learn patrol routes, and finding convenient ways to dispose of corpses or making a mental note of sneaky exits for when the mission goes wrong all go a long way here.Fortunately the levels are very well designed and encourage this whilst still giving you other options.The soundtrack is generally awesome, being composed by the legendary composer Jesper Kyd and the ambience of all the environments really helps to draw you in.And the lighting. While the graphics still hold up well today, this was one of the first games that allowed destruction of lights.Yes it is possible to shoot them out entirely - strangely satisfying with a ""pffft"" from the silenced pistol.That being said the accurate yet cool default pistol is also posessed of a better function that temporarily disables them (and cctv cameras) - it can shoot emp waves at short range.How cool is that?Its an even quieter method than the silenced pistol, does not waste ammo, and draws less attention if people decide to investigate. The light, or camera in question will soon reactivate and be perceived as a power fluctuation or some glitch which doesnt bother guards apparently. Just long enough for you to sneak past though or silently slit someones throat...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is by far the best in the series. The locations are superbly designed, drawing in a sense of haunting atmosphere with solid, musical ambience that forces you to move slowly and silenty through the shadows to avoid detection and successfully complete your objectives. Would highly recommend to all that are new to the series as their first Splinter Cell game.My Verdict - 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got a inner stealth soldier in you?If the answer is yes, then this is the game for you. This game is by far the darkest, atmospheric, tactical stealth game you'll ever play in your life. It's right up there with the legendary Metal Gear Solid solid series, but more realistic in a Tom Clancy's universe. Step into the shoes of Sam Fisher, an ex US Navy SEAL working for the NSA as a Splinter Cell. Flawless level design, graphics and lighting that will make you explore and sneak around for atleast an hour on each level on a very lengthy single-player. Brillant usage of sound, with a high tech razor sharp musical score and a deadly arsenal of weaponary/equipment that will make you feel like a stealth ninja that can't be stopped.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chaos Theory is probably the best of the Splinter Cell games when it comes to stealth and espionage.  It doesn't have the same ""badass"" feel as Conviction, but here you're more about NOT BEING SEEN than looking cool.  The game is mission-based and although each mission has several objectives, only the primary ones are needed to complete the mission.  How you complete your mission is very open-ended and there are often multiple paths and ways of doing things.  You can be as ruthless as you want, deciding whether or not to kill people (or simply avoid them entirely).Despite having been released in 2005, the game still looks impressive.  The controls are complex and some people might have a learning curve to get over, but please stick with it. Unlike lots of more recent games, Chaos Theory allows you to not only save (both manual and quick saves) whenever and wherever you want, but name them as well.All in all, I suggest playing it if you like stealth games.  If not, don't bother.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the best Splinter Cell game there is, harking back from a golden age where Ubisoft didn't bog us down with proprietary DRM and shove Season Passes in our faces for $30-$50. Not only is the stealth gameplay pure, simple, and a pleasure to play even to this day, but the game boasts an amazing soundtrack that manages to stay relevant, and classic at the same time. The humorous quips of Sam Fisher never tire, and are always welcome, despite the serious tone the game takes on for the most part, giving Sam that old, characterized charm that you can't find in modern protagonists. Guns are represented faithfully, and many military terms are used correctly, and regularly- as a Tom Clancy game worthy of its title should. Overall, a classic stealth game that helped define the genre, and one that can easily keep you coming back through each new generation of machines with its added compatibilty and rather decent visuals (ridiculously good for 2005, honestly), no matter its age.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->old_review.txtThe best SC in the series. If you are a fan of stealth games at all, pick this one up. It has great voice-acting, graphics haven't aged badly at all, and you can beat the game in any way you'd like, so long as it doesn't involve running around like a madman, as it will get you killed quicker before you can say ""Hokkaido"".

												It is certainly an older game, and in some parts it shows, but generally the lighting and textures look great. It's also a great stealth game, though. In fact, it's probably the next best thing to a Co-op stealth game you can find out there, and this was made in 2005! The Co-op is different from the singleplayer. It features it's own story that you and a friend (or complete stranger you met online) follow and the maps are full of areas/tasks that can only be completed with both players. It's satisfying when everything goes smoothly and you can high five the other player (in your imagination). The AI isn't particularly bright, but that sometimes is because the area they are guarding isn't particularly bright either. This gives you the advantage unless you let them stub their toe on your balls while you crouch in the pitch dark hallway feeling all cool and stealthy. If you're smart, you can press up against the wall like a shadow. They can hear you if you move too fast and get suspicious of things like dead bodies for example, unlike in Assassin's Creed where the guards are like, ""Hey, what happend here? Did anyone see the killer? We'll find him eventually!"" Then they go on their mary way waiting for you to kill them. Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory does it right, because the enemies get anxious and stay anxious.When that happens, the in-game music changes to a faster, super spy tempo and sets the mood. But they aren't really your enemies unless they are in your way. You can knock them out or kill them, depending on the mission intel. Sometimes, killing means you lose, so instead of choosing your battles, try your best to avoid them all together, because they have more guns than you that go ratatatatat. TL;DR - It's a good game from a forgotten time. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The a.i isn't as dumb in comparison to splinter cell blacklist and other future installments. This game excells in the freedom you are given in moving around the map, and exploring. The game feels large and big, unlike splinter cell blacklist where their idea of ""immersive maps"" were tiny little vents, and occasional pipes,and ledges that all led to the same place. The game even lets you pick what objective you want to get done first. As said before the A.I is not incompetent, and will actually respond to the situation like believable humans, unlike future installments where they all of sudden know there's a guy in the premissis when you've never been spotted or killed any one. The mechanics are defined and detailed, you can split jump, freely traverse the map with parkour, crouch roll, sc 3000 machanics work exceptionally, and more features that LATER games removed... Unlike future installments this game focuses on stealth making it well detailed, unlike blacklist where the combat gameplay was boring and the stealth gameplay was subpar and less detailed. The only set backs in this game is that the game sometimes feels repetitive and the story is forgettable.Lambert: Sam we need you to save the worldSam: K Beyond that the game has no multiplayer anymore, and the game wiped my save data. This was most likely the work of ubisoft and their greedy snake like business practices. However the multiplayer can still be accessed through tungle and other things that I didn't bother myself with. I suggest you give it a try if you're look for a more defined stealth experience.When I did get to play the multiplayer I felt that the game was pretty challenging to get into which made it fun, but of course the community at first was slime. The same fools that say ""Why don't more people play this game"" are the same ones talking crap every second ""Gtfo of my lobby, I wanna play with my gaylover only bro."" When you get the multiplayer you will have to download a patch to fix the Merc's flashlight. And while playing the co-op I learned that some of the mechanics from the main game were glitched.

												The best Splinter Cell game to date.  I'm a huge fan of stealth games.  Chaos Theory came out near the end of what I like to call the Golden Age of Stealth games and it still holds up today, for the most part.  Story wise the game is lacking, which is one of the reasons I would rank Choas Theory under games like Metal Gear Solid 3.  The graphics aren't great even for a game that came out in 2005.  Enemy AI is decent for the most part, but their imposibly quick reaction time to spotting you can be frustrating.  Somtimes if you bump into an enemy or are somehow spotted they will immediately start firing, as in no animation of them turning around or rasing their gun, just immediatly firing.  Apart from that the AI is decent. Mechanincally it's a phenomenal stealth game worthy of the genere.  There are light and sound indicators telling you how visibil you are or how much noise your making, it even tells you the noice level at which the enemy will hear you.  Unlike recent releases in the franchise, Chaos Theory isn't a game you can approach with guns blazing.  You actually have to use stealth.  You can't fire from the hip and you have to pull your gun out every time you want to fire which decreases your movement speed significantly.  The PC version runs fine on modern systems, I had very few problems, and the game supports 1920x1080 without having to mod the game(old titles tend to be hit or miss with resolution support).  If you have a high refresh rate monitor like I do you should know that the game is locked at 100 FPS.  Keyboard and Mouse work fine, but it doesn't have controller support like most title now do, so you'll have to figit with it if you want to use a controller.Story Score: 6/10Rest of the Game Score: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game that is, at the time of writing this review, almost 12 years old, it still holds up today as a visual and gameplay masterpiece from a once great developer called Ubisoft.The third installment of the franchise improved on its predecesors in countless ways. Its light,shadow and sound mechanics are unmatched to this day.The game comes from a time where developers actually cared somewhat for the PC market, which can be most visibly seen in the movement speed variation of Sam Fisher, that could be controlled by the scroll wheel. A feature that for some inexplicable reason noone has tried to emulate.Visuals that hold up even today, stealth that is simultaneously unforgiving and fun, varied missions locations and enemies make the experience of playing Chaos Theory one of a kind. And that's all without mentioning the performance of Michael Ironside as Sam Fisher.Not recommending this game to everyone because most people today are morons who wouldn't know how to play this game today since it doesn't have a built in wallhack, invasive HUD or achievements you can masturbate to.Now give me my ♥♥♥♥ing badge.

												As a guy who's played Conviction first, I have to say I'm actually having more fun playing this game more. While I still feel like the controls could've been better, something I also feel about Double Agent, I enjoy the game immensely. The most obvious reason for the game is the story, which isn't ""US vs. Russia"". From what I can gather, it's North Korea.Chaos Theory is also easily the best game in the series, according to the dozens of reviews by new fans and Splinter Cell veterans alike. I certainly would agree; stealth is paramount in any situation. Sam's suit comes with a variety of items to help you know when you're hidden, or when you've screwed the pooch. Light sensors to let you know when you're visible, sound detectors to let you know how slow you need to move to keep quiet. An option I'm familiar with because of Double Agent is the OPSAT, which is a real-time objectives and map menu, meaning you'll need to hide to use it effectively. Hacking is way more interesting than Double Agent, and shooting, when done right, feels like an accomplishment.Graphics wise, character models in game show visible age and are acceptable if you remember it's from 2005. Environments though show great lighting and attention to detail. I did get a feeling of being in the locations Sam visited. And again, for a game in 2005, it looks just as good as some games from this decade.Sound is phenomanal, with a soundtrack by Amon Tobin and layered for different events in gameplay so it never feels stale. Sam Fisher is voiced by Michael Ironside; not the new guy who everyone hates for some ridiculous reason. Seriously guys, move on. In fact the voice acting and the script writing are good too; minus the enemy/foreign character voices. While Sam and his pals are witty and relatable, enemies tend to have such bad and stereotyped accents. And let's not forget the character ""Long Dan"". Turning on native voices solves this, but there's no subtitle option to let you know what's being said, so it's more for immersion after beating the game.So yes, I'm joining the bandwagon. But at least it's a good one; Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is easily one of the best stealth games I've played. And it's one that really deserves it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is an amazing game and instantly worth a recommend if you are a fan of the stealth genre or just like the series and haven't gotten into the 3rd instalment for some reason. It's worthy of its Steam-tag ""Best in the series"". I have debated with myself about it, but I would add this game to one of my favourite games of all-time. No, I am not a huge stealth enthusiast. Also being a legacy title, it doesn't have any UPlay integration at all!A good stealth game is dependant on solid mechanics and unlike later instalments of Splinter Cell. Chaos Theory and its predecessors are mostly stealth driven games.  Sam Fisher is given 3 settings in his trademark 3-scope goggles (Night-Vision, Heat-Vision and an EEV mode which highlights electronic equipment),  an EMP function on his handgun and of course a knife.  The game also features  sound and light bars in the HUD to show how silent and hidden you are which is a nice touch. With these tools, some environmental manipulation and the solid controls it's possible to get through entire missions without being detected or firing a bullet. Infact in the 1st mission I got through with only firing 2 on normal difficulty.Controls are excellent here on the PC with a keyboard & mouse. With the controls already premapped sensibly and are all rebindable.  A notable control mechanic is how you can alter Fisher's walking/sneaking speed via the scroll wheel of the mouse which is a really nice touch. The game does have a good tutorial which teaches you how to work with these efficiently.The plot is worthy of the Tom Clancy name and is immensely detailed. I didn't understand it as a child in 2005 and I still only have a relative understanding of it now with some help from the Wiki and knowledge from previous playthroughs. It follows on from the previous 2 installments and takes you all around the world. That's the idea of the plot without mentioning spoilers.Visuals are from the Unreal Engine 2.5 and are pretty solid. The game is from 2005, so it's safe to say that the visuals are antiquated. The lighting plays a key role in the game as it can be the difference between having bullets hurled at Fisher. The textures are antiquated for the most part, but that's to be expected. Still it doesn't look too bad for a 2005 game.Soundtrack was composed by both Amon Tobin and the well-know Jesper Kyd. The OST is amazing and each tune has a unique vibe that sets the scene whether it be ambient whilst Sam Fisher is sneaking around or frantic when enemies are firing at you due to your carelessness. It was also apparently featured on the UK motoring TV show Top Gear which says quite a bit and my favourite tracks from El Cargo (the 2nd mission) have been part of my personal music library for quite some time.So all in all give it a try. At its current price of £9.99 ($9.99/9.99€), it's not a bad deal for stealth enthusasts. Though it has been reduced by Ubisoft to at least 75% making it cost around £2.50, I would it's worth getting for most gamers.That's all I can say about the game. If you want to know more there are a myriad of reviews out there. One which I think sums it up well is MrSnuggleDuck's review here:

												I was never really a fan of the Tom Clancy's Military Pornography series, but for me, the music makes this one.

So if you have to play a Splinter Cell game, it should be this one, because it sounds ♥♥♥♥ing cool. Also you'll need a gamepad, because the keyboard doesn't really allow for the degree of sneaking that this game requires.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the epitome of what makes a good Splinter Cell game. You have the ability to be aggressive but stealth and cunning will still win out everytime. Conviction is a fun game but if you want a good Splinter Cell game to go with Blacklist, check out Chaos Theory.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best game in the Splinter Cell franchise - more sophisticated than the original, not a bland shooter packaged as a SC game like Conviction, less buggy than Double Agent. You get new toys, graphics that stand up to modern scrutiny, the ability to whistle to attract guards' attention (as opposed to awkwardly running in circles to make noise in the original game), et cetera. If you only play one game from the series, make it this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My all time favorite stealth game! It still holds up really well for being a game that came out on the original xbox. Taking your time and planning your movements is rewarding, while going in carelessly and killing people willy nilly will get you killed very quickly. I like that there is not only a meter to show how visible you are, but also a sound meter that is affected by your movement speed and ambient noises. My proudest achievement in gaming was getting 100% on every level without killing anyone and not being seen at all, leaving no trace.I don't know if co-op or multiplayer still works, but the co-op missions were great when I played them on the original xbox with my brother back in the day.

												The last TRUE Splinter Cell Game. If you love stealth games, this is a must have.Iv'e been a Splinter Cell fan since the original. The first two games were great, but Choas Theory is a masterpiece. Ubisoft seemed to forget what Splinter Cell was about with EVERY game after this. Dumping stealth for generic action. Black List brought a TINY hint of stealth back but it was just basic and castrated. It runs flawlessly on Windows 7 as well. No files to replace or 3rd party patches needed. A rare thing in older PC games. The game's polygon count is a tad low, but it has all the fancy stuff used today like Paralax mapping. The game will pretty much run off a potato. It even ran on the PS2.Iv'e played it on the GameCube, original Xbox, the HD remake on the PS3, and now on PC. Maybe it's just nostalgia, but man I love it. :DIf you havn't played this and love stealth games, Get it! Especially with this sale at the time of the review. It's a steal!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory is stealth genre gold. It's the third title of the Splinter Cell franchise and is simply the best stealth game of the series. Ubisoft Montreal did great work on this. The character, Sam Fisher, is a veteraned soldier of the United States working in secret for the government's NSA. The game provides well written and voiced dialogues for Sam and most of the characters in the game that can be quite humorous at points.  The core stealth mechanics of the game are extremely well done and fun to play once learned. The actions and controls of the gameplay are pratical and fluid. The shadow and lighting systems are easy to use and provide clear feedback to the player at all times. The takedown system is fun to use and capturing an enemy is challenging at times. The stealth gadgets and weapons are fun to use and have some creative examples like sticky cameras, shock bullets, pistol emp, and more.Level design is extremely creative and the game contains some very cool setpieces and level design.The environmental sound is an aspect of gameplay as well. Game sounds can be heard by your opponents and even microphone talk in Coop can be heard by guards. Guards are well voiced and some have some creative writing that can be pretty entertaining at times. Gunfire sounds fine. Most of your weapons are silenced but it makes sense. Environmental sound effects are great. The music is done by Amon Tobin, a braziallian electronic music artist, and it fits perfect with the stealth mood of the genre. Its a fantastic soundtrack for a gameGraphics are quite nice on this game. Especially when set to higher values. But for most of the game they'll be viewed through your night vison goggles. Graphics look great on most systems and are not demanding. This is the best game of the series and is really a stealth classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recently purchased this again. Was one of my favourite games when it came out, not just in the stealth genre, but in general, it made the idea of sneaking around, and also not killing, fun.I cannot speak for multiplayer or coop, so please think of this as only a single player review.Story isn't the strongest point, but is still pretty good, nothing fancy. The gameplay is where the game shines. Intuitive controls and a good hud system to allow players to exploit their environment to the fullest, with a good balance of choices which allow the player to feel in control of Sam, despite linear and clear missions. You decide if you want to sneak, when to distract, what tools to use, from which direction to leap upon guards etc. I feel it's hard to put into words how the game manages to pull off beautifully many things, aiming for Sam to be a stealthy ninja, a predator, a covert operative with many tricks, moves and gadgets up his sleeve, which add up to a fun balance of power, not making the player feel too powerful (the difficulty isn't hard for this game, which isn't too offputting) but not too weak. AI has a variety of tricks, though it isn't anything mindblowing, it is still enough to remind the player that you better anticipate some pushback from the npcs.I think the campaign was short, I haven't played it through yet (again), but the length and replayability is still decent.Graphics are still highly enjoyable for an older game and has solid frames per second with highest settings. A proper mix of dynamic shadows, decent shaders and textures, solid animations and physics, allowed me to still immerse myself into the game without being distracted by too much unrealism. Doesn't mean you should expect the quality of modern games, but this game does enough, in my opinion, to still be eyecandy, the basic solid kind of candy, like milk chocolate.Happily reinstalling this game on my mediocre laptop, I didn't find many problems, which I were slightly expecting, due to so many, not merely old games, but newer ones also having so many problems (which can nevertheless be fixed in many cases). The major problem is that shader model 3 doesn't work for me, the screen goes white, but upon investigation I think it has more to do with the intel HD graphics card than the game, or my drivers anyway (SM2 is still good and looks good). My laptop is a win7, intel dual core 2gHz, 4gRAM with shared graphics card memory, dedicated only 64mb. So it might just work for the majority. I should add that I always add the admin rights and compatibility mode XPSP3 by habit, so that might also have had something to do with it.People who are not even fans of stealth games might find SCCT a luring gateway drug into the world of patient stalking and picking your own time when to pick npcs off one by one with satisfaction.

												One of the greatest stealth games ever created. It's in the Holy Trinity of stealth games, along with Thief 2 and Hitman Blood Money.Gameplay: There's a light and dark stealth system, which means that staying in the dark is crucial to sneaking by. Some of the tensest moments are spent hiding in the dark while a guy with a huge gun is so close you can see his nosehairs. You can always see how visible you are and how much noise you are making in the HUD, which provides a lot of convienence. You can also use sounds in the enviorment to mask sounds you are making, like thunder. I recall one moment where you have to open a loud door in front of a sleeping guard, and if you don't open it while he's snoring, he'll wake up. You can also interrogate guards you've grabbed, and it leads to a lot of hilarious and memorable moments. The gadgets from Pandora Tomorrow make a return (the previous game in the series) while adding some new additions to Fisher's arsenal. The gameplay overall is tense and satisfying, and makes you feel like a badass spy.Graphics: The lighting system is brilliant, and looks better than most modern games. The character models, however, are lack luster. I remember one specific guard who's gums were light green. And Sam himself, when he's not wearing mask, has a consistent cross-eyed dumb look on his face. The textures are fine, not really anything special. It looks fine, overall.Sound: When the absolutely kickass music isn't playing, there's atmospheric sounds and really sets the mood. The sound design of effects like footsteps rivals even the Thief games. The enemies have very stereotypical accents, and it's done for laughs. The music starting to play when an enemy is suspicous and is looking for you really kicks up the tension.The sound design overall, is fantastic.Level Design: There's usually at least one alternate way to get into an area (although it heavily relies on pipes and crawl spaces.) It's non-linear and sprawling (excluding the first level) and is fun to explore. The level design is great (while not anywhere near the masterful level design of the Thief games.)Conclusion: Buy this game. If you're looking to get into stealth games, this is the game. One of the greatest games I've ever played.And I don't know why the enemies can't see the 3 suns on top of Fisher's head, shut up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The epitome of the entire Splinter Cell franchise, Chaos Theory marks the high-point of the stealth genre(except maybe losing out to Thief in that regard). Unlike most games involving guns, the most important skill in Splinter Cell is situational awareness, as opposed to the usual reflex-aiming; this is because Sam Fisher is a man, not a stormtrooper strung out on stimulants. Multiple methods of entry and escape from a room or area are usually avaliable, but many of these paths are guarded by some form of deterrant. Cameras are usually hidden in shadow or difficult to see areas, and guards can (and do) change routes. All of these things means that the game tends to promote a cautious advance rather than a blitz. Not a good experience if bloodlust is prevalant.TL;DR the game rewards you for being cautious, aware, and using your brain to take the path less traveled by.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chaos Theory is one of those rare games where everything just came together perfectly: the music, the look, the sound design, the level layouts, the voices, etc. It's hard to find a flaw and easy to play all over again a different way. One of my top ten games of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An abysmal port of one of the best stealth games ever made. I'd recommend the game, but the port is terrible. 55 minutes is the longest I've gone without a crash, it has no overlay support at all so if you want to publish screenshots, you have to work some tech magic and do things the long way. If you ever need to alt tab, you can pretty much guarantee that the game will crash when you try to open it again and you'll have to set your graphics settings up all over again, so if you hear a notification in the background or whatever, you really are better off just saving and closing the game properly.The game it's self runs fine and there's no issues gameplay wise, it's just the crashes that nearly always happen after a cutscene or when you start a new level. Sometimes the game will mess up right from the moment you click play and will either run in a weird sized window that you can't open properly or just be a black screen with sound.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If anyone cares to read my reviews and are wondering what the best of the best in the Splinter Cell is series than this is it.  Everything from the first two games done to perfection.  Pure stealth that you expect from this series toppled with better controls and interface.  This is where they struck gold.  Its a shame they started dumbing down the series after this.  Stealth began to take a backseat for edgy dark broodiness and action!  If you like stealth in any way and haven't played this one than you're doing yourself a great disservice.  NO game touches this in just how everything fits perfectly.  Better use of shadows.  The ability to draw enemies to you by whistling and distracting them with lights.  Not to mention the mini emp device in the pistol that lets you short circuit lights or other electricity in case shooting is too loud.  They really thought of everything with this game.  And then the PC version of Double Agent comes next and I've already talked about that one *shudders*.  Going from this to that is just mind baffling!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It might be a bit old but it aged very well (the graphics still look decent and it runs smoothly). It is IMO one of the best games in the series and one of the best stealth games in general. It has an interesting plot and an amazing soundtrack by Amon Tobin. You do not need to have played the previous games to understand what is going on. I definetly reccomend this to any fan of stealth games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I remember back in the original xbox days playing this game and replaying it here on the pc makes the experience so nostalgic, fun, and VERY immersive. This is by far one of my favorite stealth games ever made. The most innovative in the series in my opinion and it still rivals with some of the new modern stealth games out now. Trust me, if you are into stealth games, then pick this up for sure. - 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spy game from 2005.+Looks fantastic for its time+Spy equipment+Tense sneaking and satisfaction for tricking the guards succesfully+Some great levels (gargo ship and bank robbery are my favorites)+Fun mini games like hacking and lockpicking+Whistle+Less linear than the previous game (it's still very linear game)+THOSE 2 RADIO SONGS ♥♥♥♥ING ROCK!!!+Voice acting (good guys (espesially Sam Fisher))-Voice acting (bad guys)±AI is pretty clunky: sometimes it's utterly passive and stupid, sometimes it spots you from a mile away or just keeps camping the same area. Most of the it gets its job done.-Annoying music-Some bad missions (the first no casualties-mission was pretty awful)-Some dumbed down stuff: when the NPCs are searching for you, they walk the slowest pace possible as if they were scared (in PT they were a lot faster so you didn't want to draw any attention), pistol is dumbed down so shooting light bulbs takes now more luck than skill, no more door roll, also hiding in shadows is now easier than before imo.-Not as interesting missions as the train level from PT.-Story is not worth following-Don't play this game if you get headache easily, the nightvision goggles will♥♥♥♥♥♥your eyes.In conclusion it's a very enjoyable stealth game which makes you feel like a ninja as you master the mechanics and equipment. I'd suggest you to play with the hardest mode if you have any experience from the previous games, and also because the AI glitches less that way imo. I couldn't review the multiplayer mode because it's basically dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The best Splinter Cell title ever madeSo, Blacklist turned out to be pretty good and a huge improvement over Conviction which was a detraction from the core SC formula. However, the definitive SC experience will always be Chaos Theory, which largely corrected the flaws of the previous games while further improving the strengths.When this game released in 2005, it was a graphical masterpiece that pushed the consoles to their limits, and also put strain on the most powerful PC GPUs of the time. Ten years later, the graphics still hold up pretty well, especially the lighting effects which are essential to the stealth gameplay. The freedom of choice you get in this game is incredible, and sadly absent in the later titles. In previous games, it was difficult to do things more than one way. That guard HAD to be KOed/killed. That door's lock HAD to be picked. There was rarely more than one path. In Chaos Theory, the levels are more sandbox-like, with multiple possible routes for you to discover. You can break locks or you can spend time picking them.. You can wait for a guard to come walking up to a door, and then slam it into his face with all your strength, or you can wait for him to turn away, and do a standard stealth KO. You can open a door slowly, pushing it a little more forward with each press of the W key, or you can fling it open and exposing yourself. You can hack electronic locks or retinal scanners or you can force guards to cooperate. You can hack PCs to disable lasers and cameras or you can play a dodging minigame. It's also much easier to carve your own 100% avoidance path this time because you get a lot of room to breathe.Every single enemy could be interrogated which expanded gameplay possibilities and also made for amusing easter eggs. The alarm system was much more forgiving without making the game too easy. Gone are the days of instant-failure because some dude saw you even if he didn't get a chance to radio for backup. The story was quite engaging, and made Sam Fisher more involved in the plot rather than just an everyday cleanup guy.AI was significantly improved from older games. Enemies would start using flashlights, lighting flares, and calling backup instead of just walking blindly towards the sight of a broken light.Melee attacks, a serious letdown in the past, are now my favourite way to deal with trouble. Sam Fisher now gets a knife that can do one-hit kills. If he wants to go non-lethal, he throws a fast punch to the head - a LOT more effective and realistic than the stupid elbow move in the previous games. Chaos Theory isn't a shooter, and it's difficult to play it like one without dying within seconds. Nevertheless, should the♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan, the guns are more effective than before, giving you choices of attachments (gadget launcher or shotgun or sniper attachment?) and making ammo more readily available (you can now carry more than 2 mags per gun at a time). The pistol is more accurate so you don't waste so many rounds to take out one light. The rifle with its attachments can make for many interesting possibilities (long range stealth kills, sticky shocker KOs, etc). Co-op mode was the first of its kind, allowing two players to play as Splinter Cells and boost each other over walls and work in tandem to do coordinated kills. It was even more fun than the campaign, but sadly a bit short.I've never tried Spies vs Mercenaries so no comment there.Anyone who enjoys stealth games like Metal Gear Solid and Hitman will find this well worth a few bucks.

												This is the best Splinter Cell game, there are already enough reviews of the game, so I'm gonna talk about the PC version.I don't have a problem with this version, the game runs great, it looks great for that time, you can play in Widescreen, and I have no problem with the controls, but of course I'm using a gamepad. Maybe the negative reviews come from people who don't own a controller and use a keyboard to play the game. But with a controller, the game is great, is just that it doesn't have vibration but it doesn't bother me (but for a 2005 PC game it should have).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chaos Theory is the 3rd in the critically acclaimed Splinter Cell series which is based on Tom Clancy's series of novels with the similar name. This is an 8 year old game that actually aged quite well: some of the levels look quite good and the game utilises the lighting and shadow effects superbly.You play as Sam Fisher, member of a secret US black ops team, and are dispatched to various locations in order to find evidence, defuse a bomb, eliminate a terrorist, capture someone alive, etc. Although the game is linear, throughout the missions you are given secondary and opportunity objectives, therefore, the game tries to lengthen the singleplayer experience as much as possible. At the end of each level you are given a rating in accordance with the number of objectives you completed. In addition to this, the game counts whether or not you killed someone - this, in fact, lowers your score so it's best to focus on the stealth approach, otherwise achieving 100% is impossible. While making sure you are not seen by anybody or any cameras you can also knock your enemies out and hide the bodies.I like how varied the environment is: Sam can use a lot of objects, can climb a lot of things and can hang from a lot of places. There are also minigames in each level: you can do a lot of lockpicking, hacking and before knocking out or killing someone it's worth interrogating them to get some more intel for your objective. These interrogations can be funny due to the well-written script.It is unfortunate that coop and multiplayer are not played anymore, so, if this is on sale, make sure you grab it but only for the singleplayer experience.

The best Splinter Cell title ever madeSo, Blacklist turned out to be pretty good and a huge improvement over Conviction which was a detraction from the core SC formula. However, the definitive SC experience will always be Chaos Theory, which largely corrected the flaws of the previous games while further improving the strengths.When this game released in 2005, it was a graphical masterpiece that pushed the consoles to their limits, and also put strain on the most powerful PC GPUs of the time. Ten years later, the graphics still hold up pretty well, especially the lighting effects which are essential to the stealth gameplay. The freedom of choice you get in this game is incredible, and sadly absent in the later titles. In previous games, it was difficult to do things more than one way. That guard HAD to be KOed/killed. That door's lock HAD to be picked. There was rarely more than one path. In Chaos Theory, the levels are more sandbox-like, with multiple possible routes for you to discover. You can break locks or you can spend time picking them.. You can wait for a guard to come walking up to a door, and then slam it into his face with all your strength, or you can wait for him to turn away, and do a standard stealth KO. You can open a door slowly, pushing it a little more forward with each press of the W key, or you can fling it open and exposing yourself. You can hack electronic locks or retinal scanners or you can force guards to cooperate. You can hack PCs to disable lasers and cameras or you can play a dodging minigame. It's also much easier to carve your own 100% avoidance path this time because you get a lot of room to breathe.Every single enemy could be interrogated which expanded gameplay possibilities and also made for amusing easter eggs. The alarm system was much more forgiving without making the game too easy. Gone are the days of instant-failure because some dude saw you even if he didn't get a chance to radio for backup. The story was quite engaging, and made Sam Fisher more involved in the plot rather than just an everyday cleanup guy.AI was significantly improved from older games. Enemies would start using flashlights, lighting flares, and calling backup instead of just walking blindly towards the sight of a broken light.Melee attacks, a serious letdown in the past, are now my favourite way to deal with trouble. Sam Fisher now gets a knife that can do one-hit kills. If he wants to go non-lethal, he throws a fast punch to the head - a LOT more effective and realistic than the stupid elbow move in the previous games. Chaos Theory isn't a shooter, and it's difficult to play it like one without dying within seconds. Nevertheless, should the♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan, the guns are more effective than before, giving you choices of attachments (gadget launcher or shotgun or sniper attachment?) and making ammo more readily available (you can now carry more than 2 mags per gun at a time). The pistol is more accurate so you don't waste so many rounds to take out one light. The rifle with its attachments can make for many interesting possibilities (long range stealth kills, sticky shocker KOs, etc). Co-op mode was the first of its kind, allowing two players to play as Splinter Cells and boost each other over walls and work in tandem to do coordinated kills. It was even more fun than the campaign, but sadly a bit short.I've never tried Spies vs Mercenaries so no comment there.Anyone who enjoys stealth games like Metal Gear Solid and Hitman will find this well worth a few bucks.

												This is the best Splinter Cell game, there are already enough reviews of the game, so I'm gonna talk about the PC version.I don't have a problem with this version, the game runs great, it looks great for that time, you can play in Widescreen, and I have no problem with the controls, but of course I'm using a gamepad. Maybe the negative reviews come from people who don't own a controller and use a keyboard to play the game. But with a controller, the game is great, is just that it doesn't have vibration but it doesn't bother me (but for a 2005 PC game it should have).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game play and smooth playing! Got a little lost trying to find the next step in missions. I thought it was not as good as the first Splinter Cell, as it lacked intense thrilling graphics. The entire game was based on being sneaky and finding a way around the usual path, which didn't make it too exciting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Played in 2014, without rose tinted glasses for old games)A decent game from 2005 that stands up well to what is released today, but I would rate it ""average"". It looks like DeusEx:HumanRevolution imitated much of this game, so if you liked that, you'll like this. Gameplay is solid and tactical, but I found it a bit too linear and scripted. The controls also feel a bit clunky, especially if you have to start shooting. I had a few minor issues with light detection. Most graphics are average (it was designed for first gen xbox), but some details were really good, like a floor cleaner really making the part he cleans with his mop more reflective as he goes! Maybe worth getting in a steam sale. Fortunately no Uplay account required.Essential PC tip: go to pcgamingwiki for instructions on how to increase the FieldOfView, which is too low. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game contains the best multiplayer experience i've had out of every game i've played but is not that popular anymore as far as i know but the game does still have a big chunk left. There is obviously the campaign to play through and there is also a co-op mode which either can be taken seriously as you go through or it can be fun to mess around with the physics within the game like.. slamming doors on your buddy sending them flying and you can experiment with similar game physics like that.

												One of the absolute best Stealth Games that have ever been made. I've played this game longer than I have had it on Steam. I have the original CD, but it won't work with Windows 7. The Steam version does! The Story is great, funny, and the Dialogue in this game is downright hilarious! Its everything a stealth game should be. 17/10 all the way!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Again it's very late to write the review of this game - as it was release for quite a long back.Still, I am compelled to write the same cause of the game itself. As usual I will be dividing my review in parts. So without any further adieu lets jump into the business here - Story: The plot is, as with any other ""Splinter Cell"" title, is self-untangling. At the beginning player will have a very limited knowledge about the entire plot and that is revealed as the game is progressed. The plot itself may not appeal to the average FPS people, who are looking for Aim-n-Shoot kinda play through. But if you invest enough time and senses into the game - the plot is very apt and con-sized.Gameplay: The best part of any ""Splinter Cell"" title. Yes, though its not an open world environment, still there are more than 1 ways to complete most of the missions. The player will be given ample scope and time and equipments to complete each of the missions as the way they see fit. Players can vary their tactics - they can go complete ""Stealth"" and not raise a SINGLE!! alarm to complete mission or they can take a bit more direct approach to solve mattes - using bullets, that is.The tools are great and fun to use as well - be it a sticky camera or optical fiber or Lock Pic they can make the players life a lot less painful.Graphics: Now, when we talk about in game graphics - we usually bring out some of the big names of the business but very easily forget about ""Splinter Cell"" titles. Even for an old game like Chaos Theory, trust me, the graphics is great. The shadows and the ambient glow from the street/table/wall lamps are just too good. But the best part of all of them are the different vision mode of Sam Fisher's goggles. To me, the ""Night Vision"" is one of the best rendered ""night mode"" across all the game titles.AI: The AI is a strong point in this game - specially how they react to a whisper or when they see a body. Some of the guards are as ignorant as ever yet some of they are very suspicious (even of their own breathing). AI bots take some predefined paths or some random one - specially after they are being alerted. Even an open door or torn curtain can raise there suspicion. Be very careful to watch your light and ambient noise meter all the time - and don't hesitate to grab one if needed.All in all I am really enjoying the game and I would surely recommend anyone who is looking a different breed of the FPS genre.- Go Covert -			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Spinter Cell to date. Graffics still look better than half the shiit that comes out today. True non-casualized stealth with the best gadgets. Nice stealthy levels at night in the dark like how a good-ol-fashioned sneak'n'peek should be with great atmostphere, and action. Coop-Campaign is also a blast with a friend. Still best MP to date even though it's more dead than Stevie Wonder's eyesight. Overall great goyim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a MUST OWN if you want a really well done hardcore stealth action game. It's difficult but you'll keep coming back for more. The game also has a neat coop mode, and proper multiplayer, however the internet servers had shut down long long ago...good thing THIS GAME HAS LAN!!!The game looks great even today, and controls well along with gamepad/controller support and widescreen support built-in, however the multiplayer and coop modes are capped at 30fps because the network packets sync at 30 and raising it would break the networking. Fun still though!(Don't be fooled by a small playtime. I've owned it on both PS2, and Xbox, and loved every bit of it.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Splinter-Cell series was always my favorite, the first splinter cell I owned was also the first game in the series, I own the following:Tom clancy's Splinter-Cell: Classic XBOXTom Clancy's splinter cell- Chaos theory: Laptop/PCTom Clancy's Splinter cell-Conviction: XBOX-360Tom clancy's splinter cell-Blacklist: XBOX-360Splinter cell is a game that will stay deep down in my heart as my most beloved game, forever.As a gamer who wasn't born in the 90's, yet my first consle was still a SNES (Early 2000's) I am a gamer who will say: GRAPHICS. DO NOT. MATTER. And the splinter cell series early on did just that without over-glorified graphics, and SC:Blacklist was somewhat a dissapointment, even though the new spies versus mercs is great (and packed with glitches)Sam fisher's original voice actor was taken out in SC:BL which leaves an empty feelingBut for this game,I LOVE IT.

												My poor knife is missing... I forgot that when this game came to pc the took out a lot of the original gear asthetics from the Xbox version. Honestly this game would have been 10x more awesome with the wicked looking blade. This game with always be one of my top favorites of the series.

												This game is a MUST OWN if you want a really well done hardcore stealth action game. It's difficult but you'll keep coming back for more. The game also has a neat coop mode, and proper multiplayer, however the internet servers had shut down long long ago...good thing THIS GAME HAS LAN!!!The game looks great even today, and controls well along with gamepad/controller support and widescreen support built-in, however the multiplayer and coop modes are capped at 30fps because the network packets sync at 30 and raising it would break the networking. Fun still though!(Don't be fooled by a small playtime. I've owned it on both PS2, and Xbox, and loved every bit of it.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My poor knife is missing... I forgot that when this game came to pc the took out a lot of the original gear asthetics from the Xbox version. Honestly this game would have been 10x more awesome with the wicked looking blade. This game with always be one of my top favorites of the series.

												I have just finished the 3rd mission in this game. I played TCSC Blacklist earlier this year and enjoyed that game, so based on the reviews I bought this one. I have to say that I am enjoying this 2005 game even more than the 2013 one! I guess that its because I like stealth games and Chaos Theory is certainly a stealth game done well. My only criticism is that it is mostly, but not completely linear, since there is clearly an 'ideal' path to take to complete each mission and in some places only one possible path. But importantly the game does not rush the player - a key factor of stealth games. I remain amazed that a game which is over 10 years old can give me so much enjoyment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the top 3 Stealth games of all time, right under Hitman Blood Money and Metal Gear Solid 3. Multiple ways to complete objectives yet the game forces you to go stealth. This game is unforgiving and that's what makes it great. There is never a point in time where it holds your hand. There are no objective markers, forcing you to interogate guards and eavesdrop on conversations to find infomation to lead you to your next location, all while remaining completely undetected. Your gadgets will help you stay out of the dark and stay out of sight. Brillant stealth game, highly recommend for players interested in the genre. Graphics have aged well for a 7 year old game too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The classic Splinter Cell - a great stealth experience-Sam Fisher - the hilarious and highly trained secret agent. His character and skills are on FULL display here. -Take on your dangerous missions in many ways - never touch an enemy OR bring your assault shotgun attachement and party-Tactical whistling - simple and futurisic tools are at your disposal -Very robust mechanics, reliable and challenging AI (that scales well with difficulty levels) -Good graphics that even works at excelent frame rate on my 2003 Dell lapop/fax machine-No DRM -Recommendation: Easy mode: Quick save whenever you want. Fun mode: Whole mission without saves (unbind quicksave controls and iron man mode it!)-Graphics are not 2015 Triple-A level, do some research to decide-Hard to follow storyBe the ghost's shadow that saves the world			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't written a review in a long time; since I was a dumb little kid that didn't really know. I first played this game when I was a kid and never realized how amazing this gem of a game truly was until I replayed it on steam and did both single and co-op modes (I have a twin, and he was doing his side of the work on this game as well) and h-h-huh-huhHOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THIS GAME IS AND WILL FOREVER BE A TIMELESS CLASSIC.The gameplay is at it's peak in the series, in my opinion of course. It really had the classic Splinter Cell gameplay and had really started to emphasize on assault tactics if you preferred, which is pretty neat. I myself am a stealth guy, and I was not disappointed in the slightest bit when it came to seeking a challenge. Expert Stealth is probably THE way to play this game, as you will get the entire Splinter Cell experience. I was a kid when I played this originally so of course I was running in and spraying, bashing doors into the enemy LMAOOO sometimes your parnter! Even the soundtrack to this game is really good. Really ♥♥♥♥ing good as a matter of fact. Hats off to you, Amon Tobin! The soundtrack chilled and stressed out with you as the player depending on your situation in the game, and at the time of this release, I'm sure it must have been groundbreaking in terms of video games and OST. The sound and lighting aspects were on point, AI, gameplay, blah blah blah. It was all diamonds and gold for me man. This game really holds a valuable spot in my heart (as do many games, for I am beyond the deepest universal levels of all things geek and game) and I would give this a 12/10 because the soundtrack (Kokubo Sosho Battle theme is life) will forever be reminding me of when I used to sneak out haha. what is this water coming out of my eyes right now			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Splinter-Cell series was always my favorite, the first splinter cell I owned was also the first game in the series, I own the following:Tom clancy's Splinter-Cell: Classic XBOXTom Clancy's splinter cell- Chaos theory: Laptop/PCTom Clancy's Splinter cell-Conviction: XBOX-360Tom clancy's splinter cell-Blacklist: XBOX-360Splinter cell is a game that will stay deep down in my heart as my most beloved game, forever.As a gamer who wasn't born in the 90's, yet my first consle was still a SNES (Early 2000's) I am a gamer who will say: GRAPHICS. DO NOT. MATTER. And the splinter cell series early on did just that without over-glorified graphics, and SC:Blacklist was somewhat a dissapointment, even though the new spies versus mercs is great (and packed with glitches)Sam fisher's original voice actor was taken out in SC:BL which leaves an empty feelingBut for this game,I LOVE IT.

Posted: June 12, 2015
												So here is my review of ""Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory"".(just imagine and low voiced guy saying Tom Clancy)TL;DR it's in my top 10 stealth games, get it.So I'm going to split my review up into 4 sections, gameplay, story, graphics, & how does it compare to the newer games(?).GAMEPLAYTom Clancy's splinter cell CT has problems but also does things that I adore.Ok, stealth; the stealth in this game is realistic but it gets kinda annoying after a while.You see, there are 2 monitors attached to your U.I called your ""aural monitor"" and your ""brightness monitor"". Now of course your brightness has a big impact on you and your enemies. The bar works like a brightness setting I guess. Point is, the closer you get to light, the farther left (right?) it goes. If you are in full brightness then enemies I believe from anywhere can see you. Now the Aural monitor is the annoying part. The aural monitor watches your speed setting, the faster you go the easier enemies can hear you. Now the scoll wheel on your mouse functions as a speed changer, the closer you get to enemies the lower you scroll your mouse because unlike most of the games, you can't just walk behind a enemy and grab them, you have to gradually get slower until it prompts you to grab them, but this can f**k you over cause it doesn't tell you very much about the monitor. But I must admit, for it's problems I can forgive it, I...LOVE REALISM IN STEALTH GAMES! I am not a big fan of the cartoony stealth like ""stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" or...well you get me. I like realistic stealth games where you are in situations that can mimic real life. This game does that almost perfectly, I guess this game i- I am getting off track. Stealth = 8/10STORYNow the story takes you through a bunch of locations ranging from a  Hokkaido Island (a dojo) to a giant ship( Maria Narcissa) and even Seoul, but no one likes the Seoul mission...The story is quite enjoyable if a bit cliche'ed but it does take you to some nice locations. story = 6/10.HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO NEWER SPINTER CELLSI've always found the new spinter cell odd, they changed so much. I felt and think they changed devs or engines, probably both. But I've always thought of conviction and blacklist as different games. They are great themselves it's just if you WANT a STEALTH game then choose this game. The newer ones are more likes AC, if you have someone in your way you kill them, but if you want a ""stealth"" game then you go for the ones that make you think about your decisions. If I kill this guy will anyone see it? Will I be able to move the body in time? Will anyone hear him drop? Those are the type of stealth games that in my opinion, represent the stealth genre greatly. How does the game fair? 8/10FINAL THOUGHTTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is a great stealth game. If you are a die-hard fan of stealth then you should have this game. Yes the FMV is cheesy but this is a game that was made in 2006, I don't blame it, and you shouldn't either. But for my final thought, this game is a underrated gem of the series, I find it a guilty pleasure, and from the reviews I see this is a very loved game. Pick it up, please, if you don't like it then just refund it.Tom Clancy's Splinter cell: Chaos Theory (I am saying Tom Clancy too much) get's my final rating of 8/10, a great game! If you enjoyed this review then leave a comment on my profile saying ""+rep decent reviewer"" it will make me happy <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(After fiddling with the poor controls) Chaos Theory still holds up 11-ish years after release. Though I consider Conviction and Blacklist to be rock solid games, Chaos Theory is purebred stealth. The sound design/soundtrack is excellent, the graphics were incredible for the time (and are fine to look at today), and the dialogue between Fisher and his handlers is witty and entertaining. This is my favorite Splinter Cell and an all around must play for stealth fans. I personally have a hard time going back to older games and even though I played Conviction and Blacklist before this one, I can still find it amazing. If that doesn't speak for the quality, I don't know what else will.It's very cheap now and can be picked up for dirt cheap in sales. As far as my experience has gone, it has no issues on modern rigs. The biggest downside is that it ran on Gamespy, so the multiplayer and co-op functionality is gone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great stealth game. It's basically more of the first games, with less bugs and a sound detection bar. It's just weird that there's an ""Assault"" option for loadouts, as going in guns blazing will ruin the game completely. The most enjoyable way to play it is by trying to stay unseen and taking out only the guys standing directly in your way to the objective (IMHO). Changing your speed with the scrollwheel is a neat mechanic that I liked about this game. So is the alt-fire on the pistol that disabled electronics (so that you don't have to shoot them anymore).It has a great soundtrack that changes every level and as you get spotted or identified.Oh, there's plot too, mainly so that the missions don't all appear the same.This brings me to the less enjoyable part of the game: the repetition. Pretty much all you do is sneak around people or lure them till you can get behind them and snatch them. This made it very hard to play the game for longer than an hour at once, and I became pretty bored of it nearing the end. Some more ways of getting the information you need or getting people out of your way would be cool. The airfoil rounds, sticky shockers and gas grenades are supposed to do that job, but they all work in pretty much the same way. I guess this game could just use a little less linear gameplay is what I'm getting at.This game is definitely worth your time though, even ten years after release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best video game I have ever played hands down. I have played through this countless times. It's perfect in every way and form. The solo campaign is lengthy with plenty of variety in environments. You'll sneak around cargo ships, apartmetns in NYC, and Japanese villages as the ultimate spy. Chaos Theory offers vast amounts of options for every level ensuring plenty of replay value. The graphics, while obviously old, still hold up pretty well to todays standards; with reflective surfaces, lots of realistic textures, and an AI system that is so much fun to mess with. The music, written by Amon Tobin, is fantastic and some of the best original soundtrack work for a video game I've heard. This is a game that you just NEED TO PLAY!The coop mode was amazing when it was working. It was at least 6 more missions that you could play with a friend and there were even some unique abilities you could do with your partner, like throwing him/her across hallways to knock out guards, or climbing them like a human ladder to get into higher windows. The servers aren't available anymore as far as I know, but I'm sure if you try and host one with your friend you should still be able to play it. The versus mode is a totally seperate game that's very creative and loads of fun. However! Be warned, this game is highly competitive and the players that are still playing online know the maps inside and out. It's best to play this mode with your friends until you get good enough to play against the 6 or so players that are still playing this online. Also, since the game's versus mode runs on an old engine, the lighting doesn't work anymore with new Nvidia video cards. There Is a fix if you go into the steam communtiy hub to fix it, but if you don't do this, the mercenaries flashlights won't work; which is not good considering you need the flashlight to see in the dark to find spies. Anyway, this game is a must play for anyone who's ever even had the slightest interest in video games... and considering you're reading this on ""Steam"", I'm almost positive you have some interest in video games yourself. So buy this game.. now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was a awesome game back on my Playstation 2, and would hold up better today if it were not for the newer Splinter Cell Conviction (2010) and Splinter Cell Blacklist (2013), both vastly superior in every possible way. Having said that, Chaos Theory is still a fun game with pretty decent controls for a game that is so old. At first, the controls suck something fierce, but after you play for a while you will start to get used to them and they won't be a problem anymore, although how you run and how you use a weapon is still dumb. And of course one really fun thing about the newer games is that they have really cool kill animations. Here they are pretty crappy. One really great thing about this game (for me at least) is despite its age, there were no compatibility issues (Win 8.1 Pro) and no sound/control/mouse sensitivity issues which you will see in a lot of PC games that are as old as this one.If you can afford Conviction and/or Blacklist, buy those over this for sure. If you like those games and want more Splinter Cell, then this is where you wanna go next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was always a big hardcore fan of the Splinter Cell Series. To this day, I still lowkey enjoy the games whenever I feel like binging on a ""James Bond"" induced spy thriller. This is the passion that I felt like when playing this game at first. Sneaking through enemy guards through crevasses and navigating in the dark. It really does give the player a unique spy experience. But, however it falls off in a lot of categories which really doesn't match up to modern day expectations. And, you can't really blame the game just because it's a little outdated by at least a decade.First of all, the most recognizable control problem when going into the game for the first time is the SNEAKING. It's kinda hard to figure out at first but, you have to scroll with your mouse to control the intensity of the sneak. and whenever you f*ck up just because you forgot to sneak softer totally blows and you have to start back from save. (not even auto save, so yeap you gotta remember to save). The sneaking controls are more preferably for the console controller due to the analog stick requirement of ease for lockpicking and sneaking. Another problem is the level design. Pretty much it's linear. Point A to Point B, while also filling out objectives.This one sometimes get's on my nerves, but sometimes you just start calling the guards f*ken blind for not spotting you like 2 meters away. Like, I know it's a game and stuff, but it should at least simulate realism.A good aspect I liked was the storytelling, always loved it, and Fisher's comments are pretty hilarious at times.Overall, in the end you either finish the game by looking for a walkthrough of the game because it get's very hard to locate objectives some times. OR, you just rage quit and save time.Good shoppings customer!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Damn it Fisher"". The only good Splinter Cell game. Or at least the only one that's memorable or some what worthwhile. Chaos Theroy is both over rated and severly dated (Coming from someone who grew up with far older titles I think that says something) and if your wondering if you should buy the game you might notice that all the positive reviews say it's great without explaining why. The story is a Call of Duty esque snore and the stealth is simplistic and boring but I must reluctantly say since there's a lot of freedom in how you deal with enemies (Kill or do not kill) or for how you can screw up it's still a video game (Take that for what you will).The AI springs between aimbot accuracy, sloth like, and just plain blind and or stupid. Unlike the console versions you can actually see whats going on as the PS2 and original Xbox version suffer from pitch blackness gamma syndrome even with the goggles or turning up your TV's brightness settings all the way. The graphics get the job done in regards to the world but the character models are frankly attrocious and suffer from pre next gen Ubisoft graphics with the enemy models looking especially bad (Barely better than Max Payne's) what with their mouths being green. The character models and blurry badly animated CGI make the game look even older than most PS2 games. Hell for 2005 it wasn't even the best stealth game. I think that title goes to Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistance which was the re release of the 2004 original on weaker hardware that added a free thirdperson camera which is embarrassing considering that this Splinter Cell has better hardware than MGS 3 to work with on the Gamecube and Xbox Original and of course the PC.The real issue is it's terrible controls and awkward bindings for mouse and keyboard. The console controls were already wonky (And thats coming from someone who's used tank controls, pressure sensitive controls and motion controls.) but here on the PC both options control as if you were drunk. It's controls are harder to understand and get a grip on than any of the Arma titles and yes that extends to Operation Flashpoint/Cold War Assault. You name it and it will probably control better than Chaos Theroy (Middle mouse to aim, shft to jump?). At least you can rebind some of the conrols (The mouse wheel effecting your speed is interesting albiet flawed). If your excuse is ""bad controls incentivise sneaking or avoiding combat"" than every stealth game prior or afterwards would like to have a word with you.It's a mediocre third person shooter disguised as a stealth game with that aspect only just barely being above average and with the latter being primarily in focus. It's voice acting, music, level design, COOP and lack of Uplay are the only thing that salvages it from being total♥♥♥♥♥♥in my eyes. Even then the COOP is capped at 35 FPS for some bizarre reason and its hard to even get it working. If you like scanning crates and bad spanish accents this is the game for you. If you like stealth try anything else (Might I suggest Hitman: Blood Money or Theif?).I don't usually do numbered score but I give Splinter Cell: Chaos Theroy a 3/5 or a 4 out of 10.

												Entertaining dialogue and cool goggles.However since there are no checkpoints, and grabbing enemies from behind is often unresponsive (especially if they are sitting in a chair) - it leads to frequent save scumming.How dark some of the shadows are is visually inconsistent sometimes, and enemies occasionally instantly whipping around 180 in their paths doesn't help either.Even when everything is going according to plan, the sneaking really isn't that entertaining. Get a guards attention, KO & drag, rinse & repeat.The last few levels try mixing things up a bit, but that just showcases how much worse the gun combat is.There are also ratings for how smoothly your mission went, but they're completely meaningless.Co-Op was fun, but Spies vs. Mercs was a real pain to get working a few years ago.

												""Amazing single player game, blah blah blah, best stealth game ever in the world"". Yeah this stuff isn't wrong I truly love the game for its single player experience and all that it offers in that department. However there is no online funtionality due to the trash state of the servers, The bulk of these hours I have on record were probably from attempts of trying to coop with my pal and get some of the 'Spies vs Mercs' action the Splinter Cell series is renowned for. None of this was possible :(. I'm just a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that after returning to this game after many years via computer my hopes and dreams of online play were destroyed, more so that none of this information was made available to me on the Steam Store before my purchase. I lost $20.TLDR; IMO and many other's its the best single player stealth game in existence. However Steam failed to communicate to me that it has no FUNTIONAL online play so f*ck Steam and Ubisoft for ripping me off. And so, because of my saltiness I do not reccomend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
