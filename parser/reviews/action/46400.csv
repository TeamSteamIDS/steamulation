												With your choice of 3 classes(each with different trainable skill sets) you'll embark on a fairly uneventful dungeon crawler through three forgettable locales each with their own distinct mobs. While the classes and builds make for a bit of intrigue you'll quickly be mired in repetition as you clear room after room without much to distinguish each one from the last. In typical crawler fashion the game is broken into three acts each capped by an uninspiring boss encounter. The game also features an incredibly frustrating lack of responsiveness from the controls. Attempts to pivot and free fire are often ignored as you find yourself running directly into damage(and often death) instead. While it had the potential to be a good title there just isn't enough there to warrant the time commitment and achievement collectors will also be disappointed at the absence of any. Unless you are a die hard fan of the genre or have a fetish for poor controls I'd suggest spending your time elsewhere.			",747,184,19,65,52,12,82

												This is an isometric action RPG. Everything you love about the Diablo games, or Torchlight, or Titan Quest/Grim Dawn has been toned down quite a bit here. Not as many classes or skills or equipment options. I haven't even run into any side quests yet. So, in essence, this is a poor man's sci-fi version of Diablo. However.... this is a poor man's SCI-FI version of Diablo. Fighting robots and mutants and aliens on spaceships and distant worlds is a very cool idea for this genre. The graphics aren't super great but they certainly aren't bad either. I am enjoying them just fine. And the soundtrack is techno and rock. Great music to blast enemies away to. The bottom line is, if you're a Diablo/Torchlight/Titan Quest fan and you find this game on sale, I recommend picking it up. The sci-fi theme and techno music alone make this a worthwhile buy for us action RPGers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had a lot of potential that it unfortunately did not live up to.The Good+ Great atmosphere+ Good soundtrack+ Sci-fi Diablo gameplay+ Each class plays very differently, as advertised+ InexpensiveThe bad- Short; only three chapters- Lack of variety in gearing- Plot elements are really thin- Feels unfinishedI'd like to recommend this game, but as it stands, I really can't. The premise is cool, and the game does an excellent job of setting the tone, but unfortunately, it just doesn't deliver. The game is short, it feels rushed, the gear is bland, and the levels are a bit grindy. If it had an expansion, it might get a better score from me.			",361,66,4,54,11,0,48

												Firstly, please note that my ""hrs on record"" is wrong because I play with Steam in Offline mode. I have finished the game and played all three characters up to the point where all their skills are unlocked.I really enjoyed this game, so I wanted to offer an alternative view to all the negative reviews here! Firstly I think this game is pretty clearly inspired by Space Siege. This is perhaps a rather questionable choice in inspirations, but Greed is a much better game because it has character classes with skill trees for each.The game has things that may grate with a new player. Enemies can be real bullet sponges. Level features are reused often enough that levels can seem a bit long-winded. Also items aren't randomised much at all and you will see the same armor and weapons repeatedly. Damage numbers on weapons you find are too low early in the game. Each character class is restricted to their weapon type (gatling gun, long range plasma rifle or flamethrower).After experimenting with the different classes and looking over all the skills I decided to make a character based around maximizing my ability to spam my skills. (Skill damage increase with character level unlike weapon damage.) I did this first with the flamethrower guy and it was great fun! The fire effects in the game are excellent. The flames, smoke and burning sound effects combined with the ability to set large sections of the screen on fire was very entertaining. One of the top level skills is a long range flamethrower effect that reminds me of John Carpenter's The Thing. Making heavy use of skills made playing this character more like a fire mage.After finishing the game the first time, I went back and played as the long range character and she also has some pretty entertaining skills. I appreciate that the game rewards a bit of planning about how you're going to build your character with some fun (albiet repetitive) action. So for all it's flaws, I still really enjoyed this game.The game also does a bad job of communicating some important information. Useful tips for someone starting the game: If your mouse is laggy go into the graphics settings and disable Post Render. Make sure Highlight is enabled in graphics settings. It will help you find interactable containers. In the Inventory screen, click the icon near your currency count then click on an item to scrap it. This turns the item into scrap which sells for less then the item, but stacks and only takes a single inventory space. After you get to Act 2, an icon appears in the bottom right hand corner of your Inventory screen that lets you teleport back to the shop once every 5 minutes. Leave skill points unallocated until you find a save point, then buy new skills and test them. If you don't like them, just reload to get the points back.Enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought got this in the Indie Gala 3 bundle several years ago and only now got around to playing it.  It took me almost ten hours to get to the end of Normal difficulty using the Marine.  Ctrl+F ""TL;DR"" if you don't wanna read all this.  Before I start, I'll say two things:  First, I'm going to make reference to the Diablo series quite a bit here.  The second is that this is a not-recommended review because I didn't really enjoy it, not because of any particular flaws.Greed: Black Border is Diablo in Space.  You explore a set map for each area, you fight enemies, you get drops, you make money, you level up and get better skills.  You start by taking your pick of three classes:  The close-range Pyro-Soldier, the mid-range Marine, and the long-range Plasma-Engineer.  Starting with a story sequence, now you're on a large ship and you have to go free your own little ship from impound.  And on the way, you fight zombies and robots.  Later on, you're in a desert area fighting desert critters, and finally you're in a cave fighting robot bugs.  Gameplay is fairly simple.  Isometric view, you have a minimap in the corner, left-click to move, left-click enemy to attack, Shift+click to attack without moving.  All of the classes are in some way ranged with the Pyro being the one most likely to get into a close-ranged fight and the Plasma sniping everything from afar.  You're gonna do a lot of kiting.  All classes have a regenerating shield, a set amount of health that doesn't regenerate by default, and an energy bar to fuel special moves.  There's also a regenerating bar for dodge-rolls with WASD or the spacebar, though you aren't immune to damage during them.  Not being able to spam dodge-rolls sorta harms their effectiveness since you don't exactly get very far away in the process.  All classes have skill trees.  Raise one skill, unlock another, that sorta thing.  What is interesting is that apart from your basic attack, you can have an active right-click skill, a passive offensive skill, and a passive defensive skill all equipped at the same time, so it's a matter of figuring out which ones are good and then dumping your skill points into them since unequipped skills obviously don't work unless equipped.I wouldn't say it's a lootfest like the Diablo games.  Sure, gear and money drop, but there aren't any magic items.  You find gear that your class can equip only, but only basic things drop.  This means that for the most part, the better stuff you find is just numerically better overall, nothing really different other than appearance, and there was no variety in weapon types.  For the Marine, the only weapons I found were miniguns and I imagine the same situation applies to the other classes.  You can add affixes and traits to items by putting in socketables, though there still isn't a very big variety of effects, mostly +X energy or maybe +X a set of skills or +X% damage.  It took me until near the end of Normal just to find gear that had affixes already applied to them!  At least everything shows up on your character.  There's a store, but you don't get access to it until maybe halfway through the first chapter.  You get a device that lets you warp to him every five minutes, though his stock doesn't really update often.  You can recycle your gear for a pretty generous return on money and a chance at making a new socketable, though I ultimately felt that money didn't have much point.  I never felt like I had to save up money for something good, just that anything good the shop had I'd buy since I had more than enough anyway.  Maps are huge, like, they'll take you an hour for each one or so.  There's no randomization here, and there are some puzzle elements, like reading a note and then using the numbers to get through a code console, or navigating over the safe spots on a damaging floor.  There aren't many of these elements, though.  A rather big problem I had was that this game only saves by checkpoints.  And you have to manually walk up to one to save your game.  It's very possible to just forget to activate one and lose several minutes of play.  Or in an area where they're not common, lose time anyway when you die.  I didn't find a way to scroll the minimap though I actually didn't get lost at all.  There's only one running speed and outside of the final areas, no way to get around the map than just regular moving.  There didn't seem to be any backtracking either, not that there was a good reason to back somewhere.I didn't keep count, but I think there were maybe 30 varieties of enemies to fight.  Like dropped gear, they didn't have any really remarkable traits, so you either fought the garden-variety mook or its upgraded version.  There were bosses at the end of the three chapters at least, but each chapter was filled with cutting through a slog of the same enemies.  They weren't very interesting, just a few long-ranged ones you could easily tank or evade and a lot of melee ones that you could easily kite.  Granted, I did die a few times though it was more to environmental hazards/puzzles than enemies up until the final chapter.  Watch out for those Gun Drone Overlords.There isn't much for plot.  You answer a distress call for a mining ship and your ship gets impounded, then you crash onto a planet and have to find fuel cells.  That's basically it.   There is quite a bit of world-building done given the story with the five colonies and you even get little news bulletins from the outside world as you play, though they're ultimately pointless, like finding the history books in the first Diablo.  The setting is nice, a Diablolike that isn't a high-fantasy world but future space sci-fi and all.  And of course the game ends on a sequel hook cliffhanger and nothing's probably gonna happen on that front.  There is voice acting, though that too's not very remarkable.  Your character makes some comments during the game but for the Marine, they were almost impossible to hear or understand, even after fiddling with the sound options.  TL;DR:  I don't know.  Greed isn't a bad game, it's just not good.  It's average.  Underwhelming.  The things it does, other games do better.  The game gave me zero issues like crashing or bugs or whatever, but I just didn't really enjoy my time with it.  At least it's kinda pretty.  I'd say unless it was like 90% off, you can probably avoid this.  It's still too bad, since it feels like the first episode in a longer game and there was nothing wrong with it outside of it not being remarkable.  I might be convinced to go back and try Hard Mode for a little while though I have a feeling it's gonna be more of the same.			",519,139,12,130,27,8,81

												Awful. Simply awful. What originally started as a sort of simple dungeon crawler with a little charm to it, quickly became a nightmare with each moment grinding against what little patience I had left. The first chapter is fine, nothing special, completely tolerable. Once the second chapter, OF THE THREE CHAPTERS IN THE GAME, began, a lot of glaring issues began to emerge. First of all, controlling your character is broken. Simply broken. Your soldier will randomly stop, start, run in circles, fire at nothing, or just flat out kill himself. The characters themselves have less personality than generic sodas, and the class balance is absurd. The experience curve is ridiculous, requiring multiple playthroughs to ""catch up"" to the zones you wish to clear. Fortunately, you don't even need to care, as most of the enemies are easily bypassed by just running, assuming your character doesn't have a stroke. The shopkeeper must be a mythological creature, because I've only seen him in photos making out with bigfoot. Item ""customization"" is non-existent, with actual equipment being an afterthought. Skills have no weight and don't even feel like they do anything (except the nuke, which HAHA kills teammates). Co-operative play requires jumping through hoops to get a lobby to function. The game looks muddy, seems like it was made around 2001 but plays like something you would have bought for MS-DOS. The bosses are, to be frank, stupid. The checkpoint system lets you zerg bosses by simple resetting from checkpoint. I got this game for $0.49 during a steam sale when it seemed like a steal. But at this point, I would have rather bought 49 gumballs and choked to death. This is not a game that can even be enjoyed with friends who are just goofing around. If you feel like learning what being lynched feels like, grab this game from your local dumpster. It's probably in the one thats on fire, since only Satan incarnate would own this game to keep in his torture pits. Play Path of Exile instead, it's free and doesn't make me feel like I'm eating a truck's tire with a bendy straw.			",214,20,1,36,16,0,25

												So imagine Champions of Norrath-lite in space and you have Greed: Black Border. End review.... INVENTORY TETRIS! :D...No, seriously though, Greed: Black Border is fairly good, in spite of some of the horrid reviews it has received. It's an isometric sci-fi action game with RPG-lite elements.You get to choose one of three characters to respond to a distress call from a mining ship. Each has a different set of abilities, passives and combat style.The presentation is pretty good. The graphics are definitely more than adequate for the game, with decent character modeling and particle effects for weapons and abilities. I REALLY like the interface. The general gameplay interface, the character, skills, logbook and shop interfaces are all well thought out, clean and easily accessible. I played the long range character, and the actives and passives on offer seem to provide quite a few different playstyle options. So far I have opted for mostly relying on my range, though it seems as if she could be played in significantly closer quarters for those more brave. I can only imagine the capabilities of the other two. However the equipment options are rather paltry, with only head, chest and weapon slots available, though each slot has a selection of mods that can be socketed into them to add stats or boost your abilities/passives.There is a decent variety of enemies. Just on the first map, I encountered several varieties of machine and humanoid enemies, all of which were well designed. Speaking of the map, the maps are HUGE. It took me three hours just to clear the first mission. THREE! And the final boss was just madness.The audio. Oh god the audio. The game's music is awful. The music is really arcadey, and it's on a short loop that it gets annoying very quickly. I shut it off and played my own after about 15 minutes. The voice acting I have seen so far is passable, though, but nothing to write home about.Only real complaints about the game are no gamepad support, and somewhat obtuse controls. With some time learning you get used to them, but it takes a significant amount of time to do so. Overall, Greed: Black Border is a decent ARPG for the asking price. There are better out there, but there are also FAR worse. Definitely worth picking up on sale.			",297,53,27,70,15,1,42

												I don't know what all the thumbs down are for on this game. Graphics are decent, gameplay is simple yet fun, it's relatively hard, and the sci-fi atmosphere is well done. If you're a fan of Diablo style RPGs and/or sci-fi themed games, ignore the haters and give it a try. It's worth spending only $5.P.S. To the haters: it's not really fair to compare this game to Diablo and say it doens't match up. Of course it doesn't, Blizzard didn't make this game. The only similarity is that it follows the platform and gameplay formats of Diablo. Other than that, nothing else fits the center of the Venn diagram. This game is not a ""rip off"" of Diablo.

												Greed: Black Border tries to be Diablo in Space (personally, I'd rather be playing Space Siege), but it ended up being a puzzle / action game that is closer to Titan Quest but with much lamer story line and a bit too blatant Diablo cloning without enough loot variations. Only 3 pieces of equipment: helmet, weapon, and armor. Most of the variations is in the ""enhancement modules"" which adds one or more attributes to one piece of equipment, and you only have one piece active at  a time. There's a skill tree too and offensive vs. defenisve skills. However, loot is lame with almost no variations, and the arcade sequences like ""walk through this field of killer forcefields without getting killed"". After 13 hours, the grind is lame enough tithat I quit.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

This is some kind of sci-fi action/RPG game with a slight Diablo feel to it.  But it just falls flat.  It works, it just isn't interesting.  Have never tried it in multiplayer since I never saw anyone else playing.  I am not recommending it, but if you can get it super cheap I would encourage you to try and decide for yourself.

												Greed: Black Border (GBB) is a mix of Diablo style click to move player character, Kingdoms of Amalur dungeon traps, and top-down shooter combat. The mix is both interesting and frustrating.GRAPHICSThe game is not processor heavy. Only 12-15% is required from an Intel i7-4770k CPU and 31-41% from an NVidia 770 running at 536 MHz. Backgrounds aren't as pretty, and aside from the frequent explosive canisters from earlier levels, there aren't much to interact from the environment, nor it is purposeful.SOUNDMost of the interactions (walking on different surfaces, downed enemy, broken tables, plants shot at) are paired with sound effects. The soundtrack isn't interesting, and I got tired from hearing the same (or similar) electronic music by the middle of the game.GAMEPLAYThe story is short. Enemies, gear, and environments don't have much variety. Add all that and you have what I feel like a grinding game. Controls are also an issue, specially considering how hard it is navigating traps via point and click controls. The control scheme is just inappropriate for this type of gameplay. Rogue style controls will feel better for the mazes and overall gameplay. And, too bad, rogue style control is  not an option in GBB.OVERALLI did finish the game without complaining much. I did find it weird that the player can only have one passive offensive perk and one passive defensive perk active at a time. For $0.70, it's ok. Buy it. But increase the price and you'll have better games to play than Greed: Black Border.			",437,125,8,41,32,1,35

												I recommend Greed: Black Border (GBB) but it's a borderline decision. I recommend it if you feel for a 10h quick action zombie smashing fix! It felt short and I usually spend ages in games like these selling every piece of unwanted loot and backtracking and checking out every corner of every map.  So with all of that, I finished GBB in roughly 15h and you might say: ""It's not that bad..."" But compare that with many other games where I easily have 80+ hours if not outright in the few hundreds and 15h is short.Also there is a lack of weapon, armor variety and monster types. So I guess, in general, the game lacked some content. Now maybe, if you continue after beating the end boss (because you can restart the game at a higher difficulty level), maybe do you get new item images for armor and weapons? I'm not sure but I did not feel like doing the campaign again.I should also mention that because of the way I play, I only assigned some of my skill points, as a ranged damage dealer and finished the game easily on normal difficulty.With those negative aspects behind, let's look at the positives: + It's an isometric ARPG (Diablo style) but set in a sci-fi futuristic environment. + Dropped items are randomized + Nice environments (maps) and nice unit animations + Good soundsNegatives: - Not enough content - Lacks a bit of polish - Not enough replayabilitySo overall, unforatunately, I have to say that if Mass Effect 1 or 2, Diablo 1 or 2, Company of Heroes 1 or 2, Titan Quest, Path of Exile, Dawn of War 1 or 2, etc. are on sale at around the same price as this title, then buy that other title. These games are each worth about 6 times GBB!			",25,4,0,14,2,0,18

												Incredibly dull action RPG where you shoot endless amounts of little robots and kite zombies (in space!). And also the big variants of those. The action is just you standing in place, shooting things, running away for a bit to get some distance, shooting more, running away a bit more, etc. Enemies trigger when you open a room or get close enough. Some enemies are sleeping and only wake up when you just about step on them. They don't take damage until they wake up.There is some worldbuilding, but nothing is really done with it. There's also bits of voice acting, but they're for exciting plot points like finding an elevator to get to the next area. Then an hour of nothing as you slog through the level, plugging boring drones and boring zombies that have somehow gotten chainsaws for hands, searching for the thing that will end this godforsaken level.I could feel my will to live draining with every minute I played this. Play Torchlight instead.			",825,202,34,65,26,6,59

												There is nothing more unintuitive than the control scheme in this game. Have you played a twin stick shooter? If you use your keyboard you would expect to move wi WASD right? Well in Greed , you dodge with WASD and instead move Diablo style , by clicking. That would have been ok , if they made a game like diablo , but you need to keep your crosshair on the enemy and keep pressing the mouse button to shoot. Not only that but if you want to shoot at destructible objects you need to hold down the shift key , otherwise your character just walks over to the object. This might have been an OK twin stick shooter , or an ok point and click ARPG , but its neither. The awkward combination between ARPG controls and twin stick shooter gameplay does not work at all. I dont know if its different members of the dev team had different vision about the game or something or if the development was cut short and they just figured ""hey we need a control sheme ASAP lets slap something on!""Just patch it , maybe add controller support and it might turn into a decent game. But I guess devs abandoned the idea long ago.			",931,236,44,74,58,15,101

												Greed: Black Border is too imbalanced in terms of difficulty to recommend.While the game is beautiful to look at, runs at a great speed despite very intricate pre-rendered and live graphics (the mix of which often causes other ARPGs to get choppy), it's gameplay wildly fluctuates between appreciably challenging and downright diabolically cheap.It's a shame because at the points in the game the devs get it right, this makes a great play of being a science fiction alternative to other point and click hack and slashers, and makes a very good transition from their predominantly sword based gameplay into gun based action. Effectively, when Greed is good, it is very very good.This only serves to make the multiple difficulty spikes (actually never mind spikes, cliffs), poorly thought out mobs and insanely cheap sudden deaths all the more frustrating and hard to forgive. The boss fights are next to impossible, and many of the higher level enemies can almost instantly kill you from off screen. Enemies at times seem to shoot you with their highest damage attack from the end of a corridor across an entire map, and in general, the game really forces you to save every time you kill something or suffer the consequences and that really destroys your immersion. To cap this off, there is no enemy respawn or randomised encounter system to enable you to grind until you're too powerful to get cheap-shotted into oblivion during a boss fight or violated into a reload for the cardinal sin of opening the wrong flipping door. I could forgive the game suddenly going off the deep end without warning over and over if I could've run around doing the equivalent of stabbing rats until I was big and hard enough to not have to worry a la any JRPG you care to mention, but EXP is finite and levelling is painfully slow even on Easy.I don't mind hard games at all. I have two Ninja Gaiden games and around 50 bullet hells sitting in my games collection, and I've even finished a few of them. I enjoy a well put together challenge. However I cannot stand a schizophrenic, jumpstarting, spiking and above all else, cheap attempt at a challenge. Greed has no balance to it's gameplay at all, veering constantly between laughably easy and nihilistically, keyboard-punchingly difficult with next to no warning, and no amount of high performance, great music (sadly actually FANTASTIC music) or interesting ideas can save it from that one issue.If you're a hardcore masochist, or you pee EXP and poop cure potions, this might be for you.But for anyone who doesn't view 200 restarts on the same boss fight because it's got an instant kill homing bullet on STAGE ONE as their idea of fun, avoid.

												Greed BlacK Border is getting much better and more interesting after the first 3-4 maps-levels, when you meet the Trader and finally you get off the spaceship on the planet surface. That is my personal opinion.In general, the game is a Diablo-style with ranged-space-weapons, as you can see from various internet sources. It has a slower pace than the manster-mob-madness of diablo, thus being a bit 'slower' on action. It also incloudes a few of simple wriddles.The first impression of the game is its worst enemy: 1st: You start at levels with repeated and slow enemies. 2nd: All the items you find at the beging look alike, with only difference a minimum change at the statistics. All the weapons look like they have the same grafic model. At the begining, I thought that the game was a low-budget that has nothing to do with 'dressing-up' your character. I was also wandering why the developers bothered to make a rotating-3d-model of your character at the inventory screen, since there was no reason for more than one admiring-look to my avatar.3ed: Your skill tree does not look interesting, neither 'grafically' nor in the essence of the skills.I was ready to quit, but I had read in a review that the game gets better later on. (I can not track down the review now, to give thangs and credit to the writer :-( ... )And now I am glad that I didn't quit on the game.After you find the trader, the 'feeling' gets much better and I got some fun playing the game. There is a bit better variety of items, even thow not as mach as i would like. I can justify it considering the 'game world setting: Industrialised, standardised production. The enemies have now a variety of forms and tactics (there are also crubs that dig-hid in the ground and attack you from  below with spike-claws). Even if they are not so intriguing like diablo-2.The setting and feeling of the game now is rewarding, and the more relaxed-slow pace regarding to Diablo, now looks to be part of the game experience, completly in harmony with the game setting, not frustating me any more.I define the game slow-paced, becouse there are usually a few enemies but with many HitPoints each. The Marine character I tried most, will aways need a second or two to finish a standard enemy... Not frustrating any more for me, but definetly something that could tire sombody out of the game.One more negative factor still in place after 2-3 map-areas is that once you add an upgrade module at a weapon-armor you can not remove it to replace with a better one. This is constantly frastrating, and i can only bare it becouse at normal difficulty the upgrades boosts dont look so crusial.In general, I am having fan with the game (mostrly after meeting the trader and landed on the first planet). If you have not played Titan Quest or Diablo 2, you should keep your money for those two gems of gaming. If you have been througth the fabulouse hack-&-slash games in your collection, and are looking for a new one with a space-mashine-gun setting, then Greed Black Border is a good option, surely worthing 4 or 5 euros for the hours of funny, relaxing bulletstorm it can offer.Considering that the game is not a big one (it took me about 15 gameplay hours to complete all the three game areas), and that personally I don't feel intrigued to start a second replay with an other character class emediately, I would recommend the game, rating it as 3/5.Edit: I read in some reviews about broken control of your character... I have not yet ecnounter any control issues, regardless that i have rearange the key-commands to my liking... Version of game I play is the 1.03			",255,93,5,80,29,0,91

												I wondered just how bad this could be, and then I found out that in an already overcrowded genre (top-down action RPGs), this is easily bottom ten, because basic features like ""shooting the thing right next to you"" don't even work consistently. Or ""oops, your dodge move will only function randomly"".In fact, I don't know that a single thing worked properly 100% of the time. Sometimes I had to hit the button two or three times to advance dialogue too. It's sort of Bad Ratsian that way. It's a sci-fi Diablo wannabe in a world where Bad Rats Physics are the laws of the universe.			",2445,961,89,309,287,27,386

												A horrible, poorly thought out and executed trainwreck of a game with poor controls and a severe lack of creativity. I'd really like to know what the developer did to receive such positive reviews.I'd like to say that it's heart is in the right place, but several glaring problems really make it a horrible experience, including instant death agility puzzles (What kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥thought it would be a great idea to have those annoying rotating sawblades of death and three hits and you die sentry guns you need to get past), which is especially annoying to traverse when paired with rather sloppy controls and poorly placed checkpoints. On top of that there's an almost unwinnable first boss battle, unless you know how to best build your character and be able to eat that incoming damage. Also, when I got to the next chapter, I was hoping for new opponents, but for the most part these were nothing more than a case of ""same enemy type, different appearance"" which is just plain lazy.Seriously, do not buy, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥			",178,42,0,22,18,0,28

												Kinda fun, for a while.A bit too slow pace combined with half empty corridors, take some of the fun out of otherwise pretty good dungeon crawler. This game has small but notisable flaws on many places. Handling is as fluid as it could be, nor is it well explained in tutorial. Auto pickup is also missing, it's something that many of us have learned to love.In a way his brings back memories about Crusader: No regret. After 6 hours of playtime and stage 1 finished, I really can't say that I will return to play, but I wont remove it from harddrive neighter. First few hours went kinda fast.I got it from bundle at very good price, so It was worth every dollar.			",109,23,0,7,8,0,13

												Surprisingly better than I expected it to be. It was so super cheap that I couldn't pass up purchasing it when on sale, and expected it to not be very good. However, I find myself enjoying myself as I explore the first level with a pyro burning stuff up. I'm not sure how well it will hold my attention or how good it will be later on, but for now I would recommend getting it if you're just looking for something interesting to poke at now and then. Especially if it's on sale. A lot fo reviews complain about bugs and bad controls, but I have experienced niether of those issues. May be more fun with friends than solo, or less fun, who knows! But, if you see it cheap, give it a go. I'd give it at least a 6/10, if it had more classes, customization, or even just a steam workshop I would give it an 8/10.			",129,20,1,21,14,1,18

												GREED is a sort of hack-and-slash styled game in a sci-fi setting, giving you access to such exciting classes as ""flamethrower guy"", ""gatling gun guy"", or ""energy rifle girl"".  Noteable features of the game are the surprisingly good music track, ambient and very fitting to the theme and mood of the game, and some particularly deadly traps, usually based on careful, timed movements.Sadly that's where the remarkable features end, unless you count the baffling absense of ANY variety of equipment in the game; there seems to be approximately one type of weapon and armor for each class with a single new variant only being discovered in each succeeding chapter, leaving absolutely no choice in the matter of which gear to use, save for slottable upgrades which provide basic alterations such as improved armor, health, weapon damage, bonus skill ranks, etc.			",201,55,1,27,15,2,16

												People were right, this is a turd. From the time I've played this game you fight generic enemies. Your shield takes forever to recharge. The big reason I stopped was because of bugs and problems with the game. First off, after one cutscene the game would not let me move, and clicking and pressing buttons did nothing, even if I pressed escape to the menu. So there I had to restart last checkpoint and it worked the next time. The final straw was when you step in the first checkpoint and it explains that they save your progress, I soon died after in a fire part that didn't make a lot of sense, and it started me all the way back at the start of the level, and I couldn't load the other checkpoint. And for such an apparently boring and uninspired sh!t game, I wasn't going to replay the same exact level for the THIRD time becaus the game has problems and can't work right even after all these years. Also you can't change graphics/difficulty/other settings in game, which is always sooo stupid. 4/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												This game doesn't work on a deep level. It's supposed to be a traditional action RPG, but in space with guns, but the control scheme it has means you can't move and shoot at the same time. This results in you standing still while clicking on enemies, misclicking, moving, trying to click again, and so on. It screams to let you move and shoot, like every other top-down game with guns. Add a lack of interesting character building, dark and dull graphics, tactically boring enemies, and you have no reason to play this dreck.			",455,119,14,67,34,5,92

You can only use WASD to do a quick dodge and the wait for it to reload, htis is so damn unnecesary, if you where to move with WASD and just aim with the mouse this would become so much simpler.Its such a task of a game that is not worth it.

												The gameplay of Diablo (2), the art asthetic of Starcraft (2) and the plot of Dead Space (1). You are a space hero, responding to a distress signal from a space mining ship because... well, it's not really explained, you just are. Anyway you find out in short order that some kind of space plague has turned everyone into space zombies and you pretty much have to kill them all.This game is actually better looking that I expected, but unfortunately it falls flat in terms of gameplay, which is sadly rather bland. The level up and equipment systems are both very basic and uninteresting. Left-click is used for move, attack, interact, and pickup, which can be problematic if you mis-click, and some of the pickups, particularly ikarium, which serves as the 'gold' of this game, is actually quite tiny to click on.Overall an average game. Could be good for a few hours of fun on a train for instance. But if you're looking for a good ARPG and have an internet connection I would recommend Path of Exile instead, which is pretty much better all-around.			",843,293,32,127,114,14,175

												An interesting game that's sort of a mix between Diablo and Alien Swarm. It's not amazing, by any means, but pretty fun if you have a couple of people to co-op with. Worth the pittance it costs if you like this sort of thing and don't expect a great solo experience.			",635,272,12,103,70,7,115

												Greed is a boring and broken mess. There is a complete lack of a story, interesting gear, and enemy variety. The controls are clunky and unresponsive. You will find yourself constantly running into enemies instead of shooting at them. Combat is dull. Enemies are bullet sponges and take forever to kill. Skills are seizure inducing.Tunngle is required to get multiplayer working, and even then there are quirks to joining a game and when you do be prepared for bugs and friendly fire. My full video review is available here:

												This is the third person hack-n-slash game to play if you want to kite for hours on end. Interesting game assets, but overall not engaging to play. Game progression is slow, inability to rotate 3P camera is unbelievably annoying. Tutorial font is difficult to read. Map design is somewhat linear, following the idea of ""if there's an enemy there it means I haven't explored it"". Buggy movement controls, sometimes moving character even when not holding down mouse button.			",61,8,0,7,11,0,14

												I am not impressed. It plays very slow. Not much as far as usable loot drops. Played through 6 levels and only found one gun that was better than the starter. It takes far too much to kill one enemy. I find myself running away and firing a few shots. As far as the skill tree goes, its fairly thin as well.  Its too bad, it could be a pretty fun game.

												What a waste of 0.44€... Even at this price I fill ripped off.Bad controls, despite what Onlinewelten.com seems to think:- only one button to fire/move, so you can't move while firing + sometimes you'll fire on something when what you really wanted was to move somewhere (like an explosive barrel, preferably near you...)- there is a free fire button, but it does not even stop you when your moving: you have to wait for your character to stop when you last clicked, before being able to fire...Bad line of sight handling, or rather lack thereof: if you character can see an enemy, but the camera cannot because of a wall, then tough luck! Enemies only get highlighted if you have the cursor hovering on them...The enemies are bullet sponges, and how so dumb: they will stop coming at you when out of sight, get stuck on corners/crates...You can't fire through barriers (those are waist high...)...History? I don't know, really I could not most muster an ounce of care for it...So anything good you ask? Huh, no idea, since I stopped playing....			",411,188,9,77,10,2,59

												This is the first and one of the only two purchases I've regreted on Steam. Very unimpressive weapon/equipment designe. Loots are what made a dungeon crawling game fun, and this game has nothing in it. Everything are just the same, you can pick up 1001 rifles and #1001 is just the same as #0001. I have progressed through 5 stages and I'm still using the same rifle from the beginning of the game, because I can't find any reason to replace my rifle #0001.Weapon and Armor upgrades are uninspiring. Never bothered to insert any into my gears.All the game permits the player to do is shoot, shoot run, run, shoot and run some more. This is a very boring game, that's sad, since I do appreciate the graphics and world setting of the game, but other than that, there is nothing leaving any impression in my head about this game.

												The idea of a science fiction action rpg isn't bad, but the execution is rather flat and the controls are really bad. Too often your character will move when you need it to shoot. This is exactly what makes Diablo a joy to play (even though D3 disappointed me in almost every other sense) - the flow of action, looting and progression. Greed: Black Border is a constant struggle against the controls and fraught with frustration over your character misbehaving.			",229,46,6,37,20,1,64

This game is a lot like Alien Swarm, except the controls (or that there of) are f*cking hard to use.Lets talk about the controls, there's only one. Left-click.You have to hold left-click to move, hold left-click to shoot, open doors and pick up sh*t.Yes there is W-A-S-D to dodge roll but that takes forever to regenerate so let's not even count that.The shooting is akward, you click and hold on an enemy which stops your player/character in place. Once the enemy is dead, you have to re-click on another, you cant just have it held down the entire time and highlight over the next enemy no you can't do that we won't allow it. So when you're fighting groups of 5-6 normally at a time it's f*cking annoying and I feel bad for literally r*ping my mouse.The visuals are really good, but the whole RPG-style is a little confusing.Thankfully you're given infinite ammo because when you encounter undead/zombies later on they take 5000 f*cking rounds just to kill one while being attacked by a group.It's meh, if you can get past the awful controls then you'll like it for sure.5/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												At first I thought this game would be a nice diablo-style sci-fi game. But I couldn't get past the first level becuase of the ""death disco"" room with spinning lights in every direction that auto-kill you if so much as your pinkie toe hits them for more than a second. I literally tried everything, but short of an invulnerability cheat this area was impassible for me. I'm sure theres a pattern or something to it, and if I tried it enough times I could probably beat it, but no... just no. This♥♥♥♥♥♥is not fun. Your character controls like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The camera angle is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cannot be changed - frequently pitting you agains the most powerful enemies from angles which you cannot see them until they are right on top of you. I picked the plasma class (sniper) in which range is key to success. But it is a farce, the enemies are always right up in your ♥♥♥♥ing face, and the ones that aren't either have the same range benfits you do, dealing far more damage per shot, or even better range. DO NOT BUY!			",120,34,0,40,13,0,8

												Greed Black Border is probably the worst loot hunting game I’ve ever played. No I take that back, this game doesn’t even have its own loot appeal done correctly. If you think the itemization in Dungeon Siege 3 is bad, better look again at this game. You spend the entire game carrying the same rifle. Every weapon you pick up is the exact same weapon with different numbers and weapon slots; the same thing applies to armor as well. On top of that Greed Black Border gameplay is a giant snoozefest, nothing screams unoriginal and uninventive when you can play a looting hunting game with just your mouse. Everything is done via right clicking or left clicking. Don’t even bother with skill swapping with number keys; the mana system is done so poorly that you will never have enough mana to quick cast two abilities anyways. I had to use speed hacks to get through this game without falling asleep, yeah avoid this god awful title.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												This game blindly copies Diablo for no benefit. It's as if the developers thought to themselves,""Hey guys, let's make a sci-fi ARPG with hardly any RPG elements, where you use the left mouse button to attack AND move! No, we can't just use WASD to move, that's for dodging! No, we can't make double-tapping dodge instead!""Not only am I confused as to what they DID decide to copy, but also what they DIDN'T. It's a little mind-boggling when I try to picture them sitting around, saying,""Remember how in Diablo II there was a RUN button? Let's not bother with that, even though we pretty much already have a stamina bar we're using for the dodgeroll. You know how Diablo is all about the LOOT? Kinda unnecessary, let's only have ONE GUN for each class, make the droprate and variety incredibly low, stuff like that.""Anyways, as for my experience, I picked the Plasma class because I'm a little mad about StarCraft: Ghost being canceled, and I wanted to play as Nova.Very first time I leveled up, I took a look at the passive skills and found the ""I WIN"" mode: an ability to transfer damage taken to the energy use for skills.Turns out this ability straight-up made me invulnerable. I mean, I figured I'd be too busy shooting bad guys with my gun to bother with active abilities, but the energy bar replenishes so fast that it's almost hard to actually take damage to your normal shield, let alone your actual health.In conclusion, the game is boring, the control scheme is inappropriate, and the sounds, music, story, environments and enemies aren't even worth mentioning, and I would not recommend playing this game unless you want a simple sci-fi Diabloish game to turn off your brain and play on auto-pilot.

												There are games you can define as a ""bad Diablo"". This game is a bad bad Diablo. It isn't good enough to even be considered a bad Diablo.But it's cheap (it cost me a little over 1 €), it's reasonably fun and it can give you some good times before you finish it or become tired of it. Definitely a recomendation if you have nothing else to play.			",67,15,1,33,4,0,14

												Greed: Black Border starts you off as a marine of your choice responding to a distress signal. You have a choice between three play styles right off the bat. Short range, Medium range, and Long range. My review is for the Long range character. The basics of my class were just a sniper plasma weapon with some interesting skills and passive skills. Unfortunately, the game isn't really long enough to unlock most of the skills but the ones you do unlock are fun nonetheless.The graphics are amazing. I wouldn't say that they are very high tier but they have a nice sharp texture to them and they just look great. I haven't experienced any bugs or graphical glitches throughout my full 14 hour playthrough. I understand that steam says that I played for less time but my internet went out and I played offline. Not that any of that matters. The graphical engine is similar to Alien Swarm with less gloss.I will be the first to admit that there is little to no story in this game. So if you are looking for a wonderful and immersive story, this won't be your cup of tea. This game is more focused on the combat. Let me explain how the combat works. You move similarly to Diablo III with the whole point and click. WSAD are very much useless unless you plan to dodge roll. You can also dodge roll by pressing spacebar and you'll move in the direction your mouse is facing. The dodge roll has a cooldown, about 2.5 seconds at default if I remember correctly. In this game, for long range at least--your shield is your best friend. I added a perk that allowed me to defer some of the damage done to my shield to my energy.You also have an energy bar which is directly tied to your skill use. For example, a ball that sucks enemies towards it and does massive damage. Something like that may cost 170 energy. In order to prevent skill spamming, this game also has a cooldown for the skill. It's not that long of a wait and it is very effective. I'm not sure if it was a common game mechanic or due to my choice in the passive skill to reduce shield damage by transferring some of it to shield--but when enemies hit me it would reset the cooldown and I'd be waiting twice as long. Not much of a problem for me being a long range character, although this may have an effect on the close range character. I haven't tested it yet.There is a merchant in this game as there is in almost any kind of game nowadays. The merchant will sell you goods such as, in my case, different damage plasma rifles, armor, health and energy potions. They aren't really a potion but that's what it can be interpreted as. The game does lack in story as well as lootable items. The currency in game is Ikarium, a rare mineral in which enemies will drop, you'll find in lootable sources, and selling items to the merchant. As you are on the last section of the first chapter, you will discover the merchant. He will give you an item which will allow you to teleport to him and sell items. There is a 5 minute RT cooldown in which the merchant will be switching up the items he's selling. If he doesn't have the item you want then, just wait the cooldown out and check again.A few weapons and armor will have socketed items similarly to the embedded gem system in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. I was disappointed to realize that once an item has been placed in the socketable items, they are forever embedded there. This is a silly design but it does not affect the gameplay too much. The merchant will typically sell you a small variety of the upgradable items.The first boss that you encounter has a large pool of HP and you might find this to be very annoying. There are no checkpoints during the boss battles but they have relatively easy attacks to dodge. Just hang in there! Bosses are nowhere near as tankish th rest of the game. There are three chapters in the game. My first chapter lasted me about five hours, second being around two, and the third being around seven. Overall not too bad. There is definitely replayability as there is new game+. The point and click is doomed to have some issues with movement as you are not fully in control all the time with these kind of games. Although you can just hold down the mouse button to move and use your mouse to direction, it can still be annoying. Your hands will get tired while playing this game as there is a lot of clicking. The attacking will require you to left click enemies and your skill move will require you to right click. You can hold shift and click in order to attack without the risk of moving towards the enemie accidentally. It does get annoying when sometime you're attacking an enemy and you wish to retreat as they get closer to you, but the game continues to attack and you'll take a hit. This hasn't been a major deal to me as no enemies have landed a killing blow on me due this.The health and energy ""potions"" can be activated in three ways: a bind(preset) Q-Health E-Energy, clicking the icon on the hud, and clicking the item via the inventory. This allows you to flow freely through combat without menus and such. This game has an interesting set of enemies that all have different abilities. Robots, bees, scorpions, wasps, and a zombie type of character. Most of them have unique attacks. For instance, the chemist zombie will shoot some liquid out of his mouth and heal the other zombies around him. Taking him out will require the others to regenerate health slowly. Another important thing to note is that there is no autosave in this game. There are quite a few checkpoint marks on the ground in which you must click on to save your game. It is worthwhile to travel back to an area to save as there are some cheap instant kills occasionally with puzzles and enemies. I found the key codes in the first chapter to be a very unique addition. Trying to figure out codes that were not blatantly handed to you reminded me of the game Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Sitting there trying to read a log, or look at a piece of paper and figure out the meaning of it. I felt very interested in trying to figure out the codes myself as opposed to searching the internet for the answer. Overall, the game is not perfect. I did find it to be a bit on the shorter side due to a lack of story progression. But this game is definitely a diamond in the rough. I found it to be very fun and a total bargain. I mean, $5.00 for this game? Just that is a deal let alone the $1.00 steam sale. I would even go as far as to say I'd spend $10.00 on this game if it had more of a story. I've seen some $30.00 games or even $60.00 games that don't compete with this. Get it, play it, enjoy it. Even if you don't enjoy it, it's $5.00. It's not going to break the bank. I'm interested in playing through the game a handful more times to test the difficulties and try out the other characters.			",168,27,0,17,11,0,7

												I want to say this game is great.  But as a single player game it's just...mediocre.Looks beautiful, I love the lighting effects! It's shiny, It reminds me of the art direction of Star Craft... especially with how similar the Engineer looks to Nova.  Ahem.The gameplay itself is actually pretty solid, like nothing completely glitching out on me, but then again there doesn't seem to be an excessive use of features to really screw it up.  It's a pretty basic premise.  You have short range Pyro Guy, Mid Range Marine Mini-Gun guy, Long Range I'm Not Nova GIrl.  They have skills that you can upgrade and find a combination to a play style you want to do... which ever that is I guess.The game itself is pretty unforgiving and will take building a character a couple of times before you say ""Wait a second, I should plan this out a little"" and by Plan this out I mean Figure out which two passive builds I want to go with followed by which secondary move is going to work with me... otherwise your character is going to suck and die.  Get respawned.  Then Suck and die again.  Players who arn't used to that sort of mechanic will quickly either A) Lose Interest or B) Learn the hard way.You find loot, you slot loot...like Diablo.  Or most other hack and slash games.  Most enemies are pretty straight forward though have pretty special AI.  LIke they can get stuck in corners very easily.  A good number of enemies if they lose a little bit of sight of you will just forget about you altogether.I would still recommend this game though, for one reason. Multiplayer.It took me playing this a little while, after kiting enemies and realizing how incredibly tanky everything is and it just donned on me.  Could it be that this game was intended for Co-op?  Well... yeah actually.  3 Players, run through the game- play off eachothers strategies and inch their way to victory with a lot less kiting... A LOT LESS KITING.  Ok ok, still a decent amount of Kiting but each battle doesn't make you run back 100 meters screaming ""JUST DIE ALREADY"".  Granted I feel the game does try to make up for Single Player by putting explosive barrels everywhere AND thank some lord out there that the pack of zombies or robots don't seem to go into very very high numbers.  So Multiplayer is pretty much dead, so if you were hoping to catch an internet game well...good luck with that.  But don't let that stop you.  Your best bet is to wait for it to go on sale, buy two extra copies for your 2 friends that play these kind of games and say...  ARE YOU READY FOR A CHALLENGE!?!?!?!? Then record you talking crap and post it to Youtube.Easy Peezy.			",363,44,6,53,12,2,24
