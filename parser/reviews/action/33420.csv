												The Call of Juarez series is one I'd definitely recommend giving a go. Every game in the series is distinct and has its own identity, which is something I really appreciate. I'll avoid going into too much detail about the rest here, but they're all a good time with individual strengths and weaknesses that form a satisfying whole.Unfortunately, the defining characteristic of game number three, The Cartel, is that it's an utter shambles. The classic Wild West setting of the previous games was ditched for a staggeringly uninspired modern-day Los Angeles/Mexico counterpart, which is exactly as appealing as it sounds (i.e. not at all). Likewise, the hole left by the entertaining and likeable cast of the first game and Bound in Blood (like legendary gunslinger Ray McCall) is filled with some of the flattest caricatures to ever spout tired one-liners. Once all the character and charm of Call of Juarez has been stripped away, what you're left with is a medicore first-person shooter that is an absolute chore in single-player and probably not much better in the new co-op mode. Solo players be warned: your AI partners are incompetent, and they will make no effort to hide it, though they will continually belittle your performance as you carry them for the game's entire duration.Lackluster AI, boring gunplay, dull visuals and an uninteresting plot combine for eight hours of unmitigated tedium. The only saving grace is the way the game ends, which could have been a pretty cool conclusion to a much better game, but is of course held back here by being part of The Cartel. In retrospect it's good that the series had one final outing after this, though The Cartel remains a testament to how quickly good games can go bad. It's almost worth playing just for that lesson, though I'd suggest you try any of the others over this rubbish.			",298,68,5,40,20,1,40

												I have finished about 1/3 of the game. So far so good. I would love to give it thumbs up. But unfortunatelly i will have to do the opposite.I cannot continue.On first day everything was fine. Uplay and steam worked fine together. Accounts were conected and i have seen no problems.Day after - Uplay doesn't allow me to log in. ""Too many log-in attempts"". Rubbish. If 0 is too many then f*** you ubisoft. Click on play offline - to play offline log in to your account... Argh...UPlay is steaming piece of s***.AVOID BUYING ANYTHING THAT REQURES DOUBLE DRM (especially if second drm is uplay).Sadly CoJ:TC is one of those games.:(UPDATE!Uplay kindly allowed me to log in after some time, and I was able to finish the game. Still cannot recommend it. On highest possible difficulty game was easy and I was still dying all the time because of technical issues (for example killed by enemy that fell below the ground xD).Driving in this game is terrible (and they made too many parts that needs driving). Shooting is nice and story is decent (especially endings). AI is probably worst AI created ever and your companions deal almost no damage. Game was designed for co-op, but you won't find anybody to play with.SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT for Achievement hunters.Achievements are broken. Probably because of double DRM.Haven't received Achievo for beating game on hardest difficulty.In the middle of the story - game stopped counting towards some achievements (fe. kill 30 people in slow motion), while other were working.Turning off steam cloud, setting uplay to offline mode, deleting all saves (in steam and uplay) and reinstalling game helped with some achievements. But not with the one for beating game in hardest difficoulty - looks like this one is impossible to get.SUMMARY:DON'T BUY THISBloom effect will burn your eyes, technical issues will frustrate you and double DRM will do everything to not let you even launch the game.

												Let me start by saying I really do enjoy this game, it really isn't as bad as the reviews say. However, I completely and fully say do not bother with it on Steam. The uPlay is absolutely awful, and the game refuses to play on every computer I have tested it on (and I am FAR above even the recommended settings.) After attempting to start new game, the game crashes and you are taunted with a ""Thank you for playing Call of Juarez: The Cartel"" window from ubisoft. ♥♥♥♥ those guys, and ♥♥♥♥ this game on steam.Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ the censorship here, you can eat a♥♥♥♥♥♥ censorship you punk♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",163,13,1,9,4,0,5

												Even though I'm giving it a thumbs up, I have mixed feelings about this game. The Cartel is the worst game in the Call of Juarez series, but it does have a few features that other games in the series (and even many co-op FPS games in general) don't have and make this game unique and somehow enjoyable to play. I would recommend this, but only when it's heavily discounted and you've got one or two friends to play in co-op with.PROS+ Good campaign mode with an intriguing (and underrated) storyline and characters, 4 endings and amazing soundtrack.+ An ""unusual"" take on co-op approach+ Replayable: 3 playable characters each with their own objectives, roles and dialogues (e.g. talking with different characters on the cellphone). Playing the story once with one character, in fact, may lead to plot-holes.+ Varied levels with car chases, nightclub shooting, highways and more.CONS- Unfinished: the game got released when its development wasn't finished yet. It is technically horrible, with dull graphics, many bugs and audio issues. Expect frustrating moments.- The main menu and the first levels are dull (luckily the game gets slightly better and more interesting afterwards).- The gunplay, the driving and grenades.- No drop-in joining (players can only join your co-op match at the start of a level).The game as-is, is MOSTLY technically horrible, but if you can get past its technical issues and focus on everything else, you might enjoy it in co-op with one or two friends. If only Techland had more time to develop this it could have probably been a masterpiece; co-op mode is good and unique, the story is decent and has its moments, but the rest is heavily unpolished. Dead Island, which is made by the same devs, got released in the same year.Tip before you play: don't tell your friends what you're doing and what your character says in certain moments for the full experience!

												Call of Juarez is a western-themed FPS game series released by Ubisoft. The Cartel is the ""odd one out"" in this series as it is the only one taking place in a modern day setting instead of the good old Wild West. Interestingly, the concept works and it makes for a good - albeit somewhat mediocre - game that fans can feel free to pick up as it becomes, after all, an important part of the franchise.The game is best played cooperatively. For some reason the developer decided to pick not two (remember Bound In Blood?) but 3 protagonists. When playing alone they are controlled by the A.I but they are not exactly sharpshooters; however, the upside here is that you do not need to revive any of them.They all work for a different organisation serving their country - Ben is an LAPD cop (he wears a cowboy hat and his surname indicates he is the descendant of Ray McCall from the 1st game), Kim is from the FBI and Eddie represents the DEA. They are all after The Cartel and during gameplay each of them receives a phone call asking them to complete a secondary objective. This is pretty funny as with each player you are to pick up various things and the rest cannot know about it. If noticed, you lose the opportunity. These are all illegal activities (such as stealing money) as to a certain degree all of them are dirty.There are some driving sequences, too. One player drives while the rest do the shooting. The mechanics are similar to the one experienced in Dead Island (another Techland game series): it is pretty easy to navigate but the camera is positioned behind the dashboard so you do not exactly have the chance to change the view. There's also levelling up that unlocks newer and more powerful weapons throughout the game but it is pretty generic. Multiplayer is also available and while it does not offer anything new it is pretty entertaining. Like I said this is the odd one out in the series but it does not mean it is a bad game. At the time (2011) the Chrome engine already looked outdated and while there is a handful of cinematics the game's story is not exactly very original. Still, The Cartel is an entertaining game and if you liked Call of Juarez you might get fond of this, too. Just remember: beside McCall's character and the slow-mo shootouts and the available revolvers nothing really makes you remember its predecessors. Perhaps it's best to wait for a discount so as not to be disappointed very much.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												An extremely mediocre offering and I write this as a RABID Call of Juarez and all things western fan. I went into this looking for even a schlocky B-movie sort of good time after purchasing it on sale and I had to muster a LOT of courage to make it through to the end. Disappointing gunplay, terrible driving segments, paper thin characters and plotting, only play it if you're desperate for a gritty crime shooter and you've literally played everything else on your backlog. A huge disappointment. The series was thankfully put back on track with Gunslinger and I expect great things from Techland regarding the future of the franchise. But this one? Keep clear.

												The Call of Juarez franchise should've stopped with the first one, which was plain bad! But then Bound in Blood changed my mind! But then The Cartel appeared and strenghtened my first feeling! But then Gunslinger appeared and gave me that nice nostalgic feel of the 2nd one! Boy, those are a lot of ""But then""s :PAnyways, The Cartel Is an average FPS that lets you play as 1 of the 3 agents at your choice, each one with it's unique abilities (but those abilities/skills are pretty boring, like faster reload for pistols with one guy, the other reloads faster with SMGs and can Dual-Wield them and the female agent reloads rifles faster, aaaand that is it...)Going to the graphics, they are below average, bad texture pop-ins here and there and offline lag! YES! The campaign lags when you play (framerate drops and lag, actually), when you run to be specific, same issue that I had previously with Dead Island (same engine BTW).Character models are just awful and the dialogue is f*cking laughable.Gameplay wise, the guns all feel pretty much the same, and they all feel bad! Except the pistols, so I just used the pistols the whole game, except during Concentration mode (slows down time and increases accuracy for a short period of time) that you get by killing people, and also used rifles and smg's during the car shootout and car chases, because pistol kind of suck in those situations. There are also pretty ugly bugs here and there and some glitches, but Techland just doesn't give a sh*it and instead of patching it up, they just decided to move on to another sh*tty project called Dead Island: Riptide, and that worked out pretty well, didn't it? Huh...Multiplayer is your standard rack up kills, get XP, new level, YAY! Here's a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon, have a blast!Noone plays it anymore btw, so if you want to get it, buy for the SP Campaign (with a bad story as well, pretty bad and nonsensical and uninteresting and many more bad adjectives) which is decently long (around 7 to 8 hours) and the collectibles are an interesting mechanic as well as they work like side missions and you kind of have to do it discretely so that the other 2 agents don't catch you. It makes things a bit more tense and spices up things, making the campaign interesting enough until the end.Co-Op is also pretty fun with friends. It's a standard 3 player maximum co-op mode where each plays one of the in-game characters.There isn't much more to approach to this game but an extra fly in the soup: an extra DRM known as Games for Windows Li...AH! Just joking! It does NOT use GFWL, thankfully, but it does use UPlay, which is Ubisoft's DRM for their games, I haven't had any huge issues with this DRM, it's just annoying but I can live with it...it doesn't deserve more than a 4.5/10, save you 10 € for something better like Kane & Lynch 2 or Counter Strike: Global Offensive.I paid 4,99€ at a retail shop for this and honestly, I feel like it was worth it, but don't pay much more than that...

												This was a tough yes or no review. Def get the game when its on sale!! I beat the game once and i plan on beating it twice due to you get to play as 1 of the 3 characters. The story wise doesnt change as much just some little things such as the people calling you. Gameplay was okayish. The combat felt terrible at times and the driving is just like playing the enter the matrix game. Three annoying aspect about this game was that jumping off a small stair case can kill you, second one is when your trying to find items to lvl up sometimes you may go off the mission area causing you to fail the mission. and the last one is you have to follow the path the game gives you.Proslvl up system- giving you new weaponsCan choose your weapon loadoutSmall little side missions to do3 playable characters each have a different story (different story but you pretty much play the game all over again)2 different endingsconsBugs- Ai sometimes are in boxes and walls shooting at youCant go your on pathDriving is bloody awful.

												I don't get all the hate and bad reputation this poor game has earned.Sure, it isn't a Call of Juarez like the two before, or.. a Call of Juarez at all, as the only things in common are a guy called McCall, a trip to Juarez in a couple of stages, and the bullet-time which isn't as good as in the previous titles.It wasn't ported perfectly on PC, that's true. You almost can't set up the graphics at all, there's a motion blur and a depth blur that can be annoying, but you'll get used to them pretty soon.But for the rest? It's a simple action fps like tons of others, with badass characters ""maxpayneing"" their way against an army of bad dudes, a lot of gunfightings, explosions, car pursuits, a story that's maybe a bit confusing but overall good, great voice acting, the same easy controls as every fps...It may not be the most original fps of all times, it's very linear and doesn't allow you to explore anything, but.. who cares? It's fast paced, funny and entertaining for all its length, and never bored me.Give it a chance			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												Call of Juarez: Gunslinger was FANTASTIC! Creative story-telling approach, style, action, points-experience-powers, duels, etc. None of that is found in The Cartel. Nothing. Gained experience (given for stealing secret items only!) is used to unlock new guns only. So it always goes like this: cutscene (full of f-bombs and violence) followed by a linear shoot-out. Sometimes a short drive in a car that feels like plastic. That's it.Big fan of ALL previous Call of Juarez games. Disappointed with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright, all of the problems asside, slow frame rate, cheap difficulty, bad voice recording and buggy gameplay...Those things could have been forgiven if there was some substance to the story line that might tip the scales in this games favour...but there isn't even that. For some reason, it had to be made ""hip"" and set in modern day LA, where the previous games were set mainly in boarder towns between the southern USA and Mexico...The McCall brothers have been replaced by a DEA agent, an FBI agent and a street cop sergeant who looks like he was the attempt to rip off Ray McCall in modern day but fails in every way. I haven't gotten ALL the way through the game yet but even after nine hours of gameplay I've heard no mention of anything linking this to the previous two except for a last minute entry great grand son that the previous games never supported. There's not a mention of the gold of Juarez, or the town, or really anything to do with what the game is labeled about THE CALL OF JUAREZ...there's not any mention of the treasure let alone those who go mad searching for it. I'm not normally one to completely can a game unless there's nothing redeemable about it, and (I might not have played it enough, but) there is nothing redeemable about this title at all, I don't care about the characters, the story isn't engaging and the gameplay is broken and the sound design is well below sub-par...Play Call of Juarez, Call of Juarez - Bound in Blood and/or Call of Juarez - Gunslinger, and call those a trilogy, but avoid this one at all costs.

												This game is not as bad as everyone says it is. But it is one of the worst sequels of all time.I love the Call of Juarez franchise: the first one was good, ""Bound in Blood"" was great and ""Gunslinger"" is a fantastic FPS. But where does ""The Cartel"" stand?The story starts in a very mediocre way, following a police officer, a DEA officer and a FBI agent as they try to bring down the Mexican Cartel's operations in Los Angeles. The first levels are as dull as they can get, but as time goes on, there are multiple scenarios that are quite engaging: car chases through cities, shootouts in rainy docks...The only link to the other CoJ games are the police officer (a relative of Ray McCall) and some levels set in Juarez.The gameplay is really mediocre: the guns are recoil-less and they feel all the same. There isn't the dynamic cover like in  ""Bound In Blood"", and the special ability is your typical bullet-time. The three characters are identical, if not for tiny little differences (again, unlike ""Bound In Blood""): McCall has more accuracy with pistols, DEA with shotguns, FBI with rifles.The graphics are okay, but the worst parts are the FOV that can't be changed and the Depth of Field that works like♥♥♥♥♥(and can't be turned off). The Graphic Options are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor (unlike ""Bound in Blood"" xD), but you will get used to these issues after a while (2 hours max).Overall, this game is a really bad sequel, and definitely worse compared to ""Bound In Blood"".

												Bought this for the cooperative mode. Turns out even the coop mode couldn't bring back any replay value. Is this is a broken game? Well, it's not entirely broken but it's not a good game either. I had 1 playthrough and I felt like deleting it off from my HDD. Unfortunately, I wanted to get Upoints from for completing all of the character's campaign. It was suffering since all of their campaign were pretty much playing the same levels again.The good thing is that each character has their own perspective view. For instance, when your character is on the call, you can hear the conversation while others can't. This applies to coop mode where your friends can't hear what you're listening from your phone call.  Let's get straight to the point.The graphics is awful. It's very blurry. When you aim, anything apart from your center of your aiming scope gets blurred. Sometimes when the enemies are running around and your aim focused on the tree, everything gets blurry. It's hard to aim at the enemies. Using the directX 11 doesn't seems to have any difference. This game graphics is bad.I gave the sound average is because of the voice acting. Anything else felt like low quality sound effects. Your gun sound effects doesn't feel powerful. The soundtrack isn't memorable. At least they tried to use back the cowboy soundtrack. Very weak in this department.Gameplay is just a typical shooter game but feels very boring. You have multiple car chase, multiple gunfights and multiple enemy chasing on foot. Yes, they are repeating those same events through the 3 campaigns. It gets buggy like enemy pop out of no where. Enemies disappearing. The game gets broken where the event doesn't start. As for gunfight, you fight 4-5 enemies, then done, next area, 3-4 enemies, then move on, 3-4 enemies again. Very repetitive and very boring gunfight. Even in coop, it's nothing interesting about this except the challenge like who gets the 1st 5 headshots within the time limit. There are some other challenges but it's just competing with your friends That's it, nothing else. For public game, good luck finding one.Story is about the corruptions. The only reason you want to replay is because you wanted to know everyone's perspective. There are multiple ending as well. I spent so many hours on this game is because of that and the U points. Nothing much to say about this.I can't recommend this game as it is very weak. I got this game from promotion sale so I don't get much loss.My Rating:ExcellentGreatAverageBadGraphics: BadSound & music: AverageGameplay: BadStory: Average			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's be straight. Call of Juarez: The Cartel is not really a good game. It take the wild west setting of the previous installments and brings them to the modern day. The game is buggy, it's incredibly linear, the gunplay is mediocre, the enemies are on the bullet sponge side and the AI is nonexistent as your partners are absolutely worthless at times. That said, I had an absolute blast playing CoJ: The Cartel. It is the video game equivalent of playing a B-Movie, and I love B-Movies. You see all the ""twists & turns"" in the story a mile away in a cliche ridden script filled with stereotypes and eye rolling dialogue,  But like a trainwreck I just couldn't take my eyes off of it. You play one of the individuals from different agencies (FBI, DEA & LAPD) put in a task agency meant to take down the Mendoza Cartel who is responsible for drugs, gun running, human trafficking, domestic terrorism blah blah blah and then off you go. I really liked the level variety. You from the Sequioa National Forest to the Streets of L.A. to Arizona and finally to Juarez, Mexico. All very nicely realized. Gameplay wise, you don't have much to do other than going from point A to point B while killing lots of dirtbags along the way. Sometimes you'll get a side mission but those pretty much consist of finding an item on the level somewhere. One escort mission where you are being chased through the streets of LA and up the freeway deserves special mention. An absolute blast. I also felt the voice acting was excellent. Like I said, CoJ: The Cartel is not really a good game but I enjoyed the hell out of it.  If you're looking for political correctness, mind blowing set pieces & a leap forward into the FPS genre look elsewhere. But if the positives I've mentioned are up your alley, well here you go. 7/10 from me.			",509,215,8,51,24,6,63

												This game is....well to be generous....quickly thrown together and lacking in story, graphics, gameplay quality.  Really wouldnt recommend spending any more than a dollar on this.

												Where do I begin.How can a game this broken be sold over $4.99 anymore.  It's not fully broken, but there's still enough anoyances to make it a chore to play in 2016.I've wanted this game for a while. especially for coop, so for a couple bucks it's ok if you're ok messing with Uplay and tweaking config files. The FOV is terrible without tweaking.One thing that's funny is how Techland used the same voice actors in this as they did in Dead Island. Not only that, but some of the same dialog: ""You're not leaving here alive!""  Any Dead Island fan will be able to pick them out.Why review this old-a$$ game in 2016? It was on sale and we needed something new, knowing full well it was going to be a $hit$how.  Be aware it installs Uplay but doesn't use it for matchmaking. Checkpoints that dont' allow you to pass until you go back and clear the enemies.  Falling into sandpits in the map with no way of getting out.  These bugs are a joke, we are all beta testers.Pass on this, even when your buddy says to get something cheap for the weekend. Better off going to Burger King.			",204,18,14,10,16,1,16

												This was a terrible game. The point is that you have 3 protagonists who follow the main story but have unique side objectives. Although this is a good idea in theory (3 different games), they mostly just follow the same damn story and the only difference is what items you steal and the phone calls you get. Not worth 3 replays (not even 1). The story is hideously complicated with 3 different motivations and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of characters that you don't care about that it all merges together into crap. The levels are very linear and the weapon choices don’t really matter at all. The only pros are that the controls are pretty good and the cover does shred forcing you to move. Other than that, the game is bad			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												This is a perfect example of a very bad first impression.Coming directly from playing the first two games in the series, this one felt out of place and did not explain the giant leap of the old west setting to the modern-day world of the Mexican cartels. If you wait it out, the connection between them appears to be there, but it is not exactly obvious.It started as a generic, cheesy, and unbelievable story that eventually became a somewhat tolerable and almost interesting one that will end up being forgotten when compared to other story-driven first person shooters. Gameplay mechanics are nothing new and very generic. Shoot, cover, rinse and repeat with the straight forward driving sections to mix up the gameplay a bit.If you stick with it to the end, you can see some design choices that carried over from the others in the series, which they attempted to improve upon, but ultimately ended up with mixed results.This game was clearly made for a co-op experience and it is strongly recommended to play it that way if at first you find it really hard to have fun.It is not a very good game, but it is also not a completely bad one either. If you give it a chance, it can grow on you. With its equal amount of shining and eye-rolling moments, it is an underrated title.			",2017,830,86,261,257,21,367

The Mexican Drug War, Juarez style.Call of Juarez: The Cartel, third installment into Techland's CoJ series, seems like the misfit child of the bunch.  It's not as good as Call of Juarez: Gunslinger; it's not a game to be taken seriously or to carry any real expectations for, whether you're a fan of this developer or not.  As action shooters go, it's definitely more of the same.  It did provide me a brief bit of fun & includes a potentially decent cooperative experience.The Dead Island series & Dying Light are by Techland too, so if you liked those you'll be at home with The Cartel, which looks and feels similar in a number of ways.  Level design, enemy AI, linearity of missions, visuals/art, side tasks involving item collection, gun aiming & handling, driving & playable characters with unique personalities & combat characteristics all felt familiar.  What you shouldn't expect much of in The Cartel is homage to the CoJ series itself, 'cuz there ain't much.  You do get to play as a modern day McCall, dual wield revolvers, take a brief jaunt through a familiar place & hear a schpeel from a guy who's obsessed with the treasure of Juarez.  None of that gives this a real connection to the rest of the series, however.  In my opinion it lacks the flair that makes the others entertaining.By 2011 standards The Cartel is decent, & I'd say by today's (2015) it's mediocre but worthy of purchase on the cheap.  I got it on sale and can't imagine anyone doing otherwise, by now.  It's a very brief campaign consisting of 15 missions; took me about 7 hours to finish on Medium difficulty, with the AI companions rather than real teammates.The AI teammates worked out well enough, although I regrettably didn't play it with anyone else & thus missed out on what looks like a fun three player co-op.  You can breach rooms together, provide covering fire allowing allies to advance & also engage in some friendly competition via the Secret Agenda feature (each law enforcement agent has an ulterior motive & they each mistrust each other, so you try to catch the other two red-handed while being sneaky & accomplishing your own hidden objective unnoticed).I tried doing some multiplayer action online but was unable to find anyone for the Cops vs. Criminals mode or the online campaign mode.This game is published by Ubisoft & requires their client, Uplay to run alongside Steam.There were some (sadly not too) farfetched news clip cutscenes and a lot of interagency bluster between the LAPD, FBI & DEA that I found entertaining.  The entire game is pretty much a sensationalized portrayal of the Mexican Drug War.  Each character & most of the dialogue was cliche.  I feel like I'm describing a Hollywood blockbuster film.  I'm not saying I wouldn't recommend Call of Juarez: The Cartel to anyone; it was okay.  It just doesn't merit recommendation unless you're looking for a quick bit of shoot-em-up action & don't have better alternatives - or if you're a big fan of this dev & just crave that experience.

												TITLE : CALL OF JUAREZ: THE CARTELDATE : 13-Apr-2017 (Finished story)SETUP : Windows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80 (980M SLI) Laptop, Logitech F710 GamepadRATING (rated as if released in 2017) Optimization : BStorytelling : BGraphics : C Sound : CControl : CFun Factor : BValue : BV-Sync setting doesn't work, so the game performance could be as high as 200 fps before dropping to 30 fps on some scenes, making the visual looks choppy. The game requires Uplay, but I don't have problem with it. And unlike other Uplay games, this one have fully working Steam achievements.Storytelling is good enough with good voice acting and cutscenes. There are 3 playable characters and each character have it's own story (although the missions still the same for all of them). Graphics obviously are outdated, but still look beautiful enough with every missions offers different environment. Music and sound effect are standard, nothing impressive. Control is tight, but the gameplay mechanic is just standard first-person shooter (no leaning, no parkour, etc) although it does have bullet time system. The car driving is bad though. Beside the regular multiplayer match, this game also offers 3-players co-op campaign. But the way the game doesn't explain clearly how to do co-op campaign, so lots of people including me get confused at first. Basically, before each of the campaign mission, you will be in a ""lobby mode"" and this is the only place and time where you can invite friends to your game. If the connection break in the middle of a mission, you automatically enter single player mode and can't back into co-op mode until the mission is over and you're back in the ""lobby mode"".The game base price is low enough these days, and with great story, co-op and multiplayer match, it definitely worth it.

												Bargain bin material. That's all you guys should know. It's maybe worth €5. At first I didn't really know why people thought it was bad but the closer you get to the ending the more annoyed you'll become. The graphics are mediocre, definitely not bad, and the voice acting is also ok. The rest; the story, the gameplay, the menu (aaarrrrggghh, so hideous and simple); it's all forgettable. The stealing of illegal items is a nice idea by the way, but it's badly implemented, which is a shame really.If you have nothing, nothing, NOTHING else to play you might want to give this a try.[Rating: 52/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												It's a different game if you compare it to Call Of Juares series. It has many disadvantages and some advantages. The only one thing i love in this game is a weapons quantity. Lots of modern weapons. But plot is very weak. Plus game technique is very sharp. Stone age animation. Idiotic A.I. So the only one thing why you should buy this game is to support developers. We are all make mistakes, they did them too. But they made it up for us. So buy it just  to complete the collection in your steam library.Also: multi-player is dead!			",64,0,0,0,3,0,0

												So for starters, I have NOT played the co-op or multiplayer, in fact, from what I played of the singleplayer I think it would be majorly improved by playing with 2 other people rather than horrible AI partners.  The driving sections in particular, as well as the sequences where you're seperated (though few and far between) would be pretty epic playing with friends.Now that that's out of the way, let's start with the cons.UplayVery dull, repetitive gameplay for the most part, in fact, you know how most people rag on call of duty for being 6 hours long?  I kind of wish this game was done by 4 hours, but for whatever reason I powered through.  The full time for one playthrough (on hard) for me was about 12 hours.Low rez textures ect, only good looking texture in the game is really the bull revolver (from my point of view) though this is from like 2010 so mabye I'm just nitpickingSeriously, I didn't think uplay was a thing back then, only bought it because I thought it didn't require uplayReally common scripting bugs, from having the ai chars just not move (when you literally can't play the game without them moving to you meaning you have to restart the checkpoint) to scripted sequences where you're forced to literally slow down to a crawl, put your gun away, and sit infront of your cell phone screen for 30 seconds (often in the middle of a ***ing gunfight) ""NOT NOW DADDY I'm SHOOTING BAD GUYS!""Really unlikeable chars, I mean the only likeable main char was the sherrif I guess, and all the other chars are just really shallow (as in badly written, not just bad people), the story was awful, or at least awfuly portraied.  I think they were trying to fit together some kind of tv show thing where each level would be an eppisode, and had breaks from fighting to do other things (like harrass strippers, yes that's a pro).  Also, at least the ending I got was pretty terrible, though there's really about 2 endings.And I mean seriously, are these blood goggles?  ""Don't do drug violence kids, you'll have to wear blood goggles for 10 seconds till you heal!""


Am I wearing like blood goggles?

uplay plz...The gunplay is kind of awful most of the time, but with that in mind, it's also fairly decent sometimes, it seems to be contextual.  It might be better if you're not the only one shooting *stares at ai who are shooting at a brick wall*.Ok, now for the pros.There's a suprising ammount of vairety in guns, though not in the right ways unfortunately.  There're 2 snipers (one you get halfway through the game, the other you get at the end), and yet there's like 12 standard pistols and 5 revolvers, the pistols seeming to be the main focus on gameplay.Durring the 12 hours I played this game, I may have had a mental break.  Between boredom and frustration, and who knows what else, I actually got nostalgic for the 2nd worst part of the black ops 2 campaign...  Yes, that awful horse.  Or at least for me it was awful.  I spent an hour and a half on that mission, that was supposed to take at most 30 mins, trying to deal with how broken that horse was (at launch).  I was actually getting nostalgia pangs for that part of black ops 2, I'm not sure if this is a pro for the game, but it's a pro for black ops 2 at least.  That horse section was less borring than this game.


sir, your horse is dead, you're going to have to put it down.

A 6/10, only purchase it on a sale, it would be pretty fun with 2 other people, if you could convince them to buy it / play it with you, otherwise the single player is majorly boring, and I doubt anyone's on the multiplayer.But one more crucial piece of information is required.

												Call of Juarez®: The Cartel is the third game in the series. It is considered to be the worst Call of Juarez game, but is it realy that bad?I consider myself a fan of CoJ series. And I like western setting in general. So it was sad to hear that the third game of epic western shooters is actually not a western, because the action takes place in 2011 and the setting here is called...ugh, ""Neo-Western"". Well, whatever. I've read some reviews of this game before playing so I wasn't expecting much to begin with. But let's talk about it, there are good things and bad things, like in any other game.First thing, the story, the setting, the atmosphere and the soundtrack. Well, those are not half bad if you ask me. Well, the story is a mess actually, there are lots of uninteresting dialogs and complicated stuff in the mood ""who betrays whom"", actually the story here is much worse compared to all other CoJ games (even the Gunslinger). There are 3 playable protagonists, the police officer Ben McCall (a walking tribute to Ray McCall, not as Badass as the latter, but not half bad though), the DEA agent Eddie Guerra (for some reason he remonds me of Pierce from Saints Row series, probably because of those black and purple tones in clothes) and FBI agent Kim Evans (the girl with an attitude). Each of them has their own problems and ""inner demons"", but in the end I can tell that only Ben McCall is interesting enough as a character. Anyway, the characters don't trust each other, there is no bond between them so you won't like them too much anyway. The heroes must find and terminate the Mendoza Drug Cartel, who is presumably responsible for some kind of bombing in which several people died. They investigate deeper into the case and it turns out to be that the culprits are also their higher ups in FBI/DEA or whatever. Anyway there are many things in story that I didn't get fully and that's quite sad, when the plot is overweight in lots of uninteresting twists. I'd say the story is really poor, well, at least there are several endings.The graphics in the game are so-so. Not bad but not good either. They say the developers were testing the new engine, meh. The soundtrack is actually pretty good. There are many decent western-themed tracks that actually create a western-feel in the game. There will be some missions in western setting and you will even visit Juarez, so those levels come along nicely with the soundtrack. In terms of gameplay the game is so-so. You can play as one of three characters and the other two will accompany you as AI bots (or you can play online with other people, but I couldn't find any partner via internet, looks like nobody plays this game anymore, lel), each one is good with a different type of weapons: mister McCall is good with pistols and heavy machineguns, the lady is good with sniper rifles and Eddie Guerra is decent with SMGs at medium range. There is almost no recoil from guns and it was kinda hard for me to shoot enemies at times for some reason. I just don't feel the gun and the crosshair in this game (and I didn't have this problem with other CoJ games by the way). Oh and you won't ride horses in Cartel, but there will be some car chasing missions and they are actually pretty fun.There are some bugs in the game, like clipping issues and stucking in the walls, but nothing serious so far.VERDICT: CoJ The Cartel is indeed the worst game in CoJ series, but it still has good things in it. And most importantly it feels like CoJ game and has a western feeling. The chars are pretty boring though (and some of them are just replicas from other games, like ben mccall and Juan mendosa), the story is not captivating and the gameplay is iffy at times. But I would still recommend this game to those who like Call of Juarez series. I think it is worth a try, at least, besides it is not very long and you can complete it within 7-8 hours. My personal rating for this game will be 6/10.			",84,0,0,3,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed this game, I had to disable motion blur and increase the Fov, but after that, it was an enjoyable experience. The physics ain't that good, but it still didn't ruin the game in general, I enjoy more story based games and this having three characters with 3 different stories to tell really did it for me. 7/10 Gameplay, 6/10 Story, 8/10 Enjoyment.

												Without a doubt this is the worst game of the year. I had high expectations, nothing of which was met. Call of Jaurez was an enjoyable game, with the sequel being a fair step up in quality. But as is often the case, the longer the series runs for and the more greedy companies become, the products that roll out generally become inferior, and production values just plummet. Profit folks, that's all that matters nowadays...Considering the poor mechanics, the downgrade in graphics, and the incredibly horrible script (I can't emphasise this enough!), The Cartel is not even worth a $5 sale. Stay well enough away! Although, if perhaps you've the money to spare and you ever run across a retail copy of the game on sale, buy it, and do us all a favour... burn it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the worst Shooters I have ever played. The plot is moronic, the graphics are sub-par for its era, and the gameplay totally lacking in any depth. The gunplay is unsastisfying and awkward, with many of the iron-sights on the weapons bordering on useless.The plot of the game is moronic, racist and disrespectful to the ongoing human tragedy that is the Mexican Drug War. In particular I felt uncomfortable mercilessly killing hundreds of 'gang members' when I was supposed to be playing a police officer. No policing or investigating is done in this game at all. Its plot and mechanics are totally at odds.If you have any respect for yourself or your money do not play this game. Take your money elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't quite get all the hate and bad reputation this poor game has earned.Sure, it isn't a Call of Juarez like the two before, or.. a Call of Juarez at all, as the only things in common are a guy called McCall, a trip to Juarez in a couple of stages, and the bullet-time which isn't as good as in the previous titles, and that's it.It wasn't ported perfectly on PC, that's true. You almost can't set up the graphics at all, there's a motion blur and a depth blur that can be annoying at first, but you'll get used to them pretty soon. And it freezed a couple of times, but this happens with every Ubi game, so no big deal.But for the rest? It's a simple action fps like tons of others, with badass characters ""maxpayneing"" their way against an army of bad dudes, a lot of gunfightings, explosions, car chasings, a story that's maybe a bit confusing but overall good, great voice acting, the same easy controls as every fps... It may not be the most original fps of all times, it's pretty easy and very linear and doesn't allow you to explore anything, but.. who cares? It's fast paced, funny and entertaining for all its length, and never bored me.Give it a chance if you can, I heard awful things about it and had no expectations at all, but I was actually pleasantly surprised.

												When I played this game I genuinely enjoyed it. The missions were quite repetitive sometimes, and I do feel that if the developers had spent maybe a few more months to maybe a year irioning the game out it could have been a huge seller.  unrelated; I noticed that when I was playing it I believe the game shares the same engine with the Dead Island franchise, they have the same developers, how true this is, I'm not sure this is purely off of observation. Back to the main point; I do understand the people who dislike and do not recommend the game, it is pretty buggy, and a bit cheap feeling. I meant to replay the storyline as one of the other characters, but I just haven't felt like it. The game does lack replay value. After all of that, you either love this game or you hate it, I love the game. I completely recommend the game, heck it's not bad for $10 bucks. I spent  $50 on a game I disliked so much I've only played it for two hours (GRID 2). If you do buy the game I recommend McCall, you get more of a western feel, pale horse and all.

												This game has severe console-itis. I'm sorry to say it, because I loved the last two games, but immediately getting into the game I had problems. First step, rebind your keys. Well, guess what, no rebinding any extra mouse buttons you have, because it will ignore they exist. Actually starting the game, was cool, the begining has you gunning cars right away. And it is rather pretty. Then, they get into a crapload of cutscenes, and the voices desync from the animation rapidly and often. This is jarring and broken. Singleplayer feels off. Because you're stuck with L4D style AI. It seems to have been designed solely with co-op in mind, down to leveling, with guns locked until you reach appropriate level. Therefore, in any car sequences in SP you are stuck as the driver. Which is rather boring. And the first real level is, guess what. Then, when you get there, you're still following a jarring waypoint dot system, hovering there, breaking the immersion. I'm not even 10 mins in.			",305,44,2,42,17,1,17

												After playing - and liking - Gunslinger, I wanted to get into more of the Call of Juarez series that I missed. The Cartel was the natural next entry to try because other than Gunslinger (2013) it was the most recent (2011).It's awful.I can only imagine that ads for this game claimed it was ""high-octane"" or contained ""explosive firefights"" and while there is the occasional fun moment, for the most part it is a boring, bland affair.Despite some cool concepts and set pieces, the graphics are subpar, even given when it came out. The animations are choppy, textures low-res and flat. The skyboxes are particularly grainy, like they were JPG compressed.The sound is even worse, with horribly repetitive dialogue delivered by some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game.The menus are especially painful because of a terrible font choice and the fact that the mouse speed there is not affected by the sensitivity setting. It crawls across the screen and turns anything you want to do in a menu into a belabored chore.And the story is a jumbled mess of cliches. Where a run-of-the-mill FPS normally shines when it falls flat in other areas is the gameplay. As you might expect, that's not the case here. The enemies are predictable and easy to outmaneuver even on the highest difficulty. The weapons and controls are very standard. And there are driving sections that are more frustrating and annoying than they have any right to be.Unlike all the other games in the series this one takes place in modern times instead of the Wild West. The only thing it has in common with a Call of Juarez game is the name and a concentration mode. It's like they were trying to boost sales on a project they knew would fail by randomly attaching it to this pre-existing franchise.So if you want to play a Call of Juarez game, you're better off with Gunslinger. If you want a better FPS from 2011, then go play Homefront.			",204,75,1,29,4,2,23

												This game got it's own ""crapgames"" category in my steam library.Actual quick review:This game is a joke in terms of gameplay, plot etc. I played it for couple hours on ps, because I got it from a friend as a present. I was never a fan of console shooters, so I decided that it's just me being bad with the gamepad. I traded it for pc version, and after playing it for 1 hour or so I turned it off and uninstalled. ""The Cartel"" is the worst of COJ series, and I just couldn't enjoy it. I hope that devs took a lesson from it at how to not make games. Gunslinger is a nice refreshment from it though, so they might have learned since the Cartel was released.			",96,11,0,13,10,0,17

												Call of Juarez: The Cartel: Graphics look Great, Sounds are Great and Music was Good. The story look's very cool, I heard their are Four Ending but I will say I just didn't like or cared for this game it lossed it's feel of the Wild West for me but It may be different for you and you may like it. I'm not much for that many end's one or two, maybe three but no more then that. It would have to be an Awesome game for that many ending's. The Gun's and Outfit's look cool tho, and No I don't recommend this game. Now down to business Call of Juarez: The Cartel is a 5 out of 10			",154,8,0,19,3,0,10

The cutscenes are horrible, the animation itself really bugging me. The voice acting would be okay, if it didnt sound like it was recorded over a phone.All in all, i came here expecting something modern-Read-Dead-Redemption level of game, but instead i got this....

												To make a long story short, I thought for a long time that it was a cool game from watching the trailers and screenshots and everything. I bought this game luckily discounted to about 1 euro. - I played for the time that it says above here, all in one take, and I was not very happy about it: What I found out in the short period of time:The NPCs is pinpoint accurate. Grenades should probably not have been added to the game since they are nearly useless, throwing a snowball would deal more dmg than those. Graphics is very bad, and the premade configurations makes it hard to control your movements. Many bugs. The story starts with some very monotonous objectives, where you might be wondering if the whole game is like that. Finally when the storyline takes a turn it's just a lot of awkward objectives instead. My personally feelings for this game is that I would NOT recommend it and I would only rate it 2 of 10 ",118,6,4,7,7,1,6

												Glitchy, poorly paced, and with attrociously frustrating driving mechanics, this game really is the low point of the Call of Juarez series.I generally try not to hate on games too hard, but in this case, they completely threw the concept of interesting, identifiable, and compelling characters right out the window. One of the player characters, Guerra, seems like he's got a bit of a story behind him (DEA agent that's a compulsive gambler and selling drugs on the side to try to pay off his debt), but it's never really fleshed out. The female characters name eludes me because she was so one dimensional it wasn't even worth remembering who she was.The game starts out with you ""meeting"" all of these characters in a high speed car chase in which you have no earthly idea what you're doing or why you're shooting at these various cars. Get used to that feeling, because this game rarely stops to explain what the hell is going on. After that you're catapulted into a world of tracking down the leader of a drug cartel after a DEA building is bombed (the connection between the two is nebulous at best), and protecting a girl who is thought to have witnessed the bombing... and also one of the playable characters survived and witnessed the bombing but is somehow expendable enough to simply throw into a massive, violent war against drugs rather than being temporarily relieved of duty and examined by psychiatrists to handle the mental trauma. Also, he's suspected of being the bomber, so... send him out on police work? Sure.What follows is a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt at making an action game that allows you to sling enough lead to supply a Chinese paint factory for a month while also tossing all of the rules of common sense straight out the window in favor of cheap ""thrills"". Oh, and the driving sequences... God save us all from the driving sequences... The driving mechanic is so poorly designed and implimented that it's far more frustrating than cool, and unfortunately you're almost ALWAYS the driver. And as for the guns, they all feel approximately the same, apart from different skins and rates of fire.The storyline is approximately 6.5 hours in length, but manages to feel like it's dragging on for an eternity (see GTA V for the opposite effect, where it lasts 40+ hours and still feels like it's not enough), having overstayed its welcome within the first 45 minutes.With all of these terrible features, there were a few redeeming qualities. Personally, I felt like the bullet time mechanic was well done and well integrated, the music was quite well directed to fit the situation, and I do like seeing games branching out and police games starting to trickle onto the market. I also feel like some of the voice acting was done competently, and the graphics were, for the time, moderately good.Unfortunately, in my opinion, the few things it did right weren't enough to save this honker, and so I give it a thumbs down. Buy it only if it goes on sale for $2 and you need something to waste a few hours with.			",133,40,1,24,24,1,42

I thought it was going to be good because the other ones were good. They just milked this one too the max and that is the reason why it sucked. Now if you are going to get in too the Call of Juarez series I recommend buying all of them except this one. I suggest that because unless you want a disappointment instead of action packed game then stay away from this. My favorite has to be Call of Juarez blood born and I could not stop playing the game it was amazing. My next game buy on my list is call of juarez gunslinger, which looks really good so I while give that a go.			",60,6,2,3,7,1,1

												You know those games that frustrate you without end but you love them anyways? Weeeelllll, this is not one of them. This game is filled with 2 partners that talk you down endlessly even if you miss just one shot (admittedly they praise you as well when you do a headshot but that doesn't weigh up to the endless nagging), the fact your partners talk you down all the time but them being useless whilst talking you down and often walking in your way makes the game dreary to play, then there's the gloom of death which hangs over the levels like an endless fog making it almost impossible to spot enemies at times, not to forget the terrible cutscenes which are incredibly cliche/unimaginative most of the time. I guess I could go on about little things like shooting being a bit dodgy sometimes but the above should be enough to put you off.Does this game have any redeeming features you might wonder and surprisingly yes I can actually think of two things, ocassionally shooting can feel nice specifically when you make a vehicle explode killing some enemies around it. The only other positive, and this is really the best thing you can do in the game, was watching a stripper do her thing for a minute just to get the achievement ... oh wait I just needed to watch her for 30 seconds. 4/10 and that's me being generous.

												Today's Review: Call of Juarez: The CartelFirst of all, this game it's another adition to the family of games that's Politicaly Incorrect and VERY VERY racist. The game's based on the Mexican drugs cartel and some attacks on the united states (terrorist attacks)Seeing some videos and fast footage of the game might lead you to think this game it's fun, when actually the game feels really unpolished, very sluggish, enemies can easily kill you even on easy, there's no cover button or cover system, you have to hide in everything you can and pray you're not in visual range of the 100% accuracy that the enemies have, thought it's kind of fun, it's NOTHING compared to another game of the same franchise, Call of Juarez Gunslinger.Metascore: 52/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												lets see. they dropped the western age to explore a different more modern story. still involving mcall, and several others who look like decendants of the original cast. theres a focus time that is similar to bullet time. the graphics are alright. the facial animations are a bit low grade for its age. dual wielding doesnt seem as fun as in the previous games. less auto aim I guess. playing this single player limits you in the coop sections like the car chases. it teases you in the first level with riding shotgun with a shotgun, but in all the chase scenes you get to be the driver. you cant take shortcuts off road. cover based health regen is prevalant. 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Хоть и много нареканий в плане халтурности игры, но тем не менее что-то в ней есть, что заставило играть достаточно долго. Наверное потому что большинство экшенов просто кишит ""спецназовщиной"", либо нелепым миксом с фантастикой, что я в общем-то на дух не переношу.			",177,29,5,9,28,2,21

												Definitely not as bad as the majority of other reviewers make it out to be. This is just like Resident Evil 5; when you take it out of the series, you have a decent game. When you compare it to the other games in the series, yeah, it's a bad game. On its own, not so.However, is this game good? Is this game going to make you tremble with ecstacy? Is this game will the ""the one""? Hell no.The only thing keeping this game together is its incredible story. You can take this game's plot and shoot a blockbuster Hollywood movie with it. It's extremely realistic, dark, and a very good reflection of the hellhole we call politics. It becomes so complex sometimes that you need to pause the game and get all the pieces together in your mind's eye.Soundtrack is well done. It suits the theme of the game and the environments you play in very well. It's not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, but it's definitely enhancing.Voice-over is brilliant. You can feel they paid attention to quality in that department.AI? Well, it's complicated. Sometimes they just get stuck and stare at you like some idiots. Some other time, you see them flanking you, moving from cover to cover and getting you at your most vulnerable moment. Your partners though, they are completely useless. Don't expeck anything big and you won't have a problem with them. Gameplay mechanics? Bad. It's just plain bad. Covers don't always work, the game glitches and bugs in some missions, forcing  you to load a checkpoint, grenades are useless, weapons don't differ from each other much, playing offline really detracts from the whole gaming experience, etc. One good thing is the ""Secret Agenda"" system. During most missions, someone important calls you a gives you a secret mission that you must complete without being seen by your partners. It's a breeze when playing offline, but I reckon it adds a lot of excitement on online playing sessions. A very refreshing idea. More games should try something like this.Worst thing? Sound effects. You fire a shotgun and it sounds like a tiny balloon just popped. You fire a friggin M60 and it sounds like an old man's fart. You shoot you Desert Eagle and it sounds like a kid is clapping his little hands together. It's downright terrible.Overall, would I recommend this game? If it's below 5 bucks, yeah. It just isn't worth 10 dollars.			",677,189,33,92,87,5,142

												Call of Juarez: The Cartel tries to be a hip, relevant and risk shooter that explores the gray area cops live in. The problem is it's a genric cover based shooter, with edgy collectibles of a cop stealing evidence, and bad story. The game does seem to be setup for coop which might add some fun, but over all it's a trudge not a fun adventure like other entires in the Call of Juarez series.			",439,63,4,46,17,2,55

												A lot of people railed about this game but I thought it was pretty good. No its not as good as the other call of juarez games but judging it as a fps it was fine. The story was meh but the characters were pretty cool and the game had a lot of gameplay. The fighting was pretty fun and they did throw in some extras and if you desired to play the game three times. For me, I only played it once with one character and I'm fine with that. No, the game is not amazing but its not bad either. FPS games are usually generic enough that you really don't need all that much to make them fun. Still, I wouldn't pay more then 5 bucks for it.

												This would be kind of a 50/50 to recommend.  As far as being a call of juarez game it doesn't really fit and it comes off as a bit cheesier then the other games.  If you're looking for another game in this particular series you might be disappointed.  As a standalone game it's pretty entertaining.  The graphics are rather impressive as well as the environments.  One thing that does get annoying is your partners constant badgering.  Every 10 seconds they yell "" if we weren't watching your back you'd be mother♥♥♥♥ing dead"" or "" do you ever practice with that thing."" And if they arnt insulting you then there are attacking you for hogging all the action like a couple of bipolar ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Despite that, it has a good variety of different locations to keep it interesting throughout.  You even get to go back to a location from the first game which is kind of cool.  This game was worth playing at least once at a discount but could've been a whole lot better if they didn't decide to cheese it up.			",126,8,0,6,5,0,1

It plays like a $10 indie shooter at best. I can't think of a positive thing to say. It's repetitive, poorly designed, has the most  unlikable protagonist of any video game I've played, the weapons sound like toys, the dialog is repetitive and has so many swear words it's just silly (and you can tell by my user name, I'm a profane mother ♥♥♥♥er).

There are some driving missions but they are boring and no fun.Even the smallest details in this game are poorly made, the game takes place in Los Angeles but all the police cars are marked Texas state Trooper!

												This is tied for the worst game I have ever played with splinter cell conviction, because both games destroyed the series they were a part of. You mostly just shoot at minorities and do horribly illegal things as a cop trying to get things done the fast way and the only reason there is so much play time is that I was so disgusted I got up and left my computer and it stayed on for awhile. As a shooter it is at best okay. Play bound in blood instead.			",228,55,3,20,35,4,33

												Call of Juarez: The Cartel (just ""Cartel"" from now on) is one of those shooters that was a product of the times, or even slightly behind the times, and tried to meld a Western motif onto ""modern day"" (early 2000's, after 9/11) US Mexican border. This is a ""modern"" shooter where instead of hunting for health packs, just hide for a little while to regenerate your health (theres' not even a health meter). However, there is no cover system. It's side-strafing all the way. The back story is the DEA office in LA got bombed, and the DOJ arranged for a DEA guy, an FBI girl, and a LAPD veteran to for an interagency task force to find out who did it, then one of the dead agent's daughter had a message from his dead father... So she's a witness... The trio each had their own agenda they try to accomplish without revealing to their two partners. As the investigation takes them from barrios of LA to border to desert to Mexican estates, they get to shoot their way through a TON of bad guys of various types, from simple gangbangers all the way up to mercenaries. And sometimes, they even have to deal with heavy enemy support... like gunships. To do that, you get your standard arsenal, from pistols and revolvers to SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, and even light machine guns. However, you can only keep two pistols and one long gun. To make things simple, all pistols use the same ammo, and all rifles use the same ammo, even though in real life they use different calibers. And yes, you can dual-wield the single-hand weapons like pistols and light SMGs. It's fun to do so, as you'll have two triggers (mouse left and mouse tright) for separate guns. The ""Concentration mode"" (i.e. Matrix slo-mo) is back, where basically time slows down so you can kill bad guys by pumping them full of lead before they can react. There are also various ""breach"" scenarios where your team line up on the door and at the signal, bust in, and in slow-mo, shoot everybody that has a gun. (Yes, there are often civilians, and you get an award if you don't cause collateral damage by end of campaign). One of the factors that sets Cartel apart are the driving sequences... where you get to drive the car, dodging traffic, and if you're not driving, you can hang out the window and shoot at bad guys. If necesary, that is. There is a mission where you need to tail another car, not too close, not too far. (And don't run over civilians)  But often, you need to chase enemy vehicle while dodging things left and right, and sometimes, you just need to get away. Another thing that sets Cartel apart is the fact that this is a 3 player co-op shooter... In ""single player"" you play with two AI bots. if you have multiplayer set two buddies join you to shoot your way through bad guys. There's also competitive mode online. It's basically the same game instead of completely separate SP vs. MP map levels. As mentioned before, each member of the team has their own personal agenda, and often will get calls or reminders about where their ultimate loyalty lies, and have ""secret agenda"" on missions, as well as try to sneak some evidence, money, or such ""found"" on various parts of the mission. And they have to do so without being seen by their partners, making it tense. This is how the character gain ""XP"" for levels to unlock additional weapons,  in fact. So you have to explore a little. The story is actually better than the average shooter. There's no ""foozle"", just a lot of guys with guns, and each guy has their own motivation to ""do the right thing"", which may not be THE right thing. The hardware requirements are strange. I can play COJ: Gunslinger with no problem, but somehow Cartel felt slower. At least the bots know how to conduct themselves. All in all, COJ: The Cartel is a hard break from the ""Western"" roots of COJ. There are some tie-ins but ultimately it felt really weak. The shooters are not bad, and 15 levels ain't bad for co-op, but it's not exactly a shining sample of how shooters *should* be done. I applaud them of trying to break new ground, but the execution seems to lack that ""must keep playing"" feeling. It's recommended, but only if it's at bargain bin level prices.

												This game got a lot of hate, I don't know why. It's not that bad. Sure, it's not a western like it should've been, but it certainly it certainly isn't a bad game.Give it a go if it's cheap. It's what you can expect from any Call of Juarez game, really.			",454,20,6,11,8,3,38

												Worth a try if you are a fps-junkie. Otherwise i would stay clear of this one. At its finest moments the game is just okey but most of the time the game is just plain boring and it stinks of being unpolished and uninspired. This is not simply a matter of it not fitting into the series. The game wouldn't be better if you would remove the ""Call of Juarez"" part of the title.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

												Though it's not a terrible game, it destroys the reputation of the Call of Juarez franchise.			",589,94,9,52,39,1,54
