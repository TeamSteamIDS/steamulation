A very nice sci-fi sandbox experience, now optimized and without GFWL.Red Faction Guerrilla's physical destruction engine is truly a fascinating thing. It's like a GTA-lite where you can drive THROUGH buildings. Or walk through them in a huge industrial mech. Or plant lots of explosive charges, detonate them and watch the whole thing collapse. Or just bring it down manually with a hammer :)With the recent updates (still open beta, but working flawlessly) the game was massively optimized, running at full 60fps without much trouble. It also ditched GFWL, and the developers even included a savegame migration tool to transfer your old GFWL save to Steam Cloud.Finally, we get the definite version of this game- one that shows how it was meant to look, feel and be played.

												I know it does not make much sense to review a title that's already older than your grandma but i HAD to say this:YOU CAN FINISH THE WHOLE GAME BY DESTROYING EVERYTHING WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER!How can this not be an awesome game?!I can wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone working in the retail or having to deal with customers one way or the other. Had another dumb one? GO SMASH A HOUSE TO PIECES! Aaaahhh...how relaxing.Had a clueless customer who thinks he knows everything? GO ERADICATE A COMPLETE TOWN INTO OBLIVION! Aaahhhh...that's the stuff!You've been cheated on? YEAH GREAT, LET'S EXTINGUISH ALL LIFE ON THIS PLANET INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LIFELESS BUILDINGS! Ahhhhh...much better now.Oh and I think the game also has some kind of Story or even Missions, I don't know. But it's probably good :-)Have to install this at work too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Steamworks is here, the great tyrant GFWL is dead and gone! A round of applause is in order for Nordic Games for reviving this wonderful game. Now, on with the review.	 Red Faction: Guerrilla is an insanely fun game, let's get that out of the way right now. The open world nature combined with the destructable nature of almost every structure in the game makes for one of the most enjoyable, destructive romps you'll ever have in a game. While you play through the story mode you'll have a wealth of options for how to deal with objectives, many of which involve the destruction of key buildings. Perhaps you'd like to get up close and personal with your hammer, maybe you'd rather hop in a truck and send it flying through the side of a building or you might just hail it with rockets from afar, all of which are perfectly viable options.Even if you don't wish to go through the campaign it's likely you'll find enjoyment in one of the two other gametypes:Wrecking Crew - A Solo or Local co-op gamemode with leaderboard integration where you seek to do as much damage to the buildings in a give map with different caveats depending on the mode which are: Total Chaos - Doing as much damge as possible in one minute with unlimited ammo. Behemoth - Using one of three Walker (mech) types to do as much damage as possible in a limited time. Challange - Completing level-specific challanges. Escalation - You have a limited amount of time and ammo, each round both increase. Barrel Dash - Destroying as many explosive barrels as you can within the time limit. Rampage - Deal as much damage as possible with a three minute timelimit, each shot or swing of your weapon takes a set amount of time away.Internet Game - Go head-to-head with other players in a variet of gamemodes, such as: Anarchy / Team Anarchy - Your basic Deathmatch mode. Bagman / Team Bagman - Hold the bag and gain points. Capture the flag - Exactly what it says on the tin. Siege - Defend / Attack gamemode where the key is to destroy specific structures. Damage Control - Fight to capture the three points. Demolition - Protect the Destroyer, the only person who can damage buildings as they go around and destroy as much as they can.TL:DR - The Pros New Direct X11 support, improved stability, better experience over all thanks to Nordic. New steamwork intergration, including Matchmaking and achievements. Strong openworld campaign with plenty to keep you busy. A host of other activities beyond the campaign that provide many hours of fun. You can load up a truck with remote mines, send it flying into the side of a building and then detonate it. Awesome.The Cons Known technical issues, check the forums and such to see if it'll have any issues with your setup. Many of these are being fixed by Nordic currently, it would seem. Still, it's good to make sure. While the campaign is fun and story is perfectly acceptable, anyone looking for a great narrative might find it lacking. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   It's very sad and disappointing how this game wasn't really given a chance due to mediocre reviews from popular media sites.  OK, this game has flaws;  The AI isn't bad but also nothing special, the behavior coding is pretty poorly done with followers walking in front of you while you are aiming and firing as well as running in front of your vehicles while you try to make getaways, and the game can get slightly repetitive.  HOWEVER, as Craig put it, Red Faction Guerilla is truly masterful at destruction.  The first true ""Next Generation"" feeling of awe I felt was from this game when I destroyed my first structure.  After I finished with it, I watched as it groaned while trying to support itself under its own weight then eventually crumbled beautifully into a glorious pile of scrap.  I don't think I have ever felt as truly satisfied than when I ""stuck it to the man"" in teh form of a giant mining truck plowing through military controlled compounds, watching architecture collapse all arounds me as I literally drove into then out of large structures.  If you have the capacity to be moderately creative, and teh rig to handle that ""creativity"" (I would recommend 512+ VRAM, though you can run this game at 256 on lowest, at least I had to for a while) then, as someone who has actually logged a respectable amount of playtime, I cannot describe this game in any other way than a ""work of art.""  I would say it's easily worth 20$, a steal if you get it under, like I did...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those worried about the GFWL issue, I just have one piece of advice. Just make an offline account using the GFWL menu that pops up at the beginning of the loading screen. Yes, multiplayer is not possible this way, but you can still enjoy the single player campaign. If you make an offline account once, this offline account is usable across all GFWL games, and all saves will then be local. Good luck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction Guerrilla is Blow Stuff Up: The Game.You can destroy everything. And I mean everything. There are literally like two buildings in the entire map that you can't blow up, and it's only because they're integral to the plot or a mission element. Everything else is at your mercy. You can decide, at absolutely any time in the game, to punch a hole in the nearest wall with a supercharged sledgehammer. And I think that's really the essence of RF:G. You have absolute and complete freedom with the environment you're put in. It's a true sandbox; there is nothing you can't put a few explosives on and demolish when the mood takes you. It's never the case such as in other games, where there's occasional missions to sabotage things and the rest of the time it's like ""LOLNOPE, THIS WOODEN SHACK IS INDESTRUCTABLE, RAM AS MANY CARS INTO IT AS YOU WANT LOLOLOLOLOLOLO"" It's never that. The game never cuts you off with the mission focus, either. The entirety of Red Faction Guerrilla is built around the mechanic of destructable environments. What do you do in missions? You sabotage enemy bases, or demolish buildings to cover the Faction's tracks, or ram a car into this, or fire a thermobaric rocket at this big hydrogen tank thing. How do you unlock new missions? You smash the f*ck out of enemy bases to lower enemy control over the sector, and raise morale. And with the variety of it all, and the many methods of nuking an EDF outpost, and being able to dismantle every single piece of a checkpoint until nothing is left; it's just intoxicating.Not to mention: THERE ARE CHEATS. You can be an invincible super-badass and propel cars with melee attacks into buildings and run super fast and and and---Even in the moments where you're not giving Martian architects the finger, the game remains solid, and combat is enjoyable and challenging. It's never a case of running in like Superman and obliterating an entire army with your bare fists; you have to find yourself some cover and demolish the enemy's; choose the right weapons for the right situations, and be accurate. Ammo conservation is a big part of fighting EDF soldiers, so spraying plasma bullets everywhere isn't going to earn you victory. Story's pretty nice, too, but it's more just to support the gameplay; the main attraction is the explosions and destruction.TL;DR: Breaking things is fun. This game is all about breaking things, so this game is fun, and you should buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction: Guerilla is all about getting revenge for your brother's death by destroying every piece of infrastructure on Mars. Armed with the Thor's hammer Mjolnir, you set out on a journey to smash and blow up everything the Earth Defense Force has built on Mars while destroying your own safehouses in the process for fun.8/10 story sucks but no one cares.

												GTA on Mars? Well, it may be a little too far-fetched, but it still is true. You have this HUGE map with tons of missions and tons of DESTRUCTIBLE buildings. And the game wants you to cause mayhem and destruction. No mission can be completed without wreaking havoc!The story is mediocre at best: you play a guy called Mason whose brother has just died. He takes up his role working for the guerrilla, a rebellious group that aims to rid Mars of the oppressive government called EDF. There are some nice cutscenes telling the story but the 20 main missions are not sufficient to make it a great story.On the other hand: Who cares? The story is just an excuse to destroy everything in your path. As you make progress further areas open up in front of you with the same goal: you must liberate them. Every sector has a morale meter that increases as you complete missions. Higher morale means more assistance from guerrilla members while fighting. Main missions that advance the story can be accessed, too, with the exception of the last one. This particular mission to liberate the sector requires you to decrease enemy morale. Naturally, helping the rebels causes the bad guys lose morale.Do you like collectibles in games? Well, Red Faction has destructibles. You can prove your worth by looking for high value EDF buildings, piles of ore, propaganda signs and practically anything else that belongs to Mars' evil faction. Side missions are also many and varied as one would expect: you can catch couriers, protect allied areas, take vehicles to safe locations or - and this is my favourite - ride shotgun with Jenkins. The guy drives but you are manning the gun: just shoot at everything that belongs to EDF - buildings, vehicles and anything that increases the counter on the upper right-hand side of the screen telling you how much damage you have caused. Once you have reached 1 billion credits another achievement pops up.I like how varied the environment is. You would think the entire game swims in brownish-reddish colours. No! New sectors have a newer, more different look. Oasis has green areas with fewer but bigger buildings telling you this is where the upper class of Mars lives. The Badlands have a more evil look with the presence of the mysterious marauders - you can clearly see this is an homage to Mad Max!A good way to encourage the player to cause destruction is the currency introduced: every collapsed building leaves scrap metal. These shiny, light blue pieces of salvage can then be used to buy newer weapons or upgrade the existing ones. I understand the Steam Edition of the game has a lot of new features. This is certainly a plus - I played this well after it finally ditched the awful GFWL service. It is a good thing that more and more games do the same! To summarise: Red Faction is a game about destruction. There's nothing more satisfying than leaving the office after a long and hard day and using Mason's sledgehammer to off some Martian bad guys or to destroy a tower. And if you truly want to destroy everything dozens of hours of fun is guaranteed!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Red Faction GuerrillaDeveloper:  VolitionPublisher:  Nordic gamesGenre:  3rd Person ActionGeneral ImpressionOne of the best video games that combines an open world and destruction. ""Demolition"" is a better word in its case. You are once again the hero of a revolution against corporate tyranny, only this time you have an immense “playground” to wreak havoc upon. It is by far the best game in the Red Faction series. This is a game that really stood the test of time. Eye candy aplenty if played at 4K resolution!Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics featuring plenty of destructible assets.+ Great storyline within a vast open-world.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- A few glitches.- Difficulty spikes.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Finishe Red Faction: Guerrilla on Casual difficulty, took me around 10-12 hours, and I unlocked 13 out of 50 achievements.A damn good game, while the story doesn't do much to inspire a whole lot of interest, the gameplay and destruction carry the game and make it into something special, it embodies everyones desire to blow things up and cause mayhem, while watching the thing you destroyed crumble infront of you in a surprisingly realistic way. With the recent Steamworks patch, there's no greater time to jump into Red Faction: Guerrilla and have a fun, destructive, albiet slightly bare gameplay experience.+Destruction, destruction, destruction+Gameplay is enhanced by the need to think strategically about how to approach a situation with the games destruction engine+Cool and unique weapons, that enhance the destruction+Did I say the destruction was awesome? Because it is, by far the star of the game-Story is typical sci-fi, rebellion, unneccesary love interest stuff you see in every made for TV SyFy movie-Enemies can be annoying to fight, sometimes you just want to drive around and hit stuff with a hammer without a squad of EDF goons shooting at you.-Kind of flat in the open world department, it has side stuff, but nothing super intersing and the world seems built just to be blow up, with weird empty archtecture and barren areas with little to no civilians.Overall it's a great game that deserves and play just for the fun of the destruction and the many ways you can lay waste to Mars.8 out of 10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Red Faction: Guerrila Review - Rating: 8.7/10General ImpressionRed Faction: Guerrilla is a very nice open-world destruction game. From my point of view, would be a nice Grand Theft Auto: Mars Edition. That’s because it is an extremely open-world game, being a huge advantage. I had a lot of fun with this game. Off to the features: The graphics are well-designed, everything has a smooth looking, there were a lot of items which needed to be polished, and the developers proved to do it pretty nicely. The textures are nice and well-made. The atmosphere varies between 7 different environments, where the buildings will change, the enemies will be tougher and more, the sky’s and the overall map will look quite different (the color, sometimes it’s more windy, etc.) It’s a really nice atmosphere, indeed some places are not lively, but good morning, this is Mars, what did you expect? It’s realistic. The audio is nice, everything sounds well, the voice acting, the cars’ sounds, the tanks’ sounds, the guns’ sounds, etc. They were made to sound pretty realistic as well. The music is a nice feature as well, the music changes from the point where you are not in a combat status, where an ambient music will play, and when you will combat, a dynamic music will play. Hence there aren’t many types of music, they are all well-made, and I appreciate that. The gameplay is a pretty strong point. This game is open-world. You have many side quests, such as reaching a location in a matter of time, or destroying a location in a matter of time, saving arrested citizens, and also unexpected side missions, where you will have to go to a base and defend from the EDF. The main quests will generally come consecutive, meanwhile sometimes you will need to go to a certain location to activate the mission, or you need to get the maximum respect from the citizens of the respective area in order to unlock the last mission of the area, as example. Salvage is also a very important feature, by collecting salvage you can upgrade guns or buy new ones. The story is well-thought, and you will constantly experience it throughout the game. The user-interface is well-designed, and also it has additional designing and synthetized information. The controls are very well-chosen, all of them are easy-to-learn and good. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. On bad computers, you will experience easy lagging, hence I actually didn’t. The mechanics… we need to talk more about this one here. Destruction. That’s what would resume the mechanics. There are so many ways to kill your infantry enemies, your vehicle enemies, your tank enemies, any building, and even other elements. Buildings, especially… have a very complex way of destruction. They destruct in a very realistic way. All the damage given to them is as it should be, nor too low, nor too high. The characters move well, the cars are fast and feel very good when driving them, and even other positive elements. Overall, Red Faction: Guerrilla is a great open-world destruction simulator, with nice graphics, awesome gameplay, interesting story and sophisticated mechanics.Positive PointsNice and well-designed graphics and texturesLarge and different atmospheresPretty nice audio and musicAwesome, fun and challenging gameplayMany main and side quests availablePurchasable guns by salvage itemsAn interesting storyWell-designed user-interface with additional designsWell-chosen controlsPretty stable enginesSophisticated mechanicsSteam achievements and trading cards available Neutral PointsSome racing missions would be a nice featureBeing able to talk to people would also be a nice featureNegative PointsThe multiplayer is not alive anymore, a big disadvantageSome missions are pretty uninteresting, such reaching a point with your car in a certain amount of time ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game to bits. I'm not kidding.1. It runs on a potato. The minimun RAM needed is 1GB.2. Almost everything is destructible, and in spectacular ways, too. 3. The main missions gave me a challenge, but stayed fun none the less.4. It has addicting gameplay, and it deserves better reviews than it received.5.

 A short history of RF:G No I am not going to spell out its full name because I cannot properly spell Guerrilla. Its double R and double L I know but no. No full name. Anyways back to the history, RF:G was originally released with Games With Windows Live integrated. That means no cheats, lots of issues regarding login and etc etc and we have tons of weird graphical problem that made this game not very well known. Thankfully the Steam port has been optimized and there is no more GFWL. Thank god. My pc went from 20fps to 60 stable fps. Game Info Name: Red Faction : GuerrillaDeveloper: A lot of people, this game has been brought out by Nordic Games after the fall of THQ. RIP.Genre: Smasing, Action, Open World, Guerrilla WarfarePersonal Thoughts: Good game although there are parts that they did right and parts that they did wrong. What is Red Faction: Guerrilla? A game about a guy who lost his brother and so join a rebel insurgency fighting back against the military. ON MARS! That means super wonky vehicle, unrealistic weapons and building that crumbles at the drop of a hat. Everything you see saved for some things are completely destructible using the force of vehicle, hammer and explosive! But dear god the story is wonky even though it make sense like the Dev tried stretching a lump dough too thinly trying to cover the whole baking table with it. But well at least the game is fun enough to cover that slight defect.  Sound Main character grunts a lot, gun doesn't pack any power in them although we can excuse it by saying in the future recoil proofing technology has improved. The most powerful anti infantry still sounds like the usual sci fi pew pew pew. Hardly any music in this game but one good thing is at least vehicle grunt properly instead of purring like a cat. Graphic Everything look so brown especially the first and third area. Especially the first area because when you exit the town you will see that there is literally a change in the overall saturation of the game. Also I have to state that I used the DX9 backend instead of the DX11 because it still runs badly on my computer merely just to add more reflection and glaring elements.  Gameplay Fun game, you have a hammer from early on that can be used to smash buildings to pieces which is useful since every single building in the game is smashable and since it follows the laws of physics it is completely pointless to destroy the top part of the building since destroying the bottom part will quickly bring it down.Why destroying building you ask? For money to get salvages duh. Salvages used to upgrade the Main Character from a big man with a hammer to a big man with a hammer and 20 kilos of metal strapped to him with a full blow rocket launcher on his back and an exotic martian weapon by his side. The main game of RF:G has you filling a meter and emptying out a meter. The filling one is the morale meter where killing military unit quickly, destroying propaganda and helping out the rebel will fill it. This serves mainly to get more money when doing story mission and for receiving backup which you will seriously need later on. At maximum rate you will get 4 people fighting by your side.The other meter is military control meter where you need to make it zero to unlock story mission and I can't confirm if making zero affects the military hardware they throw at you. Maybe not because I still get tanks and humvee trying to ram me even when the bar is full. You make it go down by destroying military stuff.There are side activities that helps you with lowering those bar as well and they are generally pretty fun mayhem filled things to do that ranges from assaulting base, drive by mission and explosive mission. Generally fun enough. Good thing the story mission is as good as the side mission! Because the story is weak.EDIT: Forgot VehicleVehicle are so tough even your basic buggy can break through concrete wall, lets not even talk about the APC that can smash straight through a building clean. Although they do handle terribly and tend to float all over the place if you hit a bump they're good enough I guess. Also you can change the orientation of your vehicle while in midair so pretty much you can with a bit of practice land perfectly fine on the ground.And that's pretty much for the gameplay, there's stuff to collect, people to rescue and the usual fanfare of open world stuff although some upgrades are evil enough locked behind doing side missions! So go complete them otherwise you won't get some of the gear. SPECIAL SECTION  THE STORY! Pretty much does not suck but is jarring as hell. You see character usually make one appearances then were gone just like that.  Conclusion Yeah it's a fun game where you really are being a Guerrilla Fighter against a military forces. And you do get a lot of toys to play with. Well destroying building never gets old I guess but the story really rubs me the wrong way. Anyways lets wrap this up. RF:G a fun game from a publisher that is legendary in the industries but is no more. Buy this game now that it has steam support.

												Oh my....the sledgehammer.  Quite possibly the greatest weapon shy of the gravity gun from Half Life 2.  I can literally play this game from start to finish with just the sledgehammer.  Ok, almost....Great sandbox game featuring over 100 side missions; however, little incentive to do more than about 45.  You get rewards for doing ""X"" amount of missions, but after so many there are no more rewards.  And it's easy to drop the EDF control in other ways so you dont have to rely on doing these missions to drop EDF control to 0.  Been a fan of the RF series since it's inception, and this game brought it to new heights.  Great physics, great weapons, soon rid of GFWL (YAY!) and decent story.8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant stress reliever. Got problems with Hauser, a rogue agent who thinks he is someone else called ""Quaid"" screwing up your plans? Smash down some buildings with a hammer. Richter suddenly deciding he can think for himself? Smash stuff down with a hammer? Some little mutant freak stiring up trouble? Smash stuff with a hammer. Now that the foul Games for Windows Live has been purged things just get better and better :)Of course, I, Vilos Cohaagen do not approve of smashing anything on Mars with a hammer. Especially not my god damn Turbinium mines, but those Earth Defence Force are nothing but trouble and not at all like my enlightened administration.Of course this game does indulge in fantasy.

												A pretty good sandbox game, with a mediocre The-Moon-Is-A-Harsh-Mistress-esque story. The really interesting thing about this game is that you are essentially a terrorist fighting the powers that be: the EDF. I, at least, would constantly go around with bombs strapped to my vehicle with a specific target in mind. Success wasn't surviving the attack; it was destroying the target. Even on medium difficulty, when the EDF came in force, it is very hard to survive long. I would have liked this game to be a conversation on terrorism and guerrilla warfare for a good, but extreme, cause. The ambivalence of destroying a civilian structure that probably-- but not certainly-- was a base of operations for the enemy would have been wonderful, and would have made this into a great game. Instead it is a ham-fisted, ""the EDF are killing innocent civilians, they are evil tyrants, you must stop them"" kind of a deal.Anyway, this open-world, physics-based third person shooter is a fun diversion and it's worth the twenty dollars they're asking. And, yes, seeing that building stand for a split second after most of its supports have been destroyed, then seeing crumble absolutely is one of the most satisfying experiences in video games.

												8/10Overview: 3rd Person Open World The Good:+ Technically the game holds up extremely well, graphics still look nice and the game runs very smoothly despite all the destruction and chaos happening. + The open world of Mars is split into different sectors. Each sector has its own unique setting and look to it. The developers made good use of color hues to really differentiate the different areas. + The sense of destruction in the game is some of the best I've seen in a game to date with very few games matching it. Just about everything that is seen in the game can be destroyed with your sledgehammer, blown up with explosive or shot with rockets. Seeing large buildings crumbling down with debris flying everywhere is very satisfying. + Variety of weapons that fit your play style + Side missions are varied and provide a nice change of pace from the main game. 2 of the main side missions is destruction and transportation. In destruction you have to destroy a building given limited weapons and time. In transportation you have to drive a vehicle to a destination within a time limit.  + As you destroy enemy buildings and complete side/main missions you raise morale allowing more AI to fight alongside with you and gain more ammo from crates. Although it doesn't make the biggest difference in the world it is a nice system given the context of the story. + The game comes with bonus single player DLC which extends the game + In addition to single player, Wrecking Crew mode allows you to play a different levels with a variety of different options either by yourself or with others to try and get a high score. A fun, optional mode that extends your playtime. + Removed games for windows liveThe Average:I found the main missions to be pretty average. Most main missions have you going to a certain location and blowing everything up. I would have liked to see more variety among them.  Because of the lack of variety in main missions, sometimes the game can feel a bit repetitive. The Bad: - Like past Red Faction games the story and characters are forgettable and one dimensional. The story serves as an excuse to blow things up and nothing more. A lot of wasted potential here which is sad given some of the cool locations.  - I hear multiplayer is fun, too bad the community is gone. Conclusion:This is a good mindless fun game that reminded me of Just Cause 2. You go around blowing things up and watch the destruction unfold as you fight wave of enemies attacking you. I am fairly new to this series only having beaten the other two games a few months ago. This is a very interesting series. Red Faction started out as a linear first person shooter, then it became a level based shooter with bosses and then it became a third person open world game. If you love blowing things up then look no further than this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like Michael Bay movies or just blowing the sh*t out of stuff then this is the game for you. I highly reccommend this to anyone as its by far a great third person shooter. The only downside is that the story missions cannot be replayed but apart from that this game is amazing. This was even mentioned in Nerdcubeds top 100 games all time at 26th place so any procrastinators reading this will know what Im talking about.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily one of the funnest games I have ever played and in my top 3 games of 2009, Red Faction Guerrilla is a masterpiece of destructive fun. Volition just knows how to make a great 3rd person, open world game that is simply enjoyable to play (Saints Row being their other fantastic series). Very few, no seriously, very few games can match the destruction and physics that RF:G has available to the player. You'll need a decent PC even by today's standards to keep the framerate up during some epic facility colapses. Sadly, Games for Windows Live has infested this game and until it is patched out, you cannot save your game. It is a shame that such a great game must be sheltered due to such a failure of a 'feature', but once GFWL is cleansed off this planet, you owe it to yourself and the pleasure centers of your brain to play this game.5/5*I guess I should have noted this in the initial review, but I played this game originally back in 2009 after purchasing the disk version. I bought it on Steam during a Steam sale. That is why I have such a short time played on Steam.*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Multiplayer is my favorite part of this game. Multiplayer is like an arena shooter, with the same awesome destruction from singleplayer, same weapons, and added ""backpacks"" pickups that give you incredible abilities like running through walls with the force of a Rhino. Multiplayer is truly a unique experience, unfortunately, there are not enough players to reliably find a match when you often like.However, there is a bot you can add as a friend on Steam that will message you when there are lobbies available. This bot is the alternative to waiting in matchmaking for ridiculous periods of time without finding any players.You can add the bot here: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259171976Join us on discord: https://discord.gg/9pWGeXE DISCLAIMER: I am bot creator			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The old game was already a lot of fun with the whole destructible enviroment thing. There's just something about smashing the whole place up with a sledgehammer. Or crashing it down with 'splozions.Now that the game's patched up to a Steam Edition, it's great.Better graphics settings, and the keyboard&mouse controls have improved a LOT compared to the old version. And obviously they've gotten rid of GFWL.I do get the impression they did make the game easier... Normal mode seems a bit more casual this time around.

												I've already bought 8 copies of the game for my friends. It is pure fun for LAN parties with its crazy multiplayer modes and THE SLEDGEHAMMER of course!Singleplayer campaign is solid and rich. I didn't expect it at the first time played. AI adapts to destroyed walls, they can even crush a building occasionally to get you out. Lots of explosives and powerful vehicles create plenty of ""omg wtf lol!"" moments all the times. There is even a stealth system! And cover-sticking if you wish! And did i mention explosives? Remote charges, landmines, barrels, black-hole generators, rockets, HUGE ROCKETS... They all fit the game and it's fun to combine stuff.Community support is nice to tears. You can download a load of mods and user-friendly mod manager (google for FactionFiles). In the winter of 2016 i thought that people squeezed every bit of modability and hackability from the game, but new modders and their work apperaed since then!Multiplayer is beautifully crazy, but it is not easy to find people playing since the community is not that big. Someone made a steam bot ""buddy"" which can alert you when someone creates a game. Isn't it awesome?I only wish that something will make developers release an SDK / map editor. However, even without that, there are A LOT of maps for multiplayer already in-game, a bunch of maps for demolition mode and a big world to explore in campaign. All of these destructible.

												This game is one of the best out of what i played... So i definitely reccommend it!Main review part:Story: Story of this game is perfect (being guerrilla and trying to destroy bad guys with minimum equipment and maximum effort)(very ethical)(10/10)Graphics: Graphics are just OP for the game that came out in 2009... and DX11 makes it even better. Also ability to destruct everything rocks. (10/10)Gameplay: It's very fun in both SP and MP and takes some effort to be done perfectly..(Destruction makes it better for acting variety(like either explode stuff near enemy/drop building on him etc.))(10/10)Setting: Mars with differently terraformed sectors which adds variety to place where there can't be much of it (10/10)Controls: No problems detected and also those are very easy to get used it (10/10)Replayability: Not so high because of lack of endgame content and stuff...(9/10)Overall Rating: One of the best games out there, definitely worth it.(but MP is almost dead, which is sad :/)Rank: S+ (9,8/10)P.S. my playtime is currently low because i already played much of it in GFWL.EDIT: Now my playtime seems better XDEDIT 2: Its been a while since i first tried this game, and i came back to it a lot of times. This made me give it Test of time steam award.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sure, RFG has been rightly criticised for its boring characters and non-existent storyline, but I feel that people who over-emphasise those shortcomings are rather missing the point.Mechanically, I believe this is one of the greatest games of all time, not just for its destruction engine, which was far ahead of its time, and remains unmatched by anything made since, but also for the way it blends seamlessly into its brilliant combat, and the quality of that combat itself. I've spent hundreds of hours raiding bases in RFG's massive and colourful sandbox world, getting into raging firefights against waves upon waves of troops, tanks and airships, with buildings crashing down as they're hammered by cannon shells and explosive charges, and plowed into by out of control vehicles. The shooting alone is excellent. They've nailed the sense of feedback you get from firing your weapons so that every kill feels inordinately satisfying, more so than in anything else I've ever played. The high quality sound effects and music only complement the effect. You can complain about the story, but I've been playing this for years and never even bothered finishing the main missions. The moment to moment sandbox gameplay is just that good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like GTA/Just Cause set on Mars. You play as a new arrival on Mars, under the impression you're there to mine. Soon, you join the forces of the Red Faction, a guerilla terrorist cell whos goal is to liberate the citizens of Mars from the oppresive EDF (Earth Defense Force). The main draw of this game is the destruction and free roam; collapse anything, drive through anything and just plain out wreck the world, and escape the EDF goons in a high speed chase. It runs really well, and has a great storyline. You need to buy this if you liked Just Cause, or if you enjoy free roaming and destroying things like a badass.One of the BEST games I have ever played, if not the best free roam. Highly reccomend.

												This game was one of my favs back when it came out, I remeber playing it back on a friends PS3 before it FINALLY came out for us PC gamers but there was one issue......GAMES FOR WINDOWS♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!! Years later PARKER, the hero from RF 1 saved the game and gave us the STEAM EDITION, WOOT!!!!RFG has a solid solo campaign with a great story and lots of fun gameplay, the tech they used at the time for the destruction was very impressive even for todays gaming standards.The MP in this game has to be some of the best MP I have ever played, no perks, no levels, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just old school shooting with some fun game modes and cool POWER BACK PACKS that add a ton of flavor to the game, mix all that in with destructible maps and you have some DAM fun crazy MP games. Only issue is that the games MP is very underground now and has only a few loyal players left to play with, also the match making system in the game sucks.RFG is worth checking out even if you just play solo, and if you get lucky enough to find players in MP its just icing on the destructible cake!!!Also make sure to check out the ""Wrecking Crew"" mode, there is a map were you get to DESTORY GFWL!!! Buy the game and you will see what I mean :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was just browsing steam and noticed this game has been patched recently to support newer hardware and resolution options. 1000 points for just patching an old game rather than trying to milk it with a ""remasterd edition"". I don't remember the plot but the main point of this game is to destroy buildings. Doing so is fun throughout the game. Can get a bit repetitive towards the end but the game is not short so thats ok I guess. Reccommended as a sale purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A technical masterpiece with few equals. Red Faction: Guerrilla accomplishes something very few games have ever tried, much less achieved with real success; dynamic destruction with full physics and few - if any - slowdowns accompanying them. While the game is not perfect and even its destruction system can be finicky at times, Guerrilla is a game that I wish had inspired other developers to follow suit.The centerpiece of the experience is the Geo-Mod component of the game that handles dynamic building destruction. From my experience, little comes close to the level of optimization, stability, and overall fidelity that Geo-Mod enables for Red Faction. Practically every building in the game can be demolished in a maddening variety of ways. Strategically knock out primary supports and let the roof cave in, demolish a wall and watch the building topple sideways, or just ram a tank or a few demolitions charges in the front door and let the chaos unfold. Even with hundreds of individual pieces of a structure smashing to the ground and causing even more death or destruction in their descent, the game runs butter-smooth in all but the most catastrophic of collapses.It isn't just Geo-Mod alone that makes the building destruction fantastic, but how the game is set up. From the beginning, Guerrilla understands that demolishing buildings is a core element of the game and incorporates it into everything from sandbox shootouts to evasion missions. Stuck in a corner with bad cover or no ammo? Whip out your sledgehammer and knock a hole in the wall that's got you trapped. Taking fire from a difficult target on a balcony? Chuck a demo charge onto the bottom and bring the floor out from underneath him. Horde of APCs charging over a bridge? Blast a hole in their path and watch them tear apart the bridge's supports on the way down.Unfortunately, all games pay for quality in some area or another. Guerrilla suffers in several. While its shortcomings rarely fall below a professional grade of quality, Guerrilla struggles notably in its writing and offers a fairly light, two-dimensional plot with an antagonist that's almost on par with zombies in lack of characterization and absurdity. Characters on both sides of the firing line aren't developed beyond their basic introductions and the conclusion of the story itself is predictable, at best. The game's wonderful soundtrack almost feels like wasted potential as a result.Combat, graphics, and post-story sandbox activities are smaller failings, but are thankfully not quite as mediocre as the game's story. Gunfighting suffers from enemies lacking satisfying hit feedback and a reliance on weight of numbers and spongy health instead of engaging or varied behavior. The player's arsenal likewise suffers from severe maximum ammunition limits, forcing many weapon switches or battlefield pick-ups to stay competitive. Interplay with the game's destructive environment, good player mobility, and a wealth of available weapons shore up the otherwise forgettable combat, but only enough to keep it from being a chore.Graphically, the game isn't quite up to snuff, but this is understandable given its sandbox nature and physics-heavy environment. Textures are low resolution, models often lack in style or quality, and animations are mixed bag of stiff movement ""compensated"" by high playback speed. Lighting is often strange inside buildings and the game's low texture resolution is regularly given its own ""compensation"" with aggressive tiling where applicable. Fortunately, the Geo-Mod system is again of note; its effects, sounds, and behavior make for a stunning experience watching buildings collapse.Overall, while not as well-rounded as it could have been, Guerrilla is an applaudable, enjoyable game that baffles me for all the right reasons; why has no one followed it up, copied it, or took after its lead with its sandbox destruction? Why does a 2009 game have better physics than many games that came much later afterwards? How the Hell does this thing run so smoothly? Finally, why haven't you bought this game yet?

												I can't believe how underrated this game is.No, seriously, it's the best destruction game made since 2009. No other game has come even close to be this good.You can break buildings bit by bit with sledgehammer, explosives and a disintegrative gun (just like Marvin the martian). The destructions feels nice and works perfectly well. The physics are adjusted to a level where it feels realistic without compromising the gameplay. Watch the first teaser on this steam page. Do it.And for some kind of witchcraft this game runs smoothly even on my old as hell computer. There's all those particles and stuff flying on the screen, bits of buildings and people exploding everywhere and for some reason I still have a stable fps and 10/10 graphics.This game is optimized as heck. The guy who coded all that stuff deserves a medal.Or maybe two medals.♥♥♥♥, just give him a bunch of medals and a beer. He deserves it.I guess I should say some cons too.Well, the AI sucks. Nothing game breaking but most of the time the NPCs will do weird stuff like running in circles, driving off cliffs for no reason and standing in front of you when you're trying to shoot something. But people would do that in real life too, so I guess I can't blame those silly NPCs. (still a better AI than Skyrim, though).Also, everytime you start the game you're on one of those save points instead of just respawning where you saved the game. That's really annoying.The game also uses GFWL, but it'll be fixed in some time.And that's it.Definitely worth the full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not really sure if I recommend this game or not because I had my Fun with it but I will talk mostly about the negative aspects of the game so I put this review here.The game is fun and all the destruction is great, but it has multiple flow-breakers which makes it often just annoying.-The game is extremely tedious at many points, if you have fun, you have really fun but the way to get there was like really ♥♥♥♥ing tiring. You have to do many side missions to advance in the game to get control and salvage. Control is literally your game progression and salvage is money, which you obviously need both. The Problem is the you have 5 sectors with very similar missions and tasks, where a few of them are very boring (driving a car across half the map with a timer), which you also can't skip because you need the money. Which leads us to our next problem:-Salvage, or better money , if you play the game normally you are always low on cash so you have to farm to enjoy the game to its fullest or even to try out a few of the different weapons without reloading after testing it out. Because you need salvage for Upgrades and for the Story to continue and both are pretty expensive.-ammo shortage : Longer Fights can get really annoying because you always need to have a look on your reserve-ammo. For the normal assault rifles you have only two mags + the one in the gun and their damage is pretty low which makes them almost useless in longer fights. Later in the game you can kinda solve it but bigger fights are still annoying because somewhere in the middle you have to search for an ammo-crate.-much stuff in the endgame: there are a few things you get right before the ending which I think should be available much earlier. (You get a jetpack which you aren't able to use as much because the main part of the game is already over, btw it's awesome)In the end I would describe the game like this: skiing without a ski-lift. The descent is great, but its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to walk back up the mountain through the snow with your heavy gear.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Minecraft griefing + GTA lite, with bits of Just Cause 2.See that building? You can drive a tank through it. Or you can smack the structural supports with a sledgehammer and have it drop on top of you. Or you can slap demolition charges to it and level it in a controlled demolition, if you really have to. More fun to slap a demo charge to the back of an EDF jeep and drive full speed at a small jump, then faceplant out while it's airborne and detonate the wee bomb and send the truck at a great rate of knots through the top floor, taking the whole lot out in a glorious show of ragdoll and shatter physics.Plot and story? Meh, but still far better than a Michael Baygasm.Music is great, graphics are functional, still standing up against certain modern releases, but texture resolution seems a mip-map level too low on a lot of surfaces.Gameplay has been cleaned up completely from the awful GFWL version, is smooth and well optimised, with the polished close quarters gunplay far removed from the randomised clunkathon it was, although having the cover button the same as the sprint button is a bit naff.Needs more demolition master missions. About 3 times the amount.And the Marauder DLC wasn't long enough. The Marauder NPCs genuinely do not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ they will fire through each other at a target, frustrating when trying to rescue them from a prison camp. Watch the AI when they drive, they can get a bit suicidal.All in all, you like third person explodathons with vehicular manslaughter, jetpacks and ¡Viva la Revolución!?Get your♥♥♥♥♥to Mars.

												After playing this for a few minutes, this is a must have steam game in your library. The world of mars is beautiful, and opened world as well so you can explore various places and take in every little detail. While also blowing stuff up and taking cool screenshots at the sametime.The opening sequence of the game doesn't sugarcoat it and it gives you the plot right then and there. You are Alec Mason trying to start a new life on Mars when your brother was killed by the EDF, soon you find yourself in the ""Red Faction"" group and your main objective is to liberate mars from those evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There is just so much playtime in this game, and the game runs smoothly and the game's controls are easy to navigate requiring no rebranding of the keys or anything. I could go on and on how impressive this game is. It's a recommendation i suggest you get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  THIS IS TO GET YOUR ATTENTION  While it's not a super deep game (such as System Shock or other CRPGs), RF:G is still one of the best games I've ever played. The story is interesting (but not  great ), the graphics are a little dated, but the gameplay is spectacular. If you want to ♥♥♥♥ around and destroy stuff, this game is one of the best to do so. Buildings, bridges, government bases, nowhere is safe from your destructive power. The only complaints I can really bring up are the lack of modding and the lack of a real multiplayer scene (that may change in the future, I hope).I posted this because I saw the game was on sale. If you're reading this, and feel even  mildly  interested, I implore you to buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DEATH TO GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE, LONG LIVE STEAMWORKS!  GABEN BE PRAISED!!!  Now that I got that out of the way, this game is GREAT.  Originally a crummy console port this game has been revamped and GFWL removed and a ton of new stuff added.  Sprinted at guy and beat him with a hammer 10/10Honestly though, this may be one of the most underrated games in existence.  The campaign is decent and the multiplayer, THE MULTIPLAYER.  When this came out it suffered from GFWL matchmaking, now it uses steam works and is pretty easy to find a game.  It is a blast (hardy har har).  Never gets old throwing proximity mines all over your oppenents tower and then jumping off while detonating, Micheal Bay style.  Fantastic game I got it for 2.99 on sale but would gladly play full price :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play Jenga as a child, but not in a way one would expect. Sure I would construct precariously high towers, but my aim wasn’t to preserve their structural integrity. I wanted to find interesting ways to topple them, to observe the blocks collapsing inward gradually or being popped outward at speed. That same curiosity surrounding the observation of demolition is precisely what developer Volition channeled into Red Faction: Guerilla. This brilliant infusion elevates an otherwise typical action experience into something memorable.Red Faction Guerilla is set on the planet Mars in the year 2125, and follows the rebellion of a mining colony against the authoritarian regime of an organization known as the Earth Defense Force (or EDF). At the center of the conflict is Alec Mason, an Earthling who has made the journey to Mars seeking an honest job with his brother Dan. Unfortunately, Dan outs himself as an ally of the Red Faction resistance and brings down the full fury of the EDF upon them both. When Dan is gunned down in front of Alec, he begrudgingly joins the cause to put an end to EDF tyranny.Being so straightforward, the plot serves as a loose justification for wantonly blowing things up. There is essentially no character development, with Mason never evolving into anything more than a reluctant jerk. This despite the fact over the course of 20 missions I razed dozens of oppressive EDF structures, murdered hundreds of their troops, and even forged an alliance with a clan of barbarous tribals. It is also heavily implied that Mason has feelings for a member of the Red Faction, yet can’t even commit to her. For the 12 hours it took me to finish the story, Mason was smothered by dialog from jarheads preaching the high-minded notions of a free society, but refused to adopt any of them. I now question why the developer bothered hiring the talented Troy Baker to voice such an unlikeable character in needless cutscenes.Honestly, I would recommend skipping the narrative sequences, as the gameplay more effectively reinforces that the player is an outmatched revolutionary. The game begins in a remote corner of a considerably large open world, only arming the player with some demolition charges and a sledgehammer. In order to unlock missions, you have to destroy valuable EDF property in the region and decrease the strength of their occupation. I learned quite quickly that using hit-and-run tactics was optimal, as a Grand Theft Auto style policing system punishes troublesome players for lingering in an area. As I gradually outfitted Mason with better weapons and upgrades, I found I could dwell progressively longer in locations where EDF forces would have previously crushed me with ease.As I liberated each sector of Mars, the sense of empowerment became more pronounced and satisfying. I eventually moved from destroying inconsequential EDF roadblocks, to leveling entire military bases. My arsenal grew from construction tools to a collection of comedically exaggerated weapons of mass destruction, akin to the inventory of Ratchet and Clank. The increasingly involved story missions became opportunities to compose my own symphony of pandemonium. I no longer had to personally wreck every wall with my sledgehammer, I could use nanomachines to literally eat support beams or wipe out half a building with a thermobaric rocket and let gravity do the rest. Physics became a toy to me, something to experiment with and exploit for my amusement. From the first minute to the last, I never tired of listening to concrete shatter from concussive force or metal beams buckling under topheavy weight.Even the multiplayer leverages these primal delights to spruce up the typical suite of online modes. I regularly exploited the fragility of structures to improvise cover, generate new avenues of movement, and even set deadly traps. Following conventional map routes made me an easy target, while busting through barricades at weird angles often threw my opponents off guard. At times I found it more entertaining to be a human bulldozer than actually participate in the arena shooting. I can more clearly recall instances of disintegrating the ground around an opponent's feet, sending them plummeting to their death, then I can freak headshots. These atypical options motivated my addictive pursuit of chaotic ingenuity, encouraging me to play longer and return sooner.Unfortunately the community is no longer very active, regardless of one million users owning Red Faction Guerilla on Steam. I had to browse the forums and add a dozen strangers to my friends list before I could start lobbies with any consistency. More often than not, I was locked out of certain games types due to our group not meeting the minimum number of participants. While I personally felt the effort to get games going paid off, I would neither expect nor recommend an average consumer do that. If substantial multiplayer components are a factor in your purchasing decisions, looking elsewhere would be more fruitful.This game is also not a graphics benchmark, it is not made to impress computer hardware enthusiasts. The most taxing element of the engine is the proprietary physics tied to rendering chunks of debris as objects are damaged. Large quantities of rubble remain after buildings are dismantled, so areas dense with structures will put a strain on any CPU. Nothing will challenge even the most modest GPU, as the textures and relative draw distance compare to a PlayStation 2 release. However, it is worth noting that since the Red Faction IP was acquired by Nordic Games in 2013,  their programmers put in work to upgrade Red Faction Guerilla to the DirectX 11 API. The update added the ability to toggle appreciable visual effects like ambient occlusion, sun shafts, depth of field, and multisample antialiasing. While these options are fairly standard in software dating back to the DirectX 9 era, legacy support is nonetheless laudable.Ultimately, the adoration of Red Faction Guerilla’s inventive gameplay is why developers and devotees alike support the product at all. It could have been a critical darling if the writers had bothered to flesh out the template characters and scenario. The visual fidelity was also arguably lacking, where even the application of slightly more sophisticated bump mapping or tessellation would have allowed Red Faction Guerilla to age gracefully. As it stands, the game is a cult classic propped up on a foundation of outstanding interactive destruction.---My Set-Up:Hardware - Intel i7 6700k at 4.0 GHZ, 2-Way Nvidia GTX 1070 SLI, 16GBs of 3200mhz clocked RAM, Samsung 950 Pro 512GB NVMe SSD, Windows 10 Pro.Software Settings - 2560 x 1440 resolution, Character FOV 60, 2 Times MSAA, Particle Detail High, Shadow Detail High, Motion Blur Off, Ambient Occlusion Off, Depth of Field Off.Extra Enhancements - 60 FPS cap applied through RivaTuner to ensure locked performance, 16 times anisotropic filtering applied through Nvidia Control Panel, ReShade 3.0 used to inject SMAA and sharpen the image.Notes - Due to the lack of players in the multiplayer community, I resorted to using the Steam Achievement Manager to unlock the following achievements: Experimenter, Detective, Mad Genius, Courier of Pain, Topher Would be Proud, War Veteran, and A Winner is You. I also had to use SAM to unlock an achievement called Revolutionary, as a glitch was occurring that prevented the final side mission I needed to complete from triggering. Had I pursued all of these items as intended, my game time would have been pushed well over one hundred hours. Tens of hours would have been unnecessarily spent waiting in the open world or in multiplayer lobbies.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction Guerrilla Steam Edition is a one of a kind Military based shooter. I normally am not one that always plays shooters constantly so this game gave me a change of pace with a great level of difficulty from the very start.  The whole purpose of the game is to try to take over control points to stop this evil organization that has killed many people. In order to take control of these sections of the game you will have to bring down small and then large heavily fortified buildings.    There is little to hardly no cover system so often you may need  to shoot small packs of enemies and then retreat for a bit to get your health meter back up which automatically regenerates and then head right back over that way to finish your mission.  There is a wide variety between the tpes of vehicles you can hop in to remain safe from the opposing faction. The first consists of your normal vehicles you can only drive and have no weapon attachments. You can generally hop in any vehicle even if a civilian or the military organization your taking down is in it. Sometimes this will require you to shoot  them off the turrent based military vehicles so then you can invade control points easier.     In my own opinion wrecking crew mode is the greatest feature of all because it has no story and you just follow short  objectives like blowing up barrels to demolish buildings, using walkers to just obliterate everything standing in your way in what is known as Total chaos mode which is just a free-for-all destroy type of mode within wrecking crew.     My favorite part about this game is the use of Walkers to demolish control points if you are lucky enough to find one. There are usually a few different types but only one that has missles which is something similar to something that would be seen in a Armored core game or even generally comparable to a Star Wars AT-AT walker though smaller.I'll give this game a solid 8.5/10.  I highly recommend you check it out. It is made by THQ which was a company that went bankrupt eventually after having games only targeting family friendly kids games, movies games and then they created fully Muture games which was primarily targeted towards adults though that did not help their downfall as a company.All in all the destructible environments reminded me of some videos I have seen where people play the Battlefield Shooter series.

												Great mechanics and physics, you can blow up pretty everything using your hammer, rocket launcher, firing at gas tanks, etc. If you like blowing up things you should buy it.It needs a bit of strategy, because you cant act ""hit n run"" (most of the time), if the guards realise you are there, they will throw up to you everything they have :P You must act guerilla style, think your way in, how you should attack the building and your way out alive.The story is that you have gone to Mars as a miner, there you become a member of Red Faction, and you are fighting with others to liberate territories from the fascist EDF.

KAMGUSTA's mini ReviewA 7 years old game that is still a joy to play. It is an open world where almost everything can be destroyed and you can choose your own missions. These are divided in main story and side missions (I loved the demolition ones). As you complete mission you gain access to new mass-destruction weapons and upgrades. After 25 hours of gameplay (just as soon as side missions became a little repetitive) I finished the game and... surprise, a bunch of new side mission appeared, along with a brand new story line. Awesome.And you know what? Developers still update it!Still not convinced? You can drive 20 meters tall mechs armed with missiles.Score 8.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You're not some caution-to-the-wind, I-do-what-I-want protagonist who lives his life by crashing cars and doing drugs. You have a good-Karma kind of sense, and the game punishes you for doing things wrong to any innocent people. Now, as this makes driving lackluster, it makes combat more fun. Because you're rewarded for destruction and murder of enemies of the Red Faction. The game is fun and not too dry for something made a short while ago. It provides many fun times and good laughs and if you're into Xbox gamerscore, this game will sync with your achievements. I'd recommend it, but at 20 dollars, it's kind of a run-of-the-mill game that will be amusing for a good while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All I know is, this game, by itself, is a real hoot and a half of descrutive fun.Oh, and you can rebuild it all after blowing it up. But, eh, who wants to build? DESTROY!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start by saying *DON'T GET THE OLD GAMES FOR WINDOWS VERSION OFF EBAY OR SOMETHING NO MATTER HOW CHEAP IT IS.*That version had a pretty common showstopper bug in my experience, and required you to register it with the dreaded GFW:L client.This version has NONE of that crap. It's amazing. It's actually enjoyable.It's better than the console versions (PS3 or Xbox 360) because it actually includes the DLC, which is actually pretty fun, even though few people seem to have played it.Anyway, GTA: Mars -- I mean, Red Faction: Guerrilla -- is amazing. It's pretty much where you do a few missions, then the game is like, okay, you have to get this number down to zero to progress, and to do that, you go blow up some buildings. After you blow up some buildings, you often also have to do a ""guerrilla action"" or two. Those range from rescuing people from their own houses, helping a redneck guy blow up some more buildings, helping a bunch of random people blow up even more buildings, and keeping the EDF from blowing up your own buildings. Did I mention you blow up buildings?It's a third person game, unlike the earlier Red Faction games, and it's really fun even at that.10/10 would blow up EDF central command again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Viva la revolución!Red Faction Guerrilla is a futuristic si fi 3rd person open world game set on Mars.RFG is pretty much what would happen if Just Cause 3 and Mad Max had a baby. You have a baron wasteland to explore, and a FULLY DESTRUCTABLE ENVIORNMENT. I cannot stress how amazing a game where everything is destructible. It is by far one of the game's strongest aspects, and one of its most limiting aspects. I say this because the game lacks any memorable landmarks, since you can pretty much destroy everything.You get a lot of action packed missions, decent variety, MECHS!, and of course... a sledge hammer. The game doesn't have the best of stories however, just like Just Cause series, it doesn't matter.So go out there and remember, Viva la revolución!I recommend this game on sale. ",146,26,1,8,9,1,15

												Pretty good game, guys its better than Red Faction Armageddon and yea its OPEN WORLD, i would say its as good as Red Faction 2, anyway the Destruction in this game is so sexy!(AWESOME) like siriously almost everything is destructable. Oh you saw a Beatiful House BAM put bombs around it and explode it. Then look at it and LAUGH. Or get yourself a tank(only when your further in the game) or a Mech :D . Story is ok nothing special but DAYUM THE WEAPONS. I mean like who does not want a Singularity bomb(hard to find but so COOL) other weapons like a saw thrower aka Grinder(just like hl2 with the gravity gun) or you may prefer the Sledgehammer(wreck it ralph) you will have it from the start, its just giving you pleasure to run towards a soldier and slam his head. Or just use the damn nano rifle (starts with low on ammo just upgrade it and it will be worth the money) So much fun to destroy stuff. I think its a pretty good game and you Should get it. And hey if youre finished with the campaing just start the downloadable content campaing  and play as the Marauders ",136,7,2,4,5,0,11

Red Faction Guerilla Steam Edition is a great open-world game that excels at destruction.You play as Alec Mason, an Earth-born miner that comes to Mars looking for a job. Soon after your arrival, you get involved in a guerilla war against the oppressing force - Earth Defense Force. Your mission is to weaken EDF's control over different regions by destroying key buildings and completing optional tasks. Once you lower the control over a region, 3-4 story missions unlock for every region, so there is a little grinding involved for progression. Bring EDF's control to 0 in a region and you can take it over.The gameplay is focused on destruction, as it should be because this game uses a very nice physics engine. There are a lot of tools to blow things up: items in the environment, mines, placeable detonators, rocket launcher, etc. You even get rewarded with scrap (game currency) for bringing down structures and making stuff go boom. There are also regular guns such as a pistol and assault riffle, but these are less fun to use. Later in the game you will have access to better guns and gadgets, but you will need a big amount of scrap if you want to unlock everything. My favourite combination was sniping with the nano-rifle from mid-air (using jetpack).  I didn't play Red Faction Guerilla in its original itteration, but from the information available it looks like the developers cared enough for the game to improve a lot and re-release it in a better state. If you like open-world games such as Saints Row, Just Cause or Max Mad then it is a must-play. If not, I would still recommend to give this one a try. You will have a blast, I promise.

												This is a game with most of the gameplay being the ""fun part"", unlike games these days with chunks of boring cutscenes and narrative trying to make a fundamentally boring story interesting but fail, making it even more boring, or just scripted gameplay where the player has no control of what is going on. So much fun playing it. Physics, explosions, shooting, driving, blowing up buildings, and blowing up more buildings. Everything is fun. And it's still been getting support from the developers to make the game even better. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tend to call this game the last great destructible scenery game. Red faction since its inception has given players enormous freedom in blowing open walls to make new paths, blowing up bridges to drop things, etc. Red factio Guerrilla is the pinnacle of this system, with a truly beastly amount of freedom to destroy. Car bombing a building into a tiny pile of rubble is totally possible. The fact that the game has this system but does not force you to use it means that players can just as easily go in tactically on a mission despite all the explosive possibilities. You can blow the entire block up to kill a target, or blow a hole in the roof and blast him. Vehicles are not left out of this and can be used to destroy things just as easily as a det charge. In terms of story, it really is not bad at all, nothing groundbreaking, but the fact it ties into the old games and still stands out with cool themes of its own (Such as the awesomely dressed raider faction) makes it a pleasure to find in a game that could easily have shipped with a cookie cutter story. The weapon selection is extravagant and awesome, with precision deconstruction weapons like the nano rifle, and massive ordinance like the thermobaric rocket that can level blocks. While the game in large part is totally badass, there are some pitfalls. The inability to redo main missions is bad to find in an open world game, though theres alot of side missions that can be replayed, that does not excuse the inability to redo missions. Along the same lines, if you destroy many landmarks, those landmarks do not come back, ever. Blow up the biggest coolest bridge in the game and thats it, never again. Many buildings do respawn, especially ones used in side missions, but the many that do not are a sad one time but of fun that will never be again. So overall, red faction guerrilla is a game with a fantastic destruction system, above any other game to come out before or since. Blow everything up, deconstruct your enemies bunkers, bridges, and tanks. Sneak in, blow your way out. use vehicles as disguises, wrecking balls, or escape methods. Work with the reistance. This game is a great example of an open world game made right, but with the downfalls of diminished replayability due to being unable to replay missions or regenerate the environment.

												The environmental damage takes centre stage in this game, buildings can be torn down piece by piece, they have weaknesses to their architectural structure, and other surfaces can be smashed and mutilated. The environment always feels alive, the wind blows dust across your path and howls gently, the EDF are always carrying out patrol routes and intimidating civilians, then we have the safe houses where your fellow faction members are deep in conversation and planning their next moves. There are various sectors to explore, each with their own distinct look and feel. You will start your journey in a quieter and more open desert area, then move to a rocky wasteland, and venture across more urban and densely populated areas.Environmental design has also been taken into consideration, there are some vast open areas but all of the sectors are connected well and just as easy to navigate. In-game character models are well crafted and animations perform competently as the gameplay pushes the boundaries of pure carnage. The soundtrack deserves praise as it matches the ambient nature of Mars. The story missions revolve around helping the Red Faction overthrow the EDF and liberate each sector; once a sector is free of EDF control then no enemy forces will bother you in that zone. A lot of the time you are outnumbered and it isn't always easy to take out specific targets. The A.l. for your guerrilla allies can be really clumsy at times, some missions require you to free captured guerrilla fighters and get them to safety. For some reason, sometimes they don’t wish to get in a getaway car with you and end up fending off enemy forces at their own demise. Perhaps it would have helped having some greater control over freedom fighters. ",313,18,14,20,6,2,27

												I've known the game Red Faction Guerrilla for about 4 years now. I first got it on my Xbox 360 and thought it was amazing. You can do whatever you want. Destroy buildings, crash cars, kill innocent or enemies, jump into pits of doom.... but it's not really all about that. It's about the creatitvity the developers put in the game. The weapons are amazing, the story line is good and the bunches of days/months or even years they put into making the whole world in this game is amazing. It's cool to watch the NPCs react in the game, they'll help you out in very tough situations and lead you to victory. They are a HUGE part in the game. Anyway, great game, great plot, great characters. 10/10 would play again.			",20,4,0,1,3,0,0

												This game is ridiculously underrated. The destruction system is genius and while the story isn't winning any awards, it's decent enough to be pretty engaging. They've designed an interesting enough sci-fi world to feel somewhat invested in it. The game is highly atmospheric considering it's built off of the same engine as Saints Row, and on max graphics the  barrren landscape of Mars is actually beautiful. But other people have mentioned this stuff already. I'm writing this review because I want to give a shout out to how ridiculously well-optimized this game is. I'm able to play it at max graphics with a good frame rate on a Microsoft Surface, that is, a tablet. I installed it thinking it may work on the lowest setting, but was blown away. If you have a laptop or a tablet and want something to play on an airplane or wherever you don't have access to a decent gaming PC, I highly reccommend this game. I wish more games would emulate Red Faction. It seems like this great little game kinda got lost to history, which is a shame.			",41,8,0,5,12,0,23

It has a massive map and cool weaponry. The graphics are great and the pc port is alright. I once placed a bomb on the road and an EDF truck just went over it, it exploded and bits and pieces were flying everywhere and then a pipe just fell on me and I died! Once you buy the game it starts to crash and stuff so copy ""-nod3d10"" (without quotes) go to your library, right-click red faction guerrilla, go to properties, click LAUNCH SETTINGS and paste it in the box.This game is just destructively awesome!Thanks for reading my review. :D			",78,11,1,4,6,0,2

												The best way to describe this game is if you mixed Total Recall and GTA into one game.  This game is tough and has alot of fun when you can get going into it.  If your a big fan of Red Faction game, this one is the best yet.  Adding to the story of the original and even some neat Easter Egss along the way, this game really amps up everything from vehicles, weapon upgrades and even some impressive mechs to make you feel like a badass.  Along with that, the game features the classic Red Faction destroy anything features where every building can be broken down right to its foundations.  This adds alot of variety and creativity to the game and don't forget about the difficulty either!  Its nothing to difficult to say but it will definitely keep you thinking and restrategizing yourself instead of just going in guns blazing.  So what are you waiting for, get your a$$ to Mars!

												A blast from the past, literally!I love the freedom you have in this game, not only in the sense that it's a sandbox title, but also how from the get go you are pretty much free to approach the missions however you see fit, not only because you can but because a lot of the time you are provided with great alternatives. It goes without saying but the weapon and vehicle variety is insane and through them you will level towers, blow and tear entire bases to shreds a start quite a fuss with the oppressive enemy forces. The destruction physics still hold up quite well, given your PC can handle them. (unfortunately, even my half-decent build couldn't manage to keep up without chugging while I was wreaking havoc and things got a bit intense.) The setting and plot provide you with just enough context for the missions that they don't feel out of place or lacking in purpose, it's the other way around, even if you're not into the story or characters, completing the missions and conquering bases feels very rewarding because there is a sense of progression as you conquer new areas in the map and push back the enemy forces.My only complaint so far is the main character's revenge plot device is pretty run of the mill...the way it's presented just isn't that convincing. I don't even remember the protagonist's name so that alone says something about how poorly developed he is. That aside, the game is a TON of FUN and that's what it all boils down to.

												This game has an absolutely amazing destruction and physics system, with very good combat, that feels very balanced for both the player, and enemies. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun, destructive game that has a nice story that will keep you playing.			",21,2,0,2,5,0,0

												By far the best in the entire red faction series. Seriously, there is nothing on the map that you cant destroy!Oh! The amount of joy you will feel when you detonate a cleverly placed charge and watch an entire five storeyed building come crashing down.Havent gotten into the story deep yet, but I find it extremely enjoyable to play.Had a bad day? Angry at your boss? Well the remedy is simple, just log into steam, start your copy of red faction guerrilla and pick up your trusty ol' sledgehammer and go about destrying everything at your heart's content.10/10			",293,73,4,42,16,2,48

												Let me just state this upfront: Red Faction Guerilla is a great deal of fun most of the time.  This should likely come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the developer’s (Volition) most famous (and ridiculously fun and absurd) series, Saints Row.  That being said, Guerilla is far from a perfect game and definitely shows its age in some respects.  But first, the positives.  Like I said before, there is a lot of fun to be had in Guerilla and this is due in large part to the Geo-Mod system the game employs which essentially allows for you tear down damn near every structure in the game, brick by brick.  There’s an extremely visceral amount of fun to be had simply roaming around the Martian landscape plowing through buildings or bashing away at a building with your trusty sledgehammer before hearing that telltale creak that signifies a building is about to come crashing down all around you and scrambling to get out of the way of the debris.  Additionally, the system can even take on a bit of a puzzle like aspect as you try to find the most efficient manner of bringing a building down with your remote charges or rocket launcher.  From a technical aspect, the game is also well optimized for most any PC.  I tested the game on a mid-range laptop (8 GB RAM, i5 processor, and integrated graphics card) and it ran with very few problems (there were a few frame rate hiccups here and there when the destruction started to get really crazy but even still it was absolutely playable) on low to medium settings.  When I moved over to my desktop though (i7, 16 GB RAM, with a GeForce GT 730) I was able to get silky smooth performance at higher settings.  For what it’s worth, I’ve also played Guerilla on my 360 and while performance there was closer to what I saw on my laptop, I would still recommend it on that system to anyone who asked.Unfortunately, a lot of what’s surrounding the actual gameplay in Guerilla leaves a fair bit to be desired.  The story of the game is utterly forgettable and extremely self-serious which is quite disappointing, especially in light of what Volition would ultimately go on to do in the Saints Row series.  I honestly couldn’t tell you the name of more than two or three characters in Guerilla and to say that the characters who are present in the game lack definition would be putting things lightly.  The Witcher 3 this game is not but then again not every game has to be. What’s a bigger issue though, is that the game is unfortunately afflicted with an issue present in a lot of open world games in that there simply isn’t a lot there to make the world feel alive.  Much of the time you’ll simply be driving between the different “Guerilla Actions” (essentially side quests and events) or EDF (the game’s primary villain) bases looking for more targets to destroy with little points of interest in between.  Furthermore, I found the actual combat present in the game to be frustrating at times as there’s a surprisingly low ammo ceiling for the weapons you can carry and Alec Mason (the game’s protagonist) proved to be somewhat fragile in terms of survivability.  There is a cover system present in the game, but it’s laughably simple at best and actually detrimental to your play at worst as you can pretty easily get stuck to walls and find yourself swarmed with EDF goons in pretty short order.  I typically found it a lot easier to instead just get in whatever vehicle I could find and ram through as many enemies as I could before actually getting out and engaging in a direct fire fight.That being said though, I would still recommend this game purely based on the amount of fun there is to be had with the destructibility of the environment.  Just know before going in that there are some gameplay frustrations that you’ll have to push through and that there really isn’t anything waiting for you at the end in terms of a satisfying narrative. Guerilla is one of those game’s you should play for exactly as long as you’re still having fun blowing stuff up and then feeling fine dropping once that loses its luster.   ",85,19,0,12,8,0,37

												- Review of Red Faction Guerrilla Steam Edition Single Player -The game itself is awesome ; destroying structures never gets old, walkers are a blast to use ( too bad you only get to play them a few times ),your arsenal is varied and destructive, and enemy AI are smart, they adapt to destroyed environments and always try to flank and kite you.But it does have its flaws;(-) Story is pretty generic and feels rushed ; before you know it you'll be playing the final mission with no build up for the final confrontation against EDF ( antagonists )(-) Characters are uninteresting and forgettable (-) Framerate stutters when a lot is happening(-) Physics in this game is whack, such as when a building is still standing with only one scaffolding left. and my characters can get shoved by slowly-moving rubble until he dies(-) Civilian AI is incredibly stupid ; they run in circles and into firefights and hide under a building when it's very clear that it's collapsing; this might not be annoying had there be no consequences, but there is; civilian morality drops after they do stupid stuff like this(-) Guerrilla AI is also dumb ; they always seem to follow around and sometimes end up hiding under collapsing buildings or near explosives; you'll also be punished by losing morality because they do thisAside from its flaws ; fun, chaos, and destruction ensues for those who bought this game < 7 / 10 >			",77,6,0,3,1,0,4

												Red Faction Guerrilla is now free of GFWL! If sandbox style, open world play is your thing, I thoroughly recommend Red Faction Guerrilla. While it's getting a bit long in the tooth these days, both visually and mechanically, it's still a great game for tooling about and destroying things.While this is one of my favourite sandbox games, my recommendation comes with a cople of caveats; mission checkpointing can be a little harsh at times, and the game really is mostly about choosing your own way of doing the missions you're given. There is a story, and there are many, many missions. But the true joy is in deciding how to approach a given challenge with all the tools the game provides, especially in terms of destructibility. And when you screw up, you're sent back to the beginning of a mission, so repetition is virtually inevitable. Therefore, if you like your game experiences more towards the curated end of the spectrum, I can't extend this recommendation to you. This is very much a game that lets to find your own fun in a science fiction world, but helps that along by providing tools of sheer destructive joy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction Guerrilla is good for what it is, but it is starting to show its age.The building destruction mechanics are awesome, and there still aren't really any games that compare to how satisfying and detailed the destruction of buildings is. Sadly, the insides of buildings feel very lifeless compared to the sculpted mountains and hills of Mars. Add the fact that you can raze the entire building with a mis-click, it adds to the lifelessness of buildings, and the world feels somewhat better without them. 90% of the buildings don't ever respawn, which means once you enjoy the destruction of everything on Mars once, you won't be able to do it again on the same save file. Also, having good building destruction kind of pales in comparison to the terrain deformation from the original Red Faction, and it is a shame that they couldn't somehow implement that as well.The combat is the usual stale third person shooter type, similar to Watchdogs. The melee with things like hammers is pretty satisfying against enemies, though it is very risky on harder difficulties since enemies will take out half of your health with great accuracy while running up to them. The driving is OK, a little stiff, but solid. Smashing a truck through an outpost is great, and really highlights the great destruction engine.The graphics are fast becoming very dated. The cutscenes look almost like something from a PS2 game, the human models look kind of chunky, like action figures, and I don't know if it's just me but the sound files for voice acting sound really compressed and garbage sounding, as if they were from a game from 2002. Mars looks fine, it looks like Mars.The game is pretty unbalanced on the hard difficulty. Enemies empty magazines into you with very little inaccuracy, and because the health regeneration takes such a long time to begin, the sheer amount of enemies that start chasing you will kill you. The enemies also take a huge amount of damage. It helps make the EDF feel more like armoured bad guys, but it's very annoying using all of your ammo on only 3 normal bad guys, especially when there are 12 more around the corner. The sheer randomness of the physics system also takes part in causing much frustration. Sometimes getting hit in the head with a fallen turbine blade will only give you some damage and won't knock you down. Sometimes a stray hand-railing will knock you down, take out a quarter of your health, and pin you under a nearby walkway making you a sitting duck for enemy soldiers while you wait for the standing up animation to happen. I don't know what a remedy could be for something like this, because it makes sense to die from a bulding landing on your head. But sometimes the physics are just too random.Overall, the game is good. It's just kind of showing it's age with some other problems from the time. If you are in the mood for games like GTA, Watchdogs, or other third-person drivey-shooty games, then this game will fit the bill with some added cathartic destruction.			",510,61,9,27,16,1,22

												If I had to summarize this game I would describe it as Grand Theft Auto on Mars with destructible structures.Wrecking stuff in this game is ridiculously fun. One of my favorite tactics is just lobbing remote detonators  and using them to destroy whatever building the enemy is hiding in.My only major complaint and only reason why I haven't put more time into this game is the mandatory GFWL crap. Unlike other people, I am able to save, but GFWL is responsible for numerous crashes. I look forward to the time when the GFWL integration is obliterated and I can play this game unfettered by unnecessary bloatware.In summary, this game is great fun and its one main drawback (GFWL) should be going bye-bye within a year.

												The destruction engine in this game is second to none. Literally everything can be destroyed and always in spectacular ways. It is so much fun to sneak in and carefully place explosives on an enemy building's supports and then detonate and watch the it all collapse very realistically in my opinion. Its just as much fun to jump inside a mech (think power loader from Aliens) and run through buildings, vehicles and enemies.It also features multiplayer which can be good at times. Its the frantic madness that makes it fun rather than the tactical shooting. There is also a mode where you try to beat others scores by causing as much destruction as possible in a given time limit.This is a very fun game that you could easy sink hours into just blowing things up and watching the pieces fly.8/10 .

The most common glitches are constant sunrays through walls, flickering objects and dissapearing objects. This is a problem with Direct X 10. To fix this, you need to launch the game in Direct X 9.

												Red Faction Guerrilla is an excellent game.What? You want to know more? Fine. Red Faction Guerrilla takes up the open-world that the likes of GTA and Oblivion provides but adds one key factor: Destruction. Blow up buildings, destroy EDF checkpoints all in an effort to free the Martian people.It's extremely ballsy to develop a storyline about terrorism, and frankly no other game that I'm aware of has ever gotten the interesting introspection needed to really explore the more subtle statements the game offers.""Why am I fighting the EDF? Why is it okay for me to destroy property and endanger people in an effort to destabilize areas?"" While the game takes the easy route to vilify the EDF and occupational forces, it still is enough to make any post-9/11 American to raise an eyebrow in curiosity.Guerrilla is worth the time spent, and is recommended wholeheartedly. Go get it, right now. Stop reading, do it.			",653,134,32,120,86,3,104

												The destruction system is excellent, causing havoc feels great, there are dozens of weapons each with its own upgrades, side-quests are fun and the voice acting is nice. Awesome!What's not so awesome is the characters, the music, the AI and the story...The characters are easily forgettable and the story feels weak mainly because the good guys win only thanks to the main character (who's just some generic dude). The EDF aren't that hard to beat either (I played on Normal).The game also talks about some Marauders during the beginning, but they only appear twice in the story. Some interesting events happen throughout the story every now and then, thankfully.The AI is dumb, but at least it's funny watching the enemies and allies do weird stuff sometimes. The music is there, but nothing really stands out. Everything sounds the same and it's usually hard to even hear the music, because of all the loud noises (fighting EDF, blowing up stuff, etc.)One last big annoyance is the the ore crystals & the EDF crates. There are way too many crystals and crates and they are all too far away from each other. The rewards you get for destroying them are also negligible. 6-12 salvage per crystal and about as much per crate? That's it? If there were fewer of them, but rewarded more salvage (and maybe even stuff other than salvage, like unique weapons or temporary buffs, or discounts to certain upgrades) then maybe it would've been fun destroying them all.Despite its flaws it's a good game. Even better now that GFWL is dead! Definitely worth playing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction Guerrilla is the other masterpiece from Volition (Freespace being the first.)This game hits all the right notes and lets you do what you like once you learn how to thoroughly♥♥♥♥♥♥of the Man (EDF). As much as I have enjoyed Saint's Row the Third and IV, this is a more fun sandbox experience. There is nothing like demolishing building after building, then running away or fighting the swarms that come to pacify you.The multiplayer is awesome, though you need to coordinate with others to play, since you must have a full roster to launch. But no other game gives you such an arsenal or destructable arena to smack people around in. For the longest time this game was out of reach on PC due to the GFWL abomination. Even while that was 'online' it took herculean effort for me to get the game to launch. Now that is in the past, thanks to the efforts of some clear-visioned coders.I cannot wait to play through this game again, and lay down some singularity bombs to suck my friends into who knows what online.

												Red Faction Guerrilla is an open world sand box game with an interesting narrative and fantastic amounts of playability.Open world games are certainly not my kind of game, however this game excels in the fact there is a linear, developing plot as you progress from story mission to story mission, without this, the game would have been a flop in my honest opinion.The game didn't hook me at first, but the moment they put a gun in my hands, and I was fighting hordes of EDF soldiers, that's when I started to become hooked. The gun play feels refreshing, impactful and enjoyable. That and the fact that it isn't your stereotypical cover shooter... because the cover will just get blown up! It's great that for once, the best way to play is aggressively, it really helps make it refreshing.the game heavily features driving segments, and they aren't F-zero GX quality driving segments either. This would hinder the game, but it actually helps a lot. It gives you time to immerse yourself into the game and the game world. Eventually you do get a fast transport system, which is fantastic, but you still need to drive to your destinations. This combined with the raid missions which have colonists hop in your vehicle, makes the driving all the more pleasant.And on the topic of colonists, this is where the game truly shines. You can sing praises on the destruction physics, but what really makes this game amazing in my eyes, is the Morale and NPC interactions. As you fight the EDF and complete objectives, more and more colonists will fight by your side. One particular cause of this, is the EDF assault missions, where EDF Armoured personal carriers and tanks drive into a colonist base, and you must fight them off. As your Morale increases, more and more of these NPC's fight by your side, it makes the world feel real, and helps really show that the mission your doing actually have weight behind them. The morale goes as far to change the dialog of the NPC's when you walk past them, which is truly the icing on the cake for me.The games plot is nothing to write home about, but the game does a great job immersing yourself in the world at least, thanks to features like the Morale system, as described earlier.  The mission variety also helps a lot in keeping the game interesting. The Jenkins missions are a little bit boring by the end, as its basically a gallery turret segment, and timed driving segments would have been better if the driving itself was more enjoyable, but it is what it is. The two artillery segments towards the end where mediocre at best, but they weren't bad, I'm glad they were included just to spice things up a little right at the end, but I would have preferred to only have had that segment played once, and not twice.However, the expanding diversity of guns and upgrades, and the dynamic, highly entertaining Havok physics engine made this game a stellar experience. A fantastic game, definitely worth the time and effort (and of course the money) to play, you will (probably) not regret it! ",58,2,2,3,1,1,33

												A very fun open world action game. What makes Red Faction: Guerrilla stand out is the destruction physics which are truly awe-inspiring. They are not like what you see in other games, it is much more in depth. Its very satisfying to take a hammer and reduce a building to dust, watch it crumble apart, it never really gets old. The moment I picked up the hammer and break down the first wall in the tutorial was when I knew it was cool.One fun memory I had of this game was when I was inside a building and there was an enemy tank firing at the building and I saw the building I was in crumble around me, the building falling apart in front of your eyes, the walls would get destroyed and troops would start firing on me through them, I rush outside just in time before the building clopses completely. Another time, I had to kill some snipers on the roof, so I used the disintegrate gun to shoot the ceiling of a building and the sniper on top fell through and I hit him with my hammer. It creates a new dimension to sandbox games that you don't see in many other games and has yet to be topped to this day. Every time you pilot a tank and fire missiles into buildings, or a mech suit and rage through buildings, is awesome. Why somebody hasn't taken this technology and applied it to a pure tank or mech game is beyond me, as the missions where you pilot a tank or a mech suit were probably my fondest memories of this game and could have made a great tank or mech game with them.Some missions did not utilize the destruction physics to their fullest potential, such as any of the driving missions which are usually really boring with floaty driving (although given the setting on Mars I suppose it makes sense), however most of them were very good. My favourite side missions were the demolition ones where you level a building or structure using limited supplies, like a puzzle almost, which were fun, and I also really enjoyed the house arrest side missions where you have to rescue fellow resistance fighters because in those missions, you have to actually be careful about which parts of the building you want to destroy as you don't want to level the building with your buddies inside it or you lose, which you don't really need to do in the rest of the game.There were a few design flaws, such as when a fellow guerilla helps you out and gets killed and you support in that area because the AI isn't the greatest. Losing 3 support points every time you die in free roam was annoying too. Plus sometimes buildings would be held up with only one wall and wouldn't fall over, when in real life they would have. I wish this game would have gotten a real sequel that expanded upon the destruction physics and made them even better and more satisfying, it could have even been a more linear game or a level based game like Hitman because most of the actual missions in Guerrilla are quite linear themselves.The focus is on the sandbox fun and the story is a loose framework to hang this on. I recommend skipping the cutscenes because they are pretty boring, plus it was not very clear on who the Maurauders are in the story. All you need to know is that there's an evil totalitarian government and you're out to take them down and get revenge.Music and audio were fine. Multiplayer is pretty dead but I've heard its fun so there might be some steam groups around to play with.Overall, definitely worth playing through, I played it years ago on console and it still holds up today. I played it on Hard this time and the difficulty was still fine, it was fun on Normal too, will play through it on Insane sometime in the future.			",651,181,13,106,63,5,102

												Download size: about 8 GBPlaytime: about 12 hours for single playerThe newly updated Red Faction Guerilla steam edition comes with trading cards and achievements since they migrated away from Games For Windows Live. It also seems to be less buggy, but this may be a coincidence. You don’t need to have played the previous Red Faction games to understand what’s going on, and if you played Red Faction Armageddon, the campaign story isn’t really spoiled for you either. The stories take place with enough time in between for all sorts of things to have happened.You play as Alec Mason, a recent immigrant to Mars planning to live with his brother as a miner (actually a scavenger of salvage). Unfortunately your plans are ruined when you experience the brutality of the EDF (Earth Defense Fleet), the powerful military organization that seems to be in the pocket of all the major corporations keeping the working man down. Alec joins the Red Faction, which is a kind of resistance/terrorist group committed to driving the EDF off of Mars by any means necessary. So now you (as Alec) spend your time blowing things up (and collecting salvage).Red Faction Guerilla is a third person open world game, similar to Grand Theft Auto or the Saints Row games. Since it takes place on Mars, there’s also reduced gravity though you don’t really get to fly around everywhere, even after you get a jet pack. The trademark of all Red Faction games is destructible environments, so like Red Faction Armageddon, you can pretty much destroy any man-made structure in the game, including buildings, bridges, walls, and all the crates the EDF leaves lying around. There are a few things that might give you trouble, for example some buildings have indestructible metal girders as part of the construction, but you can still knock them around and cause the buildings to collapse. It’s probably easiest to just ram your cars into the buildings though. Yes, like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row, you can hijack all sorts of cars (no aircraft) and drive all over the map. The game world is moderately large and probably would take 15 minutes of straight driving to get across it. You can’t do that though since Mars has mountains and valleys blocking you so you mostly need to follow roads.You can carry up to 4 weapons at a time, but one of them is locked as your trusty sledgehammer, which is decent for destroying buildings. There isn’t too much variety in the projectile weapons, and you’ll probably stick will explosive weapons in order to bring down buildings. Weapons and their upgrades are unlocked in the game by completing side missions or just picking them up from fallen enemies. Once you’ve unlocked the weapon you can restock it from any of your “safe houses” around the map. Money in the game is salvage, which shows up as shiny metal that you can pick up by walking over. Most of your salvage will likely come from completing missions, but a there’s a lot to be gained from the rubble of buildings.Pros:+Wreck buildings in all sorts of ways. Usually the quickest way is using explosive weaponry, which has ammo limitations, so I like to try and crash cars into the buildings whenever possible. Just make sure you have enough room to build up ramming speed (and enough firepower to survive the EDF retaliation).+The game has multi player which I only dabbled in for about an hour. There are actually people still playing but not more than a dozen or so at a time. No co-op campaign play however, which is a shame. There are a lot of multi-player modes, but people only seem to be playing the deathmatch types.Cons-Unfortunately for me, a large number of the game’s Steam achievements are for grinding in multiplayer, and a bunch of the single player achievements require finding ALL of certain types of collectibles. -The game’s side quests become repetitive after a while and by the time you unlock the game’s final area, you probably won’t be doing any of the side quests since you’ll be bored by then. -For an older game, my computer actually heats up when I play for a while. The game uses Havok engine, which seems to appear in a ton of the games I’ve been playing recently, but the game’s graphics aren’t much better than say, Fallout 3.All in all Red Faction Guerilla is a good game worth your weekend to play through. The campaign has its exciting points and it’s fun to go around blowing up buildings. The DLC Demons of the Badlands is included in the Steam edition (I don’t know if the GFWL version had it). The DLC is about 3 hours and includes a few new weapons to play with, as well as a completely useless new kind of collectible (battery packs that don’t do anything). At least in the main game, all the collectibles had some sort of benefit (like give you a little salvage). ",655,205,34,57,43,12,103

												This is a game I did not pay any attention to or notice until there was a free weekend, I was almost not going to try it out as I have heaps of games Iam yet to play. But I tried it and played through the start and was immediately hooked and had to buy it even though I wanted to play other games first.I love games where you get to destroy your surroundings I always find them so much fun.And there are so very few games like that. The only other game I played that was sort of like that was Just Cause 2.I enjoy this game a lot. Blow up entire buildings, destroy everything around you with explosives, sledgehammer and even your vehicle, what more could you want? It also has decent combat, and side missions that test your skills such as beating the time for demolitions master which you have various scenarios such as find the buildings weak spot, destroy it with 1 explosive and beat the pro time of 15 seconds, or destroy this building as quick as possible just using your sledgehammer as well as various others.There's also transporter challenge of getting a vehicle somewhere as quick as possible. But I find those boring. I dislike vehicle controls so found it rather frustrating doing transporter missions.And some others as  such as raids, rescue etc. The story and characters aren't much, but I don't mind as destroying everything is what the focus of the game is and I can't get enough of that. Once I start destroying I get so immersed and can't stop. I really like the futuristic look to some vehicles and buildings. The music is very good. Though the landscape looks rather bland and barren being mountainous and dusty, but I guess that's what you get with Mars.Did not have any problems or bugs with this game and like that the world feels very open and not boxed inIt's great that when morale is high guerilla's join you and help attack the enemy and they can be helpful when trying to destroy things they can draw the enemies focus so I can destroy things easier, but they also can be a hindrance and get in the way of explosions and hammer swings.This is a great game for those who love destruction and I did not start to feel bored until after the 46 hour mark which is good. What I disliked most was that you get such a small amount of ammo, even with full upgrade.Awesome fun and a must play. Doesn't quite get an 8 as there is not much variety in what you do.7/10			",74,18,0,13,12,1,2

												There aren't a lot of games like Red Faction: Guerrilla out there but I've got to say I loved it.The game's emphasis is basically centered around blowing stuff. And carnage. And blowing some more stuff up. I lost count of how many times I just went on rampages throughout the various sectors, trying to destroy key strategic places while having the EDF on my♥♥♥♥♥trying to stop me. The fully destructible environments and buildings just give you such an amazing sense of freedom and endless shortcut potential. Combine that with the possibility of driving overpowered mechs and tanks, and you've got a really fun game to just mess about.It is also open world, so there's plenty of side missions here and there, and unmarked collectibles, but this made me recall the first Assassin's Creed, and not in a good way. See, while there are several types of side missions, every time you visit a new sector, you just end up getting the same side missions anyway. You really just end up feeling like you're doing the same thing over and over again even when you're in a new zone, just like Assassin's Creed. There's a few dynamic ones that pop up when you might just be wandering around, but again, not a lot of variety.I absolutely love Colonial Mars. You don't see it depicted often, and it is that sweet blend of early colonization + open expanses of wilderness. The sectors themselves, of which there are quite a few, do have their own personality and flavor. The whole vibe it gave off really reminded me of driving the Mako in Mass Effect.The plot itself is pretty standard really, usual insurgent rebels fighting evil empire with superior forces. There were a few plot twists here and there but I found most of it, including the story missions, rather underwhelming. Personally though, the freedom fighter premise is something that never really gets old for me, so I did enjoy it nevertheless.All in all though, totally recommend this one. While it may not be thought provoking long after you've beaten it, you will remember the slaughter you've inflicted as your carefully planted bombs collapse that huge apartment block in one go, causing its floors to crash on the enemies' unsuspecting heads as you break a hole in a wall to cut a shortcut and make your escape. Fun stuff.			",858,258,31,163,96,14,179

												Great open world TPS with destruction physics that have never been bettered in the 5 years since the games release. Easily the best Red Faction game. Now with GFWL stripped from it and replaced with Steamworks and a new DirectX 11 renderer that fixes any compatibilty issues with modern cards. The game is a better port now than when it was released in 2009. A must own game.EDIT: Also contains a DLC prequel that is short but gives a little bit more insight in to the marauders.

												Do you like breaking things? Do you want to destroy things? This game is for you.Just grab your big hammer that delivers enough force to destroy buildings, vehicles and anything else you care to hit with it and smash everything.

												It's awesome. It's amazing. It's fantastic. It's outstanding.Anyway, I really hate the transporter guerilla action. Sure you can beat it in normal time but getting a pro time felt you have accomplished something really big. The Arc welder is also good for taking out driver or the entire crew in a vehicle. It's great against tanks since you can just hijack it afterwards.Of course since it's a Red Faction game you know you are going to blow stuff up!			",64,5,1,8,4,0,19

												Red Faction: Guerrilla Steam Edition is an amazing package with the original game and includes all released DLC - including the Demons of the Past campaign and continues to receive updates and support from the developers. Finally, a true Red Faction game that utilizes the Geo-Mod destruction to the fullest potential on all structures (not on terrain like the original game)! Everything is destructible which creates amazing explosions and the desire to blow everything up. The game does a good job requiring the player to destroy buildings and other barriers in order to progress. This is the first game I have ever seen that actually allows you to raze structures to the ground and uses physics for the explosions and for the structural intergrity. It's awesome to see a building stand on one leg for a few seconds before it crumbles to the ground. The story is pretty good and there are a ton of missions available (~100). The optional missions become really repetitive so I stopped after doing about half of them. There are tons of collectibles to find as well, including mining ore locations, finding radio tags and destroying propaganda. Overall, I was able to find all the collectibles, beat the game and the DLC in about 30 hours and when you're blowing stuff up it's a ton of fun! Only negatives I can complain about is the weather/fog is way too thick sometimes impairing the player's vision and the enemy is able to shoot you through it with no issue and near the later half of the game everything feels pretty repetitive driving from point A to point B and doing the same thing over: do the same type of missions to reduce the control of the sector, blow stuff up and then do the story missions to free the sector. If you're looking for a game just to blow stuff up or wanting to try a Red Faction game, then look no further this is the game to get! Lastly, I need to mention the soundtrack in this game is awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really fun sandbox with a destruction physics system that's pretty impressive even in 2017. Simply going around and demolishing buildings with a sledgehammer for no reason whatever is a blast. The actual missions are good too though. Some of the weapons and gadgets you acquire by the end are very creative and fun to use. For example: the pulse rifle (which makes a return from the original Red Faction) which allows you to see and shoo through walls, a gun that can literally disintegrate matter, and even a jetpack. It's not a flawless game. I have some issues with it. For example, it allows you to carry only four weapons at any one time. Ideally I would've liked to have all my arsenal available at all times for a game like this. Or it could've allowed you to purchase additional slots at least. Instead you have to look for these ammo crates which are scattered around the map. They allow you to switch weapons and refill some of your ammo of which you can't carry all that much. Also, checkpoints are rather sparse. More often than not if you fail a mission you have to start all the way from the beginning of it. Some of the missions include lengthy shootouts or driving sections and it can be frustrating to have to redo the entire thing. It is an older game but is not old enough for it to be an excuse. To be fair, I played on hard so these last issue may not be so pronounced on lower difficulties. In fact, I found it a bit more difficult than I would've liked but I didn't want to change the difficulty midway through the campaign. Not impossible or anything but I died quite a lot in the second half. It's the kind of game in which I just want to feel like a badass and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up and not worry too much about dying. If I ever replay it I'll play on medium.The driving is fine. Nothing special about it but it works well enough. The variety of vehicles is not too great but they feel distinct from one another. The damage system on them is not very impressive considering what you can do to buildings. Every now and again you can get your hands on a mech (or walker or whatever) and those a lots of fun. Unfortunately, you only seem to be able to get them during specific missions.Graphically, it looks good considering its age. With everything maxed out in 1080p it is still pleasing to the eye. The performance was locked at 60fps 90% of the time but, unfortunately, I got some drops during more intensive scenes. Particularly when you are standing next to a huge collapsing building with lots of particle effects around you. When you walk right through a building with a mech, for instance, it will slow down noticeably. I'm talking low 50's to mid 40's at the worst and only rarely. I have a 1060 6GB and i5-6500 and both of them were running at around 35-40% capacity. It's definitely not my hardware. The game doesn't seem to be able to take advantage of the extra power you throw at it during these more intense moments.Overall, like a said, it's a very good game and I had loads of fun with it. Highly recommended if you like wreaking havoc in open world games. I'm surprise that they haven't made a newer game recently or that anyone hasn't picked up the idea of a huge open world game with destructible environments. ",106,26,1,10,0,1,3

												Red Faction Guerrilla is a really good action game with an enormous multiplayer mode. The sound effects aren’t that smashing, but the explosive graphic effects are absolutely bombastic!The pacing is damned smart, the difficulty curve pitch perfect. Surprisingly, it has a lot of life to it. For a game built largely around the “blow sh*t up” gimmick, you’d expect it to lose steam after a few hours, but Guerrilla stays entertaining through most of the game, only tapering slightly toward the conclusion.

												Never liked it when it came out and for the life of me I do not know why. It's your standard sandbox game. Few main missions, few more side missions, and a butt ton of collectables. The side missions aren't a drag here though as in most of them your just blowing stuff up which is always a win in my book. The collectables aren't important it's just more salvage and you can get that from anything so it's not essential you run around and get all 500 of them which is also a win. It's just a fun blow everything up game. The only downsides is that pretty much every gun for killing people is pretty much useless, I found myself brutally beating people to death with the hammer most of the time. That and the story, or lack there of. All the missions are just a little video briefing, there's very few actual cutscenes so most of the time it doesn't feel like there's actually anything going on. But you get to drive a big mech thingy through stuff and demolish everything in sight and live out that God complex you've got going on so it's all good... You only get to do that once though.

												I am a fan of the Red Faction series. Red Faction  Guerrilla is my favorite Red Faction game. I got this when it came out on Xbox and Loved it, played it tons, and I am glad that I get to play it a little bit on Steam this weekend. Ill probably only play a little, at least enough to be able to review it. There are tons of free weekends going this weekend.   I wanted to let you people on Steam know how great a game this is. Its got one of the best destruction engines I have ever seen. its got a great story. Its open world and its got multiplayer. Really I cant think of anything I don't like about this game. Loved it at launch and I still love it now.  I definitely recommend this game, and this series as a whole.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												YOU BLABBED BIRDMEAT! YOU BLABBED ABOUT MARS! Hi this is me, Birdmeat, and here is me making a recommendation for Red Faction. Its a third person shooter about how THE EVIL EARTH FEDERATION opresses the GOOD PEOPLE OF MARS. You become Space Che Guevara by sabotaging Federation buildings, wich is great fun. You have an absurdly powerful hammer and remote charges at first, and more exotic weapons later, but to be fair, nothing beats the hammer and the charges...except for a car..loaded with charges..launched into the building with the hammer. The destruction physics are really nice, even tough buildings manage to stand upright with only 1 supportive wall for a long time, but I guess that can be blamed on MARS GRAVITY. Our hero, Mr. Alec Mason person, is rather boring. All characters are, actualy. The story is meh, it kept me playing as you unlock new areas that way, but it is really a generic revenge-rebelion story.Ha ha ha, you think this is the real recommendation...?..IT IS!

												First of all, I want to say that the destruction in this game is extremely satisfying, just having the ability to bring any building to rubble usually means everything is getting demolished, either with explosives or when they run out, your sledgehammer.But this game really doesn't benefit being an open-world game. Sure, you get to run around playing terrorist on Mars blowing up any building in your path, then having to evade the authorities which is simply achieved by just driving to the closest safehouse. Mostly what happens though is you drive for a few minutes to get to something worth destroying, blow up things until you're out of explosives which then means driving all the way back to the safehouse to restock, and then driving all the way back to something to destroy and repeat which tends towards extremely tedious gameplay, even if the destroying part is incredibly fun.Driving around the world just feels empty (sure, it's Mars) but there is literally nothing worth driving to other than indicators on the map, there's nothing to really discover. No particular area feels like it is fully fleshed out and designed to the level it would have, had it not been open world. These problems aren't unique to Guerrilla as many open world games fail to get this right but it doesn't really try to do anything new in the open-world space either.For me, the game would have been much more enjoyable just dropping you into an area with your goal and blowing your way to it using the fantastic destruction engine rather than the tedium of constantly having to drive get more ammo, or your next mission, killing the flow of the game.

The game looks and plays beautifully now.  Less GFWL is a good thing for everyone.You get to blow up buildings, and any poor earth defense soldier in the way.  You get to use a sledgehammer that's so strong it can knock down walls.  And yes, you can use it on poor sap soldiers and watch them fly.  See that soldier hiding behind cover? nothing a satchel charge that will bring down the entire wall the soldier is cowering behind can't fix.  Fun game, you get to blow up entire buildings or wade through them like paper machete in a giant mech.  Fun, fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed destroying stuff in this game.  Often, I would stop playing the campaign for hours and just destroy as many things as possible with a sledgehammer.  It sounds silly, but it's obessively fun.  Story itself is so-so and there isn't really any serious drama involved except maybe in some spooky places in the middle of the game in the desert.  Controls took a little getting used to - driving can be difficult if you are not good a driving games.  And there is a TON of driving.  You can be sneaky or guns a blazing - I usually played it safe with sneaking but at a certain point it really works against you.  Well times smash and grabs did best.  I'd say a medium sized chunk of the game is a grind, but it's got it's fun moments with the sheer destruction chaos.   Last level was a bit confusing as I often got to the end, but got stuck inside the final 'thingee"" somehow.  Maybe it was a controller issue.  Got this in a bundle and don't regret it at all.  Don't expect much story line, though.			",1011,387,22,98,38,6,71

												At its best, Guerilla offers white-knuckle action and ridiculous spectacle on par with Just Cause 2, but with better vehicle handling and cooler weapons. At its worst, it offers a lot of unnecessary sandboxing and nags you about side-missions you have no interest in pursuing.Guerilla has a lot going for it but would benefit greatly if it ditched the sandboxing for a more heavily curated single-player experience that cuts down on travel times and boring side-mission grinds in favor of the huge spectacular missions it often does well.

												This game is so good and so cheap, every time it's on sale I buy gift copies for everyone I know. It's also the only game I've happily bought on or near release day at full price for two systems (PS3 and PC), and willingly suffered GFWL for. About 60% of my hours on this game are on PS3 and 39% on a non-steam retail PC copy, so this is probably my most played game ever.If you're looking for story, stealth, or graphical fidelity, you'll probably be left unsatisfied, but this game absolutely nails gameplay, gameplay as metaphor, atmosphere and iconic imagery with a sledgehammer. The sledgehammer is absolutely the icon of this game, you really feel the crushing oppression in a ragged-edge backwater off-world colony in the quiet moments, and like an outgunned, outnumbered maniac at the end of his rope tearing apart a whole army at its foundations in the chaotic ones (even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI contributes to this feeling), and above all, between the bouncy vehicles, tactile destruction, responsive gunplay, hugely varied weapons and swarms of enemies, the gameplay is just flat-out FUN.The multiplayer is endless fun when you can actually get a game, which is sadly very hard to do these days, but if you try on Wednesdays and Sundays and suffer GFWL, you can usually get a couple of rounds in.Can't recommend enough.

												Red Faction Guerrilla has to be the best RF since the first game!The storyline is misable you balance with a mix of great missions and tedoius missions together. So there not much to say about the storyline, played past Red Faction games? yeah? they you already know.Graphics are admirable, not the best you will ever see but still a nice looking game overall. Game run smooth and shadows, lighting and terrian are simple yet nice to look at.Gameplay is when RFG really come into its own. Okay i admit it's a to a degree a generic 3rd person shooter but honestly its feels great to play. The largest selling point is the destrutability. I've completed this game countless times soley on the destruction factor. Watching a building topple reaslstcly really get the jucies flowing!Pro's- Epic destruction!- MORE DESTRUCTION!Con's- Some tedious missions- Side missions are limitedWant the best RF game? get this!- Dean			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A quite under-rated game that is just pure fun and offers exploration combined with destruction. Story wise not the best but just driving around smashing things  with your  sledge just feels great. Open world where every building is destroyable with few exceptions. Highly recommended. 8/10.

												If this was a normal game, then it would be pretty bland. Story I don't care about, no character development, crappy AI. But it has the best destruction in any game i've played. You can literally drive through a building and have it crumble around you. Pick this up on a steam sale, its tons of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Very good multiplayer (lots of modes, flexible settings). Now on Steamworks. After 5 years since its release, it's still fun to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just now got this game on Steam, having some 100 hours on my hard copy, but nonetheless it is an amazing game. It's destruction engine is still all but unmatched, and the ""insane"" difficulty level gives anyone a huge challenge to raid enemy fortifications with the utmost stealth (or I guarantee you will die). It has plenty of ""standard"" (i.e: Pistol, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, etc) weapons, as well as end-game toys to just screw around with. It's also good to occasionally gaze up into the Martian sky...seeing the beautifully rendered Heavens above, with a comet streaking past every so often.Let me talk for a minute about the destruction engine: off the top of my head, there are 2 things that cannot be destroyed in this game: the terrain and those big♥♥♥♥♥towers in the games last stage. Every other building, however, you can destroy essentially brick by brick, with any non-energy weapon (even your fist). The engine also understands that if you take out critical points of a structure, it will fall much easier than just randomly blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.The EDF in this game are also very realistic (on the highest difficulty at least, I haven't played medium or easy in such a long time), as in they behave like police. If you commit a felony and they see you, every one of them in close proximity will fire warning shots and try to ""capture"" you. If you start killing them, they send in reinforcements. If you're just being a big enough♥♥♥♥♥♥about killing them, they send in tanks and even ♥♥♥♥ing gunships (yes, they have an airforce). If you try to hide from them, they search the area for quite a long time, unlike in other games where once you leave their sight you're free to do whatever.However, I'd like to talk for a moment about the hilarity of their pilots and drivers. The EDF will often flip their cars and crash into each other or even drive off a damn cliff when they're pursuing you, and they will often just fly their gunships into tall buildings, mountains, or even each other. It's really ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious and I'd say buy this game just to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the EDF.But aside from that, I 100% recommend this game. Buy it and play it, then let your kids play it, and let their kids play it. This game is really ♥♥♥♥ing underrated. Spread the word of how amazing this game is (but not the GFWL part. That part sucks).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- some parts of morale system- multiplayer (nobody play it now)+/- Guearrila actions (little missions) is fun at start but when you play it more and more, it is the same few kinds again and again+/- physics (mostly for cars, It´s horrible but there´s so many mountains so it is useful)+/- story (in some parts very interesting but in one couple very simple and ordinary)+ Very big positive is destroying system, you can destroy almost everything+ weapons and upgrades+ big map+ robots+ colectable thingsSo, I should start with destroying system, it is wonderful. You can destroy each building with your hammer or explozives. You are member of guerrilla group on mars and you are doing a quickly little missions for them where you have to steal car, save hostages, destroy a building or win a fight etc. But there´s the end of positives. Misions starts be boring and the same, yeah there´re several sector with different textures, houses and cars but the missions are the same and sometimes impossible to done. So, It is fun for few hours, finish the game, maybe collect some collectables (not all, it is impossible like: Ore 0/300 and you didn´t see it on your map only on your minimap when you are close)All in All: 76%			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed destroying stuff in this game.  Often, I would stop playing the campaign for hours and just destroy as many things as possible with a sledgehammer.  It sounds silly, but it's obessively fun.  Story itself is so-so and there isn't really any serious drama involved except maybe in some spooky places in the middle of the game in the desert.  Controls took a little getting used to - driving can be difficult if you are not good a driving games.  And there is a TON of driving.  You can be sneaky or guns a blazing - I usually played it safe with sneaking but at a certain point it really works against you.  Well times smash and grabs did best.  I'd say a medium sized chunk of the game is a grind, but it's got it's fun moments with the sheer destruction chaos.   Last level was a bit confusing as I often got to the end, but got stuck inside the final 'thingee"" somehow.  Maybe it was a controller issue.  Got this in a bundle and don't regret it at all.  Don't expect much story line, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you ever fancied playing ""Total Recal"" simulator then grab Red Faction Guerrilla; the recent patch has fixed the DX issues which affected some users and the semi mission vs semi sandbox approach works well. Also the game features one hell of a physics engine when it comes to blowing things up, shooting things up or smashing things up with a big hammer. Liberating sectors is fun and rewarding in a ""freedom fighter"" sort of way but a lot of your NPC buddies will give their pixels for the cause especially in the later sectors. So as our much beloved but sadly aged Austrain actor once said repeatedly; ""get your♥♥♥♥♥to mars... get your♥♥♥♥♥to mars.... get your♥♥♥♥♥to mars....""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction: Guerrilla is a somewhat open-world FPS with RPG elements. While you have freedom to move about, you cannot access the next area until you've completed certain objectives. Overall, the graphics are great, and the game-play, handling and general game progression is good. You play a character who leads a rebellion, but the planets governing body is too large and your resources are too little. The only way to put a dent in their regime, is to use guerrilla tactics. You infiltrate an area, do as much damage as you can, and then retreat to either another location, or come back to the same place, but only once the guards disperse. You cannot take on a whole encampment or patrol detachment and stay fighting for prolonged periods of time, so for all the fan-boys who like to rampage unchecked, this is not the game for you. If you enjoy a mix of stealth, strategy and abrupt yet massive destruction and carnage with brief pauses in between for tactics, then you'll love this game. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having 30 years of video game experience under my belt, I can tell you with an extreme level of certainty, this game is unique and enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: Recent update fixes most problems, definitely worth playing the game now.OK, kids gather round - it's time for a story. You'll like this story. I call it 'XenoPB's Wonderful Adventure with RF:G and GFWL.' It's an emotional story filled with ups and downs that teaches us that in life, ultimately the only one that wins is Gaben.XenoPB liked RF:G, in fact back when he played it on the PS3 he would have been tempted to list it in his top 10 favourite games. Xeno was really looking forward to getting the game on PC and being able to play at 1080p and 60fps. But alas there was one who stood in his path, one who would force Xeno to write an angry and negative review, one who went by the name of 'GFWL.' The young lad, Xeno knew of GFWL, but was confident that he could triumph such a foe, so with this confidence he had in himself, he decided it was an excellent idea to purchase RF:G when Steam tempted him with an seductive 90% off sale. RF:G had now been added to Xeno's Steam Library. It looked happy and at home, nestled between Psychonauts and Red Orchestra 2  as it downloaded. After a short while, the download finished and RF:G quickly installed. RF:G booted up; the THQ logo appeared on screen, it soon faded away and was replaced my some more logos. The logos were closely followed by a loading screen and then, at long last, the main menu. Out of habit, Xeno immediately sped in the direction of the options menu and adjusted it to his needs. It was at this point his enthusiasm began to fade away. Xeno knew that in order to save his game, he would be required to log into GFWL. ""No problem,"" he thought, confidently as he clicked on the large icon in the bottom left corner saying 'LIVE.' The 'LIVE' icon transported Xeno to what is commonly referred to as the 'GFWL login screen.' He thought back to GTA4 and how this same login screen had appeared then. It was at this point that Xeno entered his login details, while grunting in disgust at the very sight of GFWL. It worked; Xeno logged into GFWL. Now another screen had appeared. GFWL was asking for a product key for RF:G. With a quick tap of shift and tab, Xeno located his product key and entered it into the space allocated.The end was in sight. Xeno gave a sigh of relief, confident that soon he would be able to play RF:G and save his progress after doing so. But it appeared that he was not destined to do so. GFWL looked in Xeno's direction and with an insultingly voiced ""nope,"" GFWL displayed a third message to him: ""Your Windows Live ID is locked. To check your Windows Live ID, go to http://account.live.com."" Xeno collapsed to the floor, clutching his chest and gasping for breath. ""No,"" he repeated, each one louder and angrier than the last. Slowly rising into his chair, determined to play RF:G, Xeno closed the game down and visited the accursed, 'http://account.live.com'.http://account.live.com looked at Xeno with a hostile gaze, one that said ""You will not leave here alive."" He was told to attempt to log in to GFWL. Xeno did as http://account.live.com commanded, he even typed out the distorted letters he saw in a small box, proving that he was in fact, a real person. http://account.live.com informed Xeno that he had entered the incorrect login details. Xeno protested. He was certain he was correct, he would bet anything on it! He was going to prove http://account.live.com wrong! Xeno entered the login details and typed out the letters a few times, each time being told he was incorrect. Too blinded by ignorance to simply change his password or something, Xeno decided that the best course of action in this case was to make a second account for GFWL, so that next time he would know the correct login details and be able to prove http://account.live.com wrong. It took a few minutes for Xeno to make his new account. Now was the time to boot up RF:G for a second time and show GFWL who the true champion will be in the end. But once again, Xeno could not help but feel he was not destined to play RF:G. The THQ logo appeared on the monitor, RF:G was booting up. But there was a problem. THQ wasn't fading away like it usually did, it just stayed there, motionless. The game had crashed. After his first failed attempt, numerous times, Xeno attempted to launch RF:G again, but it crashed each time. His m8, bLuE, taunted him from their Steam Chat, finding Xeno's pain amusing somehow. After 15 or so attempts to launch the game without ever attempting to search online for a solution, due to Xeno being thick, RF:G finally caved in and allowed passage to the main menu. The 'LIVE' icon was still in the bottom left corner. It got clicked. The GFWL login screen appeared once again. Now an mlg pro at logging in to things, Xeno entered his login details and was once again asked for his product key. Xeno entered the product key a second time.  A different message appeared this time. It told Xeno that the product key he entered was already locked to his first GFWL account. Promptly, Xeno opened the Steam Chat with bLuE and typed ""Fudge this.""After being knocked down numerous times by his foe, Xeno accepted GFWL's terms and agreed to play RF:G in offline mode, without save files. The opening cutscene began to play, but armed with the knowledge from his first playthrough on console that the story was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible, Xeno wisely chose to skip it. Now he was in the game, at long last. Xeno was standing on a hill with his in-game brother and looking down on some sort of enclosed area. The textures on some objects were flickering violently, Xeno tried to ignore it, he wouldn't let such an issue stop him from destroying colossal structures with his magical wonder hammer. With a firm press of 'W,' Xeno instructed his character to walk down the hill, but even with GFWL conquered, he was not destined to play RF:G. Before the bottom of the hill was reached, RF:G crashed again.Xeno's face was emotionless. His soul had been crushed. Out of only raw instinct, he opened up his Steam Chat with bLuE and once again proclaimed: ""Fudge this.""The End			",136,20,0,9,12,1,7

 Red Faction Guerrilla Review === Rating: 7.0 / 10 - An average open world TPS / Action game ===Disclaimer:I have completed this game before on a not steam version, then got on Steam with some bundle and played it again with some modding involved. I did not complete the main campaign on this version because the custom modding i made broke a main quest, but i completed the game already. Just to inform you guys this is a proper review like always.=== Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Everything can be destroyed, with accurate physics simulation, one of the best destructibilities ever seen in gaming even in 2016+ Fun gameplay+ Many upgrades to unlock + Many side quests, albeit repetitive in some cases, some others are very varied and challenging, depends on the type + Colonial mars is an original and interesting setting+ Good AI of enemies and allies+ Good variety of weapons and gadgets - Cons - - Short. On max difficulty, doing all the side missions and main quest, top longevity is 16 hours- Unrealistic damage on people. You can fall down a mountain by rolling all the way down and be fine or with some minor damage afterwards. Same for all characters.- Graphics quality, especially on textures, shaders and models, is pretty bad even for the year this title came out.- Storyline and main characters are stereotyped and anonymous, they mostly will not involve the player=== Conclusions Mostly, RFG is good just for its gameplay based on awesome destruction. All other aspects are much sub-par in terms of quality, but the gameplay is the real deal and is realized perfectly.If you do not care about some pretty bad graphics, story, characters and some locations but just care about having fun and good gameplay, this is for you.

												Red Faction: Guerrilla is a somewhat open-world FPS with RPG elements. While you have freedom to move about, you cannot access the next area until you've completed certain objectives. Overall, the graphics are great, and the game-play, handling and general game progression is good. You play a character who leads a rebellion, but the planets governing body is too large and your resources are too little. The only way to put a dent in their regime, is to use guerrilla tactics. You infiltrate an area, do as much damage as you can, and then retreat to either another location, or come back to the same place, but only once the guards disperse. You cannot take on a whole encampment or patrol detachment and stay fighting for prolonged periods of time, so for all the fan-boys who like to rampage unchecked, this is not the game for you. If you enjoy a mix of stealth, strategy and abrupt yet massive destruction and carnage with brief pauses in between for tactics, then you'll love this game. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having 30 years of video game experience under my belt, I can tell you with an extreme level of certainty, this game is unique and enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Smash buildings and hit people in the face with a sledgehammer.  Whats not to like.On a more serious note the damage model makes the game.  There's a few issues with the graphics under DX10 but these can be fixed by running in DX9 mode.   There's a few threads on how to fix DX10, but none worked for me with the remaining suggestions covering all sorts of things with the potential to break your system.  TBH not worth the effort and DX9 mode only means a few extra graphical effects are missing, nothing major.  The selection of weapons in the game complement the smash-it-up feel and the AI's acceptable.  Played through till the end and enjoyed the lot.  One thing to note a lot of the screenshots on the store didn't really seem to accurately show what single player is like (I never once saw a flying vehicle close up like the screenshots show).The only real issue is it is a GFWL title with all the baggage thats brings.  Personally had no problems with this but many others seem to have, and of course there's no guarantee how much longer GFWL will remain around so play it while you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you enjoy Halo, Gears of War, Unreal Tournament, Counterstrike, Team fortress, I highly recommend this game.4.) The Steam Edition removes the need for Games for Windows Live.All in all this is one gem of a game. I played for over 400+ hours on the ps3 version of this game when it was first released 4 years ago.

												'GTA' meets 'Demolition man' on Mars. Guerilla delivers on the post-apocaliptic/Mad Max'esque scenario despite some lack of variety in the secondary quests. It packs a good 30 hours of destruction to blow some steam on weekends regardless of some occasionnaly frustrating game mechanics (enemies seem to pop up randomly out of nowhere in most high alert situations, and some of the stronger buildings will hold on forever on indestructible structures). Although the tension from the original game is missing as well as the solid FPS element, driving tanks and heavy mechs makes it up for the lack of subtlety. And the steam edition has an extra campaign where you get to be a marauder.If Volition teamed up with id, they would make the perfect RAGE 2 game we all deserve.			",218,26,0,17,5,0,12

												Red Faction Guerrilla is an amazing game by Volition, and they decided to make a sandbox game as opposed to a linear first person shooter.What Guerrilla brings to the table is it's primary selling point, it's destruction system. Which is so well implemented I'm extremely surprised it was never really focused on in games since then. The game allows you to destroy literally every building in the game with it's revolutionary destruction mechanic. All the buildings are built with foundations, levels and fall apart due to the strain of gravity. So it takes a great deal of strategy inorder to destroy a building using as minimal resources as possible. Indeed much of the mission structure and sidequests in the game revolve entirely around the destruction mechanic. Add to that it has an engaging world to explore. Full of little niche references to the original while maintaining a totally different stylistic design. There are of course elements from other games like cars and firefights but it pales in comparison to the well incorporated destruction mechanic. Believe me, once you destroy your first building you will go on an odyssey to return Mars back to a desolate wasteland.Thankfully RFG has had Games For Windows Live patched out. So now you can play it and it's multiplayer properly. I can't recommend this game enough.

												God yes I recommend this game!This is perhaps the most definitive -- for me -- example of ""bubble wrap popping fun.""  It's not deep, but it's well balanced as a shooter and it's just oodles of fun with how much you can destroy.  Destroy, destroy, destroy.  It's just plain fun.It's mindless in most ways, so if you're looking for an epic story this is not it.  It's also not a brand spanking new game: I had it on the PS3 in 2009 or so, and played it to completion then.That said, the graphics get the job done, and it doesn't feel dated to me at all.  The shift to the PC format is a huge step up over the console version I previously played.  I usually play shooters on the PC anyway, so this just feels more natural.Two examples from my previous playthrough that really stand out to me to this day:1. There was this big armored fortress in I think the second sector.  The thing was enormous, had all sorts of vehicles, guys on towers, you name it.  I spent hours going around the thing accomplishing other missions, and then finally decided I wanted to crack that nut.  I must have tried it 30 different ways, but finally I deduced a weak spot, breached the wall, set charges, went through absolute chaos, stole an enemy vehicle, caused more chaos, and somehow escaped.  Goodbye, giant fortress!  And the game remembers; it's one way to progress in the game, with these sorts of optional ""side quests"" (for lack of a better term.2. The other thing that really stuck out to me was in one of the last sectors, maybe 5 or 6.  It was a more dangerous area, and really hilly and comparably complicated to navigate around.  My mission was to assssinate some corrupt businessman who was on the sixth floor of some building.  He was up there having a meeting, and would be exiting to I believe a gunship soon.  So, my mission is to kill him -- but how?  Some people would go in the building, make their way through carefully, then take out the guy and escape.  Others would prepare an ambush, wait for him, and then spring a trap at the last second before he could get to his gunship.  Me?  I figured out what part of the building he was in, shot out a window semi-quietly, and then launched one of the overly-massive rockets in through the window, knocking out about a quarter of the building through several floors.  Didn't kill the guy, but suddenly I had line of sight on him six floors up, and I took him out.  It was kind of a lucky break in most respects, it would be hard to duplicate.But being able to pull off lucky breaks like that is what makes this game so darn fun.  There isn't one path to completing a lot of the missions because you can carve your way through the buildings and obstacles how you see fit (but not the terrain).  That's just bloody fun.It's not a game that I feel a constant need to play, or will come back to constantly.  But it is very much one that I enjoy, and occasionally will come back to for a romping good time destroying everything I see before me.  One of the more tactile shooters in years.

												If this game had no geomod destruction physics then it would still be a fairly decent, although you can tell their entire budget for voice actors was spent on Troy Baker. That said, the structural damage physics in this game are unrivaled to this day. I have spent years of my life searching for a game that has something close to geomod, but don't waste your time like i did. Just buy this game 1000 times so we can get a proper sequal by the new publisher. Don't bother with armageddon either, but do buy that 1000 times as well to help fund guerrilla 2. Just don't waste your time playing it, play Guerrilla instead.			",101,3,0,8,3,0,3

												I'm going to make this a TL;DR review for those who aren't into lengthy reviews:-Story free roam mode (and seperate included DLC free roam level)-Online VS mode--Wrecking Crew mode (destroy as much as you can in the time given)-Large amounts of destruction-Upgradeable weapons-Includes DLC from console-No more Games for WIndows Live✓ THQ Nordic is awesome and still updates this older game even though they could of just left it alone after they bought the rights to it from the original THQ.To sum it up, if a third person shooter that has an amazing destruction engine sounds good to you, you can't go wrong with this game. It goes 75% off on sales pretty often as well.			",95,7,6,9,5,0,5

												So here's my review of Red Faction: Guerilla;I've played this game aprox. 23 hours, finished the main game (and side quests).I must say that I really enjoyed this, you can just run around smash barrels at your enemies and make them explode, or you can smash them with a hammer so they'll fly away 10ft, at first I really had to get used to the style, I am normally not a big fan of sci-fi but, now I am!Pro's:Best. Pshysics.. EverInteractive open worldUpgrade'sA lot of gameplayGreat gameplay!Con's:When you die in a quest, there's about 80% chance that you will have to restart the whole thing, yay! -_-They could've made more changes in the environment, it is mainly just 1 kind of environment but with weather changes (I know it's on Mars, but still)!!YOU CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT SIGNING INTO WINDOWS LIVE!!And that's about it, I do recommend this game, but.. i've heard something about Windows Live Games support is going down and since you can't play offline, ermmm you wont be able to play the game.Other than that 7.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I love the storyline and if you ever wanted to wreck something, now you can! You actually have to destroy buildings, as the trailer says, to free Mars from the Earth Defense Force.The gameplay is various and fun, and there are a lot of different weapons and veichles to drive. I absolutely raccomend this game. Buy it. You'll soon realize that you've spent your money right.			",125,5,4,5,8,0,12

												This was the second game I've played from the Red Faction franchise, right after the first Red Faction. They promised me destructibel environment, I got destructible environment, and I don't need an atomic reactor to run the game on. Tho sometimes it's a bit clunky, and you can break physics, but overall, destroying a building with only a big♥♥♥♥♥hammer is really fun. And the better your hammer is, the more fun it becomes.Graphics are a'rite. You are on Mars, so it's mostly red. Gives a great atmosphere, so it suits the game well. Sounds are good. Voice actors gave a good and believable act, ambient sounds are cool. Again, suits the atmosphere of the game.Story is while not the strongest, it gives a theme to why you wreck♥♥♥♥♥♥and have fun. You are the member of the Red Faction, a guerrilla movement on the planet Mars fightning against the Earth Defense Forces, or EDF. You have to clear each region before you can advance to the next to liberate them too. There are some storyline missions, but most of them are kind of fillers - destroy a building, ride shotgun for a crazy Red Faction member, bring a car back to the safehouse in a given timeframe, attack a building, defend a building. Thankfully they are varied, so you don't get bored, and not all of them are necessary to liberate an area. With every mission, EDF's presence in the area is weakened, and in the end, usually there's a mission where they retreat to the other area, and the one you've been in is freed. The final battle and the ending is again, not the best, but is really satifying. Gameplay is where it shines. You can destroy basically EVERYTHING. And you have the tools for it. You smach things with your hammer. You explode things with rocket launchers. You have disc-launcher that shoots razorblades. You have a huge arc welder. And then, the best, the nano-forge. It basically melts ANYTHING it comes into contact with. Vehicles, personnel, building, what you want. Hit the thin spot of an airplane, and laugh while you watch it drop to the ground with a huge KABOOM. Other weapons include assault rifles, shotguns, the usual stuff. Most of them have upgrades too. There are a bunch of accessories in the game, like the warp to safehouse (good when you don't want to walk or drive), or the jump-pack. They are useful, but usually being fun is what matters. You can drive some vehicles, ranging from dumpster trucks to rocket launching tanks. Driving is sometimes tricky, and as well defined as in GTA (so to say, not the best), but then again, it's fun. And this is what this game really is: fun. It keeps you entertained, especially if you don't fail some of the missions for like 5-6 times like me. I'm glad I got the Red Faction bundle some time ago, as Guerrilla is one of the most entertaining and fun games I've played in the recent years. A big thumbs up, we can only hope more of this.

												Still the best destruction physics in a game. It's what RF:G does best. Story, missions, shooting mechanics, and AI are all acceptable but rather simple and have flaws. Tearing down structures never gets old, but everything else becomes repetitive by the end-game. Repetitiveness is a rather common problem among the sandbox genre though, so take it with a grain of salt. Just watch some gameplay videos and you'll know whether or not you'd find RF:G a fun time sink worth your money.There is competitive multiplayer, by the way. And mods too. The Games for Windows Live crap has been completely replaced with Steam integration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(edit at the bottom 23/06/15)This game might be my favourite of the serie...The missions are pretty standard but still enjoable but the real fun comes in with the open world aspect,every building is destroyable and the weapons they give you to do the job are great, there are a series of jobs and side-missions that go from defending buildings to blow up strategical points or steal military veichles.There are some bugs here and there but none of them are game-breaking, the only downside of this game is that it uses Games For Windows Live, wich we all know is kind of a failed project...I suggest getting this game even at full price(10$) and definetly a insta-buy if discounted. EDIT:Now they got rid of the GFWL nonsense and made a steam version wich solves any saving problems! Right now i definetly recommend this great game, i suggest you get the ""Protracted Rebellion"" mod, i finished the game with it and it makes it more challenging and far more realistic, no more 1 man army and unlimited destruction, I think it really adds to the game!

												Red Faction: Guerilla takes all the rules of PC game aging and hurls them ten stories out the window. Originally released in late 2009, not only has RFG retained the crown of best destruction in a video game, it's still receiving content updates to this day (Thanks, Nordic!). GFWL has long since been banished and replaced with Steamworks, cementing its place in my gaming group's multiplayer rotation.You owe it to yourself to at least try this game. You know you want to.

												The story is paper thin and laughable, just like the walls of buildings you'll be knocking down with your Mjolnir-like sledgehammer.  But the combat and physics are top notch; it's SO satisfying when enemies are entrenched in buildings to just destroy the entire building instead of carefully sneaking through each corridor and hallway.  The campaign is long and varied and I've found myself setting RF:G down for several months, then reinstalling it just to play through again and laugh in delight as I set elaborate traps up for the security forces foolish enough to mess with me.  There's a few failings in the game, but I feel nitpicky pointing them out.  Sometimes the AI is dumb.  The in-game grass has a laughably short drawing distance, making it look like the ground is kind of boiling while you drive across it.  And while the missions are varied, some are just annoyingly long with frustratingly few checkpoints.  Overall, it's a great game.  Fun, mindless destruction on a huge map.			",294,111,4,36,19,3,37

												When this game first came out, I was skeptical to say the least.  ""Oh great,"" I thought, ""they're making a GTA clone set on Mars and slapping the Red Faction brand on it.  This is going to be bad."" Well... I was half right at least.  You can definitely call it ""Grand Theft Mars"", but it is anything but bad.To put it bluntly, the gameplay on this is just addictive.  I cannot count how many hours I've spent ""reappropriating"" colonist vehicles for ""the cause"" then driving them into buildings, through buildings, over people, and so on.  GeoMod + buildings + magic hammer that breaks everything is a winning formula.  You can also replace the hammer with plastic explosives, rocket launchers, cars, tanks, tank weaponry, the bodies of dudes you just hit with your hammer (yes that will take down walls).  RF:G captures the raw destructive joy that was present in the first Red Faction and scales it up in a major way.To be clear, this is a major shift in the Red Faction brand from the previous two titles.  While there is a relatively linear plot, the gameplay is anything but.  This is very much a sandbox title, and yet the game does not suffer for it. On the contrary, the huge number of opportunities for destruction have never been so well presented.  If anything, I would argue that a sandbox game is the ideal way that the destruction-oriented GeoMod engine should be presented.There are, of course, downsides.  The ability to GeoMod the terrain is completely gone for one, though I can see how that would be too complex (and resource intensive) for a game area of this scale.  A number of the weapons are somewhat lacking, particularly the traditional bullet weapons which are only really useful at all due to the never-ending waves of enemy mooks carrying them.  The biggest problem though?  Games For Windows Live, or more specifically the horrible incompatibilities it can cause.  I can barely get this game to not crash outright on Windows 7.  I highly recommend you use a GFWL alternative if at all possible.If you take anything away from this review, it should be this: until the game started crashing on me 100% of the time, RF:G was always installed on my computer.  While it does have a long and rewarding campaign mode, it's also perfect if you just want to kill some time by causing mass destruction and chaos.  I'd not play the game for months, then pick it up for an hour or two just to destroy some buildings, cars, tanks, so on and so forth.  This is an incredibly fun game, and I'd argue the best in the series.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												Note: Games for Windows Live (GFWL) is GONE; it has been completely patched out of the game.Red Faction: Guerrilla is a satisfying mix of an open-world Mars, GTA driving elements, relatively basic shooting mechanics, some unique weapons, and a rather standard rebel-against-the-oppressive-government / corporation story. Recommended for its tough enemies and unique building-destruction mechanics.Mars is really large, even if it might not look that way on the map. There are no bodies of water, despite the terraforming; it is a dusty, rocky, generally red landscape (as you might expect), but generally well-detailed (if occasionally low-res). Vehicles have some decent variety, and the driving is generally entertaining - which is good, since you'll be doing a lot of it. When not driving, you'll be shooting. The shooting mechanics work well enough (though iron sights are strangely bound to F, while melee is right-click – the reverse of most other games I've played). The weapons themselves, while not as insanely fun to use as those in Red Faction: Armageddon, are still great: the Nano rifle instantly vaporizes ANYTHING (including steel beams), but ammo is limited, so pick your shots. The Grinder shoots throwing stars. The Arc Welder can handle mobs with ease, hitting around 8 or 10 enemies at once with a chained electrical field.The enemy AI and weapon damage provides plenty of challenge for even the most mundane task. Unless you find and seize an actual tank (which is possible!), you won't be able to “tank” anything. Playing Rambo style will get you killed fast. If you like to camp and shoot enemies, you'll die just as fast; enemy AI flanks quickly, and does a lot of damage, even if you acquired armor upgrades. The best part is the destructible buildings. If there's a sniper on a roof I could (of course) try shooting him from a distance. Or I could just shoot the beams under him, collapsing the building and killing him instantly. Not everything is completely satisfying. Vehicles are floaty and hard to control. They're manageable during most missions, but challenge changes to annoyance in several of the timed “drive-this-vehicle-back-to-the-safehouse” missions. This would be a minor nit-pick if driving weren't such a large part of the game. Save points don't save your location in the world; they save you to the nearest safe-house. The constant red landscape is cool and all, but it can get visually boring after a while. Red Faction: Guerrilla is a great game that gives you some trucks, some guns, and tells you to go free the planet from the evil forces controlling it. One of the few games to combine challenging enemies with an open world. Worth noting is that when THQ went bankrupt, the Red Faction franchise and IP was purchased by Nordic Games. Nordic has undertaken extensive patching in recent months, removing Games For Windows Live (replacing it with Steamworks), adding DirectX 11 support (DX9 mode still exists for those who need it), stability patches, a field-of-view setting, new multiplayer maps, the Reconstructor from Red Faction: Armageddon, and many more. At this time, Nordic is very interested in maintaining this franchise, and with developer Volition saying they'd love to do another Red Faction game, we might not have seen the last game of this franchise.

												(Now over 300 hours dumped into console version)Like Grand Theft Auto?How about Mars?Do you experience erotic dreams exclusively about sledgehammers?Do you regularly daydream about firemen destroying your home, or about being a fireman and destroying other people's homes?Welcome to Red Faction Guerrilla. We fight for YOU, and YOUR right to cause senseless and wontan destruction across an entire planet while dressed as a fireman. ENLIST TODAY!Red Faction: Guerrilla is essentually just that; grand theft auto but on mars (making it a literal sandbox game, more or less, depending on if dust counts as sand), with the addition of an engine that allows for buildings to fall apart and get blown apart dynamically. Yes, dynamically; none of that pre-scripted bull$^!* that most games nowadays would hand you, but true and actual dynamic destruction, all across a massive map, all of it saved down to the percentage of the building that is missing. You play as Alec Mason, a mining engineer who only shops at the fireman's goodwill, terrorizing liberating the local populace from the iron grip of the Earth Defence Force, who exclusively hire sociopathic poopheads to enforce their will on the colonists of Mars.They have guns, tanks, cars, and bridges.You have a hammer. You will easily come to prefer your hammer to any stupid bridge any dayThroughout your journey to avoid your inevitable and terrible sequel you are guided and assisted by other red faction members, such as:Samanya Inexplicablybritishface, who builds guns for you. Many guns.Guns that shoot rocketsGuns that shoot lightningGuns that shoot MULTIPLE rocketsGuns that shoot BIG rocketsGuns that shoot sawbladesGuns that shoot EXPLODING sawbladesBut no guns that anyone else can use! Because you're just a special snowflake, I guess (Actually because everyone else is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at mining and can't buy any of itRAAAAAANDY JEEEEENKINSHe drives a car with a rocket launcher on it. You get to aim that rocket launcher because he's too fat to actually get off his car to hop onto the back. FUN SIDE MISSION THOSome crazy ♥♥♥♥♥!You get to drive a car while she tortures someone in it, and then youDRIVE IT INTO THE ♥♥♥♥ING MARINA TRENCHSome old guy who is completely invincible!And many more! (Not really)The game also has a fantastic multiplayer component, ranging from your standard gamemodes (CTF, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, etc) to gamemodes based around destruction, and reconstruction to a hotseat-style local mode where you and friends compete to be the best at LEVELING EVERYTHING. Legit a game everyone should at least have 3 copies ofOld Review:(Over 50 hours dumped into the console version)The best game ever if it didn't have that damned GFWL.			",143,19,5,10,8,3,16

												Pretty fun open world game.  Demolishing things in creative ways is what you do.  There's also lots of driving.  You have remote charges, rocket launchers, mini-black hole bombs,  a gun that disassembles matter on the molecular level, and a sledgehammer.  There's a story about rebellion and oppression and fighting the system - but who cares?  You blow stuff up, you collect the scrap, and you upgrade weapons.  You can also electrocute the crew of a tank, killing them, and then steal their tank.  You do have to pick your battles.  You will get overwhelmed quickly if you spend too much time in one area.  Hit and run is a safe way to play.Once you complete the story you can go back and replay or finish all of the side missions of which there is a good variety.  Some are boring and involve too much driving, but others involve a lot of fun blowing things or piloting big robots.			",249,10,1,36,14,1,42

Now, replace the city with Mars, replace the buildings with cardboard, thin sheet metal, and plastic, give the protagonist nothing but an indestructible hammer, pump him full of steroids, kill his brother, make fun of his mother, sleep with his wife, and let him run loose.This game is actually (but not really) Jeremy Clarkson's favorite game, because it features his favorite tool for any sort of job.10/10 would ground out an entire base with a hammer while being shot at, smashed by girder beams, and ran over by some mad Mars locals(The ""make fun of his mother"" and ""sleep with his wife"" things weren't actually in-game, but it could be.)

												The Revolution goes on, and it picks up speed and power all the way through. Red Faction Guerrilla is perhaps the only game in the series to ever pay attention to as much detail in the environment and the in-game world. It allows you to go and explore it at your will in sandbox.  It might not be exactly GTA in terms of killing anyone who you want, but it gives you a great Revolutionary atmosphere, in fact the entire series has been centered around this topic. The weapons are all big, powerful and generally feel rather effective against the enemy. The ones that you buy and make from salvage (which is the main source of income, the gold on Mars) seem to be a little exagerated but certainly have a very nice concept of a sci-fi world in the future. Also, with the destruction it offfers, I think it's worth a try.			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

												From games I have played I would compare this to Just Cause 2 The Mars version. Just Cause 2 is one of my fav games. I would put this behind JS2 but only because of less interaction between any other characters. A solo cause even though you pick up fighters as you go along good challanging missions. Staying to fight is not always a good idea and knowing when to run and escape is smart and go back when safe to finnish. I found this game a good play and the driving is fun different vehicles handle the Mars terrain good and bad so pick right vehicle. Good game for my collection.

												Pozitívumok:Singleplayer:A pusztítás: A játéknak kifejezetten újító motorja volt régen induláskor. A csak nem földig rombolható objektumok, többnyire épületek elpusztítása a különböző fegyverekkel kifejezetten élvezetes. A fizika persze a földön megszokottaktól eltérő révén, a Marson vagyunk. Ettől függetlenül kifejezetten élvezetes tud lenni Külcsín:Jól néz ki a játék, korához képest kifejezetten tetszetős grafikával rendelkezik, és nem mellékesen kifejezetten jó látványvilága van, már amennyit egy Mars felszínéből ki lehetett hozni. Ötletek:A játék látszik, hogy szeretné a motorját a lehető legjobban kihasználtatni a játékossal. Erre rengeteg lehetőségünk lesz feladatok vagy csak lehetőségek terén. Technológia:Tetszik az a repertoár, amit a játék felsorakoztat. Az alapvető robbantó fegyverektől kezdve a kifinomult nanotechnológiás fegyverig sokrétű és fejleszthető arzenállal rendelkezhetünk és ezt magunknak testre is szabhatunk. AI: Az ellenfelek kifejezetten okosak lettek, de bizonyos helyzetekben még is becsaphatóak. Él a fedezék rendszer, amit előre jelzek érdemes mi magunknak is használni, nem véletlenül helyezkednek az EDF katonái. E mellett, ha harcokba bonyolódunk az ellenállás tagjai, ha éppen véletlenül is jár arra egy, amint tudnak a segítségünkre sietnek. Ilyen helyzet lehet az is, amikor nagy pusztaságban sokáig futunk egyedül, mivel elvesztettük gépjárművünket. Akkor általában odafuvarozik az egyik ellenállás tag és átpasszolja nekünk a volánt. Kifejezetten ötletes szerintem. Kihívások: Na az akad bőven a játékban. Akik eléggé Hardcore playernek mondják magukat, azok az elejétől kezdve odafigyelnek, hogy a játék végére meglegyen a 250 EDF láda elpusztítása, (Amiből többet is raktak le, tehát az se gond, ha elsiklik az ember 1-2 mellett.) a 300 Ore kifarmolása (ebből viszont kereken 300 van a játékban.) és a 36 hanganyag megtalálása. Megéri időt fektetni egyébként bárkinek ezekbe a dolgokba, mert kifejezetten sok Salvage-hez juthatunk általuk, amik kellenek a fegyverek és egyéb dolgok fejlesztéséhez. E mellett magában a játékban a mellék küldetések némelyike kifejezetten nehezen jött össze. Különbnél különb módon igyekeztek kihívások elé állítani az embert már jó értelemben. Utazás:Igen ezt a részét a játéknak külön kiemelném. Egyszerűen látni bizonyos kihívásoknál, ahol egy járművet kell leszállítani valamelyik bázisra, hogy okosan vannak felépítve az útvonalak. A domborzat, a küldetés irányába jelző útvonalat gyakran elterelésnek használták, amire érdemes odafigyelni, mert gyakran a jelzett útvonal hosszabb a kelleténél és ilyenkor élelmesnek kell lenni, hogy megtalálja azokat a lehetőségeket, amiket felhasználhat rövidítésként. Hangulat: A hangulatot, a karakterünk szerepét, mint a gerilla szerepét nagyon könnyen át lehet érezni az ottani viszonyok miatt, és időnként kifejezetten hangulatos volt, amikor győzelmet arattunk egy nehezen bevehető terület felett. Multiplayer:Barátokkal kifejezetten szórakoztató és vicces tud lenni.Pályák/Játékmódok:Kifejezetten sokrétű és változatosra sikerült mind pályák, mind játékmódok tekintetében a multiplayer. Unlocks:Van módod Multiplayeren belül változtatni a kezdő felszerelésed.Negatívumok:Singleplayer:Történet:Kifejezetten gyenge, unalmas, kiszámítható és repetitív lett.Játékmenet:Ha időnként nem csinálna mást az ember, mondjuk egy véletlen event erejéig akkor könnyen rá lehetne unni a repetitív játékmenetre. Pusztíts, utazz, pusztíts, utazz, de az igazság az, ha az ember túl lát ezen a dolgon és próbálja átadni magát a történetnek, akkor mást nem is tudna tenni talán még a valóságban sem, mint ezt itt a játékban. Ugyanakkor...A ""társak"":Nem egyszer kívántam a ""segítségemre"" jövő ""társaim"" halálát... Volt, hogy szemrebbenés nélkül felrobbantottak egy házzal... Volt, hogy tűzharc közepén hátba lőttek nem is egyszer. És segíteni, mint ténylegesen segíteni? Sosem fognak rendesen, sőt a legtöbbször az útban vannak, mert követnek és mennek veled mindenhova, amíg le nem rázod, vagy ""véletlenül"" meg nem ölöd őket. Mindenki csicskása vagy:Nem lehet ezen szépíteni, egyszerűen rád lett bízva a Mars és ennyi. Mindenki más csak dísznek való, kivétel a mellékesen fegyverekben és technológiában minket segítő nő. Na meg egyetlen egyszer a játék vége felé a Marauderek voltak hasznosak. (Mondhatni semleges és még sem teljesen semleges frakció. Őket csíptem a cuccaik miatt eléggé Badass életérzés.) Lényegében pedig minden küldetést egyedül végzel, kivéve akkor, amikor más a sofőr és neked kell tüzelned.Fizika:Igen sajnos akadt, de mondjuk csak ritkán, problémám a fizikával. Különösen akkor, amikor escort küldetéseket kellett csinálni. (Kimenteni egy EDF katonái által őrzött épületből maximum 3 embert.) Ezek az emberek ugyebár sérülnek rendesen, ezzel semmi gond nincs, ha erősen odacsapódsz egy járművel, mondjuk a falnak akkor érthető, ha mondjuk, az egyik ember kizuhan a gépágyú állványból, de akkor meg mi a nyavalya van, amikor egyenes úton MAGÁTÓL meghal a delikvens? Egyszer csak annyit láttam, hogy felkiált és kirepül holtan. Egyenes úton, sehol senki az égvilágon. Az ellenség:Sejthető, hogy bizony eléggé keményen odatudnak csapni, amikor brutális létszámbeli fölénnyel rendelkeznek, és ez bizony gyakran előfordul. A társak ott vannak, de leginkább golyófogónak. Ezért eléggé nehezek tudnak lenni a tűzharcok. SOSE rohanjunk egy tűzharc közepébe, hamar véget ér a pályafutásunk, ha nem tudunk fedezékbe vonulni. Az ellenfél meg kifejezetten ügyes, darál rendesen azzal, amije van. Fegyverek: Nos, a tuningolható fegyverekkel nem volt bajom, de a nem tuningolhatókkal viszont igen. Szükségesek, mert ezek többsége gyalogság ellen van, ami kifejezetten hasznos tud lenni bármikor, viszont a lőszer mennyiség erőteljesen korlátoz. Mindig rohangálni kell a holttestek között további tárakért, mert hamar ki tud fogyni az ember. Multiplayer:Sajnos be kell látni, de a multiplayer halott.Windows Live:Nos, tudjuk, hogy történt vele egy és más, de szükséges ahhoz, hogy tudjon az ember Multiplayert játszani, nem mellékesen a Singleplayerben Achievmenteket kapjon... A lépések a következőek: Mindenképpen kreálni kell egy új profilt. Ezt követően az Xbox.com oldala fog bejönni ahol a Sign in gombbal egy beléptető oldal fog megjelenni. Ott lentebb lehet látni, hogy ha nincs Live profilod, akkor az ott kéken kiemelt szövegben felajánlja a regisztrációra a lehetőséget. Megcsinálod a profilodat, aktiválod az e-mail címedről és utána a játékon belül lehet, párszor újra be kell lépned vele, ha eddigiekben már csináltál offline profilt, de végül érdemes belépni ezzel a fiókkal, így a rendszer érzékeli a játékon belüli teljesítményedet, nem mellékesen tudni fogsz multizni. Könnyedén lehet egyébként, ha vannak barátok, akikkel nyomulhatsz, de egyébként nehézkes a dolog. Nálam például a NAT úgy érzékeli nincs nyitva, aminek hála korlátoltan tudok ""regionálisan"" játszani. Összességében pedig a játékot önmagában tudom ajánlani, a singleplayer a maga gyengeségei mellett még mindig szórakoztató és számomra minden perce megérte már csak a tonnányi pusztítás és zúzás miatt is. :D Viszont ha multiplayer tekintetében venné meg az ember, akkor számolnia kell azzal, hogy kihalt oldalakat fog találni, de ha vannak barátok, velük jó szórakozást nyújthat a multiplayer.

												With Red Faction: Guerrilla, players return to Mars to once more stir up trouble in an open-world game promising unheralded destruction from a third-person perspective. GFWL has been removed and the game has been integrated into Steam - Multiplayer, Achievements and all! Plenty of other games have done destructible environments, but never to this degree. Not only is virtually every man-made item in the game breakable, it breaks in detail. When you take your sledgehammer to a wall you break away the outer shell first, then you start digging into the concrete, and finally you hit rebar. Not only is the game's destruction fun to deliver and watch, but it also has a pretty big impact on how you play the game. When tasked with an assassination, you can sneak in and shoot the target or just take down the whole building the person is in. Tired of enemies sending reinforcements over a bridge? Take down the whole bridge. The level of destruction in Red Faction: Guerrilla deepens gameplay in ways I never would have imagined! Your best friend is the sledgehammer! The coolest looking is the singularity bomb which sucks the surrounding area into a small gravity well. Did I mention open world and massive scale? You can roam around and unlock new areas, new missions, new weapons. You get to demolish entire towns and design all the destruction as you see fit. My personal opinion is that this installment is the best one out of all the current Red Faction games!			",375,79,12,35,32,3,76

												Quick tip if you bought the game and have start up crashing! Try using a Launch Option argument on Steam ""-nod3d10""-> Right click Red Faction: Guerilla -> Go to Properties -> in GENERAL, click ""SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."" -> Type '-nod3d10' into the text field. This solution worked for me and I hope it helps if you have the same issue!===Before reading my review, my time on record in the game is low because I originally played and completed just about all of the game on PlayStation 3. However I managed to do a lot of things in the PC version in my roughly fifty minutes of play.This game was quick to become my favorite of the series, and one of my favorite games of all time. I played the original Red Faction A LOT way back in the day. My friend and I absolutely loved the first one.I think Red Faction Guerilla is an amazing sequel to the original game that started terrain deformation in videogaming.The story is fantastic,The graphics even for a 2009 videogame are still stunning!It runs great and smooth as well and I'd have to say it's really well optimized.More recent pro, Volition is ditching GFWL to use Steamworks instead. The destruction engine, GeoMOD 2.0. (Although, not the same as the original GEOMOD, it does however have really fun building destruction capabilities and that makes up for it in an OPEN WORLD game.)Did I mention the game is open world?The beloved Rail Gun is still in here, too! As well as weapons very much similar to previous games as well as completely new ones.!!! Great game for stress relief because let's face it. What's more fun than swinging a sledge hammer around tearing a building apart and smashing EDF soldiers? !!!Is that not enough of an incentive to buy it? Aside from, the price on sale events? LIKE RIGHT NOW?The only major issue with the game is that it will crash on start up at some point namely because of the DirectX 10. I'm not entirely sure why but I was able to cure my issue was to set a lcommand line launch parameter of -nod3d9.  Every single issue I had with the game was cured. No crashing, either. I can't fault the publisher or developer for it though. For me, I see a positive visual change by disabling D3D10 because the sun no longer shines through solid objects (and it was blinding) and a few other things I could mention but can't because I was never able to keep the game running long enough.The amount that I recommend this game is tenfold unending. The game is definitely worth even paying the regular non sale price!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's been a while since I played this, but given that the game has been ported over to Steamworks and updated, I'll write a brief recommendation. The game is fun. It's got pretty good graphics, it's a pretty open (albeit repetitive) world, the destruction mechanics are awesome, it's a lot of fun to go around completing missions and blowing stuff up. Go for it!

												So here's my review of Red Faction: Guerilla;I've played this game aprox. 23 hours, finished the main game (and side quests).I must say that I really enjoyed this, you can just run around smash barrels at your enemies and make them explode, or you can smash them with a hammer so they'll fly away 10ft, at first I really had to get used to the style, I am normally not a big fan of sci-fi but, now I am!Pro's:Best. Pshysics.. EverInteractive open worldUpgrade'sA lot of gameplayGreat gameplay!Con's:When you die in a quest, there's about 80% chance that you will have to restart the whole thing, yay! -_-They could've made more changes in the environment, it is mainly just 1 kind of environment but with weather changes (I know it's on Mars, but still)!!YOU CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT SIGNING INTO WINDOWS LIVE!!And that's about it, I do recommend this game, but.. i've heard something about Windows Live Games support is going down and since you can't play offline, ermmm you wont be able to play the game.Other than that 7.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game for anyone who like to destroy walls and surprise the enemy or why stop there, lets level the whole house with a series of demolition skills and real-life physics, take your sledgehammer and knock some dents in the EDF forces or play around with high explosive weapons as you crush buildings to a crumble as you fight for libertation of mars and the corrupt Earth Defense Forces.

												This is an open-world third-person shooter (it even has cover mechanics- not that you should notice them...) that doesn't try to weigh you down with such amenities as ""good plot"" and ""well-developed characters.""It's a game about blowing things up. It has about as much to do with guerilla warfare as the sun does with fire - in the loosest terms only.That said, it's an incredibly fun game even if it might look ugly and play mediocrely compare to more modern shooters. Most certainly worth the buy due to decent replay value.As such, I'm nominating the game for a ""whoa dude"" award because it is so uniquely good at getting money on what is essentially its lone unique selling point: the ability to shred anything and everything manmade. It is a game that feeds off our most basic human instinct - the will to blow things up just for the sake of watching it blow up.Oh, and it also has a really subtle moral narrative about the nature of good and evil that's about as impressive as Spec Ops: The Line's much more obvious narrative... but that's for you to discover.9/10			",51,2,0,0,11,0,7

												Oh thank god!! They finally fixed this game so I can properly play it. I've had it for.. oh I dunno... maybe 5 or 6 years and now they finally fix it. It's stable now and runs really well. Graphics are slightly tweaked too.This is of course the most fun destruction game you can play without a Physx card.  The destruction physics are actually pretty good as you can cause entire buildings to fall over and crash onto people and other structures. Just don't let a building fall upon yourself.  Either do it singehandely with a sledge hammer or with a series of attachable explosives.  Maybe use a rocket laucher is you have one handy. There is also lots of advanced technologies that can be handy for blowing up buildings.Go in and have fun!!			",165,24,5,14,11,2,21

You can roam around and unlock new areas, new missions, new weapons. You get to demolish entire towns and design all the destruction as you see fit. My personal opinion is that this installment is the best one out of all the current Red Faction games!			",375,79,12,35,32,3,76

												Quick tip if you bought the game and have start up crashing! Try using a Launch Option argument on Steam ""-nod3d10""-> Right click Red Faction: Guerilla -> Go to Properties -> in GENERAL, click ""SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."" -> Type '-nod3d10' into the text field. This solution worked for me and I hope it helps if you have the same issue!===Before reading my review, my time on record in the game is low because I originally played and completed just about all of the game on PlayStation 3. However I managed to do a lot of things in the PC version in my roughly fifty minutes of play.This game was quick to become my favorite of the series, and one of my favorite games of all time. I played the original Red Faction A LOT way back in the day. My friend and I absolutely loved the first one.I think Red Faction Guerilla is an amazing sequel to the original game that started terrain deformation in videogaming.The story is fantastic,The graphics even for a 2009 videogame are still stunning!It runs great and smooth as well and I'd have to say it's really well optimized.More recent pro, Volition is ditching GFWL to use Steamworks instead. The destruction engine, GeoMOD 2.0. (Although, not the same as the original GEOMOD, it does however have really fun building destruction capabilities and that makes up for it in an OPEN WORLD game.)Did I mention the game is open world?The beloved Rail Gun is still in here, too! As well as weapons very much similar to previous games as well as completely new ones.!!! Great game for stress relief because let's face it. What's more fun than swinging a sledge hammer around tearing a building apart and smashing EDF soldiers? !!!Is that not enough of an incentive to buy it? Aside from, the price on sale events? LIKE RIGHT NOW?The only major issue with the game is that it will crash on start up at some point namely because of the DirectX 10. I'm not entirely sure why but I was able to cure my issue was to set a lcommand line launch parameter of -nod3d9.  Every single issue I had with the game was cured. No crashing, either. I can't fault the publisher or developer for it though. For me, I see a positive visual change by disabling D3D10 because the sun no longer shines through solid objects (and it was blinding) and a few other things I could mention but can't because I was never able to keep the game running long enough.The amount that I recommend this game is tenfold unending. The game is definitely worth even paying the regular non sale price!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked the just cause series then you will love this game. Any Grand Theft Auto person who wanted to destroy building but can't then this game will be for you or if you want to high jack a mech and ram into a EDF watch tower then this game is for you but there are some down sides like they could have given at least a city or a town so you can destroy. But that does not mean it is a bad game.The multiplayer is a really fun feature to the game you can acess wrecking crew to see who can score the most point at destoying something or just plain old multiplayer. But if you are looking for a good story plot i don't think you will find it the story plot is more of like a okay plot kust like just cause 2 it's mainly just about wrecking stuff.but if you are looking for an open world destruction game then you will find it here so i would give this game a 8/10 it has an okay story plot but needs a bigger sandbox area but still you should buy this game.

												Alec Mason went to Mars to start over and work as a miner. Things became twisted when he learned about EDF and the Marshal Law they placed. Thats when Alec Mason took a stand. He became leader of Red Faction and began the Revolution.Sound familiar?It is, except here it works!THQ took thier time making this one and it turned out the best of the Red Faction series.From the graphics to the weapons, game play, Enemy AI, controls, and mostly the story which caught the eye of producers and is going to be made into a SFI channel movie!You'll laugh at the over the top action. I've read that others complained that the game looks ""cartoony"" when vehicals are launched into the air from explosions. Yes they do soar and enemy bodies are flung out like rag dolls. I think the developers took in consideration that the gravity on Mars is something like 38% less than Earth. So yeah, vehicals will soar apon explosions.

												This is one of my favorite games from the 2000's. I played it pretty religiously on the xbox 360, so when I saw a free weekend I couldn't help but to dive back in and see if I could handle it on the mouse and keyboard. It still plays great, with just a little bit of over sensitiveness of the controls for driving. Blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up is still so so rewarding, and It's crazy to remember just how huge this game actually is. And right now it's only four bucks on sale? definite buy for me. Now that i've played red faction one and two it's a little strange that this game is in third person but I can kind of see why they did it. It makes all the jumping around swinging hammers and such very fun. Reminds me of saints row a lot, which makes sense. Overall, just a really fun game.			",126,34,1,21,8,0,12

												The story is paper thin and laughable, just like the walls of buildings you'll be knocking down with your Mjolnir-like sledgehammer.  But the combat and physics are top notch; it's SO satisfying when enemies are entrenched in buildings to just destroy the entire building instead of carefully sneaking through each corridor and hallway.  The campaign is long and varied and I've found myself setting RF:G down for several months, then reinstalling it just to play through again and laugh in delight as I set elaborate traps up for the security forces foolish enough to mess with me.  There's a few failings in the game, but I feel nitpicky pointing them out.  Sometimes the AI is dumb.  The in-game grass has a laughably short drawing distance, making it look like the ground is kind of boiling while you drive across it.  And while the missions are varied, some are just annoyingly long with frustratingly few checkpoints.  Overall, it's a great game.  Fun, mindless destruction on a huge map.			",294,111,4,36,19,3,37

												I've played the first Red Faction. I was apart of the factions/clans in online games. Such as: Lost Souls (LS), Rock With Force (RWF), and Dead Bandits (DB). This game is not like the first one!It is still good, and fun. Would I recommend it? Yes. Reasons? Sure.:GOOD:1.) Geomod for buldings! It was in the first one, now its more refined and... Realistic. Blowing up stuff is FUN!?2.) Difficulty. It can be hard rushing in with no tactics, you can't just shoot everyone expecting to survive like some ""Bad♥♥♥♥♥MO'FO"".3.) Side quests. Many and varying from Hostage Rescue, to destorying buildings as fast as you can.4.) Weapons. Many, not a lot of them but I felt there was enough of them and enough upgrades with them.:BAD:1.) Only third person. I miss first person, or even it being an option.2.) Multi Player. Now, this is my opinion. The multiplayer didn't really suck me in, nor make me feel like playing it again.3.) Story. Was (my opinion again) lacking something. Just didn't get into it as much as I hoped. It was ""OK"".4.) Side quests. Every time I finish an area, they dissapear. I'd like the option to finish all of them.			",179,11,3,19,20,2,14

												This game is amazing. First off I love sandbox games, they are pretty much all I play. This is like GTA but red faction style. If you remember the first red faction where you could destroy certain walls and dig holes in places and loved it then this game is for you. Everything in the world is literally destroyable. The guards only attack you if you do something wrong (just like GTA police). I give this game a 10/10. I am addicted most definitely. You upgrade your weapons and buy new ones from gathering scrape from tearing down buildings. So destroy everything you see pretty much. Take my advice and buy it. It’s worth the money.

Posted: November 7, 2013
												Okay. I decided I needed to give Red Faction 3 (this game) another chance. I'm loving it. It's like GTA, but it's on Mars and it's fun. You don't really wander aimlessly (as my previous review states) doing odd jobs. You just do mission for the Red Faction. It's fun, challenging, and... just FUN. I can't strees enough that this is like GTA, except it's fun.I guess my problem with the GTA series has always been the lack of direction. It's TOO sandboxy. I loves me a good sandbox, but GTA just felt like there was no driving plot. No real reason to do one thing over another. RFG has a very central plot. There are some side missions, but it's not a game full of side missions with a plot thrown in that you can follow if you want.It feels like they took the GTA engine and decided to make an actual game with it. For me, this is even better than Saints Row (another, more blatant GTA clone). That series has some drive, but still no real ""story"" to be followed.RFG hits you with action and plot right off the bat, and gets you involved in what's going on in the game setting pretty quickly (if clumsily). The lack of cinematics is almost a blessing. The few in the beginning are just painful to watch.Like many games on Steam, this one does not work with a gamepad. Let me re-state that. This game doesn't get my usual gamepad complaint, but it's equally non-compliant with how I want to use my gamepad (which is not odd in any way).I had everything working perfectly (so I thought), until I got into a vehicle for the first time. Suddenly, my look up/down axis inverted and there's no option to fix that. Rather, I already fixed it. I wanted my look up/down axis to be inverted (for some reason, ""inverted"" means ""when I push the control stalk up, my head points up""), so I set it that way immediately. I can switch it back and forth each time I get in/out of a truck, but there's no option to make it be the same in both places.So I'm stuck with mouse-and-keyboard for this action game. The upside is I can turn very fast; the down side is I can't move slowly.Some other good things about the control scheme. Both ""zoom/aim"" and ""crouch"" can be set to toggle as opposed to hold. Personally, I feel that this is the best way of doing things. There's nothing more complicated than holding down ctrl (to crouch), alt (to walk slow), Z (to aim), S (to walk backward) and A (to walk left). Okay, fine. But it takes a bit of brain power to release the correct key to stop doing just one of those things while continuing to do all the others while tracking targets and avoiding enemy fire. Much better for crouch and aim to be set to toggle instead of hold. Also, reloading automatically stops aiming and sprinting automatically stops crouching. Awesome brain savers.I do wish ""aim"" was bound to right-click by default (as in Borderlands) instead of to F, but I understand why they did it that way. And if it really becomes irksome, I can switch my keybinds. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ a console-to-PC port that lets you swap the mother♥♥♥♥ing keybinds. I get that this game is over two years old, but I just wanted to point out how far things have back-slid. Thes console-to-PC port not only has keybind options IN-GAME, but it has mouse-keyboard controls that work properly and don't limit your functionality (Space Marine is absolutely unplayable without a gamepad because of how the mouse-keyboard camera control ""works"").So I retroactively give RFG a B-. The fact that I can't use my gamepad is a big deal, but I'm still really enjoying the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So here's my review of Red Faction: Guerilla;I've played this game aprox. 23 hours, finished the main game (and side quests).I must say that I really enjoyed this, you can just run around smash barrels at your enemies and make them explode, or you can smash them with a hammer so they'll fly away 10ft, at first I really had to get used to the style, I am normally not a big fan of sci-fi but, now I am!Pro's:Best. Pshysics.. EverInteractive open worldUpgrade'sA lot of gameplayGreat gameplay!Con's:When you die in a quest, there's about 80% chance that you will have to restart the whole thing, yay! -_-They could've made more changes in the environment, it is mainly just 1 kind of environment but with weather changes (I know it's on Mars, but still)!!YOU CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT SIGNING INTO WINDOWS LIVE!!And that's about it, I do recommend this game, but.. i've heard something about Windows Live Games support is going down and since you can't play offline, ermmm you wont be able to play the game.Other than that 7.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh thank god!! They finally fixed this game so I can properly play it. I've had it for.. oh I dunno... maybe 5 or 6 years and now they finally fix it. It's stable now and runs really well. Graphics are slightly tweaked too.This is of course the most fun destruction game you can play without a Physx card.  The destruction physics are actually pretty good as you can cause entire buildings to fall over and crash onto people and other structures. Just don't let a building fall upon yourself.  Either do it singehandely with a sledge hammer or with a series of attachable explosives.  Maybe use a rocket laucher is you have one handy. There is also lots of advanced technologies that can be handy for blowing up buildings.Go in and have fun!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From games I have played I would compare this to Just Cause 2 The Mars version. Just Cause 2 is one of my fav games. I would put this behind JS2 but only because of less interaction between any other characters. A solo cause even though you pick up fighters as you go along good challanging missions. Staying to fight is not always a good idea and knowing when to run and escape is smart and go back when safe to finnish. I found this game a good play and the driving is fun different vehicles handle the Mars terrain good and bad so pick right vehicle. Good game for my collection.

												Red Faction Guerrilla haiku reviewBlowing stuff all dayJust ignore the main storyHave fun freeing Mars!Graphics: 7• the graphic themselves are ok, they probably didn't want to push it too far because of the workload from the physics, if you can max it out it looks pretty good, Mars' landscapes get a little boring after a while though. It's just a lot of red rock sprinkled with buildings, as if the world was built using a cheap map editorGameplay: 8+ destroying buildings as part of an ambush or just for fun is the main charm of the game+ a sizeable ammount of secondary missions to have fun+ a decent upgrade system that makes collectables and secondary quests more valuable to complete- the shooting mechanics are a little weird and even in normal common enemies can take from 2 to 3 bullets to the head without dying which makes it feel as if the game had no localized damage- sometimes buildings can stay on their feet even if a skyscraper is balancing on a single brick in one of it's sides- the AI is nothing special, they are as agressive as stupidStory: 5- the story is pretty cheesy, or at least the acting is... it's just typical ""rebellion"" material, in that aspect the first game of the series was much better, the character development is also close to non-existentOverall (not an average): 75/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many explosives, lots of stuffs to blow up. This game is a master of destruction above all of destruction games.10/10 from my view about the total destructon of this gameGlass it and torch it to pieces and just need sledgehammer you can torn up the EDF Command Center to dust. More explosives, more building killer stuffs it makes things thrilled and very excited.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I shot lightning at a tank to kill the occupants, got into it, and went on a destructive rampage, blowing up millions of dollars worth of government property and killing hundreds of government soldiers before they sent in more tanks and helicopters and killed me.WATCH THIS VIDEO! WATCH IT NOW! seriously this guy nails this game.

FUN BUT FRUSTRATING AS HELL.It's fun, but really hard. Frustratingly hard, which I suppose can be a fun challenge to some people. I can say with confidence, though, that I have never had more ragequits in any game than in RFG. The timed car drives are killer, the hostage crises are even harder, and dont even get me started on some of the missions. Also, the Badlands are annoying as hell because theres only one respawn point and its located on the far side of the area, so every time you die (which is quite often), you have to drive ALL THE WAY BACK to where you were OVER AND OVER AGAIN.You're also running away a lot. If you stay in one area for too long killing people, the EDF will come in tanks and helicopters and WILL kill you.PERKS: Not many games have quite the ammount of explosions and destructibility of scenery the way RFG has. its fun to tear buildings apart with the power of Thor or throw sticky C4 all over a building and run away while blowing the whole thing up. I recommend this game because its a fun play, but dont try to do all the quests and side missions because youll get really frustrated.8/10 would drive a garbage truck through someone's house again			",53,9,1,9,6,0,10

												Before you buy (or if you own it already), search the forum for the Alternative to GFWL thread and install the file it points you to.  No more problems with losing save files or the game not launching.  You'll still need GFWL installed, but that's not a big deal.			",152,7,0,28,6,0,24

												GFWL still required to save games in singleplayer mode! :(Edit:  Obviously, I was very unhappy that I missed the fine print and didn't realize that his game required  (the soon-to-be defunct) Games For Windows Live.  After spending well over 2 hrs trying to get GFWL working on my Windows 7 machine, I ran across ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is a stub dll that is meant to replace GFWL's xlive.dll.  It even comes with source code!!!  With ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I can recommend the game without reservation as it's very fun to play.  I have only at made it to the end of the 1st sector due to the time wasted trying to just be able to save a game. :-/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Edit 2: Apparently, I've been censored.

												This game is amazing. First off I love sandbox games, they are pretty much all I play. This is like GTA but red faction style. If you remember the first red faction where you could destroy certain walls and dig holes in places and loved it then this game is for you. Everything in the world is literally destroyable. The guards only attack you if you do something wrong (just like GTA police). I give this game a 10/10. I am addicted most definitely. You upgrade your weapons and buy new ones from gathering scrape from tearing down buildings. So destroy everything you see pretty much. Take my advice and buy it. It’s worth the money.

												This is the best Red Faction game I have played to date. Let's see, you get huge hammer to hit things with. (EDF and buildings). You get rocket launchers, remote charges to throw at things, really cool vehicles and big explosions when you take stuff out. The EDF try really hard to kill you and your guerrilla compatriots and also they use terrain pretty sensibly, but the man made stuff can be destroyed and so it works in your favour if you gat a couple of troopers hidsing behind one wall. Boom and the trouble is gone.The missions are well spaced out making you travel around to find all the stuff and although there is a storyline it does not drag you along by the nose, you have a lot of freedom to find your own targets.Would I recommend this game? Most definitely yes. Can I find any flaws? Yes, there are lots of video issues but turning off DX10 gets rid of 99 % of these. To stop DX10 add -nod3d10 to the startup commands through Steam.I am nowhere finished yet as I have been wandering off looking for stuff to destroy on my own, according to the stats I kill mostly with the assault rifle but enjoy hitting stuff real hard with the sledge hammer. Just unlocked the rocket launcher and this is fun but I mostly like the hammer and remote charges.			",160,20,2,33,71,1,54

												Very cool game. Love having to come home and take everything out at the edf by destroying their buildings. Stealing their tank and using at your own will. (recommend to go to safe house once you have one so you can drive without edf shooting at you ;) and doing one of those ""destroy missions"". So it can reset and repair the tank lol) and its just an amazing game. Love it. Very cool. IMO i would rate this at a 10/10.			",45,6,2,8,1,1,7

												Back when the game came out i never managed to properly play it, since the first PC version which used GFWL was just a mess but that has finally changed.No more Games For Windows Live instead it uses Steam now, lots of bug fixes, better optimization,updated compatibilaty with latest Windows OS',Steamworks achievements,Steam powered Multiplayer and DX10 replaced with DX11.Destructability in this game is still the best we've ever had in gaming to date, yeah texture quality,polygon count and lighting effects are now somewhat dated but it still look pretty solid visualy even for today's standarts, in my opinion at least.Gunplay doesn't really feel all that good, missions are very repetetive, side missions are just the same 3-5 missions repeated 100 times in the open world of Mars and since it's Mars, most of the enviroment is of course the same which makes it somewhat dull to look at, as you roll into a new sector to liberate just for it to look almost the same as the last place and the story is forgetable and not worth paying attention to.However the thing that holds this game is the what i mentioned earlier on, the amazing destructibility, watching as every lil' piece of a big building colides into another big building, all parts reacting properly and than crumbling into tiny bits is just a blissful joy to watch and makes me wish we had more games with such an amazing destructo physics engine.It's totally worth picking up just because of this amazing tech, it's so much fun slaming a giant truck into a military base filled with explosives and then detonating it and watching it all blow up in a wonderfull way.The game is only 9.99 Euros and during sales it drops to just 4 euros, sometimes even only 1.50 Euros and it's well worth the lil' amount of money it asks from you, even thought it does have alot of flaws.

												The Red Faction: Guerrilla single player campaign follows a formula similar to the always entertaining game Just Cause 2.  You are presented with an open world containing endless enemy soldiers, civilians, and rebel allies in a struggle for dominance.  The object is to destroy enemy buildings and resources with your overpowered arsenal of weapons, while avoiding death and collecting resources with which to upgrade your weapons.  The draw of this game over JC2 is that there are some fun physics involved.  Buildings can become unstable when you damage them enough in key locations, and will callapse somewhat realistically, so you can plan your attacks to minimize required ammo and bring things down as quickly as possible.  There are also lots of missions that progress the story and keep you focused.RF:G has several multiplayer modes that make for some great post-game smack talk.  Taking out an enemy sniper by blowing up the tower he was standing on has never felt better.			",401,122,17,47,26,4,67

												(edit at the bottom 23/06/15)This game might be my favourite of the serie...The missions are pretty standard but still enjoable but the real fun comes in with the open world aspect,every building is destroyable and the weapons they give you to do the job are great, there are a series of jobs and side-missions that go from defending buildings to blow up strategical points or steal military veichles.There are some bugs here and there but none of them are game-breaking, the only downside of this game is that it uses Games For Windows Live, wich we all know is kind of a failed project...I suggest getting this game even at full price(10$) and definetly a insta-buy if discounted. EDIT:Now they got rid of the GFWL nonsense and made a steam version wich solves any saving problems! Right now i definetly recommend this great game, i suggest you get the ""Protracted Rebellion"" mod, i finished the game with it and it makes it more challenging and far more realistic, no more 1 man army and unlimited destruction, I think it really adds to the game!

												So Red Faction Guerilla, a game about the famous Gorilla warfare.I could tell you something about the story or the characters but really, they both kinda suck. The main story is filled with crappy missions, cliché characters and so on.But I know that you are not interested in those things. You are interested in tearing down buildings 1 piece at a time. In this game, you are pretty much Thor, you just destroy everything and everyone in your way with few swings from your mighty sledgehammer(or with some good old fashioned explosives but you get the idea).So if you are looking for a game where you get the break plenty of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and blow up plenty of stuff, this is a perfect game for you.But if you are looking for more than just silly fun, this game isn't worth it.

												When this game first came out, I was skeptical to say the least.  ""Oh great,"" I thought, ""they're making a GTA clone set on Mars and slapping the Red Faction brand on it.  This is going to be bad."" Well... I was half right at least.  You can definitely call it ""Grand Theft Mars"", but it is anything but bad.To put it bluntly, the gameplay on this is just addictive.  I cannot count how many hours I've spent ""reappropriating"" colonist vehicles for ""the cause"" then driving them into buildings, through buildings, over people, and so on.  GeoMod + buildings + magic hammer that breaks everything is a winning formula.  You can also replace the hammer with plastic explosives, rocket launchers, cars, tanks, tank weaponry, the bodies of dudes you just hit with your hammer (yes that will take down walls).  RF:G captures the raw destructive joy that was present in the first Red Faction and scales it up in a major way.To be clear, this is a major shift in the Red Faction brand from the previous two titles.  While there is a relatively linear plot, the gameplay is anything but.  This is very much a sandbox title, and yet the game does not suffer for it. On the contrary, the huge number of opportunities for destruction have never been so well presented.  If anything, I would argue that a sandbox game is the ideal way that the destruction-oriented GeoMod engine should be presented.There are, of course, downsides.  The ability to GeoMod the terrain is completely gone for one, though I can see how that would be too complex (and resource intensive) for a game area of this scale.  A number of the weapons are somewhat lacking, particularly the traditional bullet weapons which are only really useful at all due to the never-ending waves of enemy mooks carrying them.  The biggest problem though?  Games For Windows Live, or more specifically the horrible incompatibilities it can cause.  I can barely get this game to not crash outright on Windows 7.  I highly recommend you use a GFWL alternative if at all possible.If you take anything away from this review, it should be this: until the game started crashing on me 100% of the time, RF:G was always installed on my computer.  While it does have a long and rewarding campaign mode, it's also perfect if you just want to kill some time by causing mass destruction and chaos.  I'd not play the game for months, then pick it up for an hour or two just to destroy some buildings, cars, tanks, so on and so forth.  This is an incredibly fun game, and I'd argue the best in the series.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												Imagine if the Portal gun were first introduced as just another weapon in a first person shooter; in half life, for example. You would be excited when you first got it and would be dying to see what kinds of amazing puzzles it can bring. But first you have to go to objective marker #782, kill a bunch of dudes with a rocket launcher. My point is a good game puts its best feature at the core and build a game around it. And that's my problem with Red Faction.When I first started playing this I thought ""Can we, like, remove the shootings, the missions, the story, the upgrades and... actually, can I just break♥♥♥♥♥♥uninterruptedly for a while?"". The destruction system is so great! I feel like this game has such a nice mechanic and even though it does make extensive use of it, of course, the game doesn't revolve around it, which makes me frustrated most of the time, wanting more destruction and less ""take this car to point B in 2 minutes"". The fun part is locked inside a shell of generic open world game.That isn't saying the generic open world game is bad. It's ok. It follows all the open world commandments: thou shall complete missions, thou shall liberate regions, thou shall upgrade your♥♥♥♥♥♥etc. But I don't know if it's good enough that I'll finish the campaign. I just quit after a mission where I have to hunt down snipers. I'm trying to beat it by demolishing the building they're on, but it requires too much explosives — more than I can carry at the moment — and the hammer takes too long to do it while being shot at from all sides. I like that I can at least try to do that! but I'm pretty sure it was designed with a more traditional approach in mind, specially considering how well fortified these particular buildings are.I guess I recommend it if you find it in a good sale. As for me, I'm going to check out some videos of the next Red Faction game of the series, to see which direction it went.			",261,47,6,12,14,1,10

												Here you have a sandbox game similar to Just Cause or Mercenaries, but a little more limited in scope and map-size (likely due to the game's age and relatively small development studio) and set on post-terraforming Mars.The two reasons I like it were:A) RevolutionB) DestructionREVOLUTIONIt's a pretty cool setting for any work of fiction.DESTRUCTIONThe introduction mission is just an opportunity to smash things with a super-sledgehammer. You can take out chunks of buildings and watch them collapse as the physics engine takes over. Okay, sometimes a building will be unrealistically supported by a very thin steel girder, but most of the time it is very gratifying to take structures apart piece by piece (by hammer, by explosives, or by driving a massive truck into them).You don't normally get the same level of destructive freedom in an open-world game.There are some missions that don't feel very guerrilla at all. You sometimes find yourself battling/fleeing/baiting the entire EDF by yourself in an all-out-war. These poorly-designed missions, especially the final mission, are the game's terribly low moments.We could have done with more character from the cast - your allies are virtually indistinguishable from one-another, being cookie-cutter guys/girls who turn up randomly to assist you during play. The same goes for your enemies - they are all irredeemably evil sadists.I wouldn't label the title as a ""must buy"" but I enjoyed blowing up bridges and sabotaging wind farms. Probably says something about me.Pros: smashin' stuffCons: basic gameplay and shallow plot that could do with more polish			",312,59,0,40,17,3,32

												This is truly one of my favourite games.The single player is an invigorating experience like no other, liberating sector after sector and facing increasingly militarized hostility. The way the revolution is played out is up to your choices to upgrade your skills and purchased new weapons, the way you inspired your fellow guerrillas, and your overall combat skills. Driving the surface of terraformed Mars, you are revealed to structure after structure that can be destroyed with whatever means you choose! The freedom Havok physics engine provides is just another fantastic edition to this revolutionary game. With such a stimulating and realistic environment, Red Faction Guerrilla single player provides an extraordinary and unique, freeworld campaign that many other games attempt to strive for. Red Faction Guerrilla achieves this. Its multiplayer is one of the most colourful and sublime multiplayers I've ever played. Instead of the monotonous Call of Duty kill-die-respawn pattern that we've all played before, it allows you to kill creatively with weapons that no other game has ever coneceived but still require tactics to use; not just anybody can pick up the Grinder and slice people up with it. Plus, the multitude of objective gametypes that are found in no other game (simply due to the fact that Red Faction Guerilla is so unlike every other game and therefore its objective gametypes can only be based around RFG's mechanics) adds variety to each game you play. The multiplayer never gets old. It is well worth it. This game's population must be maintained. On the Xbox, its popularity has diminshed a point of no rejuvination. This game is well worth the $20, and when it's on sale don't hesitate to pick it up!			",12,0,0,0,2,0,4

												This is one of my favorite games of all-time, played for dozens of hours outside of Steam. Bought it again because it was on sale and I was too lazy to look for the CD.It's very similar in basic game design to Grand Theft Auto 3+: Third-person view, missions that start with some job that needs done, a map to reference a waypoint, jump in a vehicle, and head to the objective. But with fully destroyable buildings, piece by piece. Sandbox-like in that regard (it's not actually a sandbox game), but how you place explosives, shoot rockets, or swing your super-hammer is up to you. Watching a tower fall after you blow up the base is just awesome. Or watching it fall after you crash a truck through it. Or watching it fall after an enemy accidentally drives his armored car through it. You can't dig through the terrain, but destroying structures is much more fun. The action is non-scripted and the physics engine leads to some highly entertaining events - I shot an explosive canister that was next to a garage. When it blew up, it tore a hole in the side and the armored car inside was lauched forward, over a steep hill, through the air, and fell through the roof of another building that I needed to take down. After a moment, it exploded. It was like some ultra-violent Rube Goldberg contraption. Completely unexpected and I doubt I could ever reproduce it.Some missions have you steal a vehicle, others will have you defend a building, or rescue hostages. Most will have you destroy something. Plenty of optional missions. Or you can just pick a high-value enemy target and take it out to help lower their level of control of the sector.The storyline is kind of predictable, though there are a few twists here and there. In the original Red Faction, the fairly-evil Ultor mega-corporation is brought down, with the help of the Earth Defense Force. In this game, the EDF has become the cruel occupiers of Mars and they killed your brother.(Not a spoiler, it happens 5 minutes into the game.) Nothing overly creative. And, like too many games these days, there's someone talking to you over a communicator while on missions- Someone who you'll want to find and punch in the face. Guy gives me a mission to rescue some hostages that are about to be executed. I accept the mission and about 4 seconds later I jump into my truck and he starts screaming ""Mason! What are you doing? People are DYING!"" Holy crap old man, keep your pants on, I haven't even started the truck!But, these a minor issues in light of how fun the game is otherwise. Highly recommended.

												Nothing like a little wanton destruction to kill an hour or two.  That's the only reason to play RF: Guerilla.  It's not the story (which is reminiscent of Total ""Get Your♥♥♥♥♥To Mars"" Recall) that keeps you playing, it's certainly not the throw-away character development, and it's not even the Games For Windows Live.  It's taking a sledgehammer, clubbing a dude four feet into a Mars precipice, and collapsing a highrise apartment complex from the ground floor.  It's climbing into an industrial loader and walking through a military base like Stallone in Rocky IV, if buildings were Ivan Drago and face-punches were that robot butler.  Maybe that last analogy doesn't make sense...Bottom line is- I fully recommend this game if you grew up watching ""Aliens"", Schwarzeneggar, or American Gladiator.  Again, maybe not that last one.  Like I said, it wasn't the story that kept me coming back, it wasn't the engine (not the prettiest game by a long shot), and it wasn't the basic game mechanics (driving is hopelessly, but somehow appropriately, floaty to the point of frustration; level design is a lot less open world than many similar games due to impassable mountain ranges; shooting mechanics are inaccurate at best)- it is literally the joy of melting a memorial bridge with a nanite rifle before exploding the rest using remote charges and a saw-blade launcher.  That'll do, pig.  That'll do.Give it a try if you like:-GTA or Saint's Row games-any of the previous Red Faction games with the VMod Destruction technology-Total ""Man, I got five kids to feed!"" Recall-GTA-style hijacking with a lightning gun (you'll be doing a lot of that!)-the sound of breaking glass-crushing your little brother's dreams along with his block towers			",283,75,5,59,25,4,24

												The Steam Update to this game adds achievements, cards, and people actually playing the multiplayer, apparently. So that is neat I suppose. I don't remember if it had GFWL before, but not having it anymore is a major plus. :DAnyway, I did a replay and the game is still as fun as it was years ago. The story and characters are forgettable, but what isn't is the non-stop violence and destruction that this game brings. I like how damage you do is (with a few exceptions) permanent, so you start off in a pristine world and end in one that borne witness to a brutal conflict. The amount of ruin you come across depends on the player of course, and in my case... well... that's going to take a while to rebuild. XDSo its a fun game where you make stuff go boom and can break pretty much every building in the entire world. Enjoy! :D			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												Red Faction: Guerilla was one of my all time favourite games for the XBOX 360. It has the best destruction engine I have ever seen in a game, including Frostbite. And whats more, it was incredibly fun! SIngle player could occationally get repetitive, and the racing mission were such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥(but I don't like racing in open world games anyway), but the awesome destruction NEVER got old. Throw in some great weapons with which to cause mayhem and you've got yourself bags of fun for hours on end. And that's only the single player the Guerilla multiplayer was one of the most underrated parts of his massively underrated game. It was quick but not twitchy simple but not without lots of strategic and tactical options. Your combination of which superpowered backpack and which gun you chose to use would drastically change your play style. My personal favourite combo was the Rhino pack combined with the electric gun. You could smash through a wall taking out a passing player then finish them off by frying them with the elecric gun. So awesome! I was gutted when the new call of duty came out (whichever one it was at the time) as there seemed to be a mass exodus on  xbox to tath, leaving me and my mates without anyone to play with or against. An unfortunately recurring problem with consoles.So when I saw it on steam I though GREAT! PC gamers are way more likely to keep this online stuff going! Only to find out it was a GFWL game and that it'll be going the way of the dodo very soon. So dissapointing!Red Faction: Guerilla is a brilliant game basically. But with very little incentive to play it any more....such a shame. ",97,23,1,8,9,0,29

												This is truly one of my favourite games.The single player is an invigorating experience like no other, liberating sector after sector and facing increasingly militarized hostility. The way the revolution is played out is up to your choices to upgrade your skills and purchased new weapons, the way you inspired your fellow guerrillas, and your overall combat skills. Driving the surface of terraformed Mars, you are revealed to structure after structure that can be destroyed with whatever means you choose! The freedom Havok physics engine provides is just another fantastic edition to this revolutionary game. With such a stimulating and realistic environment, Red Faction Guerrilla single player provides an extraordinary and unique, freeworld campaign that many other games attempt to strive for. Red Faction Guerrilla achieves this. Its multiplayer is one of the most colourful and sublime multiplayers I've ever played. Instead of the monotonous Call of Duty kill-die-respawn pattern that we've all played before, it allows you to kill creatively with weapons that no other game has ever coneceived but still require tactics to use; not just anybody can pick up the Grinder and slice people up with it. Plus, the multitude of objective gametypes that are found in no other game (simply due to the fact that Red Faction Guerilla is so unlike every other game and therefore its objective gametypes can only be based around RFG's mechanics) adds variety to each game you play. The multiplayer never gets old. It is well worth it. This game's population must be maintained. On the Xbox, its popularity has diminshed a point of no rejuvination. This game is well worth the $20, and when it's on sale don't hesitate to pick it up!			",12,0,0,0,2,0,4

												A fun game with great destruction mechanic, however the re-spawns when taking on a special mission - where heavy fortifications/vehicles appear in the area you just cleared, does hurt immersion.  If you do not like racing (like me), you will also find some of the missions to be a PITA.  Still, worth a 8/10.			",169,87,2,19,5,0,17

												A game about breaking stuff. 'Nuff said.  Or if you're into in-depth reviews... A third person shooter where you play as Alec Mason; a demolitionist, as he and the revoltionary group(The Red Faction) try to overthrow the dictatorship of the Earth Defense Force. By breaking stuff.  As far as third person shooters go, this is a fairly standard game. It has a sandbox feel to it, the map is very open. What sets this game apart from other games though, is the epic level of destruction and physics. That level of breaking stuff is amazing, I haven't found anything that you can't break in this game(Besides the ground, but thats kind of important.). Historically, the Red Faction series has pioneered video game destruction, and this game improves even further upon that idea. The story is meh, but the shooting is tight, and this game really takes advantage of its destruction. Multiplayer is, quite literally, a blast.(Get it, get it?) ",115,10,0,19,3,0,15

												I bought this game during the summer sales (as well as the rest of the series in a bundle), I mainly bought the bundle for Red Faction Armageddon (despite the bad reviews) as I wanted to at least see what was so bad. Also this game was included in the amazing bundle price of £4.99 (for all 4 games).I played many many hours on my PS3 version of this game (which has since sadly broken) and I completed the game. I thought the game was amazing with the destructible buildings, although I wish they had of improved the destructible world terrain (like the landscape) instead of removing it, but I can drive through a building! Makes up for that loss, can't win them all they say.The game has a very good story and the missions I found to be good and well told, as well as plenty of side missions to do and tasks to complete throughout the game world. This is definitely a must have, especially if you can pick it up on sale!			",94,5,0,12,7,0,22

												I only played this game for a few hours, but it was enough to form an opinion. I really didn't care for a story or characters, but that doesn't mean i didn't like Red Faction. On the contrary, i really enjoyed every minute of it. Basically, you are able to destroy almost every (99,99%) structure in  the game. You have different set of weapons, but the main star is sledgehammer, which you can use to precisely to turn things into rubble. Shooting is ok, i guess. So is the driving...basically it's nothing special. In the end, i'd recommend this game, because it really brought someting new in the genre. And, 7 years later, this game feels really fresh, because of its unique interactive enviroment.			",38,4,0,2,3,0,8

You have different set of weapons, but the main star is sledgehammer, which you can use to precisely to turn things into rubble. Shooting is ok, i guess. So is the driving...basically it's nothing special. In the end, i'd recommend this game, because it really brought someting new in the genre. And, 7 years later, this game feels really fresh, because of its unique interactive enviroment.			",38,4,0,2,3,0,8

												Its almost best discribed as a GTA-lite game with alot of explosives and chaos. Also full of little mini-missions that gives you a good time kill with either blowing up stuff, or kicking♥♥♥♥♥in a Walker/Mecha-thing. There is even a somewhat decent story to go with the singleplayer. Great time killer if you are not looking for something heavy with alot of plot nor too light with almost nothing to do.

												Guerilla really gets the Red Faction formula right. Volition developed an outstanding physics system --unprecedented at the time, and unrivaled even today-- and told us the players, ""go nuts"".It's laughable how they work destruction into every mission, but that's part of the beauty and charm of the game. I always feel unencumbered by narrative. Sometimes you just want to drive a dumptruck off of a cliff and through the roof of an enemy barracks. Now that the game is no longer restricted  to GFWL, and is 3 bucks, there's really no excuse to buy, and play the crap out of this game.			",56,7,1,5,3,0,5

												Sweet!  Steam ready RF:G!On the surface it feels a lot like an uninspired GTA clone.  Which considering Red Faction 1 and 2 where FPS's is interesting.  However...  once you scratch the surface it can rapidly devolve into an ""Orgy of Explosive Mayham!"".  At this point in time, its worth buying and playing just to be able to plant demo charges and blow parts of buildings up.  Its fun, and incredably satisfing.  All of the demo tools really have a fantastic feel, and there is little in life more fun then dropping an entire building on top of the bad guys.Or ramming them with trucks.  With demo charges on them.  Because explosions.  End game its almost a given that you have the Sledgehammer & remote charges on you at all times, not only becase they are so good, but becuase they are so FUN!			",176,21,9,22,21,0,43

												This game is good, if a bit inconsistent. Spiky difficulty changes between some missions, basic narrative and characters. Probably one of the better games of its era in terms of presenting a good open world feel in a sci-fi setting. Being the mad hammer guy rampaging across Mars is always great, though you can get overwhelmed quickly by too many baddies with transports or big guns.Reminded me a lot of The Expanse sci-fi series. If you compare the Red Faction rebels to the Expanse Belters (not to mention the crazy stuff happening in the real-world 2010s), it feels like game writers were ahead of their time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, its just an awesome game. Especially now (thanks to nordic games) that it is getting updated again with possibly more and more features! The only thing bad about the game (that I know of) is not being able to destroy the world like in red faction 1. Sure you have incredible physics and can destroy every single object and building in the game, but what happened to digging tunnels through the terrain? Anyways other than that its got some good gameplay, good story, awesome soundtrack, stunning destruction physics, awesome weapons, and beautiful graphics.  9.5/10 is what I would rate this game.Now all we need is a map editor! :D Btw, I've played the game A LOT more and beat the game on the console and just not the pc.

												I've already played through this game three times before this ""Steam Edition"", so don't take notice of my 6 hours too much.Rather than buying Armageddon (which you shouldn't do), you could instead buy this open world GTA-lite on Mars where it feels empowering to smash things up in high detail with a hammer. Also, explosions with rockets and mines. Guerilla is a great game for those who like feedback from what they do, which is topping over massive towers and plowing through tanks in a mech.If you've also wanted to purchase this game for the longest time but you realized it had icky GFWL all over it, don't fear! This new ""steam edition"" was picked up by a new developer, removed GFWL entirely, added new content to the multiplayer and optimized it A LOT. The game should run better than it ever has before.

In Red Faction: Harambe you control Call of Duty's Alex Mason on a quest to make everyone slightly annoyed by destroying every single house and bridge on MarsSee that friendly base?

												Not bad. It's GTA, on Mars, with rebels saying ♥♥♥♥ DA POLICE and fully destructible environments. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is dead. Thanks, GFWL!UPDATE: The game devs have (very) recently updated the game so that GFWL wouldn't be required to play it. It may not sound like it was a problem at first, but when you find out your saves are ""corrupted"" thanks to « Games For Windows: Live », you'll find that it's a very important update.Also, this game's pretty old.

												Very good action and destruction game. Graphics are decent and mechanics is wonderfull. Map is sandbox, that brings progressive freedom for movement and choice missions. With a bundle of weapons and a lot of vehicles, all can be driven. All structures can be destroyed by many ways, like with a single great hammer, and later, player can to rebuild at wish if lower parts are intact. Is not exactly a shooter: to play as if it were so, will be frustrating by the scarce of ammo, coverages and infinite enemies. The game concept is enterilly based on The Saboteur, an oddity in videogame industry that few people known. The designers of Red Faction saga always exploit and mix other games of its time and this title is not exception, but maybe is the best of the series. Really fun and therapeutic; just would need a first person view to be perfect. Complete the main and secondary missions and extra campaing assures long time of entertainment. Worth its price.

												      The destruction in this game is what you want here the story over all is pretty by the numbers. The locals are interesting and change up from time to time but Mars is where you shall be stuck.      Combat is good as weapons feel fairly punchy but you die so fast that it can get annoying to have to redo missions many times over from the beggining since there are no mid mission checkpoints unless it is an exceedingly long mission. Everytime you die you also lose a finite resource which isnt the biggest deal every but makes dying more of a pain. Not till the end of the game do you start getting armor that helps a little but you still die way too fast with the Ai's pinpoint accuracy.      GFWL got removed which is very cool and the game also got a nice overal update so if you like taking down buildings brick by brick you cant go wrong here.			",331,28,10,64,22,3,72

Older, but solid and nice. My friend recommend me Red Faction when It was on sale. I didn't know what to buy, so I buught it. And It was best 2€ I invested in my life ! The game was made in 2009, but graphics is nice even today ! The sounds are worse than graphics, but It isn't that bad. Story is really interesting and side quests are enjoying. But best thing is... DESTROYING EVERYTHING !!!! ON MARS !!!! In this game you can destroy every building, bridge or structure. It's so relaxing. The size of the map is pretty good for older game. Main currency is salvage. You can get salvage from missions, quest or by DESTROYING world. You can choose from various weapons, or you can craft one from salvage. The game has dlc in steam edition, so for this price you must have it!ProsStoryOpen worldYOU CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING, EVEN YOUR BASE !!!!!GraphicsMapConsSoundsSome bugsless contentOverallGood piece of game with DESTRUCTION ON MARS in it!

												The hostage rescue side quests made it for me. You’re charged with breaking into an EDF base, untying the three captured rebels inside, and driving off with them alive. But these hostages can die. It’s not game over, it just sucks. That makes me genuinely care about their survival, and I’ll rip buildings apart to make sure they get out alive.

												RFG is a bit of a hard game to play. The controls are a bit floaty and not super tight, the shooting is pretty baseline and the combat in general is frustratingly baseline mixed with bad design. The cover mechanic thats supposed to help you actually is terrible and is more of a issue to work with than just not using it at all.The physics and destruction is top notch. If you just want to break stuff its great for that though.The world is pretty empty aswll. Lots of hills with occasionally some towns or buildings between the hills. The main diffrence between areas being just the paint brush/textures used on the ground.The real star of the show is dynamic destruction and physics modelling of buildings. Which is great, but knocking over legos only stays fun so long and as time goes on it becomes a bit frustrating that you can't just knock over a building with relative ease. The novelty really just wears off because aside from the destruction the rest of the game kinda suffers.The world is interesting but in the game theres not much interesting about it, the world seems astoundigly flat and as boring as a Martian colony can be. Inside of building theres very little details much of the time, partially due to the destruction. Most characters arn't very interesting and all the civilian NPCs your supposed to be fighting for are basically stupid idiots who deserve what they get because they just get in the way.Alot of the assets are also reused in terms of building materials aswell as buildings themselves which makes destroying stuff alot less interesting after you have done quite a bit.Its technically impressive, the problem is its just a flat and rather boring game. It was easy for me to forget about my playthrough and then when I remembered to go ""Eugh, naaahhhh"" as its just so slow and boring.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												I tried this game out around the time it was released and wasn’t able to get into it so I decided to give it another chance now and I’m still not able to enjoy it. It’s one of the first games that started the craze of slowly taking over a giant open world map with very little focus on the actual story. Most games released after this one that have the same open world gameplay loop do a better job like Just Cause 2 and 3 or Mad Max or Assassins Creed Brotherhood and Black Flag, even games released before it like The Godfather for example. A lot of those games also managed to also focus on the story and main missions rather than solely relying on the side content which is what this game does. There is barely a story in this game, it’s mostly just a framework for all the gameplay. For the story that is actually there it is very bland and uninteresting with very generic characters. I didn’t find the gameplay very interesting either, the novelty of the destruction wore off very quickly because it’s pretty much the only thing you are doing and there just isn't enough gameplay variety surrounding the destruction to keep the game engaging. Mars as a location gets very tiresome to drive around, it doesn’t offer visual variety like other open world games. I don’t feel compelled to continue playing this game like I do with pretty much every other game I buy because I feel like I’m not going to get anything out of investing more time into it. Even with games that i consider to be bad i usually bother finishing just so i could see where it goes and what it does but with this game, i just don't care. 4/10 (Mediocre)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												I was obligated to play this game after scoring a free copy of Red Faction: Armageddon. I must admit, I came in a bit skeptical as the very early minutes of the game reminded me of Grand Theft Auto in space. The cars were crappy and its only gimmick was destructible environments.An hour into the game, I found myself loving it. The plot is thin, but the plot was not what kept me playing. It's surprising to see such a simple gimmick go a long way. Not only was watching buildings get demolished fun, this game mechanic forced me to strategize on my feet. It gave me many options to approach a given situation. To my surprise, this was a thinking man's game.If you ever see this game on sale, don't hesitate to purchase it. I picked it up for $5 a year or two back and it has rewarded me with about a dozen hours of fantastic gameplay. I eagerly await for more sequels from this franchise.Grade: B+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												I love this game for the simple reason I've loved all Red Faction games since the first: you can walk around and destroy EVERYTHING. This game in particular ramps up the destruction, as you play a demolition engineer who destroys buildings with a hammer, explosive charges, and everything inbetween. The plot is okay. (But that's not why we play Red Faction, is it?)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a nice game if anything. I mean imagine it, you go in, destroy anything thats a building, or blow it up, whichever you prefer, and then feel the ecasty of it falling / blowing up. Of course thats not all of it, it's actually a really good RPG game too, from where you can do the minor mission of saving a helpless person to completely destroying an enemy convoy. I also love how RF: Guerrilla allows you to play before Alec Mason even arrived unto Mars, where the Marauders and EDF fought each other in the most savage of a war. To each man / women and all, this game is a must have!			",20,1,0,1,0,0,0

 Grand Theft Mars Rover! I already enjoyed this game when it was originally released, the steam edition is even better. Not the epic type of game, because the story/characters/objectives and also the world are rather shallow, but if you´re in the mood for some creative deconstruction or atomizing your friends, Red Faction Guerilla has a lot of interesting tools for the job. Those tools combined with the amazing physics for collapsing buildings manage to make this game something really special. I also like the fast paced vehicle combat. All in all a good game that i´m always coming back to when i want to kill 1-2 hours, go brain afk and cause some chaos.			",95,5,1,13,5,1,8

												I was obligated to play this game after scoring a free copy of Red Faction: Armageddon. I must admit, I came in a bit skeptical as the very early minutes of the game reminded me of Grand Theft Auto in space. The cars were crappy and its only gimmick was destructible environments.An hour into the game, I found myself loving it. The plot is thin, but the plot was not what kept me playing. It's surprising to see such a simple gimmick go a long way. Not only was watching buildings get demolished fun, this game mechanic forced me to strategize on my feet. It gave me many options to approach a given situation. To my surprise, this was a thinking man's game.If you ever see this game on sale, don't hesitate to purchase it. I picked it up for $5 a year or two back and it has rewarded me with about a dozen hours of fantastic gameplay. I eagerly await for more sequels from this franchise.Grade: B+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												Red Faction Guerrilla is Volitions version of Grand Theft Auto with a destructible world which makes it better than GTA. But besides that, this is one of many underrated games people played it when it came out and after a year it was completely dead which sucked. So, singleplayer, with the Steam Edition it comes with the dlc that was released for the game back in 2009. And the core game itself takes a few hours to complete but with all the side quests to do it takes up to 10 hours to beat. Which is pretty good for an open world game. The Multiplayer, you can still play with friends thats if your friends have it, but other than that its totally dead you can still play by yourself but it gets boring. And theres an extra storyline to it that takes maybe 5 hours to complete. The Graphics it uses the havok engine which is a pretty good engine for games this big. But for a 2009 game it still delivers. World size, its pretty big almost the same size as GTA and thats it. The combat system is pretty great actually, and the game made a huge transiton from a first person to third person view which people thought was pretty risky. But it delivered suprisngly well. The driving is exactly like grand theft auto almost. This concludes my review. I give the game a 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely in my top 5 games of all time. I originally had this on Xbox 360 but recently bought it on PC. The PC version is identical to the console version as far as I can tell. This game offers a unique perspective as a member of a resistance force who cannot fight face to face like in FPS games, but has to use clandestine methods to overcome the enemy.PROS:*Great destructable environment*Unique storyline *Original gameplay*Excellent graphics considering its age*Good range of vehicles*You can crash your car into ANY building and attack anyone: this game offers a lot of freedom to the player, in a similar way to GTA, though simplified. *Open world that is easy to navigate and you can go off-road wherever you want.CONS:*You need to install Games for Windows Live (the Microsoft equivalent of steam) to use and save the game*DO NOT buy this game for the multiplayer experience. There is no multiplayer community and the servers are soon to be shut down. Do not let this put you off however, the singleplayer is great.*It was clearly designed for consoles, so the console experience is generally better.*Missions can be repetitive (they mostly involve blowing stuff up) but because the destructible environment is so good, you don't really mind.To conclude, this game is worth buying if it's on sale, and you could spend a lot of time playing it. However, the game is more suited to console, so if you can, I would recommend buying the game for console rather than PC (though it could be more expensive). If Halo married GTA, this would be their child.			",11,3,0,1,2,0,1

												This game is really something else. It doesn't need to be an indie game, or a flash game to really show that it's creative, and just  like other games, for example GTA you have an extreme amount of fun just walking around, enjoying the feel of the game. Even though it's characters, or landscapes are pretty boring over all, what really shines is the game play. It has a pretty good combat with guns, and also has additions to use like a Jetpack, cars and environment. Environment. You might wonder what i mean about that. Because what really defies the game is it's physics, combined with your best friend and companion - the hammer. You can see that the best par about the game is the hammer, it's upgrades, and the destrucion of every object in the world. The controls are great, and you have a big map full of secrets and things to destroy! even though planet mars is a bit boring, the graphics are advanced for the year 2010. If you love third person shooters and MASS destruction, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! (Except for Windows live... god damn, fu*king windows live...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really something else. It doesn't need to be an indie game, or a flash game to really show that it's creative, and just  like other games, for example GTA you have an extreme amount of fun just walking around, enjoying the feel of the game. Even though it's characters, or landscapes are pretty boring over all, what really shines is the game play. It has a pretty good combat with guns, and also has additions to use like a Jetpack, cars and environment. Environment. You might wonder what i mean about that. Because what really defies the game is it's physics, combined with your best friend and companion - the hammer. You can see that the best par about the game is the hammer, it's upgrades, and the destrucion of every object in the world. The controls are great, and you have a big map full of secrets and things to destroy! even though planet mars is a bit boring, the graphics are advanced for the year 2010. If you love third person shooters and MASS destruction, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! (Except for Windows live... god damn, fu*king windows live...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first bought this game back when I was a console gamer for a measly $20 at my local game stop back when I was a senior in Highschool, I think it was 2010.I was expecting a quick 5 hour game that would at least buy me some time to postpone my bordom... man if I had known how awesome it was going to be, I would've made a bigger fuss into buying it for the bargain I got.This game has themes that still hit home 7 years after it was published, And once they got it fully intergrated into steam. man it just kept getting better.Sure the dialouge might sometimes come across as cheesy but the gameplay and awesome story can make me forgive it for that.I still love this game, and I still consider it to be underrated.If you aim to buy this game, I hope your good with a car and can forgive few problems it has, it's a nearly flawless underated gem in my book.

												I played the first Red Faction in 2003 and I loved it. Many years went by and in 2011 when I bought a PlayStation 3, I found this game in a store and bought it without thinking twice. I can say that this is by far the best Red Faction game in the series. Besides being an open world game with a ton of structures to destroy, the game has a really great story too.Pity that Armageddon was the last game in the series (it also wasn't open world) but THQ stopped the series after they started receiving poor sales and later declared bankruptcy in 2012.I hope sometime in the future this series is once again picked up and worked on. Lets hope we see another Red Faction title in the near future.			",168,25,3,15,12,0,3

												This game continues to deliver a constant great experience. With a surprisingly good story, an interesting setting and atmospehere, and the beauty of the Geo Mod 2.0 destruction engine, the game will keep you enthralled and playing. Speaking as someone who's only played the game on PS3 before, I can say that it gets even better on PC. There is a somewhat small modding community, but a modding community none the less, who unlock hidden content, make tweaks and even allow to have godmode.Pros: -You can tear builidngs apart, brick by brick using a wide array of weapons-You obtain weapons such as remote charges that can be thrown and exploded at will, a rifle that disintegrates solid matter, a large missle that causes massive damage, a guass rifle, and a whole array of normal combat weapons.-You really feel like you're fighting as part of a rebellion if you play it seriously-There's a large amount of augmented vehicles that can assist you in the rebellion-It's Open World!-It plays out in a territory capturing kind of way. You force enemies out of sectors by lowering their control over the sector and rasing the morale and support for your guerrillas.Cons:-Buildings take quite a long time to collapse. An unrealistic length of time. This can be tweaked with mods though.-Enemies are too powerful, and you can't hold enough ammo to deal with them all.-No checkpoints on any missions-Buildings don't respawn, meaning that you can't go back to destroy them again at the end of the gameI can confidently give this game a 10 of 10. Playing with difficulty enchancing mods can make the game somewhat frustrating when you die repeatedly on missions with no checkpoints.			",115,9,0,14,12,2,7

												3rd person open world shooter, where you basically just go on a rampage around an earth-colonised mars, during a civil war/uprising. Theres some kind of plot, but the destruction mechanics/physics are the highlight, and put most modern games to shame. Do you strategically place shaped charges to weaken the structural integrity of a building, or take a more direct approach with rockets? Or do you simply plow a giant truck straight through it! Oh the possibilities!Theres a large variety of weapons that start off fairly normal but develop into sometihng verging on Saints Row IV, and of course everyones favourite multi-purpose weapon and tool, the sledgehammer!

												I really enjoyed this game, played it through twice. It is a little glitchy, and buggy.  Felt a little short, but again I really enjoyed it in spite of that. Pretty big world to roam around in. Nearly 100% of the environment is destructible. Thinking I might play it through a 3rd time :)			",96,3,2,15,3,0,7

												Definitely in my top 5 games of all time. I originally had this on Xbox 360 but recently bought it on PC. The PC version is identical to the console version as far as I can tell. This game offers a unique perspective as a member of a resistance force who cannot fight face to face like in FPS games, but has to use clandestine methods to overcome the enemy.PROS:*Great destructable environment*Unique storyline *Original gameplay*Excellent graphics considering its age*Good range of vehicles*You can crash your car into ANY building and attack anyone: this game offers a lot of freedom to the player, in a similar way to GTA, though simplified. *Open world that is easy to navigate and you can go off-road wherever you want.CONS:*You need to install Games for Windows Live (the Microsoft equivalent of steam) to use and save the game*DO NOT buy this game for the multiplayer experience. There is no multiplayer community and the servers are soon to be shut down. Do not let this put you off however, the singleplayer is great.*It was clearly designed for consoles, so the console experience is generally better.*Missions can be repetitive (they mostly involve blowing stuff up) but because the destructible environment is so good, you don't really mind.To conclude, this game is worth buying if it's on sale, and you could spend a lot of time playing it. However, the game is more suited to console, so if you can, I would recommend buying the game for console rather than PC (though it could be more expensive). If Halo married GTA, this would be their child.			",11,3,0,1,2,0,1

												It's a very VERY good game! The destruction is AWESOME!!!So now for the real review.My friend bought me this game and when I entered the game and destroyed my first building I said ""Oh...My...God...This game is AWESOME!!!!!"" Note my laptop is weak but yet powerful. It runs this game ((Lowest Settings)) at a solid 30-25 FPS. And when I blow up a building it lowers down about 2 FPS. Which isn't to bad! =-)All in all this game is amazing! Recommended for time waisters since you might not be for the Story but yet the DESTRUCTION!!!!!! The story is pretty nice as well. With a confusing time line I rate this game 10/10!!!			",24,5,0,1,1,0,0

I played this game whilst it was on steam for free, so it is not a game I would have bought on my own and won't have as much playtime experience with itOverviewRed Faction Guerrilla feels like a post apocalyptic game set on a distant future earth. No actually, its on mars. The game immediatley shoves the emphasis on fun and being able to destroy everything you see whilst gawping at the games great physics destruction effects. Literally, everything you see that isnt part of the terrian (i.e. cars, buildings, fences) can be destroyed using the various arsenal of weapons including explosive charges and your trusty sledgehammer. The story is nothing particularly exciting and SPOILERS will follow. This game isn't based on giving you an intense, jaw dropping story based ecperience and has a pretty run-of-the-mill sotryline. The world is basically being held captive by an opressive evil government, your brother is part of the resistance group and he gets killed in pretty much the opening cutscene (the second one). END OF SPOILERS The characters that the game throws at you are pretty run of the mill, but that in no way ruins the experience of the game. It delivers satisfying destruction and fun gunplay and should not be ignored. Positive+ Great Destruction+ Graphics are OK+ Fun GameplayNegative- Boring Story- Un-interesting CharactersConclusionIf you are looking for a story driven epic, just ignore this game. If you are looking to blow some stuff up and have a little bit of fun, then this game is probably a safe bet for you.			",207,50,1,11,9,3,6

												(Update) The game is pretty much dead and the only people who play it are a very small percentage of blue bars and red bars who mostly party up like Cowards but claim they are good but still are in a party of 3 or 4. Get your shhh right losers. Again, it is way more fun on the xbox and all who say otherwise can stop being pc cry babys. I've played on all three from the xbox to the ps3 and here on steam. Xbox360 rfg is still more fun and a way better online community by far! Anyway this game is still fun a little bit if you played it from other ports like me and even on steam. Yes i do recommend this gameIt's a fun game but enjoy it more on the xbox360 back in the day... The community was better and players had more wars with each other... I know pc gaming is more relax but still not fun to see all the time with everyone being nice... I heard from a friend that RFG is free on the xbox360 now but don't go on any more so i wouldn't know.. Good luck on the game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As among the first games featuring some sort of building destruction system, I easily spent more than half my time blowing random stuff up.

												This piece of interactive entertainment tell us a story of marxist foundation while we take command of a hero that bears, like Achilles, an egregious weakness: this champion of demolition seens to have a hard time passing over debris more than 8 inches high. Nevertheless, I persevered with my exploration to verify what could be achieved with the handling of the myriad of armaments. Before long I observed that every structure could be... completely obliterated. I can hammer down, run through or explode everything to smithereens! To be able to destroy everything feels so... Oh, yeah!... F#CK YEAH!... I'M BLOWING SH*T UP!... Why is this building looking at me funny? TAKE THAT!... Oh! So this tower thinks it is so much taller than me, huh? NOT ANYMORE! MUAHAHAHA!... AH!

												If you like video games that let you destroy things, you should buy red faction guerrilla. It is one of a handful of games that allow mostly realistic destruction. Do you want to take out some enemies by bringing the building they're in crashing down on their heads? You can do that. Just be careful not to bring it down on yourself too.			",120,18,0,10,7,1,11

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Red Faction: Guerrilla is a game developed by Volition Studios and originally published by the now defunct company THQ, now published by THQ Nordic (or Nordic Games) and is also the third game in the Red Faction series Red Faction: Guerrilla is an action packed third person shooter which follows up from the previous Red Faction II game and continues the Red Faction story lineHowever, this time the game moves from a linear gameplay and goes open world which was my least favourite gameplay change in the Red Faction seriesThe gameplay is pretty standard, but lots of fun and you also have a new nifty magnet gun and some powers with the Nano ForgeOnce again the highlight of the Red Faction series is blowing stuff up, and you can blow up all the structures and also repair things since enemies will often be attacking you and stairs and other things you need to access will be goneOverall, this game is a lot of fun and for what it is - you'll have a blast playing by blowing things up and fighting off evil cultists and aliens RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a departure from the linear FPS's that preceded it, Red Faction: Guerrilla takes place in a large, open world on Mars, where you fight the EDF for freedom. GeoMod technology provides for incredibly satisfying environmental destruction, and a variety of missions will keep you entertained for hours. That said, it's a bit of a one-trick pony, but what it does well is exceptionally entertaining.As a side note: I played the Xbox 360 version of this and got it on Steam some time afterward.

												A perfect example of how Windows Live sucks the hind♥♥♥♥♥and ruins a perfectly good game. Red Faction: Guerrilla is a near perfect blend of tactical combat and sandbox smash-em-up, objectives throughout the game involve smashing, crashing, exploding and otherwise completely vandalizing EDF structures and key buildings, you can't help the mirthful smirk across your face when you see a building collapse after dropping two mines on it. Combat objectives come to you via radio informing you of guerrilla warfare or simple defense missions. While purely optional it's a good idea to play through these portions as it provides you with experience, salvage and otherwise keeps the game fresh. The storyline is uncompelling to say the least and the shading is awful resulting in an ugly, bright world. But none of this matters when Windows Live in on the scene, so Windows: Go find yourself the queens plastic sex toys and literally ""go royally f*ck yourself"".			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

The game is a 3rd person view on how much you can clean clock on Mars and the game runs like a dream.  The accompanying soundtrack is ok,  there is lots to do, and it's well worth the price.

The devs did a really great job. The only gripes I can possibly think of are very easily fixed with mods. Once you destroy something, it's destroyed for good. However, there's a mod that brings the reconstructor gun into single player, so you can continuously have fun destroying and rebuilding whatever you want. Also, the mechs only happen a few times through the single player story and are very sparse, but as I understand, there are mods that place these mechs in various locations throughout the map for you to use.

												It's like GTA4 on Mars. Except the setting is a bit boring, there isn't really much to do besides the usual sidemissions and it's reddish all over the place.  But the fun part is blowing up everything, LITERALLY EVERYTHING. Never had such a good time :D The sledgehammer kills look very satisfying and the multiplayer is tons of tun as well. Too bad it's a sloppy port so there were basically no people playing when it was just released (the controls are a ♥♥♥♥♥). The only downsides for me were the accidental kills (like when parts of the building fall down on you, thus killing you) and the extremely frustrating endsequence. Man, that part was tough. All in all I have really high hopes for Armageddon (they're handling the PC version with care this time), and I seriously hope they can pull it off to hook me once more.[Rating: 91/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												A truly FUN game.  There is no one way to complete a mission.  Plant your bombs, run away, and watch as an entire building crumbles, taking out your enemies in the process.  Lay waste to an entire town... there is nothing so satisfying as turning around seeing all the buildings turned to rumble by your own actions.			",124,7,1,0,10,0,6

												First off: Don't be put off by my playtime. I own this game as a retail version and re-bought it on Steam.Red Faction Guerilla is an open world game. It takes place on mars which is being colonialized by mankind and civilization there is currently in the state of terraforming and mining (so don't expect a city like you would in a GTA game or similar). That said, there is a fairly big map to explore with a whole lot of buildings, machines and structures which are fully destroyable. There are driveable vehicles and a small amount of weapons (of which some are very fun to play around with). There are RPG elements like the upgrading of weapons, health and some other useful things. Besides the main story missions (of which I don't want to spoil one bit), you can take on challenges, collect and destroy stuff to be able to buy upgrades. The story is not bad, but the focus in this game really lies on exploring and destroying..and if you're in for that, this is a straight buy for you.By the way: The game was recently patched and got full Steamworks integration alongside with new MP-maps and a great community :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Faction Guerrilla is a free-roaming third person action game set on Mars. This game departs from the FPS genre and while that might offput some (it did for me at first, but I got over it), it does well to distance itself from the failure of Red Faction 2.Red Faction Guerrilla is one of the few games that I've actually played to completion. I loved the original Red Faction FPS game, can't say the same for RF2 and I was hoping this game would restore the franchise. In the spirit of the original Red Faction, Red Faction Guerrilla totes a physicals engine that allows for physics based destruction of buildings. Unlike the original Red Faction, this game actually does produce gameplay around this aspect. The building destruction physics is fairly well executed and destroying buildings can be extemely satisfying.8/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												Red Faction: Guerilla is a fantastic look into the realm of third-world demolition. As you progress through the game, you'll notice the people that still use the buildings becoming increasingly irate at your pre-emptive building removal, to the point where the horrible authorities shoot you on sight and put up wanted posters.In the end, though, as the saying goes: ""It's dirty work, but someone has to do it.""

												For the two hours I played this game, I was in video game heaven. The CD Key thing popped up and the game crashed two or three times before I got it in. Then I played for the rest of the afternoon and it was amazing. You can smash everything! I took down an entire building with a sledge hammer! It is so much fun. But then just a few minutes ago i started it up again... crash, crash, crash, crash, crash. I could not even get past the THQ logo :(. You have no idea how much it pains me to give this a thumbs down but I can not in my right mind give a game that does not even F*CKING OPEN, A RECOMMENDATON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												You ever remember going to the beach and kicking down a sandcastle?  That sheer, cathartic joy of structural destruction crying out to the gorilla in the cockles of your heart, lifting it as that ever so ephemeral archetecture was undone by your besandled foot?  That's this game.  That is so this game at any given point.  Hammer, car, rocket launcher, remote mines.  Car covered in remote mines full of propane tanks propelled by rocket launcher.  All structures are yours to unmake and the joy of it is splendid.   The graphics and soundtrack are about standard, nothing to deride or write home about, but the gameplay.  THE GAMEPLAY.  Beat the game and you get fun cheats to sandbox destroy the surface of mars and everything on it.  The story mode is tolerable and when set to hard enough difficulty actually kinda fun to play through.  The side missions are the oven fresh cornbread next to that cold chicken that is the story mode.  Rescuing hostages in building, destroying a building with the missions weapon of choice, causing as much destruction as possible.

												I have completed this game on Xbox 360 and I now have it on PC (as you can tell) so most of the things here are from what I've expirianced on Xbox 360This game is really good looking, it runs smoothly on low graphics, you are free to do whatever you want, and to top it all off, YOU CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING!One problem I had is when I started up the game the sensitivity was up to 10, so me slightly touching my mouse ended up in me looking up to the sky.But it is really good, and the combat is so much fun, so are the driving mechanics *I just wish you could beep your horn and see your speed*Overall, amazing game!10/10			",101,2,2,4,7,0,0

												Might be best game from Red Faction series. Environment destruction was already a huge step in previous ones, which were linear, but this one here beats everything. You have full freedom over big part of Mars area. Every structure is destroyable. Except ground, no craters from grenades or rockets this time, but You won't complain. Same goes with decent story, You'll be too busy ruining EDF bases. There's also interesting weapon variety and challenges. Trust me, if You ever wanted to punch someone in the face, pick this game instead.My time well spent 10/10			",660,222,18,75,55,7,85

												Most fun I've had blowing stuff up, driving into stuff, crashing into stuff, whacking stuff, knocking over stuff... you get the point. Pros: -Intriguing story, makes you want to finish the game-Extremely realisitc physics*-All buildings are destructible, sometimes I go into a new world and turn on the cheats and blow everything to pieces with the thermobaric rocket... what fun!-Easy to use controls-Open world enviroment, work on the main storyline or complete minor guerrilla actions-Blowing stuff to pieces, who doesn't enjoy that!-Runs REALLY good on low end machines if you turn down the graphics. My laptop barely gets any framerates in most games, like Garry's Mod or TF2, but this game, even with super low graphics settings blew my expectations out of the park, well still looking amazing. I can't even boot up Call of Duty: AW on lowest settings, this game got me 60+. Very well optimized.Cons: -*The physics on buildings are extremely realisitc, as long as the building/piece isn't connected to the ground in some way. A giant building can be supported by a single framing wall. No, not a reinforced steel pillar, not a metal frame, but just wall material. Not even concrete. So we are talking about a multi ton building being kept up by a single piece of plaster on the edge of the buliding. GG. As soon as you hit this plaster, the building falls and looks amazing. Overall 9.5/10. I enjoyed the heck out of the free weekend, and finished the main story in about 10 hours. It will probably take you another 10 hours to finish the rest of the guerilla actions, as well as another 24 hours to complete/mess around with all the other gamemodes. And for 4 dollars on sale, it's nice and cheap. I recommend.tl dr; blowing stuff up is fun m8 buy this			",70,6,0,3,8,0,1

												You ever remember going to the beach and kicking down a sandcastle?  That sheer, cathartic joy of structural destruction crying out to the gorilla in the cockles of your heart, lifting it as that ever so ephemeral archetecture was undone by your besandled foot?  That's this game.  That is so this game at any given point.  Hammer, car, rocket launcher, remote mines.  Car covered in remote mines full of propane tanks propelled by rocket launcher.  All structures are yours to unmake and the joy of it is splendid.   The graphics and soundtrack are about standard, nothing to deride or write home about, but the gameplay.  THE GAMEPLAY.  Beat the game and you get fun cheats to sandbox destroy the surface of mars and everything on it.  The story mode is tolerable and when set to hard enough difficulty actually kinda fun to play through.  The side missions are the oven fresh cornbread next to that cold chicken that is the story mode.  Rescuing hostages in building, destroying a building with the missions weapon of choice, causing as much destruction as possible.  Brilliant gameplay and standard everything else a game needs to be shipped out all in this package.			",249,35,3,28,10,1,35

												If you like breaking virtual♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥ing up Gestapo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the process, you might enjoy this game.I describe it as something like ""GTA on Mars,"" but with destructible objects/buildings/obstacles/structures/stuff and lots of fancy sci-fi, weapons, gear, upgrade unlocks and decent mission diversity.It wasn't the best game ever. Sometimes the physics are a bit wonky. That's to be expected.But what other game out there will let you lay waste to not only the enemy forces, but their bases, structures, and materiel in such a hands-on way? I don't think it exists.Plus, jetpack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10: You are a Terrorist similator.Basically Red Faction: Guerilla is a 3rd person sort of open world shooter set on mars with a heavy, heavy focus on destruction.Do you like blowing up/leveling buildings? Well, if so there is litterally no better game for you that isn't an indie game.The shooting is relatively passable, the weapons interesting, the graphics are definitely suitable, and the story is kind of meh. There's driving vehicles, which handle relatively well although one or two early missions involving them are rather annoying.The destruction though? Well, it doesn't always follow the laws of physics but it's fully functional and fully worth it. The game is basically Just Cause 2 with the tropical setting replaced with mars and the focus on movement and all around freedom replaced with a high fidelity destruction system and sci-fi weapons.If you're considering buying this game, it's $20 so you'll probably be getting your money's worth on this one. The Steam Edition guarentees that it will run on your system without trouble. The multiplayer, while fun, is pretty much dead right now, but it is still fully fuctional in case you get some curious friends together.Reccomendation: If you're interested, buy it.

												8/10: You are a Terrorist similator.Basically Red Faction: Guerilla is a 3rd person sort of open world shooter set on mars with a heavy, heavy focus on destruction.Do you like blowing up/leveling buildings? Well, if so there is litterally no better game for you that isn't an indie game.The shooting is relatively passable, the weapons interesting, the graphics are definitely suitable, and the story is kind of meh. There's driving vehicles, which handle relatively well although one or two early missions involving them are rather annoying.The destruction though? Well, it doesn't always follow the laws of physics but it's fully functional and fully worth it. The game is basically Just Cause 2 with the tropical setting replaced with mars and the focus on movement and all around freedom replaced with a high fidelity destruction system and sci-fi weapons.If you're considering buying this game, it's $20 so you'll probably be getting your money's worth on this one. The Steam Edition guarentees that it will run on your system without trouble. The multiplayer, while fun, is pretty much dead right now, but it is still fully fuctional in case you get some curious friends together.Reccomendation: If you're interested, buy it.

												Such a fantastic game. I played alot of the 360 version back when it came out, and now that I got this on my gaming rig, it is the best thing ever! The destruction is just so satisfiyng and the open world is fun to explore, it also has a pretty decent story about a revolutionary war on Mars! Guerrilla is definetly the best in the Red Faction series, the first two were okay for the time, and the newest one Armageddon just killed the fun with its linear gameplay and underground setting. I would highly suggest this game.			",75,22,1,6,8,0,5

												Fairly open world, nice use of the havoc engine, GUI is not cluttered, interface works well with a keyboard and mouse or a controller. Except for the grapple, this reminds me a lot of Just Cause 2 (single player). I think if you like one you will like the other.A large part of the quests are instanced, but there are random open world quests as well as a ton of stuff to destroy in whatever creative way you can come up with. Story is interesting enough, not a huge number of annoying cutscenes like some other games force on you.  You can destroy an entire planet with a sledgehammer. You know you want it. Get it.

												(NOTE: I have spent more time than Steam says I have, I had a disk version of the game, but RFG used to use Games for Windows Live, but I bought the steam copy because Games for Windows Live went offline a while ago)Mix GTA 5 and Just Cause 3, and throw Mars in there, and you get this game, which is a great game, here's why.The main thing about this game is its destruction, It's the main thing that players think when they think of this game. Almost every building except a few small bridges in the late game areas are able to be destroyed. Sadly, the actual ground itself isn't destructible. And the buildings actually get destroyed dynamically, there is no special animation that plays when a building is too damaged to be able to sustain itself, so the building will fall randomly depending on how it's been damaged, where it's been damaged and what it's been damaged by, which is great. I think you get the point on the destruction and that the destruction in this is amazing.Plot: The plot is meh, I can understand it but it's pretty basic. Since this is a sequal, I won't say what goes on in the previous game.  So, the Earth Defense Force owns Mars and is opressing the people of Mars. You, Alec Mason, went to Mars to mine and earn some profit. But your Brother, Dan Mason, is shot dead by the EDF. Alec Mason, wanting revenge, joins the Red Faction, the group that Dan Mason was in. the Red Faction is also a resistance group fighting the EDF. So, Alec Mason goes around, liberating provinces the 6 Provinces of mars (Parker, Dust, Badlands, Oasis, Free Fire Zone and Eos). I'll refrain from any more spoilers, if you want the ending, either watch a video or play the game to the end.Campaign gameplay: So, you go around the 6 provinces, doing guerilla actions and destroying EDF buildings to raise the Red Factions morale, and lower EDF control. Once you complete all the story missions in a province (Not the guerrila actions) and lower the EDF control to 0 in a province, you unlock the liberation mission. Upon completing the liberation mission, the province is liberated and EDF soldiers in the province dissapear. You also need to salvage scrap to get upgrades and new weapons from the Safehouse. In my opinion, the only upgrades you truly need are Level 2 Armour, Nano Ammo and safehouse fast travel.Weapons: There are quite a few weapons in the game, but I only ended up using 3 of them, those 3 being the Sledgehammer, Enforcer and NanoRifle. The sledgehammer is...Well, a sledgehammer, it destroys stuff and will one hit kill most enemies. The Enforcer is simple a SMG that shoots homing rounds with low damage, and the Nanorifle is a gun that vaporizes stuff.Multiplayer: This game has multiplayer, but I've never gotten into a multiplayer game, so I can't tell you if it's worth your time.Overrall: Great game, A clear 10/10 for me.

I've played through the story 3 times just so I could repeatedly destroy everything.10/10			",240,80,4,21,15,4,39

												I went into this game not having very high expectations, and what I got just blew me away. This is some of the best fun I've ever had with a computer game. Mind you, the story is not very detailed, there are some characters that you simply won't care about as they drop in and out of the story and in most cases that would be enough to turn me away. But when you look past the dull story, cardboard cutout characters and the rest, you will see something beautiful. Just try it out and see for yourself. This is an intense, pulse pounding action game that'll have you roaring with laughter the first time you drop a gunship into a building full of troops and see the rubble come down on their heads. The destruction is just glorious. The backdrop of a revolution is quite interesting, although as I stated earlier the story is bland.Trust me, just play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most fun I've had blowing stuff up, driving into stuff, crashing into stuff, whacking stuff, knocking over stuff... you get the point. Pros: -Intriguing story, makes you want to finish the game-Extremely realisitc physics*-All buildings are destructible, sometimes I go into a new world and turn on the cheats and blow everything to pieces with the thermobaric rocket... what fun!-Easy to use controls-Open world enviroment, work on the main storyline or complete minor guerrilla actions-Blowing stuff to pieces, who doesn't enjoy that!-Runs REALLY good on low end machines if you turn down the graphics. My laptop barely gets any framerates in most games, like Garry's Mod or TF2, but this game, even with super low graphics settings blew my expectations out of the park, well still looking amazing. I can't even boot up Call of Duty: AW on lowest settings, this game got me 60+. Very well optimized.Cons: -*The physics on buildings are extremely realisitc, as long as the building/piece isn't connected to the ground in some way. A giant building can be supported by a single framing wall. No, not a reinforced steel pillar, not a metal frame, but just wall material. Not even concrete. So we are talking about a multi ton building being kept up by a single piece of plaster on the edge of the buliding. GG. As soon as you hit this plaster, the building falls and looks amazing. Overall 9.5/10. I enjoyed the heck out of the free weekend, and finished the main story in about 10 hours. It will probably take you another 10 hours to finish the rest of the guerilla actions, as well as another 24 hours to complete/mess around with all the other gamemodes. And for 4 dollars on sale, it's nice and cheap. I recommend.tl dr; blowing stuff up is fun m8 buy this			",70,6,0,3,8,0,1

												I played this to completion back when it first came out and didn't particularly enjoy it then. I thought Id pick it up cheap in the sale and give it another go, I really shouldn't have bothered.The game has 3 core mechnics, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, driving and shooting. It gets every single one of them wrong.The blowing stuff up engine is probably the least broken in that it can create some pretty good mayhem, but bears little resemblence to anything based in actual physical modeling and can be very frustraiting when a multi-story building is somehow being held up by a single steel beam. All the cars suffer from jello-suspension and handle like cruiseliners, yet are content to move at mach-3. And the gunplay is just flat out cookie-cutter boring, nothing feels like it has any impact, and the enemies seem to alternate at random between being bullet sponges and dropping at the meerest hint of a graze.There's also a tendency for swarms of enemies to roll up out of no-where at the slightest hint of you having fun; combine this with no real stealth options other than hiding in pipes and you've got for one great big bland mess.The game has a story, of which I have some very vauge recollection of the broad strokes, however it clearly left no lasting impression.

												Red Faction Guerrilla is a very big dissapointment on Steam. It must go through Windows Live which is horrible though and throuh, And the game itself is seriously buggy even for a strong compatible system to play it on. The story carries and gameplay follows, but the complications to get this game to work is estatic and frustrating. A real sad demise for such a great game that worked well on console systems.

												Like Armageddon, it has good graphics, great controls, cool weapons, ability to wreck almost the entire environment, and cool weapons. Although Armageddon has way better graphics and is optimized much better. This game lags if there is a ton of stuff  being torn down around me, Armageddon does not lag ever. Armageddon is linear and this game is more of an open world type game, but still mission and objective based so it doesn't make much sense to randomly explore the open world because it is a waste of time since you need to do missions and side missions and blow up points to get a good amount of salvage and push back the enemy to advance the game. It is a pretty good game and is a lot of fun, but it does have some crappy problems.The biggest problem is that it has some of the worst sound I have ever heard in a game. The voices sound very tinny like in Half-Life 1, and all sounds in the game are very low quality, however HL1 has way better sounds than this garbage. The sound is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible.Their idea of a challenge and the only real hard aspect of the game is that you can be doing very well on a mission then out of nowhere you are swarmed with guys and you die very easily so you are going to see game over a lot. Just a little dmg and I am dead so I have to be really careful always.Vehicle control blows. My vehicle constantly takes way more dmg on missions than it should from the enemy because of the sucky vehicle controls. I am always ramming into rocks or buildings and coming to a dead stop which then allows the enemy to wail on me until I get going again, or flipping over/flying into things because vehicle jumping is very floaty. It is pretty much a problem with turning: for some reason, keyboard acceleration seems to be on when driving, so after holding left or right to turn for more than a second, it speeds up the turn and you instead of taking a turn smoothly, smash sharply into the left or right side wall.Game is not well optimized. Lags like a son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ when a large building is being demolished around me. Armageddon never lags and it is a newer game.Every time I alt+tab out of the game then go back, it is in a full screen window and I have to press alt+enter to get it back to regular full screen. Not a big problem though because I tend to not alt+tab out of games that much.If it were better optimized and had better sound it would be a 8.5/10 but I give it 7.5/10. Armageddon may be more linear than this but that does not take away from its fun factor in any way at all. Even though this game came first, I highly recommend playing Armageddon before you get this.Sound 4/10Game 7.5/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												A very fun game. The storyline was somewhat interesting and it has a good open-world. But, most of the fun is just messing around after the campaign. The destruction in this game is wonderful for venting out anger or built-up evil. It has many weapons, unlockables, and cheats. I give this game 8/10. And if you like this game, don't buy Red Faction:Armeggedon. It's practically the opposite. You can't blow up hardly any buildings and it doesn't have as much of an open-world.

Now... the combat could be improved a little, though overall, it feels nice. The only con i would give this is the restricte world you are given.

Same with the second Red Faction. My computer should be able to run this with ease. Other people online are having the same problems I am. Such a waist of money... And its too bad too, becuase on the ps3 this game ran great and was a lot of fun. Its just a terrible port. Great job steam...			",63,3,2,2,4,0,2

												This game is just OK. I play it mostly for the destruction and not much else. Only buy it if it is on sale as the gameplay is not to great and you will die alot due to weapons being underpowered. After some upgrades the game becomes much better but the real fun is in the remote bombs used to blow stuff up. It is a shame that the game didn't have the Magnet Gun from Armaggedon as that gun was more fun to use.			",31,11,0,21,3,0,4

												OMG, where has this game been all my life.One of the most underrated games ever.This game does things that other games should do, but can't do them, because they are lazy, don't know how, and it's easier to do the ""basic"" than something cool like this.In all honest, this game truly set the NEW standards but like I said, it's easier to pretend it doesn't exist and keep making crappy linear FPS's.SO, best way to describe this game, is like GTA meets Just Cause meets Total Recall (the 90s one with Arnold on Mars) meets some kind of destruction/demolition simulator.You can destroy about 99% of all structures in the game, in ridiculously fine, meticulously detail, with gravity helping you.Seriously, you can smash a wall with a your default weapon, which is an awesome, stylish sledgehammer, and put a hole and crack in it, bend pieces, and if you keep pounding, you'll bash out part of the wall. You can take your time smashing everything thing to bits.There is NO ""hit the wall and whole wall disappears"" no, rather, small to medium pieces slowly break off and fall due to gravity into a pile on the ground. You can knock out the support beams, and watch the whole building come crashing down.  The floors might have offices, bathrooms, data centers, or might be a shopping market with shelves of products, etc.But if you knock out the support beams and other supportingp arts, it will start to creak and make sounds, shake, become unstable, and a couple more hits, THE WHOLE THING CRASHES down.It's like watching videos of buildings being demolished, but in a game.You can be in combat, and there's like 10 guys on one floor shooting at you.You can fire rockets and they explode realistically inside, causing realistic damage.Maybe you are a 2nd floor and enemies on the 3rd floor? You can shoot the floor out beneath them and make them fall through.Or you need to make a quick escape? You can shoot out the floor under you and drop through.The game is GTA like in that there is a ""living"" world of people driving and going about their business, and you have various quests to deliver this, get this hear, some of them timed (which suck). You can get vehicles, run around, do whatever. The world is Mars, and the game world is divided into several large areas you can travel too seemlessly (just a couple areas must be unlocked due to the main quest).The game is like Just Cause 2 in that you are up against an evil government that has bases, outposts, and centers all over an area. The more you destroy their assets, the more they ""lose control"", the more your support builds up. The game has main-story quests, but tons of side-quests and things to do.You generally have to reduce the enemy's control in an area before opening up the next (again, you can still go there to some, but will be harder).You can take down their control however. You can attack however.There is no fixed way to do things. You can get some bombs, ram through the gates, detontate them. Or you can perch on a large hilltop or rooftop and fire rockets at them from afar, slowly damaging them and lowering their control. You can then come back later and finish the job or go do something else.It's like GTA where once you start mayhem, there is a meter that rates how ""wanted"" you are, so the security forces start to chase you, but if you can get away and hide.The game has dynamic type events you can participate in, as if the whole war is going on without you, and you can choose to go help your side in a battle or not.So, imagine Just Cause 2 meets GTA but you can destroy all the buildings, bridges, etc. completely in those games, and then pick up the salvage from them to use as currency.The whole free-to-do-it-however is the biggest plus, and you'll never get tired of demolishing the game world. After you beat the game, you can keep playing to with increased difficulty, with all your unlocked items and stuff, so that was cool.The only bad, is I wish nothing had to be unlocked. I beat the game and the later vehicles, like tanks and aircraft, I only start able to be using them right at the end, which is bullcrap if you ask me.And, I wish the game world was even bigger (it was pretty big, I just wanted more!), and lastly, mostly, that they did more games like this.

												Now 100% GFWL-free, I can recommend this game without a second thought.  Nordic went back and gave us the ""Definitive Edition/Remaster"" that other companies would charge you for, absolutely free.  The Steam edition is much more than a GFWL removal... DX11 is now available, several issues have been cleaned up, and there are a few new settings.  The game itself... surely you've heard the praise?Highly underrated, this game is ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING in every way.  Remote mines, conventional weaponry, and a hammer, with full and highly detailed destruction... have fun.  The story is alright, but the main draw will always be wrecking♥♥♥♥♥♥up and bashing EDF members with a hammer.As for the effects... let's just say it would make Michael Bay protest that these explosions are bad for the environment.

												this game doesnt hold up, its a port of a dated console game. the side activities are very basic, and lack of checkpointing makes this game extremely frustrating, because its not an easy game. its probably the hardest game ive played in a long time and some missions i had to repeat 20 if not 30 times to complete. I would recommend you try the demo, because thats really all the game has to offer content wise, its fun to run around and blow stuff up for a while, and doing stuff like driving a truck through the side of a building is awesome, but the combat is just not good and 99% of the game is the combat, not the destruction. Also I would absolutely recommend you play on easy, because even on normal this game is extremely difficult.			",294,55,5,36,18,2,54

												Worth it only to blow stuff up and smack things with sledgehammer, but the developers definition of difficulty is just as pathetic as the fighting system as a whole. Enemies take ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of bullets to kill: Devs screw you by giving you next to no ammo at all times. The sledgehammer is a really cool weapon: Devs ruin it by making it underpowered against enemies, yet it can break through solid concrete like paper? Explosives are satisfying: Until you notice that enemies can easily dodge out of the way and even survive direct impacts. The Guns are ok: worse when you actually play the game and see how frightningly similar they all are to nerf guns. At least there are no annoying missions: Devs include frequent courier trailing missions that are just as bad as the trailing missions in Assassins Creed. You should be able to at least take on bases with the help of your fellow guerillas: The Geurilla AI is as cowardly as a commaderless grunt in Halo, for them to kill somthing is a sight to behold. But seeing it comes at the cost of completing the mission since you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the killing floor level enemy spawn rates that will always include APC's. This game can be fun but the point is you have to really try. The dev's show no snese of logic and it had ended up affecting the players because anything that you find in the game that is fun is ruined in some way that you will discover soon enough. I guess if you have a bunch of friends who can get it as well then it is worth it. The multiplayer is fun but won't hold your attention unless you have enough people and the will to scroll past the dreaded Story option.			",151,6,0,14,2,0,5

												Red Faction gerilla starts from a very good position. The second Red Faction destroys everything what the first built. We do not wait anything from this one, because it starts from deep in the mine... :) The shame is that, the game is bad enough and it can destroy the last thing: our nostalgy factor and dig it's own grave and shot itself into it.There is a great engine ( destroyable environment ), a great place ( mars ), an intrest story and they just trash out everything and built a medicore ( rather worse ) game with the worst game mechanics i ever seen !!! Bonus: they kill the interesting playground: terraforming mars, so it's now seen as an empty dust on earth. A very cheap and badly built one... The result is irritating or worse... with every minute i played just feels deeper and deeper anger, frustration, hate and boringness... After a while ( it is approximately 2 hours ) the whole thing turns into really boring and repetitive without any kind of interest part, fun or anything else. What we have to do is hitting option 'xx' then run back to safe house and start again and again and again... and this continues endlessly! ( as i said: one of the worst game design ever.) The game mechanics also very bad ( not the physix engine and the deystroyable enviroment - that's cool !). Enemy AI is not exist at all, rather they compensate with numbers ( and 'they' stupid like a wooden rod ! :( I hardly break my head but i can't dig up at least one good part except the destroyable environment. :( They done everything wrong...This is the fourth time i come back and try to give some chance to the game ... maybe it dig up something from the deep... but finally all the times i'm very disaponted ! The franchise lay on the ground and volition kick into it again, without a notice. Not worth your money, time nor attention ... belive me you have dozens of things you will do rather ... no.no.no.no!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RF: Guerrilla is an open world action game set in Mars, which is controlled by the Earth Defense Force. The main character joins the Red Faction resistance after the introduction/tutorial level and the goal of the game is to free Mars from the tyranny of EDF.Gameplay is pretty standard 3rd-person shooter, but the twist is the destructible environment. The ground isn't destructible but all buildings etc. can be destroyed. There are also vehicles to drive around, but most of them are quite slow and not that fun to drive around in. The story progresses through missions, which aren't very long or even that innovative. There are also several side missions available, but they repeat the same pattern and get tedious very quickly. The story isn't very good either.Difficulty-wise the game is kinda hard, because you die quite quickly even on normal and it takes some time for the health to regen. However, you could just go to a vehicle for a few seconds, which regens your health quite quickly. You also run out of ammo for the weapons very quickly and then you have to pick up one of the enemies' weapons or resort to the melee weapon. Alternatively you could go to an ammo crate, but those are sparsely scattered around the world and they don't even have that much ammo in them.There is a small upgrade system in the game, which can be used to buy a few new weapons and then some upgrades to them. The ""currency"" in the game is salvage, which can be obtained by destroying EDF buildings, completing missions or by mining ore deposits. I would imagine that people, who like to roam around the world and just do random stuff, would enjoy the game more, but I don't really enjoy doing that so I didn't have that much fun playing the game. The game is best played in short bursts, because there isn't much to do in the game unless you really like destroying virtual buildings. I finished the game in about 13 hours and I did about 45 of the 104 side missions the game has. The main story doesn't take that long to beat, but you must do some side missions for each area before the final story mission for the area unlocks.It's just an average open world action game that isn't much fun to play.  It also has GFWL, which can cause problems for some people. No longer has GFWL.			",389,242,17,63,36,5,88

												This game should have been really cool.  Should have been.  Basically think of a very basic Grand Theft Auto set on Mars.  Throw in completely destructible buildings for the scrap-based currency of the game, and a halfway decent story.  What could go wrong?  A lot, apparently.  First of all, in spite of the fact that the Mars settlements are huge, there's actually not a whole lot to do.  There are 8 different kinds of side missions apart from the story missions, but really they're just permutations of each other.The combat is brutal.  Endless waves of enemies can and will appear during higher alerts, and while the AI is somewhat decent, they will chew through your character no  matter how many armor upgrades you buy (there are only two).  Coupled with a bad or non-existent checkpoint system during many missions should give you more than a handful of moments of blinding rage.  And when you finish the game?  The difficulty ramps up more, and there's nothing you can do about it.  The scrap system could have sold the game by itself, if implemented properly.  Blow up or wreck stuff with a sledgehammer and collect the scrap.  This could have lead to an intricate crafting system, or at least really good upgrades, but the game has neither.  90% of the upgrades are useless, and are the fundamental reason the combat is so difficult.  No matter how many upgrades you buy, the game is just determined to be an as*hole.  What should have been the spinal column of the game winds up being nothing more than a gimmick.  Inexplicably, MANY buildings and structures drop no scrap at all, even if they're made entirely of metal.  So, the game won't even let you grind for the sorryass upgrades they give you. One of the areas the game fails painfully is once you liberate a district, any missions you left aside are cut off until the end of the game.  While a district is still active, many buildings belonging to the EDF yield scrap, and bonus morale with a decrease in control.  While the buildings are still there after liberation, they no longer have bonuses, and are the same as any other structure.  They were very proud of the destruction systems they laid into the game.  It doesn't happen often, but there are times when structures absolutely should NOT be still standing.  I once had a bridge with absolutely zero supports except at one end, and the godda*n thing just would NOT fall.  This can be problematic because demolition is the target of many of the game's missions, and the EDF aren't just going to sit there and watch you wreck their stuff.  The satchel charges you are given never seem to become powerful no matter how many points you dump into upgrading them.  So do things blow up?  Yes.  In an epic way?  No, not really.  There is a social system in place.  As you raise a district's morale, you gain an increased likelihood of random guerrillas joining you in battle.  They are unfortunately completely underpowered, fragile, and won't even follow you into vehicles.  There is also no system in place to take them on raids or recruit them yourself.  You are a one man army the entire game, even when you shouldn't be.  Believe it or not, the most interesting feature of the game is the vehicles.  There are quite a few of them with some very interesting designs.  The game ruins even this with horrid driving  mechanics.  Mars has 38% of the gravity of the Earth, so I assume for this reason the cars tend to slide everywhere like they're on god*amn ice skates, but it still ruins the experience of driving.  Everything else about the design of the game is bland and forgettable.The story is decent, by which I mean ""not terrible like the rest of the game"".  You might be inclined to suffer for the sake of the story, but in general the whole game is flat.			",203,15,1,24,18,0,26

												They really screwed up the game when they turned it into the ""Steam Edition""More like ""steaming pile edition""This game is pretty old, and the original version on steam ran very smoothly with all the settings maxed out except for full screen AA.  Valve or volition must have screwed up something major, because the ""Steam Edition"" turns into a jittery, stuttering mess at random times even with all the graphics settings turned all the way down.   The game doesn't look to be improved at all except the addition of the Steam achievements.   They should have left well enough alone.I don't know about anyone else, but I buy these games to play the frickin' game.  The Steam achievements are secondary.   If you have to screw up the game to add steam achievements, I'd rather there were none.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grand Theft Auto: Mars is one of those games you hear a lot of good things about, then when you finally play it for yourself it leaves an odd taste in your mouth.  It has some good points and bad, and the result feels rather mediocre to me.The thing that this game does best is the destruction.  After all, that's what Red Faction is known for so it better be good.  It's a much more dynamic system than a game like Battlefield 3, allowing you to take out building supports and even collapse upper floors of multistory buildings to collapse the lower floors.  It's also a hell of a lot more fun than the chaos system in Just Cause 2 since you do more than shoot fuel tanks and throw grenades at satellite dishes.  Nearly everything is destructible and it's great fun running around destroying things.  Strangely though, hitting just about anything with a sledgehammer, even foot-thick metal barricades, causes them to splinter into pieces.  There are various explosives you can use as well, but their limited ammunition, even with upgrades, makes them of limited use.  Sometimes the best choice is to hijack a heavy APC, since those drive through buildings like there's nothing there.Driving works pretty well as well, though cars can be difficult to control in the low Mars gravity.  The vehicles themselves are rather unique, taking cues from various rover designs used by Nasa with some Volition style added.  You can find some really cool ones, though they pretty much all function the same.  Many vehicles have mounted weapons which auto-aim at enemies to help your destruction sprees.As for bad things, I found the alert system to be astonishingly annoying throughout the game.  The main way to advance through the game is to destroy EDF structures and do other missions that♥♥♥♥♥♥the EDF off.  When your alert level has raised up, they will constantly spawn near you with 10+ enemies shooting at you at all times, and they kill you very fast, even on normal difficulty.  This results on you being teleported a long distance to a safehouse and having to drive back to resume your task.  Dying during a mission seems to be completely random whether there's a checkpoint to retry from or whether you will have to restart the entire mission.  You will be doing that a lot.With this in mind, I found many of the side missions were designed to be quite annoying or very tedious.  There are vehicle recovery missions where you have to return a vehicle to a safe house.  The game always chooses one 2 sectors away so it takes you 4 or 5 minutes to drive there.  Other missions will put you at a ridiculous disadvantage such as requiring you to destroy 30 enemy vehicles on foot without dying.  I found these side missions so annoying that I just skipped as many as possible.The story is decent, though not terribly well presented.  It is advanced through short story mission briefings and a couple cutscenes with reasonable voice acting.  It's broken up into very rigid sections, where you progress through each sector of the map in sequence.  I never really got a feel for the characters which is unfortunate because they could have been done a lot better.Overall, while running around destroying things is fun, I feel like the rest of the game falls a bit flat.  It's fun, but the frustrating parts really get in the way.			",862,200,24,72,69,9,114

												I really wanted to like this game. I really did. Pros:+Looks pretty nice+Micheal Bay's wet dream in terms of explosions per minute.+Fully destructible environment+Cool vehicle designs+Some interesting weapons that may have been done better elsewhere+Fairly difficult.Cons:- Controls feel sluggish. - Missions and Guerilla Actions are tedious and repetitive.- Story is dumb as hell- Driving feels off, not really sure how else to phrase it- Cover mechanics in a fully destructible enviroment are kinda dumb- Game world is neither interesting nor varied- Game was released in 2009 and still has infinitely respawning enemies (depending on alert level)- not just driving up in vehicles, but appearing from around a corner.- Action does not feel fluid, nor does shooting. It all feels very sluggish and disjointed.I guess this game is comparable to Far Cry 2: It's  got a lot of really cool ideas and engine features, but the game itself is nothing more than a vehicle for the developer to demonstrate that stuff. I feel like ""The Saboteur"" or Just Cause 2 are similar games that are much, much better as actual games.			",236,40,2,51,28,5,53

Starting up this game was the worst part, had to look on the forums to get a fix to have a normal experience, but even after a few fixes the ground/objects/towers/sky sometimes disappear. When the destruction engine is starting up like public traffic the only real destruction you will get is on your frame rates. It doesn't look that good. The AI is bad.

												Personally, I was actually having a blast with Red Faction: Guerrilla when I first started playing. I mean, you get a hammer, and get to  DESTROY  anything that isn't part of the world. You can topple buildings, knock down radio towers and billboards, I mean you can destroy ANYTHING! The game knows this, however, and just DOESN'T want you to have any fun.They try shoe-horning in this massive fight between the rebels and giant evil corporation, which I honestly wouldn't mind, if the story was actually any good. It's so bland and generic, I swear to God. I just want to DESTROY EVERYTHING! STOP PUTTING RESTRICTIONS ON MY FUN, THQ!!!!This game also does have combat, but it's very mediocre. You're only given a little bit of ammo, which wouldn't be bad if it didn't take a million and a half shots to take down one enemy.

												Red Faction Guerrilla was a cool idea. Super-destructible buildings? Hell yes! On a colonized Mars? Total Recall yes! The problem is, while those two elements are cool, they need to be backed up... like, by interesting environments with more than two buildings, or with shooting mechanics that are fun and intuitive. Or with a game engine that runs on the PC. Sadly, the game didn't have much of those. I imagine it was held back by console issues. Fun for a little while, but man, does it get boring. 3/5			",759,224,23,90,104,9,146

												Horrible. Its only gimmick, and the only thing it does well at all, is destructible buildings. Everything else is a colossal mess with things like story missions that are entirely luck, dreadfully boring combat, terribly delayed controls and sometimes even destroying buildings is tedious. I don't remember exactly why, but this is the first and only game I've ever actually hidden from my Steam library. Godawful waste of money.			",47,2,0,4,2,0,0

												This game is a very cool concept but not enough to do in my mind. It is difficult to start missions and not much to do other than destroy stuff. That being said though, it is alot of fun to destroy everything in the world but there is not enough content.6/10			",78,9,2,2,15,2,5

BUT story is terrible. anyway this game has any story?? i dont think so...this game is not totally bad, but after finish RF armageddon i thought this game is familiar + open world.

												While it's a rather fun game, I can't recommend it in it's current state. The destruction is amazing, and it's a ton of fun to bring down a massive building with nothing but Thor's hammer and a few charges. However, it is not a ton of fun dealing with the damn near broken WIndows LIVE overlay that you MUST be signed into to even save your game, or the game breaking glitches I encountered in the first five minutes of starting up the game. After fighting with Windows LIVE for a while, I finally got signed in. When I went to edit my display settings, I couldn't set the resolution of the game for whatever reason. Ignoring this for the time being, I started it up and got into the game itself. Every model and texture was popping in and out like mad, making the game pretty much unplayable. After a Google search and adding a few things to Launch Options in Steam, I finally got it working. However, while the fixes were simple enough, this was a lot of hassle to simply make the game playable. If you're willing to take the time to screw around with Windows LIVE and work out any glitches you may run into, it's a good time, but if you're not willing to deal with the hassle, you'd best look elsewhere.

												This is basically a Free roam game after the tutorial. You can do random missions that come along like protecting a village with a lot of guards. The E.D.F are out to kill you and its all about survival. You can get many different weapons like disintergrating weapons, Rocket launchers, Sledgehammer (Shammer) and Assault rifles and even more! It's all about destruction and blowing up buildings. The physics are absoultely AMAZING! You can bash all the supports of a building or warehouse and with nothing keeping it up, it will collapse. However, some of the building disappears and looks like it is sinking into the ground. There are cars, turrets and later on in the game jetpacks! It is amazing and fun to play. But lets get to the pros and cons of this game. Pros: Awesome PhysicsVariety of weaponsDifferent Car SpeedsTripods are usableBreaking GlassSmashing into housesKilling E.D.FLooks like a massive mapFree roam / Open WorldSide missions / random raid missionsDestruction Races Cons: No zoomed in aim systemLimit of charges early in the game (2 / 3)Less healthNo cover systemNot many weapon casesFeels like a small map while drivingDo i recommend this game? Yes. But buy it in the sale if you are not too keen on Open World and Getting a shammer and smashing walls down and people.  Game donated by:  Smiley  10/10 Y.A			",415,65,11,63,49,7,37

There's really no direction. I got bored within a few hours.The physics for buildings and building damage is amazing, I am not going to lie. It really revolutionized environment destruction.

												Before reading my review, you have to know that I never played the first two Red Faction, and I played Guerrilla after GTA 4 so yes, I will compare the two on many levels.And with that, let me say that personally I found Guerrilla to be really boring and uninspiring. The story is forgettable, every place looks the same (miles and miles of empty red desert and occasionally some building which looks like it was made in Halo 3's forge mode), few weapons, repeating missions, enemies and vehicles which all look alike and the shooting, man the shooting, is so inaccurate that it just made me angry everytime I had to use a gun.Honestly, Guerrilla had all the right card to become a great sci-fi game in my mind, I expected crazy futuristic weapons and vehicles, a deeper story, huge futuristic cities and something out of the ""ordinary"" sci-fi game, but no, it tries so hard to be serious and realistic that it forgot that GTA is also crazy and stupid and that's fun. And yes, I do understand that a big part of the game is the destructable buildings which you can literally demolish to the ground with a hammer and yes that is something that no other game has and I had fun with it but, after a while, it all felt repetitive, and while I was glued to the monitor while playing GTA4, I had to force myself to play Guerrilla, hoping for something new to happen.

												I don't recommend this game at all.  It has nothing to do with the actual game but the programming.  Every time I turned it on, I had to change the window/fullscreen settings and visuals.  Every 2-3 times I play, I had to re-configure all of my controls again.... doesn't sound like much but I play with the mouse on the left side using the 10-key/arrows/right side of the keyboard.Anyways - the 4th time re-programming the keys, I realized... this game isn't worth going through this crap.Anyways I played about 4 hours and I was in the Badlands (area 3 of 5 or 6).  It is a third person - open world/sand box style gameplay.  You basically drive/run around blowing up buildings and doing simple task missions.  To reduce the control of the bad guys over each area.  The combat is alright, the driving isn't that bad, and the missions are random but ok.Not a bad guy and it could be fun because blow up stuff and watching it fall apart is great... but reconfiguring stuff you already configured caused me to flip my lid and uninstall it. :-D			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

There's not enough ammo and bombs, moving over the map (when you press Tab) is too sensitive - zoom in/out is to slow on the other hand. The story is dumb.			",140,17,2,10,3,1,4

												I don't recommend this game at all.  It has nothing to do with the actual game but the programming.  Every time I turned it on, I had to change the window/fullscreen settings and visuals.  Every 2-3 times I play, I had to re-configure all of my controls again.... doesn't sound like much but I play with the mouse on the left side using the 10-key/arrows/right side of the keyboard.Anyways - the 4th time re-programming the keys, I realized... this game isn't worth going through this crap.Anyways I played about 4 hours and I was in the Badlands (area 3 of 5 or 6).  It is a third person - open world/sand box style gameplay.  You basically drive/run around blowing up buildings and doing simple task missions.  To reduce the control of the bad guys over each area.  The combat is alright, the driving isn't that bad, and the missions are random but ok.Not a bad guy and it could be fun because blow up stuff and watching it fall apart is great... but reconfiguring stuff you already configured caused me to flip my lid and uninstall it. :-D			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Worst made game I have ever played. The novelty of blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up (When the destruction engine actually works) wears thin quicker than you might expect. Only thing holding this thoughtless mistake together is the fact you can act out the spite this game will generate on the people and environment located within. Save your money and smack yourself in the face with a rotting chicken breast, you'll get the full experience and save a little cash. Not even worth buying on sale. I've sworn myself to an oath following this torturous♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game, '' If I ever meet an individual who worked on this insult I will abduct, make suffer then slaughter the deranged rat of a human.. If the creatures that made this game are human.. Doubtful.			",95,6,0,9,13,0,29

												In the main game controls do NOT work, I repeat, they do NOT work. I've tried using keyboard/mouse and Xbox 360 Controller, neither of which works, except for looking around. You CAN however do Bonus Missions and Wrecking Crew, but the controls are clunky and don't respond very well, even at max sensitivity.			",66,16,0,34,14,1,21

												Almost 30 minutes and still haven't played it, thanks to Games for Windows Live.Games for Windows Live is a pain. It needs to integrate with a website and/or software you install. Both of those decide to not work at random times, making the game unplayable (well, you can play, but it doesn't let you save).It also associates games with accounts, so if you create multiple accounts and one of those isn't synced with that particular game, the game then becomes unplayable (again, you can't save).This game seems OK, but not good enough to justify having to deal with Games for Windows Live.

												Just Cause 2 on Mars, but half the fun! You'll notice from all the videos that the development team really wants to highlight the demolition aspect of their game. They should! It's easily the best part. If the game just involved smashing empty buildings, a modern update of Blast Corps, it would be great.Unfortunately, it's cushioned by a bunch of cliched game elements that are laughably half-baked. You're regular Joe who gets caught up in a revolution because his brother is killed and blah blah blah. There are some other characters, but they're all just waiting for you in their stock roles when you get recruited. The controls aren't particularly intuitive and the environments are bland. The 3rd-person shooting feels about as sophisticated as GTA 3, with some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rarely working cover mechanics.Ultimately the game would be stronger if there were less of it. Get rid of the underdeveloped aspects and focus on the old-world destruction and this could have been a classic.			",122,30,0,16,6,2,14

												A revolution of moronic AI is not a revolution worth fighting. Red Faction: Guerrilla has not aged well, particularly in its now asinine morale system in which everyone on Mars blames you for every civilian casualty; regardless of if they randomly chose to rally to your aid while you tried to hit and run against the EDF, or were simply ran over by a panicking driver while the future bullets began to fly. Volition does better work in creating destructive environments when they don't hinder or punish the player as they come to pieces like in Saints Row.Outside of an archaic single player riddled down with offensively large collect-a-things and lackluster rewards in the Mother Of All Bombs explosive said time wastes unlock, the most pleasure someone could derive from Guerilla is in its multiplayer. However, that is like saying being drunk can make you temporarily happy; a buzz only lasts as long as the intoxicant, or in this case people, hang around. And as this game only had a spike in player base because of finally becoming steamworks only AND cheap holiday sales, be aware that the current MP population will most likely dwindle within several months, if not weeks.

												I want to recommend this game, but I can't.  First of all, it seems bugged and won't save my progress.  Secondly, it was advertised as having a realistic destruction system where things would fall apart based on where you put explosives, however that doesn't happen.  I've had enough experience with building structures in real life to have a pretty decent idea of which support  beams to remove to colapse a structure, so when a structure becomes gravity defying, it breaks my suspension of disbelief.
