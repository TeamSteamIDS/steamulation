												Rock of ages is a game about rolling down a hill; to squish a little man, literally. In Rock of Ages, there is a very minor story, hardly relating to the game. This isnt a bad thing because the game doesn't need a story to be enjoyed, however the story is humorous. The core gameplay aspect of Rock of Ages is rolling your rock down a slope riddled with defences in order to smash down an enemy gate. The opponents, are not only people from history, also attack your gate and the player must build their own defences in order to slow down or stop the other rock. You gain in game gold in order to pay for defences, and to upgrade your rock. The defences range from towers, elephants, catapults and even bombs. These are used to slow down the enemy rock, if enough damage is done to the rock, it shrinks, dealing less damage. The upgrades for your rock are simple, adding metal spikes or lighting your rock on fire, dealing extra damage. Damage is also decided by the speed of the rock when it collides with the door; the faster the rock, the harder it hits.Rock of ages also has a few mini games, one of which is skeeball. Rock of ages also has trading cards, and very easy achievements, making the game apply to a larger audience. Rock of Ages does things rightIts story is humorousThe gameplay is overall enjoyableEasy 100% achievementsThe co-op is good fun with friendsThe mini games are mostly funThe in game destruction looks goodIts overall very originalRock of ages does some things wrongIt can be repetitive Slightly boring to some older gamersThe Defences aren't overly effectiveThe respawn locations can really mess with the playerLacks real substanceOverall rock of ages isn't bad, it's just basic. The $10.99(CAD) price tag is way too high unless the player is planning to 100% it. Its a fun game to play with friends, however. It also makes the game lots more fun. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like someone threw Monty Python, Tower Defence, and Marble Madness in a blender, turned it on high for a few minutes, arranged it into a delicious dessert, and sprinkled some history on top for flavor enhancement. Honestly, how can you go wrong with a game in which you control a gigantic boulder (of varying shapes and sizes - I must say the fist is my favorite), and use it to shatter your opponent's gate? Even better, you get to squash their defenseless, flailing forms immediately afterwards to an immensely satisfying whoopie cushion sound. If that is not enough to satisfy, there are also trained war bovines, elephants, and mammoths for you to use and abuse in the defense of your fortress. There are also elephant-launching airships..  If you are like me, you may derive much more pleasure from their strategic placement to troll your enemies, whether they be human players (yes, this game has online multiplayer) or historical figureheads. Highly Recommend for some hard core laughter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh man, this game is great! You see, Rock of Ages is actually an accurate historical representation of medieval warfare. Instead of having men, women and children slaughter each other mindlessly over some petty argument, disputes were settled by using sentient boulders. Yes, rocks. As this round stone, you travel through the ages of classical art (t)rolling and smashing everything on your way! Just remember though, you are not alone. Just as it happens, the enemy team has sent away a boulder of their own, and you have to race down with them! Whoever splats (oh god I love that sound) the enemy general, wins.All in all, hilarious visuals and sounds, fun gameplay, some surprisingly complex base defense features and absolutely fantastic multiplayer modes, together make this game a must buy. This game has the Pidgin's Feather Seal of Approval, 5/5 would poop on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a ton of personality, and for me, despite a few flaws, it goes a long way. It really is ""Monty Python meets Super Monkey Ball meets bowling."" ACE Team really knew how to put some outlandish material into the industry. Besides a few annoyances in gameplay (i.e. minor glitches, weird A.I., etc.) and somewhat abrupt ending, the game really is a gem of it's own kind and definitely worth a look.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lots of fun with this game especially in online. Objective is to roll down a hill with enough speed and health to do damage to the opponents gate at the bottom. During time outs, with the money you earned on rolls you and your opponent have to place obstacles which include elephants, fans, towers, cannons and other obstacles on the opponents hill to weaken and slow them down. Sounds awesome, right? There's more modes and much more fun to this game, it's a gem that needs to be in your Steam library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top fun game for a limited time I feelThe multiplayer is really good fun and where all the fun is. When plYing solo I found the game boring, but then only a few rounds of multiplayer was enjoyable. The controls are simple to use with nothing special needed. The graphics are nice and clear, nothing special or serious but the game has a unique graphics setting which is more cardboard like.The audio is amusing and funny to listen to. Some of the sounds are very funny to listen too, from the scream when breaking into base, to the odd balls the game makes. The game is really good fun and easy to get used too, but the multiplayer is where all the fun is just after a few hours I became bored of the game.  Do not get me wrong it is worth the time you want to play because writing this review, the game is on sale for £1 so for that price you cannot complain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since this is on sale right now (20th of October today), I wanted to recommend this game.first of all, it's rediculous. That is already a good enough reason for you to get it. It is just pure ♥♥♥♥ing rediculousness. You control a mother♥♥♥♥ing stone ball that smashes♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh and you're competing vs various gods and historically relavant people. To be more specific, it's basically a two sided race to the opponents fortress gate (you break the gate with your big♥♥♥♥♥rock), you have to get there as fast as possible while also avoiding obstacles placed by the opponent, when your rock has hit the gate or got destroyed by some mean elephant (no seriously, this game had elephants before Far Cry 4), you get to place these same obstacles.Very whimsical, uplifting, and sometimes challenging. A truly great game. Cheap, and easy to pick up and play (levels are fairly short and straight forward). ♥♥♥♥ing buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PresentationRock of Ages isn't exactly the type of game that you'll become instantly attracted to after the first glance, but looking beyond that and getting to play it will most definitely change your impression. The words that describe this game the best would be somewhere in the area of a tower defense with two ends where your only attack option to help you reach your enemy's gate is your giant boulder, boulder that you control. The story mode puts you and your customizable boulder travelling through time and space, starting with ancient Rome and ending with the Renaissance era, fighting different characters from each time and location such as Leonardo da Vinci, Plato or Napoleon Bonaparte. There is no real difference between all those battles except for the map where the battle takes place, but the short, humorous animations that introduce the battle are a delight, as they make fun of anything and everything such as the moment when Leonardo da Vinci realizes that kids nowadays play with boulders in a video game created using ""computieres"". There are plenty of such moments and even though there is no actual plot to tie-in those battles apart from the fact that your boulder is inexplicably rolling from one battle to the next one after you've defeated your previous adversary, you can return to each one of them at any given time in order to collect the remaining hidden keys, improve your scores or simply because you wanted to have a quick laugh at one of those animations one more time. Choosing your character and your boulder is easy and intuitive, having a simple option in the main menu that allows you to select those and apply them to all the modes, including Time Trial and Multiplayer.Rating: 8.5GameplayRock of Ages was meant to be a tower defense game at its core, but that isn't the thing that makes it fun to play, as the boulder rolling mechanic will steal the show every single time you play. In theory a winning combination would consist of a valid strategy in tower defense in order to stop your enemy from reaching your gate and good boulder-controlling skills so you can get past your opponent's defences and crash into his gate, but that isn't exactly the case as for most of the times your defences will do nothing, but slow down your enemy's boulder for a bit and unless you're playing against the AI which is dumb enough to get stuck in random places at times, it is almost impossible for a human being to fail getting past any number of defences, so the game becomes more of a speed test, awarding the fast one to roll his boulder into the enemy gate, using the tower defense mechanic only to buy a few extra seconds. One more thing that influences the gameplay comes in the form of boulder power-ups, which range from the Angel Wings that allow you to perform one double jump to the Sun Upgrade which will deal considerably more damage if you manage to get to the enemy gate with your power-up still intact. After finishing the main story, you will definitely want to play against another human being as the AI's actions are predictable and there's no real challenge in defeating one of the animated characters one more time, and even if you do have all the maps from the story at your disposal in Multiplayer, matchmaking isn't as smooth as it could be, as you can spend entire minutes finding someone to play with and even when you do, it will become boring after a while since the fastest one on a map will always win.Rating: 7GraphicsThe game is built using the Unreal Engine, which makes it a pretty thing to look at, but even so it is far from realistic and the physics can sometimes be weird, bouncing your boulder into a different direction. The crash effects are decent and the boulder damage, while not the best, does its job showing you what you did to your boulder after smashing it into all those towers. The level design on the other hand, makes things seem legit, as Rome will somehow look as you'd imagine Rome in miniaturistic style where boulders are supposed to roll for some reason.Rating: 7AudioThere is no voice acting, but the sound effects and grunts that the characters make sell the ironic theme of the game and make those short animations fun to watch. The soundtrack might not be the best, but it is certainly fixed to deliver the background ambient that fits the on-screen boulder-rolling in each of the stages, making those levels feel authentic to the period of time and the location where each of those characters belong in real history.Rating: 8ExtrasThe story can easily be completed within 5 hours, but afterwards you've got plenty of mini-games, reasons to jump back into the action for the missing keys and the Time Trial mode which will keep you busy for a few more hours if you want to achieve the gold medal for each one of the maps. The multiplayer, even with its issues can be a fun experience, especially if you find someone to play with for a longer period of time so you won't have to go through the matchmaking system after each match. Apart from the Online Multiplayer, the game also features a Local Multiplayer component which allows you and a friend to play all the modes in split-screen, however on the PC version you will need 2 controllers in order to do that, something that most of the PC gamers don't have, and considering the fact that the game only uses the direction keys, the game could have been easily played on the same keyboard.Rating: 7.5VerdictRock of Ages is fun and humours, so if you're looking for something different and with a healthy dose of parody humour, look no further, as this game will keep you busy for hours to come if you're digging its concept and you're willing to look past its flaws. There are limitations, without any doubt, and even with all the content package included in the game there was much more that could have been done, but for what it is, the game can easily keep you and a friend busy for an entire night, doing a bunch of different things and playing with the game's mechanics to try out new stuff.Rating Overall: 7.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Rock of Ages at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=234 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay:The idea of the Rock of Ages is unique, you control a rock rolling over various surfaces to destroy enemy's castle door, the enemy has the exact same goal, destroy your castle door first. It usually takes 3-4 rocks to destroy enemy's castle door. Once your rocks finish rolling or right at start of the game, there will be a period of time where you'll be waiting for a new rock to become available, giving you time to build defense units (towers, TNTs etc.) on the enemy's road to slow down the enemy boulder, or even destroy the rock completely. At start of the game you are given a specific amout of credits, allowing you to buy defense units from those. You gain credits when you hit enemy castle door and when you destroy the enemy defense units with your rock. There are 3 keys laid over every map, after every few levels, you'll require a specific amout of keys to be able to proceed further on in the singleplayer. The keys are easy to get and you can always replay any level, and even if you lose the game, you still get the keys you collected with the rock from the map, so there's no need to worry about the key part.In boss battles you simply are 1 rock inside some sort of arena where you fight the bosses, the goal is to kill the boss by hitting its weak point with the rock 3 times without getting destroyed by bosses' attacks.The rock HP system is quite complicated. The base rock has 3 layers each having some amount of hitpoints it can take before breaking. When a layer gets destroyed, your rock gets smaller, and inflicts less damage on enemy's castle doors, it doesn't affect boss battles anyhow though, except for the rock simply being smaller, making it a little harder to take damage, but also to hit the enemy. There are another types of rocks that you can buy for credits, such as a rock with 4th layer or a burning rock which basically has its first layer set on fire, making it easier to break through enemies, but it can get extinuished in levels containing water, changing it into normal 3 layer rock. Your rock can also fall out of every map, but it'll just respawn on the nearest checkpoint and it won't lose hp at all, so there's no need to be extra careful.That should be everything important I found worthy of mentioning from the gameplay, with that out of the way, I'd like to describe the other parts of the game.Game's art:You start at south coast of nowadays Italy's borders in times of Greek mythology, every new level, you move a bit forward in time and across the map of Europe (Borders of today's Italy, France, Spain and Portugal) , starting on tutorial fight with Hades in ancient greek times, moving throughout the levels all the way to late middle ages, fighting characters such as Charlemagne, Leonardo da Vinci and many more. There are short cutscenes before start of every battle, showing the enemies you are going to fight in sort of comic way, it's up to your personality whether you find them funny or insultive to Europe's history. Personally I liked most of them, but few of them took it too far (fighting the Plague, displayed as some sort of skeletal figure of human body for example). The design of the levels themselves was pretty simple, yet still nice. I could see a lot of effort going into design of the game's bosses. Except for some of the cutscenes, I liked everything from the game art-wise.Controls:I've got nothing to criticize in this part, the controls are fairly simple and work as they should.Performance:I was able to run the game smoothly on a low tier laptop without a single problem in framerate.Other:-The game also has multiplayer, but I haven't had the luck in finding someone to play with.-The singleplayer is pretty short, a good player will be able to finish the game within 2 hours. For average player, like I am, it shouldn't take more than 3 hours either.-Majority of the levels are easy, you can just place several elephants at the same place, and on most of the maps it will screw over the enemy rock's AI in single player, as the rock will get completely blocked and destroyed by the elephant defense units. Some of the defense units may feel much stronger compared to the other. I only found 1/2 of the defense units effective for most of the maps-The game could get repetitive after some time.Summary:Pros:-Unique idea of the game-Almost flawless design of the levels and cutscenes-Perfect controls-Perfect performanceCons:-The singleplayer won't take too long to finish, I'd be really suprised if it took someone more than 4 hours-Jokes in some cutscenes were taken too farFinal words:This is a first serious game review I've ever done. Took over an hour to do. I initially wanted to keep it short, but it seems like I failed doing so. Still only tried to include my view of the most important parts of the game, so hope I did not forget anything. At the time of writing the review, the game is 9.99€ in Steam store, I got the game with 75% discount due to a discount coupon for it I had, my friend reccomended it to me. I definitely don't regret spending those two and a half Euros on the game, it was worth it. If you're considering buying the game, I would say it's worth even its full price, but if it seems like too much to you, just wait for a discount, definitely worth taking at 5€ and less. I'm reccomending this game because the idea and its execution astonished me and I enjoyed the singleplayer all the way through.Thank you for reading this review, if you have any feedback, leaving it in the comments would be appreciated, it could help me if I'd be reviewing another game in the future.

												Roll your way through history as Sisyphus and his boulder. Flatten historical figures and classical concepts. Rock of Ages has a great art style and is a robust tower defense game that offers a different twist on the tower defense genre. You have to both protect your base and attack the enemy’s fortifications as a boulder that can be upgraded. Rock of Ages also has a great sense of humor which is highlighted in its cutscenes featuring both modern and historical references. Overall, it is a rock solid game that is worth playing both for its fun story and gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Comical but short, Rock of Ages is an fun little game filled with humorous jokes and scenes about various historical characters and time periods. It won't take you long to complete (it took me roughly six hours in total playtime, some of that just mucking around), however the way in which it combines traditional tower defence elements with intense rock-rolling action leads to a fresh and unique gaming experience.So, should you buy it?Hard to say. While you don't get much 'bang for your buck' in terms of hours compared to other games, it's nevertheless a unique experience - you'll have to make your own mind up on this one :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A surprisingly good title; looked like shovelware or a C-title but it turned out to be real effin good and original.You control a boulder on its way to hit the castle doors of the enemy in each level. You navigate a map littered with traps and various other items that will wittle away at your boulders size (thereby decreasing the damage done to castle walls). Once the walls are hit, their health decreases-the aim is to get their health to 0 and then squish the person inside. After navigating the course and either suceeding or failing to get to the walls, you're then taken to an aerial view of the enemie's map, with the ability to spend gold for traps to make their boulder's descent just as difficult. Simple game, awesome concept, and great use of great works of art in the character animations. You go through several historical periods of western society, and since the character art is composed of animating still images of historical works of art, there's a nifty change in the art style as you progress through the ages. It's brilliant.And an obligatory shout out to Def Leppard hereshort game; great concept, cheap price; good deal			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. I'm not sure if it's completely worth the price, because there's not tons of content, but if it's on sale you can't pass this up.It's like someone mashed an RTS, Mythology, and comedy all in one game, which they did! Multiplayer can be a bit buggy, but other than that this game has barely any glitches. Like I said before though, it could use a bit more content.EDIT:I also forgot to mention that there's a hilarious text-to-voice feature. If you type something in the chat, it will say it in a pretty funny voice. It fits the game very well to say the least.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Controls remind me of Katamari games, which are absent on the PC platform. So I highly recommend, it's so good that it will make you question why you pay $60 for a game, where you can have so much fun for so little money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun ride severely hampered by performance issues and clunky moments.Rock of Ages has all the right ingredients for being an all timer in the ""cult classic"" category. Goofy premise, unique style, fun gameplay, and great delivery. It all comes together in a great package and niche-feeling theme. Its a really unique take on the tower defense genre. You build defenses to protect your gate against your enemy's weapon; A rolling rock. But the game also features offensive play. You roll your own rock as well. A ball rolling game is a simple concept but still has to control in a satisfying way and this does on both keyboard and mouse and controller. While there is strategy involved, there's also a touch of racing as you try to get your roll and hit in before the AI to get ahead. It makes for some great fun. But the game's faults make it hard to outlandishly praise and even make the simple recommendation difficult. It is plain fun when everything is working right though! And you get a good amount of fun if you go for all the extras and collectables or whatever they are. The game felt really un-optimized for me as performance was lacking. Later levels with more commotion led to severe framerate drops. Severe. Even on the lowest of settings. There's people running it flawlessly on laptops so it was partial (bad) luck of the draw that it wasn't optimized for my toaster. But a quick search showed I was hardly alone and there were people even editing .ini files and such just looking for an extra frame. A little too messy and too much effort for a game that should run fine to begin with as far as I was concerned. So I just lowered the resolution and windowed it to tough out the last third of it. The story mode took me around 5hrs while going for all the extras. Solid length for such a ""small"" game. There's a few other modes left if I were inclined. The bosses while inventive departures from standard play and funny were usually quite clunky. They ended up a test of wills and a relief to finish rather than anything resembling a challenge and satisfaction. And the unique and inventive tower defense side of the gameplay did get fairly shallow once you developed strategies that worked against the AI well. Perhaps the depth truly lies in multiplayer, but that was never on my radar to play. Was a great game to get in a bundle like I did somewhere along the line and I wholeheartedly recommend it if its a deal, bundle or other bargain. But if the theme and gameplay idea isn't jumping out at you, its an easy skip. Its definitely a niche audience that will get the most out of it. With its problems it probably won't win anybody over by actually getting your hands on it and playing. A book that can be judged by it's cover perhaps? I could be off base here. But hey, if the cover looks interesting, take a roll for sure! Sequel in the works as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rock of Ages is Monty Python's Flying Bowling Alley. The gameplay is excellent, as is the art style and the humour. I would make two suggestions. 1.) Use the ghost rock. Even when I was struggling to get the last few keys, I never tired of hearing the rock ""boooooo"" as it fell off the track. This should minimize frustration.2.) Use gold mines. If you use gold mines during the first run, the opponent will get a free pass to your door, but the second time you can load up on defenses and stop them cold.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rock of Ages has faults - it's samey and repetitive in long-play sessions, for example, and if the trailers don't tickle you then there's little chance the full game will impress. However, considering the low price and artistic spark that lies at the heart of the game, Rock of Ages becomes a difficult game to turn down, even if the mechanical side of the experience doesn't quite rival the creative side, and there are occasional glitches with the physics of enemy AI.

												Rock of Ages is a fun game with a quirky style and sense of humor. You play as Sisyphus, rolling boulders down various levels to break an enemy gate, while your opponents (a series of historical figures) are simultaneously trying to do the same to you. Rolling the stone is only half of the equation, though. In between rolls, you also have to set up defenses to hinder your opponent's progress towards your gate. It's an interesting mashup of genres. Aside from the gameplay, there is one other cool thing about the game - the cutscenes. Between levels, you are treated to very odd (but really funny) paper-cutout interludes starring the aforementioned historical figures. The scenes are reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's work from Monty Python, and are very enjoyable. All in all, this is a pretty fun game that works best in small doses (it tends to get a bit repetitive if playing for extended durations). The music is great too! I definitely say give it a shot if you're up for something different.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

'Rock of Ages' is 'Marble Madness' as tower defense. The developer 'ACE Team' is an indie studio, which has done magnificent work to this game. You play as a rock through certain decades of human history. You roll down the track and you get money for destroying the enemies buildings/units. The enemy does the same on the opposite of the level. At the beginning of the game and during the pauses you are able to buy and place buildings/units to stop/hurt the enemy. At last you have to destroy the fortress gate of the enemy as first.Pros:+ Very nice idea+ Humorously story and design (i laughed a lot)+ Retro feeling (Marble Madness)+ Multiplayer+ Achievements (easy to collect)+ 3 different modes (War, Time Trial, and SkeeBoulder)+ You can jump+ Boss fightsCons:- no adjustable difficult level (far too lightly)- there could be more levels/bosses(- no high replayability)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because of the very humorously """"story"""" and the funny art/design.8/10 ",162,77,0,14,21,1,21

												The most unique and quirky game I've ever played, and likely ever made.Made by a team in my home country (Go Chile!), Rock of Ages is an odd hybrid between a bowling racer and tower defense. The game is a sort of duel between you and an opponent (either human or AI-controlled) in which you each throw boulders down a track toward your doors. Between rolls, money you earned from rolling your boulder can be spent on tower-like constructions to slow down, weaken and hopefully destroy your opponents boulder.The game features a huge amount of very fun maps, to the point of which it could've been a full game without the tower defense aspect. The humor is, as said by others, Monty Python-esque, with 2D paper-like animations for characters. The campaign takes you through much of history, with plenty of genuinely funny cutscenes!This is honestly a game I cannot recommend highly enough. It's quirky, sure, but the humor alone is worth the $10. Good luck, and first downhill wins!			",616,214,13,66,80,6,68

												If you want originality, this is probably the game for you. Just think about this :It's a mix of action platformer and tower defense, which is quite a startThe most famous pieces of art in history are used as assetsCutscenes are Monthy Python-esque movies parodying hisctorical figuresYou can crush Leonardo da Vinci as Napoleon. And that's just an exampleMichelangelo's David statue is a boss, and it scratches its butt when boredThis is just a few examples of the crazy things that can happen in this game. And it's not just about the humor : the gameplay is also interesting. To summarize it, it is a duel between two players (using crazy historical figures avatars) who both are on one side of a symmetrical map. The game alternates between a phase where you buy traps to set on your opponent's side, and a phase where you try to roll your boulder down your side of the map.Your opponent obviously has set up traps on your side (as you did on his), and you have to try taking as little damage as possible from them in order to damage the door at the bottom and eventually break it. All of this in real time so you have to be quick as well.It's a bit of a shame that the AI is fairly easy to exploit (a wall with catapults behind will usually wreck it). The AI also isn't the best at laying down the best trap combinations on your side of the map. Because of this the campaign will not resist you for long if you are a veteran gamer. Casuals should like this relaxed experience, though.If you can find a friend to play with online then the true potential of the game mechanics shines through.The game isn't very expensive anyway, so I still recommend it if you don't have a human opponent : the few hours it'll take you to see all the jokes and complete all the solo games modes are well worth it already.

												Running over the course of History with a giant boulderIt has be admired that someone came up with a simple concept of pushing a bolder down a hill and making it into stragety game. In this terry gilliam inspired world you are sisyphus the once banished king of ephyra who was doomed to all eternity to push a boulder hill only to do that exact same thing for the rest of eternity. But one day ol'sisy got the idea to instead use that boulder to escape his prison and from there go on journey through history to challenge famous figures in history against there giant boulders. People such as Vlad the impaler, Napoleon, and... a goat, okay sure why not. The whole game is about getting your boulder down the hill to smash against the enemy gate to literally crush the opposition into a fine pancake and move onto your next challenge. The courses are usually filled with normal obstacles like houses and people, traversing the enviroment for the fastest speed is the name of the game. But when you face off against your opponent they will set up more dangerous obstacles, such as defense towers, catapults, and elephants. All that will chip away at the layers of your rock decreasing its impact and sending it back to the top of the hill for a second go. But while your jumping and cereaning, the enemy will use there own boulder against your fort. You learn by your enemy that you have to create obstacles to stop the enemy boulder. The key being to find spechific spot that will slow down the deadly or just halt it all together. Its an interesing air of stragety and travesel that isn't seen very often in tower defense games. The boulder fantastically designed, its starts off slowly and requires a lot momentum to leave an impact in the enemy door. Those few seconds of falling off a cliff or being stunted by an elephant will cost you time and force to win the match. There are also varietes of the boulder, such as the spike boulder and the fire boulder, that will give you some extra fire power on getting past enemies. And getting past enemies is not that hard as the enemy boulder doesn't seem to know how to properly get around obstacles but a well time jump will get you over nearly anything. There are also boss battle in this strangely enough. Where you have to just aim for the right spot and ram into the bosses weak point to win. There pretty interesting from a design aspect but the gameplay around them amount to little then waiting for the right moment to strike, not really implementing much in way of stragety. Rock of ages is fascinating look into a tower defense game. It has funny visuals, responsive controls, and never really gets to hard in the way of gameplay. It may not be the longest game but if you have a passing interest in running over queen elizabeth, well this is the game for you... ya weirdo.			",368,162,3,30,20,3,35

												Rock of Ages is a fun and ""Rocking"" game (sorry that was really tempting XD. Anyway back to the review). When you play, you make buildings to defend your ""door"" (your base). Soon as your door is broken you lose! You break their door YOU WIN!!! When you have finished with the buildings ITS TIME TO ATTACK!! You destroy their base by breaking their door as i said earlier. Sooner or later the game starts to get harder. Oh and by the way you can customize your own rock and dont forget you can get a trollface rock so you have the trollface on your boulder/rock. Rock of Ages is a hell lot a fun game and definitely worth buying! To wrap it up, I'm just warning you, sometimes the game can glitch and move your mouse to the left corner for only that one defence bit then it goes back to normal. And the game is pretty ragey. I died 2 times on 1 level and I raged so much i hurt my hands XD. But the score that I'm giving this amazing masterpiece 10/10			",113,12,4,5,8,0,7

												On one hand, the story is too easy but with funny videos. On the other hand, the multiplayer is very competitive and requires skills. Nice learning curve, because you need to learn the shortcuts and best places for traps, on each map.You alternate playing a rock to reach as fast as possible the enemy's castle door, and then defending by placing different kind of buildings in the path of your enemy's rock. Everything happens in real time so you have to be fast and vicious.If you have a friend to play with or if you like competition over frustration, this game is totally worth the little price!

												Rock of Ages manages to be totally silly and still be a great game. Obviously made by people with a sense of humor, everything is specially designed to make you smile. The goofy nature of the game makes sure it’s never really taken too seriously while still being challenging in its own right.The game itself plays part race, part tower defense as you and your opponent take control of boulders rolling down separate but identical paths. Each player earns gold which can be used to purchase and place obstacles to slow the progress of the other player. The first player to smash their opponent’s avatar behind their gate wins. It’s a simple premise but each map offers a new challenge to overcome keeping the game from getting stale.The game still looks really good and feels exactly like you’d expect it to. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are a blast, though admittedly you might have a hard time finding another person to play with. If you’re looking for something solid and unique, Rock of Ages is an awesome casual title. Just don’t forget to buy your friends a copy if you’re looking to try out the PvP. ",349,50,5,41,19,1,32

Intro & SummaryACE Team have many of the things I love in a games developer- wit, charm, intelligence, uniqueness and rarity, and most of all, short, fun games. Rock of Ages is a great example, what would've been rolling rocks down a hill at stuff in anyone elses hands, has become a philosophical and historical♥♥♥♥♥♥take with some deep strategy and intense fun in multiplayer. The intelligent parts and humour were just as important for the developers as the gameplay, and that makes this title shine.Highlights* Great sense of humour, reminds me of Monty Python and Black Adder at times. May make you Crack up..* Offers surprisingly deep strategic and tactical gameplay for those who want it* Intelligence and wit that is far too rare in gamesMistakes* Slightly repetitive at times, needs to keep Rolling faster* This game isn't as hard as rock, it's too easy at timesRecommendationsRock of Ages is available for £6.99 / 9.99€ / $9.99 and routinely goes on sale for up to -80%. With a 5 hour campaign and an even better multiplayer experience, it's definitely worth a buy when on sale.* The soundtrack is pretty good, and included for free* You can unlock the Trollface boulder skin by winning a multiplayer War match ",632,194,19,62,47,5,80

												I'll start by saying that if you're a fan of Monty Python, this is for you.I am sadly late to the party on this, but.. This game honestly stands out from most of my library just in the way of it spewing out the best form of crude humor, where fart jokes actually are well done, quite a rare find in anything, especially with how they seem to be thrown around now-a-days because of a target audience they seem to want to attract but it's not pulled off in any form of decent or amusing way, it's just there for the sake of being there. Now that being said on with my ramblings.It steps out of the normal kind of game and steps into a comic like take on historic figures such as Plato and Aristotle, Napoleon, Leonardo Da Vinci etc, made into a tower defense video game, developed by the ACE Team. You are Sisyphus, a deceased character that was doomed to eternally rolling a cursed boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down before it can reach the top (Yes, I brushed up on my history for this), you suddenly get the bright idea to break out of your hell to then be the one rolling boulders over historical figures and amusingly squish them before they can squish you.. Which I must add, is more than satisfying. Especially with the little girly squeal.The multiplayer is also an amusing little add with being able to squish friends or just random people in other lobbies. It's not only amusing but quite challenging due of different play styles which also goes through in story mode as each historical figure has different tactics and items they use more of. Time trials are a good way to get familiar with maps to get the fastest time around each track finally we come to skeeball, just when you thought this game couldn't get any better, they add in carnival games to the mix. What more needs to be said.Rock of Ages is definitely one of the most unusual games I have played but one of the best. Sadly a bit short and lacking in the levels department in my opinion as I could have gone on for at least another 10 or so levels, but with solely that whinge aside, it is a perfect balance of amusing and challenging but not punishing and tedious.. I have not come across a game like that for quite some time. Honestly, this game is glorious and I would recommend it to anyone.			",385,129,19,39,53,4,53

												On one hand, the story is too easy but with funny videos. On the other hand, the multiplayer is very competitive and requires skills. Nice learning curve, because you need to learn the shortcuts and best places for traps, on each map.You alternate playing a rock to reach as fast as possible the enemy's castle door, and then defending by placing different kind of buildings in the path of your enemy's rock. Everything happens in real time so you have to be fast and vicious.If you have a friend to play with or if you like competition over frustration, this game is totally worth the little price! (Although these days the multiplayer is probably not populated anymore)			",298,94,0,14,14,0,29

												Rock of Ages manages to be totally silly and still be a great game. Obviously made by people with a sense of humor, everything is specially designed to make you smile. The goofy nature of the game makes sure it’s never really taken too seriously while still being challenging in its own right.The game itself plays part race, part tower defense as you and your opponent take control of boulders rolling down separate but identical paths. Each player earns gold which can be used to purchase and place obstacles to slow the progress of the other player. The first player to smash their opponent’s avatar behind their gate wins. It’s a simple premise but each map offers a new challenge to overcome keeping the game from getting stale.The game still looks really good and feels exactly like you’d expect it to. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are a blast, though admittedly you might have a hard time finding another person to play with. If you’re looking for something solid and unique, Rock of Ages is an awesome casual title. Just don’t forget to buy your friends a copy if you’re looking to try out the PvP. ",349,50,5,41,19,1,32

												+ Silly/fun all round; graphics, gameplay, audio and concept+ Quite a unique idea for a game- A little too buggy for my tastes - hard to control boulder with lots of pathing issues- Defense mechanisms seem pretty useless.Conclusion:Fun and simple game. Not really something I'll play a lot of but I can appreciate the positives. There's nothing to really stop me from recommending you to buy this, if it tickles your fancy and has the right price.

												it's becoming more frequent that a company so console-minded opens up to PC crowds, but sometimes the results can end up in bad ports and games.This was not the case.I enjoyed immensely every little aspect that this game had to offer:FIrst: the design. I never seen before a game designed on the old history books illustrations, and even if they are not that pleasant to the eyes of whom is addicted to the digital, in Rock of ages finds new light. With monty-python inspired comedy cutscenes and various cameos througout the game, it certainly rips a chuckle during the fun gameplay.Second: the gameplay.It's original genre cannot really be defined. It can gather people who love racing games and at the same time who hates it. Part of it is dedicated to the rock rolling towards the door, trying to avoid the obstacles placed by our nemesis. The other half involves you actually placing those obstacles against the rock of your own nemesis. Important of this kind of gameplay, as deducted, is guided by the multiplayer. And Atlus knew it well. In fact this is one of the few gems to support local split screen multiplayer on PC, Needless to say i've had the most fun i've ever experienced when i brought a friend home to play.Soundtrack, graphics and the whole game itself is neatly served to be enjoyed with the rest of the game, only cons? It can get boring after some hours of gameplay, thankfully Atlus provided the game with 20 maps all very different one another.8.5/10			",329,52,12,22,23,4,39

												Rock of Ages is a charming, humorous, and highly original game.The basic premise is this: you control a boulder rolling across a twisted battlefield of ramps, obstacles, and enemy traps. Your aim is to destroy your opponent's gate.As you destroy your opponent's defenses, you accumulate money to spend on building upgrades. These upgrades can be either single-use power-ups for your boulder to make it stronger or more deadly. Or, you can spend the money on defenses like elephants, dynamite, and catapults that can knock your opponent's boulder off the map. You get to place these obstacles wherever you want on the map.So, on one hand RoA is like a wacky driving game, but on the other it is like a tower defense game. The balance between these two is perfect -- it is fast-paced and really executes the central mechanics well.Where the game really shines is the campaign and art direction inspired by Art History. Each level has you progress from ancient Greece, across Europe and through various artistic styles. In Italy, the levels have a High Renaissance art theme. There is Rococo in France and a Romantic (Goya-inspired) theme in Spain. And each level unlocks a new type of defense (dynamite, flying machines, ). for you to place in your. Perhaps the only issue is difficulty: it may be too easy as the AI is good at placing defenses but not so great at driving its boulder. But if you want more of a challenge there is always the multiplayer or the time trial mode (with scoreboards), so the game does not get old.Basically, if you like the look of the game from the trailers -- get it! It delivers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just want to say this one got me replacing my keyboard and milk after my boulder made a ""Bzffplt"" on Agamemnon.Relatively simple game, with VERY funny soundtrack and humorous story. Gameplay is fairly simple. You roll boulders to the other's fortress door until it breaks down, and you score by killing the historical or mythological MVP inside. The very simple yet surprisingly fun game with artstyle geniusly rehashed from real historical artwork for comedic effect, the depth of the game as you actually need to build obstacles to block enemies' boulders as they will do the same to you, and the great physics combined into the game make up for either a great time, or a frustrating one. Depends on you. I think I bought this on a discount, cheap ol' me. But god dang this one always gave me a good laugh and a light, good fun whenever I open it. Consider getting it for your kids. Just remember not to press too hard on the keyboard when directing the boulder, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was just pure enjoyment for me from beginning to end. It's fairly short and even if you do all the content you'll still probably be finished with the game in less than 20 hours. It's just a very silly and fun game though.It controls kind of like Marble madness. It's a racing game where you control a giant boulder and have to try and make it to the end of the stage without getting the boulder damaged. This is harder than it sounds because while you are trying to make it to your opponent's castle to destroy it, they are trying to make it to yours.You can place traps down to mess up the other boulder. These are things like giant fans to blow it off the stage, elephants to crush it, and canons to blast it off track.This game has a great sense of humor and makes countless references to classic artwork and history.

												Rolling giant boulders downhill smashing all that stands in their way ought to be immensely fun. Somehow, it isn't here. They've done this weird vs. approach where you and an opponent throw boulders down the slope at each other's gates, first one smashed loses, and that's good enough for an arcade game. Along the way you smash dwellings, inhabitants, and similar bric-a-brac to get money, which buys you fortifications you can use to defend your gates against your opponent's rock.Problem is, the fortifications don't actually do much of anything to deter an incoming boulder—maybe they would if you had time to lay out defenses strategically, but because everything takes place in real time you're never given the chance to build your defenses with any kind of deliberation. So with the vast majority of the game's mechanics going un- or underused, it becomes a mad rush to launch your boulder first. Which quickly becomes less than interesting. It's entirely possible that the available defenses become more useful and engaging to play with in later levels, but the game doesn't hold my interest long enough to get at them. Which is really too bad. The art and sound design are unreservedly fantastic, with this great whimsical Terry Gilliam Python-era animation thing happening. I just wish the game was as much fun to play as it is to look at.			",121,17,0,8,7,2,5

												It's not easy to compare Rock Of Ages with anything else I've ever played. A single look at the game trailers should hint that not many games are quite as absurd and satyrical. My best attempt at a comparison would have to be a 3d version of Marble Madness with elements of Realtime Strategy. In short, players go back in history to build an obstacle course for their foe. As both players hasten to roll down the hill, they try to avoid obstacles and gather momentum in order to smash the enemy's gate and be the first to roll over their opponent. Storymode is fun and challenging on its own, but it's also a lot of fun to challenge your friends. Guaranteed to make you laugh, the Unreal Engine makes this a real joy to play!

												Rock of Ages is one of these games which have a big aesthetic appeal, I really enjoyed pretty much every graphic in the game, how well they did fit for each stage and the variety of them.Gameplay is good, Your rock feels nice, controls are tight and boss battles were pretty creative and funThe audio is a really strong point too since the music and voices in this game is pretty cheerful and funny for the most part, It helps to create a good atmosphere in the game and it works pretty well.The multiplayer has various modes which are fun to play, There's a big advantage if you have played the maps beforehand but nothing game breaking, I didn't experience any issues with lag, desynch or anything else.I felt that the game overextended a bit and some keys where chore-some to get and 100% completion wasn't was fun as it should, I had to finish the game playing it in short bursts because it didn't kept me engaged enough.Pretty fun nonetheless, It's worth picking up in a sale.

												This is quite an interesting strategy game, in which you repeatedly fling a big rock down a hill to smash in the gate of your opponents castle. In between each roll you then set up defences and obstacles along your hill in order to slow, or destroy, the other players boulder. There are a number of types of defence units to choose from, like walls, turrets, bombs and resource farms, that can all be used in various momentum-killing combinations. On top of this you also have to decide - do you buy the new expensive wall? Or do you eschew building defences and instead spend the money on setting your boulder ablaze? The upgrades provide a bit of risk/reward. So in Rock of Ages a match will stress your strategic-thinking, time management, platforming and the actual steering a heavy rock down a hill.The game does have it's flaws, including some incredibly tedious boss battles, and none of the different systems run particularly deep. But as a whole, the game is made up of so many different game-mechanics cobbled together in such a fun way, that it is well worth having a try. I'd keep an eye out for it in the sales.

												While ""Rock of Ages"" tries to be a strange combo of ""Marble Madness"" and a tower defense game, the tower defense portions of the game are a bit half baked. The game basically consists of two players building defenses along a track to prevent the other from breaking down their castle doors with player controlled boulders. While this sounds good in theory, in practice the defenses are mostly so weak that PvP games usually just boil down to whoever can rush to hit the other player's door 3 times first, rendering placement of defenses mostly moot.However, I still had fun with ""Rock of Ages"" mainly because its ""Marble Madness"" portions play so well.  Barreling down a path as a boulder, avoiding obstacles, collecting keys, and crushing everything else in your wake never gets old. Plus, the single player campaign (a humorous tour through history with an incredibly well realized Terry Gilliam-esque aesthetic) is one of the most amusing and creative things I played all last year.

												[FIN] Aivan loistavaa... siis oikeasti PARASTA mitä oon pitkään aikaan pellaut. Ostin siis alennuksista (2,00€ paikkeilla) ja olisin helposti voinut maksaa täyden hinnan (8,00€ paikkeilla). Arvostelu: + Grafiikat, jotain mahtaava (Siis mitä nyt tältä peliltä voi olettaa(ei kuitenkaan päihitä esim Crysis 3 tms)) + Kaikki sellaiset ""kopiot"" esim THIS IS SPARTAAAA ovat sellainen hauska lisä peliin :) - ainut on että peli olisi alusssa voinut neuvoa miten tehdä hyvä puolustus. Jälkikommentit Aivan loistava suisittelen 9/10 Kannattaa ostaa.[ENG] Absolutely fantastic... really BEST what I have played a long time. I bought this from sales, about 2,00€ and it's just a robbery that you pay 2€ I could pay the 8€ easily, just so awesome. Good things about this game is Graphics, or what you can expect from this game. And the ""copies"" like THIS IS SPARTAA makes this game lots of funnier :) one minus about this games is that it could teach ""How to make better defence."" So I really liked this game and I hope you buy this game, and it's very fun game when you are bored. I rate this game 9 out of 10 and mark with ""Definitely should buy"" Thank you :) PS. If I have done something wrong you shuld definitely be grammar-nazi for me, I have nothing wrong to get better at english			",68,0,3,1,6,0,1

												Rock of Ages is a strange tower defense game of some sort: in every match you will spend your time between making a huge rock slide towards your enemy door, in order to damage it, in a platform, third person fashion, and examining the battlefield from an aerial view, to set up defenses (towers, animals, explosives, ...) against the enemy rock.In truth, the main appeal of Rock of Ages is its art style: a Monty Pythonesque adventure taking place in different time periods (Ancient Greece, the Medieval Age, Italian Renaissance, Baroque, XIXth Century), with plenty of artistic references and a catchy soundtrack.Gameplay-wise, you can choose between a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer experience. The AI for the first trips more than once, but it can be challenging nevertheless (more specifically, your enemy will be far less elastic than you in dodging obstacles and defenses, and later elephants will stagger his/her rock ad infinitum). Aside from the campaign, you have a challenge mode too.I suggest you Rock of Ages if you are going to enjoy the artistic, pop-culture and history references, or you just enjoy a rather good indie game			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												A very charming mix of Katamari Damacy and Tower Defense. The controls are tight, the premise is unique, and the singleplayer campaign is a complete blast. I had a lot of fun with this for a few days. Unfortunately, once said singleplayer campaign is done, there isn't a whole lot of interest left to do, and multiplayer is decidedly dead. Decide how much 6 hours of fun is worth to you, then pick this game up if it's equal to or less than that amount, and brace yourself for a fun, but brief, ride.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a bit of tower defense against a giant rolling ball...Think marble madness with a bit of light humor to it.There are different game modes, but mainly two main game perspectives to play from.The first perspective is of the marble ball. Your objective is usually to reach the end of an obstacle course with enough momentum to break into the finish line. There's a few little twist to make it interesting, such as an skeeball like target at the end of the course.The second perspective is building the course. You usually given resources to build towers and other defensive structures to slow down your opponent.It's fun silly competitive game. Each match usually last less than 20 minutes. And they even have funny options for your marble ball, such one of them is just a cube.Would make for a great mobile game, but unfortunately the current player base is slim.			",94,21,0,12,6,0,17

												It's not easy to compare Rock Of Ages with anything else I've ever played. A single look at the game trailers should hint that not many games are quite as absurd and satyrical. My best attempt at a comparison would have to be a 3d version of Marble Madness with elements of Realtime Strategy. In short, players go back in history to build an obstacle course for their foe. As both players hasten to roll down the hill, they try to avoid obstacles and gather momentum in order to smash the enemy's gate and be the first to roll over their opponent. Storymode is fun and challenging on its own, but it's also a lot of fun to challenge your friends. Guaranteed to make you laugh, the Unreal Engine makes this a real joy to play!

												Rock of Ages is a strange tower defense game of some sort: in every match you will spend your time between making a huge rock slide towards your enemy door, in order to damage it, in a platform, third person fashion, and examining the battlefield from an aerial view, to set up defenses (towers, animals, explosives, ...) against the enemy rock.In truth, the main appeal of Rock of Ages is its art style: a Monty Pythonesque adventure taking place in different time periods (Ancient Greece, the Medieval Age, Italian Renaissance, Baroque, XIXth Century), with plenty of artistic references and a catchy soundtrack.Gameplay-wise, you can choose between a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer experience. The AI for the first trips more than once, but it can be challenging nevertheless (more specifically, your enemy will be far less elastic than you in dodging obstacles and defenses, and later elephants will stagger his/her rock ad infinitum). Aside from the campaign, you have a challenge mode too.I suggest you Rock of Ages if you are going to enjoy the artistic, pop-culture and history references, or you just enjoy a rather good indie game			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												I'd say that this game rocks, but that'd be going for the obvious pun. It's a game worthy of the ages- I'll shut up now.This game is pretty simple; you roll down a hill and wreck things to ultimately kill somebody with a giant rock. If you're a fan of Super Monkey Ball and silly gameplay then this is probably something I'd reccomend.			",106,8,0,17,11,1,6

												In rock of ages you switch between rolling a huge boulder against the enemy gate and building up your defenses to prevent the enemy boulder from doing the same to you. preventing only comes very late in the game with the most powerful defenses, until then its mostly trying to slow down the enemy as much as possible so that you are the first to crash their gate and roll them over. in between missions in singleplayer there are short cutscenes where historical figures and pop culture references are mixed together while having the artstlye of the specific time, this only serves for amusement and to introduce the new enemy though there is no higher plot. contentwise you cant really get more than 7 hours out of the campaign. even when going the completionist approach and collecting all keys (and some of those are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get) The campaign contains 23 missions, 3 of which are bossfights. there is a bunch of different turrets that have 3 levels. this is not a normal tower defense though, since you are just fighting one boulder, which can also just crush everything you built. there is also 5 types of boulders that still come down to crush everything then crush the gate.  Still this is a fun game that I'd say is easyly worth 5 dollars. I can only speak for the campaign though, because I havent tried any other mode.			",265,56,0,58,16,2,53

On sale it has the most vaule.Howoever,it can be boring,defenses aren't good,respawns messed up and substance ins't very real.If you like a game where action and balance is your thing,buy this one.

												You might have played tower defense games like Kingdom Rush.  You might have played reverse tower defense games like Anomaly: Warzone Earth.  But have you played one that has both?  That's what Rock of Ages is about.  In each level, you control a boulder and the objective is to knock down the enemy's gates by repeatedly running your rock into it.  The problem is that to get there, not only do you have to navigate your boulder through a winding course in a physics-based game, the enemy is continuously setting up devices to block your way such as catapults and elephants with stone towers on their backs.  If your rock is damaged enough, it loses mass and will do less damage to the gate and if it's damaged even more, it can eventually break apart.  Not only that, but you have your own gate and the enemy has his own boulder.  So now you have a tower defense game, reverse tower defense game, and a racing game all packaged up into one as you and your opponent are trying to outdo each other in defenses while trying to destroy each other's gates as fast as possible.  This was a surprisingly fun game with many unique levels and ideas that gets even better with the fact that it has not only online multiplayer but local as well.  It also helps that the campaign story has a great sense of humor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bet you've never played a game as weird and off the wall as this one. Sure, you may have seen your fair share Japanese zombie dating sims, but that is case a of cultural difference. This game, is really, very, extremely weird. Rock of Ages is a bizarre mix of platforming and tactics. You play as Sisyphus, a former king from Greek mythology who trapped in hell, where he is doomed to roll a boulder up a hill, only to see it roll down again time and time again. One day though, Sisyphus snaps and he is done with his torture. He takes his boulder and rolls it over Hades, promptly killing him and he immediately escapes Hell. So begins the destruction of the entire history of europe as you roll your boulder over famous names like Charlemange, Napoleon, Leonidas and even Gods and Angels. You play the game like you play Monkey Ball. You roll a ball down the hill. You can control the ball, and you can make it jump. The goal is to smash the enemy's gate, while you try to stop the enemy from smashing your gate. You can do this by building obstacles in your opponents path. Obstacles like fortress towers, siege equipment, cow launchers, explosive barrels and elephant soldiers. All in all, the game itself is rather simple in its execution. It is the presentation that sells it.Talk about creative use of preexisting material. The entire artsyle is based on classical, antique, medieval, renaissance, and enlightenment paintings. The soundtrack is comprised of geniously remixed versions of classical pieces by Mozart, Beethoven and others. The sheer outlandishness of the style will take you by surprise and will keep you entertained throughout the entire length of the game. Which isn't all too long, unless you go full masochist and try to collect all hidden items. Or you can indulge in multiplayer duels. That's nice and all, but I think this game is so silly you should just try it for kicks.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												You might have played tower defense games like Kingdom Rush.  You might have played reverse tower defense games like Anomaly: Warzone Earth.  But have you played one that has both?  That's what Rock of Ages is about.  In each level, you control a boulder and the objective is to knock down the enemy's gates by repeatedly running your rock into it.  The problem is that to get there, not only do you have to navigate your boulder through a winding course in a physics-based game, the enemy is continuously setting up devices to block your way such as catapults and elephants with stone towers on their backs.  If your rock is damaged enough, it loses mass and will do less damage to the gate and if it's damaged even more, it can eventually break apart.  Not only that, but you have your own gate and the enemy has his own boulder.  So now you have a tower defense game, reverse tower defense game, and a racing game all packaged up into one as you and your opponent are trying to outdo each other in defenses while trying to destroy each other's gates as fast as possible.  This was a surprisingly fun game with many unique levels and ideas that gets even better with the fact that it has not only online multiplayer but local as well.  It also helps that the campaign story has a great sense of humor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This certainly was a unique game. Art style and art direction took a turn for the humourously surreal. Gameplay is simple to learn but there are some difficulty spikes every now and then (if you don't know how to roll a ball down a hill, now would be the right time to start learning.) and choosing the boulder you will use will sometimes result in added artificial difficulty. Rolling cubes down hills, very difficult stuff right there.I enjoyed the ride and i'll play it again as soon as the fever dreams end.10/10 would roll you down a hill.			",426,66,10,61,38,5,34

												I have not yet played the multiplayer option, but I can say that I was incredibly surprised from even the start of the game. Rarely do game trailers accurately reflect the hilarity and fun factor of a game, so I did not expect anything like what the trailer shows. Boy, was I wrong about this one. This game is simply incredible. Hilarious, one of the best soundtracks of any indie game I've ever played, and clearly inspired by the animations that are everpresent in Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes and beyond. At twice the price, this game would be a good buy, at the regular price, it's a downright bargain. I think that this game would be much more popular if there was some way for people to know what they're getting into. This is hilarity and fun at its finest. My only, very minor complaint is that the controls can be a little bit difficult. However, you're guiding a giant boulder, so I weigh in on that as being built in to make the game challenging. Less than an hour in and, already, it's one of my favorite indie games. This is really saying something, at least for me. 9.5/10 - I simply will not have a better time than I have in just a half hour of playing this game. Fun, fun, fun, fun, hilarious, and fun.

												As a Christmas present from my brother, I could easily assume that: a) he bought it because he thought I'd like it, b) wanted to buy me the game to see if it was good enough for him to buy or c) was a game he thought HE would like so that automatically meant I would like it for some reason; therefore, I initially wondered if I'd even enjoy ""Rock of Ages"".Well, I DO like it. In fact, I love it!The principle is simple: Roll a giant boulder down a hill and break down your opponent's barricade before they do the same thing to you. It also has a convenient 'skee-ball' mode.While optimally enjoyed in short bursts of play, ""Rock of Ages"" can be surprisingly intense. The ""Monty Python"" style of humor keeps the simplistic gameplay from getting too stale or boring and the graphics are not only clever but implemented very well. The storyline is entertaining and even gives you a bit of a contrived history lesson.You'll get plenty of LOL's playing this one. It's a gem of a time-waster.			",133,113,2,17,13,2,11

												Here's a final edit after completely beating this game.If we only look at the game as a singleplayer game then I can say it's an odd but humorous experience, had a couple of crashes when minimizing the game, but other than that it's a stable and beautiful game. The whole concept of the game is to crash into the gate of your adversary's palace/castle and squash them with the boulder and repeat x number of levels, with the exception of boss levels and that enemies get tougher as you progress, also -if it matters- each one has their one special map/track, but the story is what is supposed to make the levels less repetitive through the cutscenes before each level, however I can't say it wasn't a bit boring at times.Other than the story mode, there are two other modes, skeeboulder which is basically skeeball with a boulder, and time trial.The multiplayer feature is a sad thing because it's optimized for fridges and hardly improved after the efforts to try and fix it.Recommending this one -on sale- because of the fun it offers despite having a bad multiplayer feature, but still hoping that they fix that damn thing after 5 years ._.

												As a Christmas present from my brother, I could easily assume that: a) he bought it because he thought I'd like it, b) wanted to buy me the game to see if it was good enough for him to buy or c) was a game he thought HE would like so that automatically meant I would like it for some reason; therefore, I initially wondered if I'd even enjoy ""Rock of Ages"".Well, I DO like it. In fact, I love it!The principle is simple: Roll a giant boulder down a hill and break down your opponent's barricade before they do the same thing to you. It also has a convenient 'skee-ball' mode.While optimally enjoyed in short bursts of play, ""Rock of Ages"" can be surprisingly intense. The ""Monty Python"" style of humor keeps the simplistic gameplay from getting too stale or boring and the graphics are not only clever but implemented very well. The storyline is entertaining and even gives you a bit of a contrived history lesson.You'll get plenty of LOL's playing this one. It's a gem of a time-waster.			",133,113,2,17,13,2,11

After playing story mode and beating timed matches, you have the option of playing online with real people. Don't underestimate this one!

												Rock of Ages is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  It makes me lie down in green pastures, it leads me beside quiet waters,  it restores my soul. It guides me in paths of righteousness for Rock of Age's sake.  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of Rock of Ages.			",59,4,0,6,2,1,1

												This is definately a strange concept for a game. You play as a rock, smashing things and you compete with some historic figures who also has a rock and you try to smash the others fortress gates. You can choose to place traps, obstacles and other annoyances along the way to stop the opponents rock from reaching your fortress. And of course he does the same!It has a good sense of humor, it had me giggling a lot. I especially love that the rock shouts in terror if you fall off a cliff! It's easy to understand the tutorial and learn the game, though placing the traps in a good place is a learning process. But thankfully you get to see a camera view of the opponents rock going towards your fortess, so you can tell what parts is too easy.You also have a lot of fun things to annoy your opponent with. My personal favorite is spamming the board with cows.I have to say it... this game Rocks!			",172,366,6,57,34,3,40

												Reasons to buy RoA:1. It's a game where you ♥♥♥♥ up plenty of historical figures with a boulder.2. Controls well and has some fun multiplayer modes.3. It's $10 (or less depending on when you read this!)4. No, seriously, run Marie Antoinette over with a mother♥♥♥♥ing chunk of rock.5. I cannot state this enough, you bust the ♥♥♥♥ out of Hades with a boulder and ruin history.6. It's like Drive Angry except Nic Cage is a mother♥♥♥♥ing boulder. How much clearer can I get?7. I'm sorry I can't hear your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuses over RUNNING DOWN THE BLACK DEATH WITH A SMILING STONE ORB			",2445,961,89,309,287,27,386

												This game is definitely worth a purchase if you want a game to play with a friend. The single player, while good, doesn't hold your attention for very long. It's really just roll down the hill over and over again on different maps. But the unusual mechanics and light-hearted nayure of the game make it perfect to play with someone else.

												In all my years of playing games, I have never encountered one quite like this. Rock of Ages is a really unique game that takes you throughout parts of european history and pits you in a bowling match against many famous characters. Sounds...bizarre, right? Well, that's because it is. If you haven't picked it up I would definitely recommend that you do (especially on a sale.) Pros:+good sense of humor+interesting story+Bowling!+very unique gameplayCons:-does seem to get somewhat repetative-other game modes provide a minimal amount of fun-boss fights are too simplistic Overall: 7.5/10 ",87,12,2,6,4,0,3

												People told me this game was fun. And it was.""Rock of Ages"" is a half-strategy, half-reflex and speed reliant destruction game, where you build defenses to protect your gate, while also trying to hit your opponent's gate with as much force with your boulder as you can. And it's really fun! The controls are smooth, the level layout accomodates the different strategy and action playstyles, and the enemy AI can be pretty relentless during some levels. It's a nice blend of challenge and fun.However, there are some problems. While I enjoyed the cutscenes, some of the jokes presented fell flat or got old very fast. Like the girly shrieks your enemy would cry before you'd flatten them. Or the pop-culture jokes that were shoved in here and there. The animation and style are great, but I didn't like the humor that much.On top of that, while the graphics look fantastic in this game... the color pallette isn't the most spectacular. There's some good crimsons and golds and crimsons and greens for certain levels, but there are some that are really dirty, unpleasant pallettes like blue and gold that just aren't that colorful. But, again, that's my own taste.And finally, the game can be a little TOO easy sometimes. Some levels I got through in one try, because their structure didn't stump me, but f***ed the living daylights out of the enemy's AI. And the bosses, while creative, are all very simplistic and really REALLY easy. You literally cannot die when fighting a boss, and the structure is find the weak spot then hit it three times. Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed playing Rock of Ages, and earning what achievements I did. It's addicting fun you can get hooked on for a good weekend or so. And I'm giving Rock of Ages a 7/10.

												I had a surprising amount of fun with this little game. Yes, the game is about rolling a boulder down a hill to break down a gate, but what seperates this game from other (rolling the ball down the hill ?) games is the art direction, style, and humor which reminds me of the old Monty Python and the Flying Circus skits. I played the game when it first came out and haven't touched it much after, but then the game was very easy. This would be my only complaint. They could have patched the game to change some things to make building defenses actually useful, but I can't truthfully account for the developer's actions. At 10 dollars, you can't go wrong, in my opinion with this game. It's a little ball of fun, something to make you smile and have fun while doing it.			",262,54,3,35,27,3,40

												ACE Team presumably licensed Def Leppard's ""Rock of Ages,"" from their album ""Pyromania,"" to make this game, but I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding how the game relates to the song. First of all, the song's not in the game, so that's weird. Second, they appear to have taken the lesson of the four nonsense words that the song starts with (""gunter glieben glauben globen"") to mean that the dialog in the game should be gibberish. Interesting choice. Finally, in place of power chords, a strong beat you can clap to, and exciting lyrics that seem to simultaneously entreat and inspire, this game includes a rock that smashes stuff. In sum, I'm incredibly confused, but that's okay because this game is amazing. I guess you could say it ""rocks."" Rock of Ages, still rolling, rock and rolling, gets 10 out of 11 rocks.

It is definitely worth th $1.29 I paid for it. Probably $2.99 would be a fair price.7/10

												This game. It's easily one of the most ridiculously childishly fun games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The sheer, simple enjoyment of rolling a big ol' boulder into something (or better yet, SOMEONE) combined with the almost Monty Python-esque slapstick humour, makes it so ridiculously funny, it's worth it just for the sake of laughing at (and with) it for an hour on end. Probably even more. And the gameplay kicks äss too! 8.9/10			",256,39,2,25,30,0,45

												NO EXAGGERATION OR IRONY OR SARCASMThis is the sort of game that you can find after spending an hour going through the 200+ pages of sales.This game is love...  Ah crie over lack of trading cards. They exist now ^-^ You set up towers to defend your Gate; you command your boulder (as Sisyphus), charging through the enemy's defenses, to ultimately breach their Gate... provided you have the skillz to maneuver. If I could, I would buy this game for everybody on Steam. Alas, I only had enough for two copies, and my bro got th'other one. Please, support the ingenious minds behind this (dare I say perfect?) diversion. While you're at it, pick up God Mode (same publisher) and Zeno Clash (2) too (same developer); the former is an arena-horde survival game based in Greek Mythology, the latter is (one of) the best first-person melee games ever made and is comparably goofy to Rock of Ages (because ""WTF-esque"" isn't a proper term) . It is truly a shame that certain companies *ahem AHEEEEEMMMMUH* gouge gamers for little innovation; ATLUS has backed games/ACE has created games that I've enjoyed more, lately, than any others - to word it legibly, they're some of my (indeed, it seems) favorite games of all time.I cannot say enough good things about this game; that lack of words drove me to use, er, memes.To be sure, I want to preserve this game for as long as I can; I'm certain my playtime will run something like *Do One Mission, Don't Play Again For Two Days* just to ensure I savor it for as long as possible. To know that this game has an ending... I die.NO EXAGGERATION OR IRONY OR SARCASM; I am GENUINELY impressed with this game (perhaps even more so at how much I've allowed the game  to  impress me, not even that big a fan of Monty Python (or comparable games (is Super Monkey Ball comparable? I don't know...)(nor am I fan of bowling or tower defense; this hybrid though))...).			",1923,764,56,219,192,19,232

												Pretty fresh and creative game, you and your ai enemy each have a base and can build defense structures for money, after a specific amount of times your minions will have build a big boulder ball for you to run into your enemy territory and destroy his fortress. You get money by destroying his defense structures, can upgrade your ball or buy better defences.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is original and fun for the first few levels, but if you are going for 100% achievements then the developer's trolling placement of the keys on some levels gets increasingly rage inducing as you are forced to try over and over again to fluke trick shots by smashing into edges to abuse the janky physics engine.

												It can be fun in short sessions. The idea is to roll your boulder to the enemy base and destroy the door before he breaks down yours. There's a little bit of strategy involved; the game lets you place things like buildings and cows on the map to stop or slow down the boulder (if you aren't careful your boulder will also stop dead in its tracks). It's a very simple idea and it gets the job done. But I did expect a little more from the guys from Zeno Clash. It's not a bad game; it definitely has its moments (the graphics and sounds are great, for example), but not enough to keep me interested for hours.[Rating: 74/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

Fight me, idiot.The BadsGame was made with less than 3.3 million dollars, somehow. Very cheap! $2 sale very likely!Cows do jack, and sometimes shit.

Premise is great, execution is bad.The goal of the game is to roll down a track (where your opponent can place tower defence style traps to slow you) and smash down the enemy door to win.The core issue is no matter how much you chip away their boulder to make it smaller or they chip away yours it seems to take 3 to 4 hits to a door regardless of your rocks size. This in turn makes most of the tower defence aspects laughable.After you learn of this critical balance issue in multiplayer it becomes a mad dash race to the finish and the actual tactics of defence building serves no point.

												Roll down a hill and try to destroy things, but don't slow down too much or you will not do enough damage to the door at the end of the pathway. You play against an AI that is trying to destroy your fortifications meanwhile you try to destory his, first to break open the door and the end of the other person's path wins, and gets to watch their opponent crushed by a giant ball with a face on it.Interesting concept, would roll and crush cows again.

												It was on sale for a $1 or $2 and I decided to try it. Most of the negative statements made by other reviewers are correct, this game gets dull quick. What caught my inteterst in deciding to buy this were the boss fights but they felt too easy to conquer and not much thought put into them except for two bosses but yet still easily doable. It was a good idea of a game but I think if it function differently it would of been a fantastic game. Do yourself a favor and wait for the deal, if still interested.			",95,1,0,0,1,0,3

												i got this game thinking it was fun. but i only got a bad 4 hours of fun with it! its just a small game with people that dance like they just took some happy pills and decided to get drunk and go take ballet lessons! one things for sure i would rate it a 2/10. the only way you can realy find a good match is if you play it with a friend! no one is playing online! sure the dragon boss in the campaign is cool but the game is just bad. You can easily make defences that are good my just adding a 2 tile thick wall of war elaphants! and ontop of all that its 15 dollars! like seriously! it should be at most a 5 dollar game! otherwise its not worth it.

												Purchased this game after watching many lets plays of it and was really excited to see it on the steam sale for only 4.99. Downloaded the game only to find out the game has had many issues with getting the game to even start. So the long and the short of this is I not only spent 5 dollars for a game that doesn't work but I also spent three hours trying to trouble shoot only to find out it wasn't worth the 5 dollars or my time. The game looks fun but if they can't fix this major issue than there is no point buying it			",105,14,0,28,18,0,18

												I had a long think about this one but ultimately chose not to recommend. The reason is the game just doesn't change enough as you progress. The first few levels were OK but it was extremely repetitive and not in a good way. As the difficulty increased so did my frustration. The map changes each level an you have to spend a run or two to figure out the paths and shortcuts along the way. This means you generally lose the first three times you play it. Of course the AI knows exactly where all the shortcuts and cheats are so it blocks you from taking them, but as you are still learning the map you make a lot of mistakes.I played for nearly two hours and am done with it.

												I was intrigued and somewhat excited by the trailer of the game, so I gave it a try.Unfortunately for me, I tried the first level using mouse and keyboard and I wasn't able to properly control the rock, not to mention complete the level. After moving to the gamepad the game felt a little better and I found rolling the rock challenging enough for my (average) reflexes.But when the gameplay expanded to include building towers, I felt overwhelmed and not that excited about. It's not that the game is bad or something, just that it is definitely not for me.			",216,35,0,31,6,0,20

												This game caused my computer to crash every single time that I attempted to play it. I tried numerous times, and on each occasion, the game would freeze and I would be incapable of exiting it, going to task manager, or even shutting down my computer. I uninstalled it so as not to waste time. I'm sure that if the game actually works for you, you'll have a good time, but I couldn't recommend a game that didn't function as intended.

												A really sub-par game, I seriously don't understand why the there are so many positive reviews. Basically, if you play the first level of the game, you've played them all. People keep saying ""Monty Python-esque"" but I don't see it. I suppose if you think Monty Python's humor was solely based on using historical paintings to make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, then you would consider this game to be very Monty Python. The gameplay is pretty basic: you control a boulder and you try to roll it towards the enemy's castle. Defenses are placed in your way to slow and destroy your boulder. The game is also a race, the enemy also is trying to destroy your castle's gates and you place defenses to slow the enemy boulder. Sounds fun, right? Defenses are pretty flimsy and easy to get around, so when facing the AI's boulder, all you really have to do is make a few choke points. So as a tower defense, its really ♥♥♥♥ing poorly designed.  There aren't any punishments for falling off the stage, so the player is prertty free to go as fast as possible, and take large leaps across the map, making any defenses placed by the AI completely useless. Controlling the boulder is pretty easy so there's no real challenge in making these leaps above defenses. The game becomes super repetitve and there aren't any rewards for the player. Sure, you get to watch a silly cinematic, but on the whole, they're really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			",85,11,1,11,5,0,11

												I hate to leave negative reviews, because I've played a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games on steam, and hav'nt even bothered to review them.This game could have been amazing, because it has that arcade feel to it, (thanks ATLUS) but unfortunately the Single player is just wrong. You have a minute of super monkey ball fun then it becomes a tedious tower defence with poor controls and no control over the ai launching attacks faster than you at the same time. The game would have been really fun if it was:1: The levels get harder to navigate but you can still roll and build up points/levels2: No poorly implemented tower defence aspect3: AI building faster and better than a C&C hack ",873,245,43,86,70,16,164

It's not smart enough to be funny.And it's definitely not good enough to be worth playing.Just look at the hours spent from the positive reviews.			",273,111,6,31,21,4,49

												Neat Idea, but executed poorly. Think of a tower defense where you can just go around the defense unharmed. That's Rock Of Ages. The multiplayer would be fun, but the problem is the lack of money, tiles for unit placement, and viable strats are very few and far between. The different rocks are worthless for the most part, and there is too many useless units you can place down on the ground. Single player story is funny, but it's the same thing over and over. Boss fights are pretty lack luster as well. Sadly the only thing this game has in common with Zeno Clash is the music. While it is not as memorable, you can still hear those jungle♥♥♥♥♥beats. Wait for a sale if you are interested. There's just better games out there.			",409,188,9,75,28,5,69

												At first blush, this game appears to be good, wacky, irreverent fun somewhat in the vein of Monty Python. The gameplay is full of original concepts you will find quite literally nowhere else, and I admit, at first I was gripped.The honeymoon period, however, wears off quickly, as the game begins to throw more and more unfair, unbalanced tripe unintuitive gameplay elements that weaken the core experience, and the single-player mode drags fairly quickly; there's only so much some quick satire of history can do for me.If you can pick this up for a song, go for it, but don't expect it to entertain you long. It's a neat experiment, but ultimately I don't feel that it's one that succeeded.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A historically accurate 1v1 tower defense game where you control a boulder using the rolling physics to maneuver the boulder to bust down the enemy gate's HP while also defending your own gate's HP. I found it fun for a short while before quitting due to lack of interest as it can get pretty repetitious because for the most part you're basically just maneuvering a boulder through or around the enemey's tower placements with jumps and the basic movement controls, though the boulders can come in different variations within the match you're currently in should you purchase them with the money you earned destroying structures and smothering people.

												I asked for a refund. The game advertises partial controller support. From my experiences with other games this usually means the menu is not compatible with a controller, or that you might have to make some minor adjustments.In this case, the functionality was so poor the game was basically unplayable. It might be possible to get it to work normally, but I didn't find it worth my time to mess with it any further.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hate to say it but I simply cannot recommend this game. Not because it's not fun (it is!) not because it's not clever and witty and funny (it's totally all 3!) but because it is such a royal pain to try and play thanks to the attached DRM connection requirements. It does NOT run through Steam and instead requires an outside connection to the developer's servers which work spottily if at all. Basically, it's a fantastic little game and the price is right but actually playing it feels like a chore.			",214,36,1,28,22,3,37

												Way too difficult to Control, not incredibly funny, Took me by surprise to have some sort of tower defence when the enemy goes up against you as well, a bit laggy, controls are WAY too sensative, I tapped the D key, nearly turned my Boulder right around, almost a complete 180. Not enough things to destroy, music is bleh, Animations are a bit Flash gamey in cutscenes. I got it for about 2 bucks on sale, Kind of wish I could get a refund, cause now I have to see this game every single time I go into my Library, but that's a Steam thing, Kind of wish there was a thing like steam bucks or something, but anyways, this game also downloaded a lot of stuff on my PC I don't think are needed to even RUN the game. So I am a bit worried, a couple of files in my Computer files named a bunch of random Letters and numbers really, Kind of scared me really.  So Let's Recap.Bleh MusicPoor Animated Cut scenesOversensative controlsUseless Tower defence system cause the CPU is cheapNot enough destructionLame comedyand non-refundable experience. (But that's Steam's Problem really, Serious Steam, Please find some way To get your customers to get refunds! Like store credit for half of what you payed for the game would be ACCEPTABLE In my book!)I do not recommend this game, some people like it, but my expierience is just terrible with this game, I beat the first level and was jumped by the whole tower defence thing, I put down as many towers as possible in tight places. The CPU Just rolled right on through them at high speed, not hitting ANY of em, so yeah, CPU Is cheap. ",218,35,1,21,12,3,5

I didn't remember why though and saw this for like a buck and thought i'd give it another go.Now I remember!The humour is nothing like Monty Python because it would have to be funny. This humour consists of fart jokes and refrences ala 'Epic Movie'. The gameplay is the most tripe♥♥♥♥♥♥I have seen in quite some time. You roll a boulder down a short path and hit the other guy's door. Takes about 3 good hits. The other component is placing easy to dodge traps/barriers in the way to slow the other guy down.Sounds like it could be fun but it is poorly executed here. The story is throw-away at best.The music is non stop medevil style dance music. It gets old real fast.Pass this game up. Its not worth anything.			",271,45,1,57,28,2,30

												I couldnt stand playing this game anymore after a hour or two... Its the same over and over and over and over again... I guess it could be fun if you like this kind of crazy and different type of games. But if you are like me, more of a traditional player, i would suggest avoiding it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am growing fond of ACE and their games. Zeno clash was fun and this has it moments. its more than a tower defense rts, you actually learn history. OK maybe not. there are historical figures, thats about it. object is to smash and squish your opponent. while also stopping them from doing the same to you.  there were times I found it to be rather easy and others frustrating. It was fun while it lasted but I dont see my self in dulging in MP too much or continuing with the SP challenges. unique to say the least. 5.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was looking for an inexpensive, fun game to buy for my friend and I to play for a few hours while we waited for something... It was a while ago, so I forgot what we were waiting for. Anyway, this game was fantastic fun to play with someone you know! It turned out to be hours of co-op excitement over the next few days, and we still play it occasionally. OH, the best part? Text to speech!!1 When you aren't building towers or steering your rock, you can type obscene messages for the nice little voice to repeat. Although I'd recommend you play with a friend, the single player can be just as entertaining. It's cheap, fun, the quality is surprising (no bugs at all), and will keep you giggling like little girl every time you launch it. Go ahead and buy it!			",64,10,2,5,8,2,4

												They did it again! Inspiring and challenging. Hell lot of fun, yet had to laugh several times.The graphics are pretty cool. Dx9, not all textures are really sharp but it goes ok since the overall design is really impressive and never done before like this.The sound is heavy like the rock you roll. It's pretty thick, too. People everywhere make weird noises, debries flying around. Very good quality. The music tracks are great and some of them are well known orchestras.The gameplay is funny and interesting. It requires quite a bit of skill to navigate the rock through the course, I've always been a fan of games such as Marble Madness.Each run turns out differently, depending on what defense objects have been placed.In multiplayer a lot of skill is asked. Without the proper strategy and good moving abilities you can not win.I knew something good was coming.This is even more. A must have for the value if you are into indie games/core gaming.Thanks for the fun :D			",386,76,22,26,37,2,54

But I'll try to anyway...This is basically a game where you roll a boulder down to smash your enemy's gates wide open and move in for the kill. Of course, they're doing the same exact thing. So how do you stop them? With towers! Part tower defense, part racing game, part smash-every-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-thing-you-see game, it's quite fun when you get the hang of the controls.			",262,65,6,40,20,3,35

												I recommend this game for casuals who are trying to get into tower defense games, however I feel that the tower D/boulder mix didn't work so well as a puzzle, specially for people who are veterans in this type of game. I played only single player, the multiplayer might be fun tho.You see, I must have played 20 or something maps from the campaign. It didn't take much ingenuity, just speed with the boulder. Some maps required some tower building, but I never felt challenged in any aspect. Basically I didn't get that satisfaction when you build a really good defense on tower defense games.This game gets a ""yes"" from me specially because it tries something new and has great humor in it, despite not achieving the greatest polish in gameplay.

												Greatly enjoyed single player mode.  You guide your ""rock"" down a ramp fraugh with perils to attack the castle at the end and breach the walls.  In between each run, you add obstacles to the path to slow or destroy your opponents ball, for he is trying to breach your castle.  Gets pretty tricky toward the end- both in guiding your ball with agility and adding the right obstacles in the right places.  I suspect the reviewer who said ""it comes down to whoever gets 3 balls to the end first"" played the game to the end, as that stops being true by halfway through.  Great music and sense of humor on top of hte compelling gameplay.  A complete joy and a legitimate use of your money AND time.			",605,332,22,116,74,8,140

												A very fun local multiplayer game, great for playing with friends. The game is filled top to bottom with humorous touches, and it still manages to be very strategic without compremising the silliness of it's core mechanic. On top of that, it has a great art style. Once you get past the first level it lacks a proper tutorial, but the mechanics are easy to pick up even without proper instuctions. For the price, it's a great value.			",337,89,4,34,33,3,53

												The world premier virtual bowling tower defence where you get to flatten historical figures and battle mythological beasts. It also boasts a very much Monty Python inspired aesthetic and sense of humor. The challenging campaign is enough to keep the ""just one more"" attitude. While I haven't tried the online multiplayer or the split screen mode, I have had a go at the alternate gamemodes and found them a nice distraction from the main game. The game also allows for you to play as any historical figure you have defeated and use a variety of different bolders, my favourite is the Block of Ages. All in all the game has a challenging and interresting campaign, with the welcome option of multiplayer.			",136,9,6,18,31,2,50

The gameplay is ultimately really shallow and all the levels are pretty much the same with absolutely no variety. One of those very rare games that is actually more fun to watch because you miss half the quirky visuals while playing yourself.I still recommend buying it though, if only because the price is so low. The developer also deserves props for making  Zeno Clash, another game that had it's problems, but is still one of the most memorable things I've played in recent years.

												Prepare yourself for the journey of a lifetime.Welcome to rock of ages, a game about rolling a boulder down some... interesting places. Due to a lack of competence, I cannot say much about the difficulty of the game, but I can speak about the actual mechanics:-The game features interesting tower defense which does add to the game positively-The cinematics have an interesting art style that always keeps the viewer amused-The levels are designed with multiple routes which allow for fun gameplayIn terms of graphics, I am fairly impressed with the actual gameplay, but it seems to downsize the resolution everytime I reboot the game, which may get annoying.The controls are generally good, but occasionally tend to bug outIt is fairly fun but not something I would play for more than a couple of minutes in singleplayerThe multiplayer mode did suffer from some connection issues when I tested it, but it pretty funI would reccomend this game to anyone who likes silly things and just generally anyone.

												What can I say about this game. I didn't expect what I got...maybe that is what I should say. I purchased this game as part of a bundle and started playing it and let me tell you, it is strangely addicting. As I'm sure you're aware, you play as a boulder, rolling through a course, trying to destroy the opponent's gate first and kill them while they are trying to same to you. You lay traps for your opponent as well as they do for you, making this an oddly fun game. There are only two downfalls to this game. One, the game is, for the most part, fairly easy. Sure, it doesn't take much for one to buy and play this game but there isn't much of a challenge for those looking for it, though there is multiplayer. Second, there are collectables in this game: Keys. These keys, early on, are easy to get and put in places which you must creatively think how to get. That being said, the later keys are unfair to get, especially the one on the last level before the final boss. Overall, a solid, easy game which can be enjoyed for a few hours.

												It's a game where you roll giant rocks at your enemy and smash their stuff, there's really not much else that needs to be said.  This game is simple, has a great art style, and above all:  fun.  The tactical aspects of setting up your defenses in single-player to chip away at your opponent's boulder could use some refining.  It's mostly just cramming defensive structures into a few strategic points and hoping for the best.  If you can get your boulder down the range before your opponent, you've already got a big advantage.  However, rolling your own boulder towards the enemy and smashing anything in your way is great fun.This game has a great art style that compliments the feel of the game well, taking elements from art from the various ages and working them into a funny parody that left me laughing at just about every cutscene.  It's very much like the Monty Python animations.This game is definitely worth the money.			",39,36,0,6,7,1,15

												While Rock of Ages isn't a particularly long game, it's 100% entertainment for the entire course of your playtime. The difficulty is well-balanced so frustration is practically non-existent, the unique blend of tower defense/strategy and... Super Monkey Ball and Monty Python is certainly something. Very weird, very humorous, very engaging. At not even 10 bucks a pop, this is a game you seriously shouldn't miss.			",544,152,13,88,44,5,65

												Pretty fun little racing game.  ACE did a great job with the settings for each chapter and you get a short history lesson during the course of the game.  It's not a very long single-player campaign, but the game modes outside of the campaign along with the achievements should add a little more playtime.This is a big departure from ACE's first outing, Zeno Clash.  They've done pretty well transitioning from a shooter to a racing game.  I wish there was more to say but it's just a short racing game at its heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If the videos don't show what goes on well enough, it's a game where you roll a giant stone boulder, marble-madness style, at an enemy's fort, while building up your own defenses against their boulder.This game has cutscenes based on Terry Gilliam's animation style, and that's kind of cool.

												This is a truly unique, wholly playable, and intensely fun game equipped with a strikingly original concept that carries a great deal of comedic weight. While the game may be a tad easy on normal mode, it is simply pure fun and a joy to play each time. If there's any criticism, it's that the AI have a tough time in dealing with certain modes of defense on normal mode, and are a bit easy to stop when you get into the swing of things. It doesn't stop the game from being fun, however. This is an awesome way to spend ten dollars for the value that you get: 20 stages to master against AI, multiplayer, and 2 game modes aside from story to play and enjoy. ACE studios have done a bang up job with this one, and should be applauded for their efforts.			",302,31,6,22,13,1,31

												Rock of Ages has the kind of base concept you'd hear and say, ""hmm, that'd make a fun flash game"".As you can probably tell, this isn't a flash game.You guide your rolling stone around a winding course and hit the enemy gate until it dies. But you have a gate and the enemy has a Brian Jones! But you can both place down defences after your Ian Stewards have been smashed! And then you can use your leftover currency to buy better Mick Jaggers!It's fun, it's as slow or fast paced as you want it be, and it has a challenging difficulty curve.The cutscenes in story are silly little gags to the layman, and chock-a-block with jokes for the history nerds. The Rock of Ages is called the Rock of AGES for a reason!I'd heartily recommend this game for a romp with your friends too. Strangely enough, latency lags both players, even when they're playing with their own individual courses. I thought the core design of war mode would have countered that.Good game, I like it a whole bunch, pick it up when you need to fill some time.			",146,40,1,16,17,3,26

												This game is very well-rounded, and an excellent source of entertainment if you get bored, can't find the motivation to start up a more complex game like Europa Universalis or Kerbal Space Program, and just want to smash something fast.That's after you beat the campaign of course, which is fun in of itself. There are three main modes a single person would be interested in, and the same for multiplayer. There's War, Obstacle Course, Time Trial, and Skeeboulder. The singleplayer campaign consists entirely of War games throughout all the maps and five different 'ages', Sparta, (characterized by orange and black clay-jar carvings as an art style) the Middle Ages, (reminds me of ancient tapestries) the Renaissance, (with both roman architecture and a lot of marble) Baroque France, (very blue, very fancy) and Spain. (a very dark and gruesome Spain, however)I still pop in almost every day to play a few rounds of obstacle course, and while the campaign won't last forever there's plenty there to play for quite some time.

												If your a person who likes a cartoony game about a rock and his master trying to beat evil by squashing others WITH A FART AFTER THE SQUASH than this is the perfect game for you! Also, their is multiplayer over wi-fi or local versus and the game is basically building on your turf to stop the other masters rock from destroying the gate on your castle AND SQUISHING YOU WITH A FART SOUND!!! Multiplayer even has a race mode where your rock and the other guys rock race to the end! Takes some getting used to the rock physics movement but, you'll get the hang of it in no time with keyboard and mouse. Sorry I don't how this game performs on controllers but, it's ""PROBABLY"" *emphasizes on probably* good.			",68,3,1,6,16,0,7

												A tower defence with a twist, you must roll your rock of ages through the enemy gauntlet and bash down their door to get to the squishy bits inside, yum! The art and humour seems inspired by Monty Python animations and is enjoyable to find shortcuts and ways to keep your rock intact as you proceed down the slopes to your opponents door, jumping and swerving to avoid obstacles and projectiles.

												A very silly and very fun game about rolling boulders on an obstacle course to destroy your opponents base. Each person places defenses to protect their base while rolling their boulder towards the other one's base. Not a complex premise, which makes it very easy to jump right in. The single player storyline is very humourous and the visuals are Monty Python-esque and quite comical.

												Rock of Ages is a game where you play as a 3-layered rock and your goal is to take the least amount of damage before you attempt to smash down your opponents door and crush him under your rock. It's kinda like bowling, except that you try to avoid the pins and the backpanel is your neighbors front door.If Monthy Python, bowling and a real-time strategy game had a threesome and made a baby, this would be the result.

I just wish you could do local vs with one keybord and one 360 controller. Saddly you need two 360 controllers for local vs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found this game when it was on sale. Honestly, thats what made me seal the deal when I saw this very meme oriented monty python humorous game that uses a tower defense and attack as its main gameplay. Do not get me wrong, there are other game modes, two other game modes to be exact and they are just as fun as the main one. The fun to be had in this game is with your friends so get them to buy the game and prepare to have some enjoyable evenings.This is a multiplayer game by all means, so do not buy it if you wont be playing with friends.

												I have now completed main story and I gotta say that I do love this game.When rock of ages started poppin up in featured and recomended games I didn't think much of it. The picture seemed too uhm... not special and attention catching.Then it came on sale one weekend while i was looking at my quence and it came up so I took a look at it.I fell in love with this game as soon as I saw the trailer!It looked like it was pulled out of a Monty Phyton movie or the Flying circus series. Both the cut scenes and levels.So I bought it and played as soon as it downloaded. Even at the full price it is worth every penny.However I feel the story is a little short. Might be that or I just love it too much and want more of it.But I enjoyed this game alot and I loved the graphics and soundtrack. I loved my rock. Especially when I saw the option of choosing its face! So now my rock has the cutest little smiley face.And now the good and bad.possitive:* Easy to play even for n00bies.* Cute rocks* Great and funny levels as well as cutscenes.* Gandalf was run over by your rock in a cutscene.* 4th wall breaking by a certain someone.* Awesome and fun soundtack.* When you win you get the most satisfying splat noise ever as you run over your enemy.* There was paid alot of attention to detail. Even the ground has patterns and everything looks amazing.* The price is also very resonable for what you get.* Trollface stone, snowball stone, pumpkin and a block. How is that unenjoyable?* The ""Nooooeh"" scream the people make is halarious.* Actually there is historical value as well as jokes.* The entertainment i had and will still have with this game is amazing. I have laughed and smiled alot.Negative:* I would like more levels.* The last couple of levels in a row had the same music. It was good music but still...Who would love this game:* People who like Monty Phyton.* People who loves funny/weird games.* People who likes a somewhat comical wiev at history and historical persons.Who would hate this game:* Peoplw who don't find Monty Phyton funny at all.* People who don't do weird or funny.

												A very silly and very fun game about rolling boulders on an obstacle course to destroy your opponents base. Each person places defenses to protect their base while rolling their boulder towards the other one's base. Not a complex premise, which makes it very easy to jump right in. The single player storyline is very humourous and the visuals are Monty Python-esque and quite comical. Overall, a great little game to sink a bit of time into here and there.8/10 - IT ROCKS ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Go get your balls to the wall man.It's a satirical game where you control an upgradable ball that smashes into cows, elephans and screaming cardboard people in an attempt to reach the gate at the end of the track, break it down, and squash the enemy player, usually represented by some historical or mythological figure, hiding behind it. If you are not entirely sure if you understand what I just said, that's fine - means you don't do drugs. If you do happen to look upon this game while under the effect of LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs, I am sure it will all make sense to you.The game mechanics are quite clever. 2 tracks, each with some branching. A gate on each end. Behind the gate - the player. Each player has a ball they must roll through the enemy track and hit the enemy gate with as much force as possible. Defence structures on the track damage the ball, breaking off it's mass. When the ball is destroyed or reaches the gate at the end, the player has some time before a new one is built to reinforce their track with defensive structures. A game ends when one player crushes another's gate and rolls over their avatar behind it.This is a fun game to play at parties, especially if you are short on weed or value your health yet still want to f*ck with people's minds. Also if you think a 4 ton stone boulder can squash a cow - you are wrong. Cow>stone. OOOOOOOOOO/10(those are balls)If this game was an accurate representation of history, it would be a pretty good representation.			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3

												This is one of those games that's hard to compare to others, because what makes it worthwhile isn't really in the mechanics necessarily.  it's the presentation and the package.  It's quirky and very Monty Python-esque, with a lot of personality.  The gameplay is enjoyable if not rather easy, though occasionally frustrating when it attempts to be difficult.  It's not a game you're likely to play through more than once, but it's a memorable experience.			",108,30,1,21,8,0,10

												Fun to play, great value. There are also a lot of references but I suppose it's a bit hard to notice when you're looking at a rolling stone 90% of the time. It can also be a bit repetitive but I'd suggest you to just roll with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably the second best comedy Video Game I've played (Borderlands series being 1st on the list). It has a playstyle I've never seen, the art is great, and the cutscenes are pure gold  xDIf only more people played it though, the multiplayer is fun.I recommend this game to anyone and everyone-9.5/10  (-0.5 due to lack of players)			",207,24,5,12,24,1,37

												This game is awesome! If you want the perfect multiplayer game (both local and online) to play with friends, you can't go wrong with this game. Split screen is absolutley where the game shines though, nothing beats the enjoyment you get when you totally destroy your friend and he gets red with anger. If you want to know what the game is about, or how the game works...well that's kind of hard to explain. You're basically duelling each other by sending a rock to the other player's door as hard as you can. The opposing player creates blockades to try and stop you. So there's kind of two phases you need to master, building blockades and rolling your rock to destroy your opponents door. It sounds totally crazy and weird, but that's a part of the game too. You should just buy it and play, you won't regret it.Oh, and btw, I have played this game over 30 hours on PS3, so yes, I have a lot of experience with this game, and I can tell you this game is worth your money.

												Like a lot of ACE games, Rock of Ages is a diamond in the rough, and well worth the price of admission (especially how often it's on sale and how deeply discounted).The premise is fairly simple: you roll a giant boulder through an obstacle course trying to mash in a set of gates at the opposite gate.It has a great sense of humor, interesting graphics, and mechanics that are at least something different.In my opinion the only downside is the combination of building defenses for your opponent along with trying to run through theirs: you can only place obstacles while you're waiting for your next boulder and this is also the only time you can try and pinpoint-catapult the enemy. Annoyingly, the computer opponents in single player seem to be able to catapult you the entire time (because of course) and have ridiculous accuracy, which can be frustrating.So it's not perfect, but it's often only a few dollars, and is easily worth that, if not quite a few more.

												DEFINITIVE / GALLERYPOSITIVES:- hearty chuckle worthy mini scenes at the beginning of every level. - lots of visual, weapon, and level variety. - though challenging/frustrating at first, the inevitable thrill of momentum and mighty destruction is unparralled and worth the endurance/patience. - lots of replayablility because of the multiplayer features.Seemingly silly, the experience is surprisingly epic. Though we all have certain times we like to reflect on respectfully, this is a great reminder that on the grand scheme of things, everything is ridiculous.			",75,51,0,9,8,0,1

												Rock of Ages is a platformer/race/tower defense game where you control a ball similar to games like Torquing (Funorb), Super Monkey Ball and various recent marble/ball themed puzzle games on Steam.The game is a bit silly and sometimes frustrating, but otherwise a very fun game that makes you feel achieved after beating it's challenges. It has some replayability, but (in my opinion) only in co-op as there aren't almost any players online..  and the local co-op sadly requires 2 controllers.9/10			",640,166,16,115,52,7,80

												I personally like to call this game of Monty Python: The Game, mostly due to it's visual style and sense of humor, in this game you take control of a giant boulder and use it to crush your enemies, all while having to build your own defenses to protect yourself from your oponent's ball of stone, it can be a bit frustrating at times but still a very pleasant experience.

												rock of ages is about you a rock that goes though history killing the enemy. The controls are easy with the w a s d to move rock and mose to move camera. You pretty much have to blow up the other person gate before they blow yours up. Also need to collect keys to unlock the bosses so you can go to the next lot of levels. all in all it is a good game and most of the time it is in sale so buy when in sale.the game is about 5 hours long . The last level is called saturday which i found hard all in all was a good game short, cheap and money well spent ooo yeah			",34,8,0,14,0,0,11

												I am growing fond of ACE and their games. Zeno clash was fun and this has it moments. its more than a tower defense rts, you actually learn history. OK maybe not. there are historical figures, thats about it. object is to smash and squish your opponent. while also stopping them from doing the same to you.  there were times I found it to be rather easy and others frustrating. It was fun while it lasted but I dont see my self in dulging in MP too much or continuing with the SP challenges. unique to say the least. 5.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoy this game because it is a fictionalized version of the reality I subscribe to. It is inspiring. Allow me to clarify.I love racing. I raced so much my feet got tired and stopped working from all the clutching involved in doing sick skids, sweet swerves, and swift stops. That is called Lame Clutch Foot, or LCF, since it starts in the foot that clutches and moves to the foot that speeds. (Automatic drivers wouldn't understand this.) Since I was diagnosed, I needed a new outlet for my ""speed-needs."" I found it in ""legal"" street races.Not to bore you with the details (plus I wouldn't want to spoil my upcoming biography), let's skip to the end where, after 2 months, I overcame every hardship known to living and ancient man.I promise to one day get my name in lights. I will be like the Moon in that picture where I will SMASH through and show the world my speed skills. And just remember: ""Whatever Speed Doesn't Kill You, Only Makes You Faster."" (My favorite quote from myself.)Donate to my Kickstarter today!			",239,42,4,25,17,3,41

												It's like a Monty Python journeys through art history... the game. Rock of Ages is super fun, the controls feel good and the game runs really well. The art direction and aesthetic of the game are amazing and really capture the art style of the periods you travel through. There's fun little customizations to your hero and ball, and the overall depth of the gameplay was more than I had initially anticipated. It has an enjoyable multiplayer component that feels natural and fun and not just tacked on. All this combines to create a game that is silly, light hearted and just plain enjoyable. Rock of Ages is undoubtly worth the asking price, and is a great game for any type of gamer  of any experince level, it's very approachable and easy to pick up and a lot of fun. GO BUY IT! :] ",469,167,5,56,40,3,67

												I bought this simply because it was cheap and the ""Rock beats everything"" promo amused me. Surprisingly, it's a pretty fun game to play and it's appealing in both visuals and control.It plays like a strange combination of tower defense, and reverse katamari. Take control of your boulder and mow down enemy towers and units on the way to their castle gate, while at the same time maintaining your own defenses from THEIR boulder. Online play is enjoyable when you can get an opponent, and the music, humor, references and 'storyline' are pretty good. Check it out if you have 10 USD to burn.			",134,17,1,28,8,2,21

												A lot of other reviews say what is needed, so I shal have the unusual here.Ahem,Some days you dont give one sh*t,you invite your friends to smash.When they say they dont want to,you steam gift them a bash.And then when they get casual,you manage to kick thier *ss.You crush their defences so much,they ask if we could play smash.While I sat it up they stole my TV, XBOX, money, desktop, wife, table, tea, and staplers.Rocks made me go bankrupt.Ok, better be serious too.This game is a unusual blast! So unique but so fun, I got comfortable with the tower defence and LOVED pulling some parkour as the rock. Defending takes some thought and planning ahead, while you just roll as a rock, past or ramming your enemy defences, thats your choice. Try it out, I think you will enjoy yourself if you like some tower defence and... whater the rock is.			",176,27,2,7,22,2,6

												A very silly and very fun game about rolling boulders on an obstacle course to destroy your opponents base. Each person places defenses to protect their base while rolling their boulder towards the other one's base. Not a complex premise, which makes it very easy to jump right in. The single player storyline is very humourous and the visuals are Monty Python-esque and quite comical. Overall, a great little game to sink a bit of time into here and there.8/10 - IT ROCKS ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loving this game. It's a lot of fun and very much worth the price. You roll a ball at the enemies tower and inbetween waiting for you balls to regen you basically build a tower defence.

												Rock of Ages has the kind of base concept you'd hear and say, ""hmm, that'd make a fun flash game"".As you can probably tell, this isn't a flash game.You guide your rolling stone around a winding course and hit the enemy gate until it dies. But you have a gate and the enemy has a Brian Jones! But you can both place down defences after your Ian Stewards have been smashed! And then you can use your leftover currency to buy better Mick Jaggers!It's fun, it's as slow or fast paced as you want it be, and it has a challenging difficulty curve.The cutscenes in story are silly little gags to the layman, and chock-a-block with jokes for the history nerds. The Rock of Ages is called the Rock of AGES for a reason!I'd heartily recommend this game for a romp with your friends too. Strangely enough, latency lags both players, even when they're playing with their own individual courses. I thought the core design of war mode would have countered that.Good game, I like it a whole bunch, pick it up when you need to fill some time.			",146,40,1,16,17,3,26

												This game is very well-rounded, and an excellent source of entertainment if you get bored, can't find the motivation to start up a more complex game like Europa Universalis or Kerbal Space Program, and just want to smash something fast.That's after you beat the campaign of course, which is fun in of itself. There are three main modes a single person would be interested in, and the same for multiplayer. There's War, Obstacle Course, Time Trial, and Skeeboulder. The singleplayer campaign consists entirely of War games throughout all the maps and five different 'ages', Sparta, (characterized by orange and black clay-jar carvings as an art style) the Middle Ages, (reminds me of ancient tapestries) the Renaissance, (with both roman architecture and a lot of marble) Baroque France, (very blue, very fancy) and Spain. (a very dark and gruesome Spain, however)I still pop in almost every day to play a few rounds of obstacle course, and while the campaign won't last forever there's plenty there to play for quite some time.

												This is one of those games that's hard to compare to others, because what makes it worthwhile isn't really in the mechanics necessarily.  it's the presentation and the package.  It's quirky and very Monty Python-esque, with a lot of personality.  The gameplay is enjoyable if not rather easy, though occasionally frustrating when it attempts to be difficult.  It's not a game you're likely to play through more than once, but it's a memorable experience.			",108,30,1,21,8,0,10

												Because I've seen this game praised as a twisted history lesson, here's a twisted life lesson (and maybe an actual review).When a  mommy Monty Python and a daddy Super Monkey Ball love each other very much and the tower defense genre throws a bit of its own seed in there as well, the baby is called Rock of Ages. And oh Lord, is it a fun time~For me to explain the story here would be a bit of an injustice (especially seeing as nearly every time I try to explain something awesome I accidentialy make it sound very, very stupid), but you play as Sisyphus. You know; he's the man in Hades doomed to push a rock up a hill for all eternity. But anyway, what follows his escape is a romp of insane, destuctive merriment that you should play for the humor alone.What's that? You don't like Monty Python-esque humor?Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ Play it anyway, because the gameplay is a fun take on tower defense and is quite addictive. It's not FTL levels of addictive mind you, but hey, neither is heroin.""THAT WAS OFF -TOPIC!"" said the people reading this ""review.""But I digress. If you have some money to burn, some time to kill, and an odd desire to crush things with a large stone sphere, this is the game for you. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll pull your hair out when the enemy lines up row after row of exploding barrels to stop your boulder. All in all, I heartilly recommend this game.8/10			",162,94,1,17,12,0,11

												Sisyphus, an immortal Greek Titan, has a job to do. For the rest of eternity he must push a giant boulder up a hill in Hades until a magical enchantment causes it to roll back down to the bottom again. Understandably enough, Sisyphus eventually decides this un-life isn’t for him and swiftly breaks out of Hades, taking his giant boulder and some Titan buddies with him.Rock of Ages is a hilariously chaotic mixture of Insane Obstacle Course and Tower Defence, alternating between guiding your boulder into the enemy gates to break them down, and building medieval weaponry to stop your rival boulder from breaking your own gates. It’s a genuine pleasure to watch your hastily erected dynamite finish just in time to blast your opponent completely off-course with white-knuckle timing.As you progress through the campaign by massively interrupting famous European historical events, you unlock more Tower Defence items to stymie your opponents efforts and more rock types to destroy the enemy gates which does an excellent job of keeping the gameplay of Rock of Ages fresh and delightfully experimental; will only using War Mammoths stop your opponent wrecking your gates more than wall after wall of dynamite?Rock of Ages also shines in the cutscenes between levels with both a unique art style and hugely funny direction. Famous characters and events are played out on screen in a 2D mumble-speech cinematic, with the famous opponents (normally accurate, although Plato and Aristotle probably never came back from the dead) highlighted in a massively dramatic way. It brilliantly furthers the light-hearted and joyfully silly theme.It quickly becomes apparent when playing Rock of Ages that it is a game wholeheartedly about the joy of play. Each level is short enough that progress is never too far away and you will never guess what the game is going to throw at you next. With a depth of silliness that will bring a smile to any face Rock of Ages is a pure joy to play and happily provides many hours of shameless fun.			",78,23,0,12,14,0,20

												Rock of Ages is a combination of both ball rolling and tower defense with silly humor thrown in. The game plays by giving offense and defense. The offense is rolling a ball, while the defense is setting up structures that will try and stop the opponent. The result is a fun game with a balance on tactics and skill. The game also sports a silly style as shown through the cutscenes. Each historical figure recieves a Pythonesque treatment with cutout graphics and crude animation and almost nonsensical situations. Art periods are spanned, from Greek to Rococo. The style of cutting out historical paintings and drawings is the basis of the game's graphics for 2d pieces, though in gameplay, well made 3d models are used that mimic the art period. Music is mostly famous clasical pieces and original tracks to compliment the historical theme of the game. In addition, extra modes such as Skeeball and Online multiplayer provide extra playability to the game's core. Rock of Ages is a game to enjoy!			",106,20,5,4,5,2,24

												I was looking for an inexpensive, fun game to buy for my friend and I to play for a few hours while we waited for something... It was a while ago, so I forgot what we were waiting for. Anyway, this game was fantastic fun to play with someone you know! It turned out to be hours of co-op excitement over the next few days, and we still play it occasionally. OH, the best part? Text to speech!!1 When you aren't building towers or steering your rock, you can type obscene messages for the nice little voice to repeat. Although I'd recommend you play with a friend, the single player can be just as entertaining. It's cheap, fun, the quality is surprising (no bugs at all), and will keep you giggling like little girl every time you launch it. Go ahead and buy it!			",64,10,2,5,8,2,4

												Rock of Ages is a fun little game of rolling a ball downhill past enemy units and defenses in an attempt to smash down their castle gate, while building your own defenses to prevent their ball from doing the same to your castle. And sadly, that's about it, with one major exception, the Monty-Python-like cutscenes before and after each match. The rest is just varied levels without too much to break it up in between. It can be fun to come back to, but it's also rather difficult, so your mileage may very. Decent controls and setup though, however it needs more you can do to defend and attack, more depth in general. 6/10			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												The game is worth its money although I finished singleplayer mode within 3.5 hours. But these 3.5 hours were full of fun and as you progress the game develops as well (more items, new cool maps...).It is a mixture of a jump n run dexterity and tower defense game where you have to destroy the enemies gate with a big stone you are controlling through the map while your opponent does the same with his stone. To make your oppenents life harder you can buy some tower defense items, such as aggressive cows, and place them in front of your gate. But the whole game is pretty easy to understand.

												Rock of Ages is an interesting riff on the typical strategy game. Your goal is to get your boulder to the enemies gate and crash it down. But before you control your boulder, you and your opponent are given time to set up defenses like catapults (which damage boulders) or Elephants (which can push your boulder off the map). When the set-up time expires, you can control your boulder and try to dodge your enemies defenses to get to their gate. The singleplayer campaign is split with about 90% of these ""break the opponents gate"" maps and about 10% boss battles, which really don't work as well. The game also has a 2 player VS mode, as well as a race mode where you try to get to a goal as fast as you can. The game also has a cool Monty Python animation style in its cutscenes, and it has some oddball visual humor as well. It works well in Single Player, and the AI is pretty fair, but if you want to get some more legs out of the game it's worth it to play the VS mode with a friend.			",69,16,0,8,5,0,6

												I enjoy this game because it is a fictionalized version of the reality I subscribe to. It is inspiring. Allow me to clarify.I love racing. I raced so much my feet got tired and stopped working from all the clutching involved in doing sick skids, sweet swerves, and swift stops. That is called Lame Clutch Foot, or LCF, since it starts in the foot that clutches and moves to the foot that speeds. (Automatic drivers wouldn't understand this.) Since I was diagnosed, I needed a new outlet for my ""speed-needs."" I found it in ""legal"" street races.Not to bore you with the details (plus I wouldn't want to spoil my upcoming biography), let's skip to the end where, after 2 months, I overcame every hardship known to living and ancient man.I promise to one day get my name in lights. I will be like the Moon in that picture where I will SMASH through and show the world my speed skills. And just remember: ""Whatever Speed Doesn't Kill You, Only Makes You Faster.""

												This is something out of the ordinary. Calling it a historical bowling simulator isn't fair, as it's way more fun than any bowling game.For a decent price you'll get so much enjoyment. Gameplay is surprisingly fun, but what really makes it stand out is the pythonesque humour. Had many laughs, giggles and content smiles, for example when reaching the renaissance-period, your foes are zombie Plato and Aristotle, risen from their graves to roll against you.Very few people playing online, but convince a friend to get it and you will have a great competitive multiplayer experience.Do get it, it has my absolute deepest recommendation.

												Rock of Ages is a mix between racing Super Monkey Ball-style down a track to break your opponent's gate, and tower defense to set up defenses to prevent your opponent from doing the same.It's a very whimsical game, with cutscenes reminiscent of Monty Python and a presentation to match. It's got a great charm and even if you don't like history too much, it will bring a smile to your face.The gameplay is actually pretty simple, but executed well. Although the rolling is kind of stiff, the boulder doesn't feel out of your control (unless you hit an explosive barrel or get shot by a catapult), and has a good sense of speed. The defense phase (while waiting for a new boulder to be prepped) is alright but it feels somewhat arbitrary, since it's difficult to tell how well your defenses are working.Overall, this game has style, and the gameplay is pretty enjoyable. It's quite cheap and worth checking out!			",243,32,5,13,6,2,26

												A fun and unique puzzle-action game that is part RTS and part racing game(?). Don't be fooled by the videos though, the most important part of the game is how you set up your defenses before and after you roll your rock.

												Marble Madness crossed with Tower Defense, mixed in with Historical Pictogram Comedy, and you get Rock of Ages. It's a fun game with great, strategic mechanics that forces players to both think on their toes as well as give them the satisfaction of crushing their opponent's buildings and defenses - with a rock that has a face on it no less.Besides, what other game let's you literally squish historical characters like Leonidas, Plato, Aristotle, Bacchus, Napolean, and etc.?

												While Rock of Ages isn't a particularly long game, it's 100% entertainment for the entire course of your playtime. The difficulty is well-balanced so frustration is practically non-existent, the unique blend of tower defense/strategy and... Super Monkey Ball and Monty Python is certainly something. Very weird, very humorous, very engaging. At not even 10 bucks a pop, this is a game you seriously shouldn't miss.			",544,152,13,88,44,5,65

												Rock of Ages is a combination of both ball rolling and tower defense with silly humor thrown in. The game plays by giving offense and defense. The offense is rolling a ball, while the defense is setting up structures that will try and stop the opponent. The result is a fun game with a balance on tactics and skill. The game also sports a silly style as shown through the cutscenes. Each historical figure recieves a Pythonesque treatment with cutout graphics and crude animation and almost nonsensical situations. Art periods are spanned, from Greek to Rococo. The style of cutting out historical paintings and drawings is the basis of the game's graphics for 2d pieces, though in gameplay, well made 3d models are used that mimic the art period. Music is mostly famous clasical pieces and original tracks to compliment the historical theme of the game. In addition, extra modes such as Skeeball and Online multiplayer provide extra playability to the game's core. Rock of Ages is a game to enjoy!			",106,20,5,4,5,2,24

												Rock of Ages is a unique game with more to offer in fun and challenge than you may expect. I really enjoy its silly sense of humor. That sense of humor takes the edge off of what would sometimes be too frustrating of a challenge. The game starts off relatively easy, but the difficulty ramps up quickly. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I imagine it would be alot of fun to play this against a friend or family member.I would definitely recommend this game. It's a nice, unique addition to your games collection that probably isn't like anything else that you have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Greatly enjoyed single player mode.  You guide your ""rock"" down a ramp fraugh with perils to attack the castle at the end and breach the walls.  In between each run, you add obstacles to the path to slow or destroy your opponents ball, for he is trying to breach your castle.  Gets pretty tricky toward the end- both in guiding your ball with agility and adding the right obstacles in the right places.  I suspect the reviewer who said ""it comes down to whoever gets 3 balls to the end first"" played the game to the end, as that stops being true by halfway through.  Great music and sense of humor on top of hte compelling gameplay.  A complete joy and a legitimate use of your money AND time.			",605,332,22,116,74,8,140

												The world premier virtual bowling tower defence where you get to flatten historical figures and battle mythological beasts. It also boasts a very much Monty Python inspired aesthetic and sense of humor. The challenging campaign is enough to keep the ""just one more"" attitude. While I haven't tried the online multiplayer or the split screen mode, I have had a go at the alternate gamemodes and found them a nice distraction from the main game. The game also allows for you to play as any historical figure you have defeated and use a variety of different bolders, my favourite is the Block of Ages. All in all the game has a challenging and interresting campaign, with the welcome option of multiplayer.			",136,9,6,18,31,2,50

												I change my vote about the game. The first time I played the story mode. the game was like a torture to me. It was really painful playin' it. No kidding so unbearable to the point I left it unfinished for weeks. (Honestly, I don't know exactly why, maybe because the humor doesn't suit me, or the way the rock move annoy me, or the sound when the rock move, or when the rock fall, or all the high-pitched screams, the obstacles, the gameplay, or maybe all of them) Time passed. I gave the game another chance. and the results:[+] I enjoyed playing the time-trial mode,[+] I also enjoyed collecting keys, and the achievements,[+] more than 30 unique levels to be played [-] I still didn't enjoy playin the story mode, [-] >30 levels in the story mode,[-] no multiplayer online,.[-] =/= 100%Overall actually the game is not that bad.

												Rock of Ages is a really simple game. You have some giant balls, your opponent has some giant balls and roll at each other in the hope that you can break them before they break you. All the while various figures and events from European history prance across the screen in their attempt to amuse you. I'm a bit worried about going on even more about the game since I do want to over think the entire experience. The game's price might be a bit high given than its been released for a few years now so I might recommend that you wait for it to go on sale like I did, but I can safely say that even without a sale the single player experience in the game is totally worth it.If you want to read a more detailed review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/09/rock-of-ages.html.

												I enjoy this game because it is a fictionalized version of the reality I subscribe to. It is inspiring. Allow me to clarify.I love racing. I raced so much my feet got tired and stopped working from all the clutching involved in doing sick skids, sweet swerves, and swift stops. That is called Lame Clutch Foot, or LCF, since it starts in the foot that clutches and moves to the foot that speeds. (Automatic drivers wouldn't understand this.) Since I was diagnosed, I needed a new outlet for my ""speed-needs."" I found it in ""legal"" street races.Not to bore you with the details (plus I wouldn't want to spoil my upcoming biography), let's skip to the end where, after 2 months, I overcame every hardship known to living and ancient man.I promise to one day get my name in lights. I will be like the Moon in that picture where I will SMASH through and show the world my speed skills. And just remember: ""Whatever Speed Doesn't Kill You, Only Makes You Faster."" (My favorite quote from myself.)Donate to my Kickstarter today!			",239,42,4,25,17,3,41

												I recommend this game for casuals who are trying to get into tower defense games, however I feel that the tower D/boulder mix didn't work so well as a puzzle, specially for people who are veterans in this type of game. I played only single player, the multiplayer might be fun tho.You see, I must have played 20 or something maps from the campaign. It didn't take much ingenuity, just speed with the boulder. Some maps required some tower building, but I never felt challenged in any aspect. Basically I didn't get that satisfaction when you build a really good defense on tower defense games.This game gets a ""yes"" from me specially because it tries something new and has great humor in it, despite not achieving the greatest polish in gameplay.

												Greatly enjoyed single player mode.  You guide your ""rock"" down a ramp fraugh with perils to attack the castle at the end and breach the walls.  In between each run, you add obstacles to the path to slow or destroy your opponents ball, for he is trying to breach your castle.  Gets pretty tricky toward the end- both in guiding your ball with agility and adding the right obstacles in the right places.  I suspect the reviewer who said ""it comes down to whoever gets 3 balls to the end first"" played the game to the end, as that stops being true by halfway through.  Great music and sense of humor on top of hte compelling gameplay.  A complete joy and a legitimate use of your money AND time.			",605,332,22,116,74,8,140

												I really had a good laugh with this game. The cutscenes alone are just brilliant and the gameplay is really engaging. I spent 6 hours non stop until I had to quit due to basic needs, but if it wasn't for them, I would have kept going. I can only recomend this game. It keeps all the promises it makes.

												I wasn't sure of this game at a glance, so I bought it with the Christmas deal that's running as I write this. Highly, highly recommend it. It's a great mixture of strategy and...I'm not sure what to call it, action? More accurately would be strategy and rolling. At first, you may not see the appeal, but the game has a great sense of humor, along with smooth gameplay, a fun art style, and good music. Definitely suggest this if you like thinking and smashing things. Which may not seem to go together, but let me assure you, they do, and great fun ensues as a result.			",176,45,2,17,15,1,35

												Possibly my new favorite racing game, and I don't even like racing games! Er, well, Rock of Ages is a humorous title with some stellar art (the use of classical pieces does in fact remind me of [and I know others have said this] Terry Gilliam's work) and fun gameplay. The multiplayer shines especially in obstacle course mode, which is essentially a race, and war, which mixes in a little strategy. Thus far into the game, the only irritation is that the obstacle course multiplayer only allows two players; I could see this being ridiculously fun with more players! I do recommend this game, especially if the price is low.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												Prepare yourself for the journey of a lifetime.Welcome to rock of ages, a game about rolling a boulder down some... interesting places. Due to a lack of competence, I cannot say much about the difficulty of the game, but I can speak about the actual mechanics:-The game features interesting tower defense which does add to the game positively-The cinematics have an interesting art style that always keeps the viewer amused-The levels are designed with multiple routes which allow for fun gameplayIn terms of graphics, I am fairly impressed with the actual gameplay, but it seems to downsize the resolution everytime I reboot the game, which may get annoying.The controls are generally good, but occasionally tend to bug outIt is fairly fun but not something I would play for more than a couple of minutes in singleplayerThe multiplayer mode did suffer from some connection issues when I tested it, but it pretty funI would reccomend this game to anyone who likes silly things and just generally anyone.

												What can I say about this game. I didn't expect what I got...maybe that is what I should say. I purchased this game as part of a bundle and started playing it and let me tell you, it is strangely addicting. As I'm sure you're aware, you play as a boulder, rolling through a course, trying to destroy the opponent's gate first and kill them while they are trying to same to you. You lay traps for your opponent as well as they do for you, making this an oddly fun game. There are only two downfalls to this game. One, the game is, for the most part, fairly easy. Sure, it doesn't take much for one to buy and play this game but there isn't much of a challenge for those looking for it, though there is multiplayer. Second, there are collectables in this game: Keys. These keys, early on, are easy to get and put in places which you must creatively think how to get. That being said, the later keys are unfair to get, especially the one on the last level before the final boss. Overall, a solid, easy game which can be enjoyed for a few hours.

												A strange little game whereas you play as a rolling boulder who must breach an enemy's gate several times through an obstacle course to squish a historical figure. In between turns, you are also battlefield commander of sorts, erecting defenses such as turrets, attack cows, and bombs to harass the enemy's boulder, who is similarly rushing your leader and building defenses against you. It's pretty unique, really. There's even a side mode where you're basically playing skeeball. The general atmosphere is VERY Monty Python and I really don't have a comparison to how the game plays- it's very distinctive. Be noted, however, the game is a bit difficult and the building defenses part is not particularly interesting compared to rolling the boulder around. Still, I would recommend trying this title out.

												Rock of Ages is a hilarious and unique type of game that's a mix of a rolling simulator (is that a thing?) and a strategy game. You alternate between rolling your boulder through a course, trying not to fall off or get destroyed by enemies and collecting items, ultimately trying to hit the enemie's gate as hard as possible, and building defenses. The graphics are very unique, the gameplay is a ton of fun, the voices and cutscenes are hilarious, and it's got some great boss battles as well as a ""skee ball"" mode and multiplayer. It's a surprise gem and I can't recommend it enough.			",1113,290,35,131,75,10,129

												You send a boulder down a twisty slope towards your opponent’s castle, steering and jumping--don’t ask how--as you splat flat buildings and little screaming people, bouncing over defences and smacking into the gates. At the same time, your opponent (computer or human) does the same to you. After the rock bashes a chunk off the gate workers start carving another boulder and, in the brief downtime, you place defences like explosives, wind machines, brave doomed elephants and cows. It's more meticulous than I expected. When I'm building traps I'm being rushed, but when racing downhill I'm constantly made to slow down. Still, there's nothing quite like it. The animation, which goes through various periods of art history as you progress, is gorgeous and hilarious. The boss battles aren’t a great addition, although defeating Michelangelo’s David by shooting a boulder at his♥♥♥♥♥♥was certainly an experience.			",418,123,17,65,31,13,65

												I found this game between (nicely) weird and a bit monotonous, but cannot tell why.You build traps along a course for the enemy rock to roll into, while you try to get to his gates as quickly as possible. It usually takes three times trough the course to break the enemy's gate and win the round.For me it sometimes was a bit confusing and the controls did not react as I expected... still not too bad of a game.

												Rock of Ages is kind of a mix between racing, tower defense, and bowling. You're playing, essentially, as one person building traps to place in the way of your opponent's boulder, then you roll your own boulder down their side until you smash against their gate, while trying not to get destroyed along the way. The story mode starts out pretty easy but turns surprisingly hard at one or two points once you start facing against ballistas and such. The war game mode is the meat of it, and it's a blast.I did have one or two complaints though. Firstly, the kind of humor in this game can be hit or miss, and for me it was a definite miss. Secondly, the boss segments in the story were by far the most boring parts of the entire game. It's not even clear at first what you're supposed to do, and when you do figure it out it's repetitive and dull, making you wish you could just get back to smashing open gates. Third, I kept running into a bug when resetting levels where the sky view on the war map would get stuck and refused to move until I realized it was detecting the W key as being constantly active; hitting the W key once fixed it, but it was still annoying.Apart from that, I still haven't found anyone to play multiplayer with, at least through random matching. You'll need a friend or two with the game to make that aspect work.Still, those minor complaints aside, this is a really fun game. Not one you'll sink tons of hours into, but one you'll have plenty of fun with for a while, and can come back to once in a while to relax while smashing things up with your giant rock.

												The premise of this game is very creative. You roll a rock down an obstacle filled cliff down to crash a castle. You compete against another rock thrown at your castle. Everything surrounded by a humorous take on different art styles through history. It also helps that it was developed by fellow countrymen Ace Team. I wish multiplayer was better (I hardly got matched), but single player is plenty fun.			",134,23,3,2,5,0,11

												This is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Its just so satisfying! Playing online with friends is a blast! Buy it if you can! This is the type of game that can leave you and your friends screaming as you both rush down the hill trying to reach the door in a mad frenzy. I highly reccomend it!			",98,2,1,5,12,0,3

												Rock of Ages is a game where you play as a 3-layered rock and your goal is to take the least amount of damage before you attempt to smash down your opponents door and crush him under your rock. It's kinda like bowling, except that you try to avoid the pins and the backpanel is your neighbors front door.If Monthy Python, bowling and a real-time strategy game had a threesome and made a baby, this would be the result.

												If you are up for a bowlingesque game that is both race and obstacle course, then this is the game for you. It also has a sense of humor akin to Monty Python. I love it. I just wish you could do local vs with one keybord and one 360 controller. Saddly you need two 360 controllers for local vs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game rocks! You try to destroy the enemies gate before they destroy yours. It's a mix of Katamari, Tower Defence and Monty Python.			",205,35,0,25,28,1,27

												I like the game mechanics, this game really is fun, but the story definetly is too short for such a high price, so I would recommend buying the game when it's on sale.			",105,86,17,4,11,0,12

												Athough I think the game itself is done very well and I like the concept, the graphics and the funny little skits.... this game agrivates the hell out of me.  If you are easily frustrated by games, don't buy it... or buy it and cheat.See comment to my own review for post details.			",88,37,0,3,7,0,4

												Score: 8/10This is essentially a bowling game merged with tower defense. Your goal is to break down the door on the other side of the map with your giant boulder and crush your opponent who is beyond the door while your enemy attempts to do the same. You can upgrade your boulder as well as put up defenses to protect your door. The boulders can be knocked off the map as well as destroyed causing you to have to remake the boulder and send it on it's merry way again. This game also has local co-op so it makes a great party game.			",647,319,15,99,47,6,79

												This is probably the second best comedy Video Game I've played (Borderlands series being 1st on the list). It has a playstyle I've never seen, the art is great, and the cutscenes are pure gold  xDIf only more people played it though, the multiplayer is fun.I recommend this game to anyone and everyone-9.5/10  (-0.5 due to lack of players)			",207,24,5,12,24,1,37
