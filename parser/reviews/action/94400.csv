This game is truly amazing as a local vs. experience. Plus, the sound track on some of those stages is amazing. Great game, increadibly precise, but accessible. Tons of fun!			",132,38,0,19,9,1,24

												You're at the last part of the level and one enemy stands in your way. It gives you this giddy feeling, those 5 seconds of a showdown, staring down your opponent, waiting to see who's going to make the first move. The adrenaline starts pumping after you charge in for the first swing and your opponent counters and knocks your sword out of your hand. You're swordless. You close your eyes and take a deep breath as your opponent charges at you with his sword. Seconds before impact you leap and flip over his head, grab your sword, turn around and throw it right through his head. As he falls to the ground you spit on his body and sprint through the gate to the cheering of thousands of spectators.Then a giant worm eats you. Victory.This game rocks. I'll start off with that. You got these tiny little guys with swords fencing for their lives back and forth as the bodies pile up. This is the kind of game that you can actually be skillful at, by watching the o0ther person's sword you can try to figure out how to counter what he's doing. It has a mortal combat type ladder single player where you play through a bunch of levels against harder and harder characters and I've managed to get about halway up. Not sure if there are lives but if you lose you continue from the same character you don't have to start over.I'm most excited for the multiplayer though, I can't wait to invite some friends over to play this because this is one of those games which will cause a lot of screaming and yelling. I just played a random person through the matchmaking a bunch of times and it worked flawlessly, I'm excited to play more.Also in the multiplayer section where there's offline and other options for multiplayer there are a whole sleuth of ""variants"": Slow mo, Fast mo, boomerang swords, divekicks, throwing and other stuff.Really not a bad learning curve. Yeah, the first couple of rounds you can't figure out what the hell is going on, but after 15 minutes of trial and error I was leaping, stabbing, and doing a lot of other weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ Music's not shabby, you got the shwing shwing of the swords in there so I'm happy.The game makes you feel like that guy from Princess Bride with those wiggly swords.The bad: No windowed mode, and the how to play menu is broken to all hell. Just check the controls and go with it.It's just a fun game, it's got a lot of replay value and it would always be cool to see more levels or maybe... hats?			",195,40,11,27,40,1,13

												Probably few people have heard about Nidhogg. At first glance it's a simple 2D fighting with 8-bit graphics. But is it really?　I CHALLENGE YOU TO A PIXEL DUEL　　There is no plot in Nidhogg. Instead, only fights with a computer opponent or with other people in online. The meaning of each battle is not killing the enemy, but in achieving the opposite end of the map. Four keys for movement, one key for punch and one key for jump. Sounds easier than it actually is. In fact, fightings are very funny and full of madness, but not without subtleties of the combat system. I advise you to play only in the company of friends. Singleplayer and online battles with strangers doesn't bring much fun.　NOT ENOUGH PIXELS　　Nidhogg has enough of advantages to buy it. But there are some unpleasant drawbacks. Too few maps, quickly bored gameplay, inconvenient system for playing online with friends (A friend is not always able to connect to your game). These shortcomings, in fact, are not much spoiling the gaming experience. If it were not for one thing. Too high price. Seriously. It should cost twice less, judging on how many content in it.　Multiplayer:　　Online: ☺☺☺☺☺OOOOO　　Co-op: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Storyline: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OOO　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OO　Complexity of the achievements: Some achievements will make you play this game for a long time. And not all of them can be easily performed.　　　Nidhogg is a game with a so much　　fun and madness, but with so few　　levels and other content. If you're don't　　mind to spending so much money on it,　　then you'll are sure to spend a few fun　　evenings.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To buy or not to buy, that is the question [6.5/10].

												Way too expensive for what it is. Although it's a very fun local game or just to play online with a friend that's close, there's barely any content here. I believe there's just 4 maps in this, only 1 type of weapon, and no netplay with random people. Once in awhile it's fun to pick up and play, but definitely not worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nidhogg is a fast paced, local multiplayer focused fencing game developed by Messhof. In Nidhogg you take up fencing and fight one on one matches against AI or other players through local or online multiplayer. The aim of the game is to make it past your opponent and run to the other side of the map.+Awesome pixel graphics+Simple gameplay, all you have to do is stab your opponent and run to the other side of the map, it might sound boring but it's actually really entertaining, especially when playing with friends+The different maps are very different to each other which provides some nice variation for the game+Nidhogg can be enjoyed in Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer/Matchmaking+The fast-paced side-scrolling nature of Nidhogg makes it perfect for playing in Local Multiplayer and things get pretty intense, making Local Multiplayer pretty exhilirating and the best way to enjoy the game+Nidhogg features a tournament mode which allows 3-8 players to play Local Multiplayer+The soundtrack is great and fits with the game well+The fighters in the game are all brightly coloured and blood basically acts like paint for the maps so you end up with some pretty cool designs on the floor if one area of the map gets particularly bloody+Both the KB&M controls and the 360 Gamepad controls are very good and very responsive-Nidhogg has a severe lack of content due to only having four maps, for £10.99 that kind of content really isn't good enough-Singleplayer gets repetitive (thanks to the lack of content) very quickly-Until recently Online Multiplayer wasn't very good (due to lag mainly) but it has been fixed, sadly it would seem not many people who own Nidhogg know that it was fixed since the game's Online Multiplayer remains pretty much deadVerdict:Highly Recommended, but Only When Discounted (6.5/10)Nidhogg is a great, fast paced fighting game with awesome graphics and simple gameplay, sadly the game is very much let down by its lack of content and high asking price. If you're looking for what is one of the best Local Multiplayer games on Steam and you don't mind paying the high price then give Nidhogg a go, if not, wait for a sale.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

												This game is somewhat of a double-edged sword. If you have a friend (or enemy) who is in the room with you, this game is great. Otherwise, you probably shouldn't get it.The game plays like an elaborate dance; two players fighting for the honour of being consumed by the titular serpent- the Nidhogg. The controls are simple: one button jabs your sword, one button makes you jump. The real beauty is how the mechanics blend together. Swords can be moved up and down to reach a jumping or ducking enemy. Swords at the same height will clash, and can block the opposing player's attacks. Swords can also be knocked out of a players hand by some particularly crafty swordplay. Jousting with your sword fully raised throws your sword through the air, which is hard to dodge, but leaves you without your best weapon. Thrusting in midair results in a divekick, a techniquie used to relieve the enemy of their weapon (that is, if you don't impale yourself on their weapon first). The result is an EXTREMELY intense sword battle. Matches can last for seconds, others can last for half of an hour or more. The ducking and dodging and jumping and running blends brilliantly with the game's glitch-art style and kickass music. You can play this before the start of a lecture. You can play this at a party, with a tournament of eight players. You can use it as a substitute for rock-paper-scissors in decision-making situations. It's become one of my go-to games when friends are over (see also: touhou 9).However, this only applies if you have real-life friends. Sure, the game has online play, but it's horribly laggy and bugged, with no sign of a fix. The lag ruins the crucial fast-paced action of the game and usually results in the host player winning. Because of this, you'll be very lucky to actually find anyone through the matchmaking service. The single-player mode is basically multiplayer but against a series of bots, which each have distinct playstyles and weaknesses. It's very much like playing against real players, but nowhere near as fun as having friends to play with in the same room. Additionally, the price is VERY steep for what the contents of the game are: only four (admittedly BEAUTIFUL) levels. Overall: One of the best local multiplayer games that exist. If you have real friends that can come over and play: get this game ...but get it during a sale. If you have no friends: sorry, this game isn't for you. Go out and make some friends instead!

												This is my first review on steam.This game is awesome to play against friends, it is intense and purely skill based. The biggest problem with this is the multiplayer system only works when it wants to so you can't even play online with your buddies unless the ""Server"" is feeling okay. When the server is working which is probably isn't right now, you are unable to customize the online multiplayer match which is a huge part of the multiplayer experience in nidhogg. In conclusion this is not a $15 game. I am glad I bought it for $3 and it is worth that when it is working. Offline mode locally I am sure is the only use for this game. Do not pay $15, beyond waste.			",116,29,1,19,14,0,23

												Don't always go for the top reviews like I did with this one. This game looked fantastic in the videos. It actually is if you go by the single player mode which doesn't last long and (more importantly) local multiplayer. Local multiplayer is where this shines. If you engage in this frequently, get it. I only have occasional local multiplayer games and this is why it was a bad purchase for me and might be for you.There hasn't been one update since this game's release. The guy ignored EVERY support request and then had the cheek to release it on the PS4. Why is this a problem? The netcode is HORRIBLE, and latency is the most important factor with a game where reaction time can be very important. If you play online and enjoy it consistently, get back to me, because that would be the first I've heard about it. Players will teleport more than in Counter-Strike in the '90s and is more buggy than the Master Chief Collection.			",1371,539,52,154,143,18,198

												I have been looking forward to this game for a long time, and figured that after 3 years of ""development"" (or what ever they were doing with it before releasing) this would be a really well polished game, and it is to a great extent. 	The offline 2 player duel gameplay is simply amazing, hectically fast and fun twitch game. Playing with a friend could grant you countless hours of fun. The graphics are beautiful. If this was a freeware game it would be great, if it was $2 it would be great, however it is priced at 15$ which is too much to pay for the amount of content (which is 4 arenas and a tacked on single player mode) 	Now the bad things are, as some people have mentioned; The ONLINE multilayer is currently  unplayable, a big bummer for me. Another really big bummer is that in fact, it does NOT have ""full"" controller support; It does support fancy Xbox controllers, but it would not recognize my lovely SNES style USB controllers which other games recognize just fine. So ya, this coupled with a 15$ price tag and lack of content leads me to a thumb down :( sorry. 	Once again it IS a great 2 player offline game, and I will be playing it a lot when I have friends over, but its not worth 15$. Wait till this game is cheaper and patched for proper controller support and online play, then it will be worth it.EDIT: GOOD: I have had a few good online games with minimal lag, but it is rare with random matches. BAD:  Game variant options do not seem work in online matches.			",237,74,1,17,50,2,40

												Nidhogg provides some of the fastest and most enjoyable monochromatic bloodletting one could hope to experience.   The premise is simple.  You are a pixelated swordsman in a territorial conflict with your opponent, most often your best friend sitting right beside you.  Each standoff is lightning fast, and invariably ends in a gratuitous splattering of blood.   Kill your opponent with a well-timed and well-placed lunge, hurl your épée at his head, or just knock him down and rip his heart out.  Savagery is encouraged, and provides a hilarious counterpoint to the civilized image of fencing.  Once you have managed to kill your opponent, you can progress to your goal until just seconds later, he respawns and you must again defeat him to progress. Lose, and he gains ground on you. This ebb and flow continues until one of you reaches the final screen where the winner is given a true hero’s sendup: He is eaten by a flying worm.Nidhogg is not just a circus of inanity and violence, but is some of the best fun you can have with your friends.  Controls are responsive, animations are fast and smooth, and landing consecutive killing blows provides a jolt of dopamine that keeps you coming back for more.  There are multiple arenas to choose from, each one visually unique and designed to make you rethink your strategy.  Some corridors are too tight for jumping or sword throwing, so both your opponent and the landscape will make you think on your toes.Visually, Nidhogg exhibits a unique combination of minimalism through pixilation and solid colors.  It highlights the expression of characters through animation rather than textures.  It is aesthetically arresting and securely has its own style.  These visuals are elevated even further when coupled with an exceptional soundtrack by Daedelus.Nidhogg could have provided only the core one-on-one experience, but if you look deeper there are a lot of extras.  There is a tournament mode supporting up to 8 players. There is a multitude of variants in gameplay to explore. There is a single player experience pitting you against an increasingly difficult array of AI personalities.  Additionally, there is an online multiplayer component, but at the time of this review, I experienced some unfortunate glitches.  In several matches I experienced moments where I killed my opponent, but immediately the game changed states, and my character unexplainably died.  It wasn’t often, but it was often enough to sour the experience.  I’m told that the online component is still a work in progress, so if you don’t have a friend handy to play local multiplayer check the forums for progress.Nidhogg was first shown in 2010, and since then Messhoff, comprised of Mark Essen and Kristy Norindr, have worked to shine the core game into a full-fledged release.  Nidhogg is available today on Steam for $11.99, and if you have friends, it is well worth your dollars.			",195,34,2,32,11,2,38

												Nidhogg is not bad at all in terms of gameplay. I won’t go into much detail because the trailers and such pretty much show what it's about, but its damn fun to play. The combat has a lot of options and things going for it and nicely juggles both complexity and ease of learning. The music and visuals match and mesh with the feel of the combat excellently. I can easily see how co-op can be a blast with friends, or the tourney potential. So why is this not recommended? Because the devs cared more about the game’s style, raw gameplay, and media hype then its long-term substance or support. You’re playing this game and having a lot of fun, and then before you even hit the one hour mark you find yourself thinking “that’s it?” and then it’s all downhill from there. Singleplayer consists of you fighting a dozen or two progressively harder AI opponents, however the stages start looping after opponent four. Yep, only four stages. There’s no story to speak of or even an attempt at one, and once you’re done with it you’re left with nearly nothing else to do with the game. Multiplayer is dead, D-E-A-D. Its features are minimal and in terms of functionality the MP barely worked when the game came out, and then because they never fixed it people gave up on it entirely so there’s no one playing. This game deserved more support and more features and updates from a solid company. But because it didn’t get that and most likely won’t ever, I am sorry to say that charging $15 for this is broad daylight robbery and I cannot recommend it. Only buy this if it’s on sale, and with the understanding that outside of being a weekend distraction or occasional hour of fun with a friend this game has no value.			",354,63,2,53,29,2,59

												Nidhogg embodies the aggressive, intoxicating thrill of competition. Through hazily defined personas and their ethereal exacting movements, a simple duel is transformed into a bustling frenzy of close saves, impossible luck, and overlapping cries of victory and defeat. It only took one match for me to fall in love with Nidhogg – to be hooked by the overwhelming energy that erupts both inside and outside the game – and hours later each round continues to bring with it that same feeling that I’m discovering something incredible for the first time and desperately need someone to share it with.In the most concise and direct of terms, Nidhogg is a two-player fencing game which calls back to the simpler times of 80’s arcade classics like Joust and Pong, but bridges the generational gap with a precision and adrenaline that would have melted the insides of the quarter devouring machines which have grown extinct over the last 30 years. Nidhogg’s indirect heritage doesn’t define it so much as provides a sense of place for Nidhogg where so many other games are quickly lost and forgotten. Already it feels like a classic I’ve loved for years and a staple game that is kept installed eternally as part of an evergreen collection of multiplayer games.Nidhogg works so immensely well because it’s the sort of game you stop thinking about almost immediately. Controlling your swordsman in Nidhogg is impeccably intuitive as they move and react contextually and clearly, causing you to forget about how your controlling them as you focus all your attention on what you’re actually doing. Nidhogg feels much like a spontaneous dance between two people attempting to kill each other. It’s not about executing a particular move or performing a perfect counter block, but allowing yourself to be taken by the moment as you and your opponent flow together in a blur of kicks and stabs as you fight against each other in a deadly tug of war.The organic interplay which develops over the course of a match helps keep Nidhogg from ever feeling one-sided the way many multiplayer games do. Everything which takes place during a match is the dual result of two players colliding and reacting with one another, which forms a dynamic that feels cordial and joyful. Even during my worst matches I often found myself erupting in laugher over my own mistakes and haphazard attempts to regain ground, because even when I’m losing Nidhogg’s ridiculous pace and explosions of pixels are still ludicrously fun to be a part of.To me the lifespan of a multiplayer game is almost entirely based on whether or not it’s enjoyable to the person losing, and I’ve never played a competitive game where me and my supposed competitor have fallen into such fits of laughter precisely because we’re losing. Nidhogg is a brilliantly tactical and engaging beast of a fighting game, but that it can also allow for a much friendlier mood and feel satisfying even when you’re outmatched is a remarkable achievement very few other games can boast.I suppose it has to be mentioned though that there is one rather enormous qualifier to recommending Nidhogg, that being the requirement of another local player. Though there is a single player mode it feels like a lifeless shell of its multiplayer counterpart, only potentially worth venturing into as a means of practicing advanced strategies against increasingly tough AI opponents. The online mode as well, despite being fairly functional, can’t compete with the feeling of having another person in the room with you (even more so if you are playing against random players). It will suffice if you have absolutely no other options, but I found myself growing tired of it fairly quickly and wishing the person I was playing with was sitting next to me instead of on the other end of the internet.I desperately hope that whoever is reading this won’t be hamstrung by a lack of local competition though, as with another person in the room Nidhogg is a phenomenal experience that takes only moments to sell itself but has had me repeatedly stuck in place for hours at a time, always shocked when I finally look at the clock and realize how long we’ve been playing. It’s a finely tuned machine you won’t notice and a catalyst for the delightful multiplayer mayhem that few other games have come anywhere close to matching for me.Developer Messhof understands that multiplayer means more than putting two players on the screen; that making sure multiple people are having fun isn’t as simple as letting them play together, and that creating a friendly competition in a space where there can be only one winner is perhaps the easiest thing to screw up and the most imperative to get right. Nidhogg doesn’t assume what it’s doing is easy the way a lot of similar games seem to, but knows if it can get it right that the end result is an atmosphere and enthusiasm that can’t be matched. Wow, did they ever follow through on that one.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. ",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

												This is certainly a fun little game that is best played at a party. It gets lots of laughs. What you see in the trailer is exactly what you get - it is fairly bare-bones, which is ok because it works well. What is not ok is the asking price. Fifteen bucks for what I believe is only three levels and very little options just doesn't make me happy. I got it for like two bucks and I still don't really play it all that much.My main problems:-Too much money for not nearly enough content (not to compare or anything but Christ I got Minecraft for 13$)-They could certainly add in more variation (I mean idk - how about different fighters/colors/levels/weapons/etc.)			",563,162,5,75,79,8,72

												The game is fun, but the price tag is way too steep. The game does provide some pretty fun 1v1 moments with friends, but you wont be playing for a long time. Wait for a sale, and make sure you have someone to play with.			",140,12,1,10,10,1,12

												Excellent dueling game... unfortunately that means it takes two to make it any fun. Quality game that's hindered in my opinion by being somewhat overpriced (and it hasn't had any good sales yet either).Too many good games that sell for similar or cheaper for this strictly 1v1 game to compete based on value for price.EDIT: It just got the sale it needed. Consume, at this price it's most definitely worth adding to your gaming portafolio.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												Want a fun little game where the pure aim is to stab your friends repeatedly and run to the other side of the map? Then this is the game for you!Pros: The game is fun, fast paced, keeps you on your toes, music is perfect for the game and comedic moments are never far behind.Cons:It's very limited, you fight your way to the other side of the map then rinse and repeat.Matchmaking is terrible it takes too long to find an opponent unless you are playing against friends, this is primarily due to the fact that having very little to do in the game results in short play times and once you've done it there's really no need to go back.Overall:It's not really worth the money for what it is. It's very fun but the fun will soon run out. I would only recommend it if you have the money to spend on it for only a couple hours of fun. ",505,97,11,63,45,4,72

												Nidhogg is a simplistic fencing game, the winner being the one who comes out on top in a contest of deadly tug-of-war, with a welcoming art style, dynamic soundtrack, a polite attention to detail and incredibly pleasing vistas, this game warms you inside, as you physically and mentally try to out-do your opponent and advance screens. The price isn't totally agreeable, £10.99 ($15) is a tad steep in my opinion as there isn't too much to do alone. However, this game shines in its co-op fun factor. Attemping to line up your friend(s) on your sword like a pixelated shish kebab is very amusing and you'll find yourselves having a blast whenever you're together and Nidhogg's involved. If you've got a buddy to have a 'stab' at this game with then do. Other than that, it's most probably worth getting for yourself in a sale, and only in a sale.			",357,48,13,18,26,1,11

												Gameplay always comes first, beyond story or visuals. Gameplay is what makes a game tick. And gameplay is where Nidhogg shines.It's tense tactical game where your skills as a player matter as much as your ability to lure and trick your opponent. It's a subtle give and take, of establishing patterns only to break them, of intimate moments of stillness and caution as the two of you step back and forth anticipating the first strike.It's a game where all are equally matched, where true skill decides the victor rather than the perks, upgrades, boosters of so many other gamesThe simplicity of the controls hide a surprisingly tense and strategic game. One hit kills and there's a wide range of moves and maneuvers at your disposal. While I love Samurai Gunn's lightning fast speed and more varied maps, Nidhogg's slower paced, more cerebral challenge is absolutely addicting. And while you may be able to leap through the air with ease in Samurai Gunn, your moveset is far more versatile in Nidhogg. The smooth animations give each fight a fluid dynamic feel.Not that the visuals are bad either. The surreal graphics and chunky pixels give the game a style all its own. And while the number of maps may seem small, it's definitely a case of quality over quanity. Each map is unique, with its own eccentricities to be mastered from the concealing high grass of the Wilds to the collapsing bridges in Clouds. Not only that, each map consists of several areas as you and your opponent push back and forth to victory. Epic 20 minute duels are not uncommonI rarely play online games, but Nidhogg has me hooked. This is a must play			",486,90,9,35,36,2,34

												Nidhogg is a side scrolling fighting game which was released in early 2014. You duel against another sword wielding foe.  You have to get to the other side of the map before your opponent. In order to do so, you must run, jump, throw your sword and slide past the other enemies. The actual gameplay is very simple, just kill the other guy really. This can be done in a number of ways, the most common is just to kill the enemy in a sparing match. You can also disarm your opponent by knocking their weapon out of their hands leaving them very vulnerable with just their fists to fight back with. You can get quite technical if you want though, by wall jumping, dive kicks and knocking down enemies by sliding their feet out. Nidhogg has a single player mode, which is quite enjoyable, but can be completed in about two hours if you have any sort of skill at the game. The single player is essentially the four different levels repeated over and over increasing in difficulty. While I did have fun playing this mode, the real fun from Nidhogg comes out of the local multiplayer mode. This will pit you against your friends in a duel with the same mechanics as previously mentioned, things get competitive very fast, so watch out!  We also have an online multiplayer options available, however there were no players online every time I checked so I would class this as a no go zone.The graphics are a very simplistic style, which actually have a nice look to them; this is the type of game that doesn't need fancy textures and shadows to make it more appealing, as you hardly pay any attention to the graphics due to how fast paced the gameplay is. The single player mode of Nidhogg is about two hours long, so if you are purely looking for a single player experience, this may not be for you since there is not much replay-ability for single player. If you have friends who you can hook up a second controller with, Nidhogg really shines there. The majority of my time on Nidhogg was spent in a local multiplayer mode and it's an absolute blast.Whilst I think the price of £10,99 is quite steep for this game given the lack of single player and online multiplayer content available, the amount of fun you can have in local multiplayer redeems it slightly. So I am going to recommend Nidhogg, but only when it is on sale for anything under £5.  This is certainly a game I will be keeping installed for when friends come round. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play

												It's funny and competitive. No other game lets you that much control over your sword. The fighters are nimble, and the controls are smooth. As much as it's amazing when playing with someone, it's boring alone, and the online is dead. Buy it only if you have IRL friends. Also, to play only in short game sessions.			",102,55,0,10,19,1,13

												I love this game, I love it soo much. But I'm nearly very close to giving it a thumbs down due to the somewhat buggy gameplay and shallow content. I have played this game extremely competitively and have a current record of 9:11, and from that 27 hour experience I can say I've speculated about every mechanic in this game down the very brim and have noticed extremely miniscule mistakes in the programming. This game needs to be more polished. Thank you. 7 / 10			",482,85,5,41,50,2,35

												This game is a work of art.  Definitely a masterpiece.  The swordplay is very interesting and different from many other games.The online multiplayer, however, is severely broken.  There is currently no indication that the developer intends to fix the problem, yet they are offering a 2-pack purchase option.Even if online multiplayer was working properly, even with the unique gameplay, the price seems far too high for the tiny amount of content this game provides.  You can ""beat"" this game and see everything it has to offer in less than 30 minutes.  For the same amount of money you can find many, many other high quality games on Steam that will provide more fulfilling experiences.			",547,135,27,46,46,5,51

												Fun bag of chips type game.  Okay at parties, not much else.  Even at parties it won't be the life of the party, but it might have a couple good bites.  If you get it free or super cheap it's reasonably fun.It is absurdly overpriced though.  Also the online netcode is/was awful, leading to less people online and thus worse ping and a worse experience and ability to troubleshoot in a vicious cycle.  Do not expect online to be fun other than to laugh at the jankiness.I am not recommending this game only because of the price point.  If you can get it for a buck or two, then fine.  Otherwise spend your money on something better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4 years in development, reviews scoring it 9/10, many ""indie"" awards won...Yet this is a game that barely works, and SOME bugs were fixed literally 22 months later after its release. It's a good local-multiplayer game for breaks don't get me wrong, but it is sadly full of issues.-Terribly overpriced: very basic gameplay in 4 maps for 15 euros. Steam Workshop would have been great...-Bad netcode: do you know the feeling of waking up from bed, only to realize it was just a dream and find yourself back in bed? Yeah, same feeling. I would not recommend this game if you plan on playing online, friends included.-(Keyboard) controls: everytime I launch the game my mapped controls go back to default. Also I have yet to know which button is used to select options in the pause screen. Controls during gameplay are fine, though.-It's supposed to be a competitive game, but it is overall so shallow, monotonous... It makes you close the game AND wish it could have more content at the same time.			",366,44,32,18,32,5,30

												This is certainly one of my favourite local multiplayer games. Although it's 2 player, this actually works in its favour as it means you can have a great game with a smaller group than many local multiplayer titles, and it's so fun to watch that it works well with spectators.From a small series of moves, Nidhogg produces often hilarious fencing moments, either from daring displays of skill or comical misjudgements resulting in failure. I'd like to see more environments in this game, but it remains a great one to have in a collection to pull out when you've got guests over and there's a bit of a lull.			",108,67,0,14,20,1,35

												Very fun game but the multiplayer netcode is awful. Don't expect to play this with anyone who isn't local.edit: Part of my problem was I had some minor packet loss. After this was fixed it went from unplayable to not bad.I still don't think it is great netcode but its not as awful as I had originally seen. My friend and I could play it together but there were a lot of times where it made no sense (someone would die but the other player was too far away to kill them). Its not great with latency, so if you and your friend are not in the same country I wouldn't even bother with multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You fight, yet you do not fight. This is a dance, one of death, and of desperation. It is a series of brief, brutal, yet exceptionally precise fights, which spin out into a tug of war woven over various arenas. You roll, you kick, you throw your sword, you panic, you grab the ledge and haul yourself up, you knock your foe down, you grab your sword. You kill him.He respawns ten feet away.This pattern repeats, music constantly shifting with the feet, and on occasion terrain of the landscape upon which you fight. In castles, upon clouds, in dungeons, with lava erupting behind you. A constant barrage of visual information, yet your duellist is kept simple, a monotone duellist with a white sword, and his movements are slick, precise and razor sharp. You move, he twitches, he adjusts his sword with a tap of the key, he lunges, he riposts, he rolls, he grabs his foe and kills him in a bloody manner. He runs forward.Then he gets eaten by a worm. WINNER.This is not a game you win. This is a game you play, and you perfect. The art is the fencing, everything else is just icing on the deliciously precise cake. Dark Souls pared down to it's most barest of essentials, fighting games without their glitz, a relentless focus on two things : You. Your sword.Are you quick enough? No. Be quicker. Be better. Respawn. Try it again. Die. Respawn. Again.Welcome to Nidhogg.			",1647,571,92,264,280,18,321

												Before yoy read my review for this game, I'd like you to look at my hours, yes, 2 hours. However, I played this game in offline mode, alot, and because of steam then, it never recorded my hours, I have tried co op with a friend of mine, so I at least have perspective on this.-You may now read the review! :DNow, to be fair, I DID have fun playing this game. Sure, at first glace it just looks like a simple game; but while the controls are very simple, the actual combat is extremly complex (stabbing, hand to hand, throwing, catching, etc). To put it simply, it's generally a good game, it's fair, it's fun, and it is very challenging to keep you interested if you're into this. Overall, I'd say for this genre of fighting games, it's perfect. But you look above and see the thumbs Doooown. Two main reasons.1. If you are not really into fighting game, but you do enjoy them, then it seems perfect to get this game; don't. Honestly, the game doesn't give that much content, there are only 4 levels in the game, which is understandable, since the actual level design is marvelous, but for most people who play fighting game, they want levels where you can perform combos and such; where in Nidhogg; it's not about combos, but about speed; so really, this game ISN'T under most fighting game genres. To put it short; it's just generally not a fighting game; it's just a game of tag, with swords.2. The price; even if you are into this game, and the game alone, honestly, for 15 bucks, I could buy the binding of isaac for 5 dollars, and get about 10 times the amount of content in this, I'm not even kidding. Isaac aside; there isn't much play value if you don't have a controller (Sure, you can play without the controller, but it's extremly awkward using the keyboard at once when you are in a really tense situation); and even if you do, you'd probably get about 15 hours worth, before you and your friend gets bored entirely. While the game is VERY well made with excellent work, I'd only get this game during a sale; to me, the game is worth about 6 dollars at the most.One thing I would like to note that, this is simply my opinion, because alot of people in the review section have good points about the game, if possible, give this game a go, it didn't satify my tastes, but it certinly did for alot of other people. So who knows, maybe you'll be that badass ninja guy who can throw his sword like a boomerang, and kill 2 guys in a single swing. Who knows!			",165,38,0,17,16,2,5

			Fight! We've survived a duel to the death to bring you our review of Nidhogg. Narrated by: Josh Script by: Val and Josh Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

While many wait for the next big title, smaller indie games fill the gaps within the major AAA releases. Among these titles is Nidhogg from developer Messhof. At first glance the portrait displayed isn't anything that would take a spot in a respectable museum but take another look and the fine details may surprise you. Nidhogg's image may not be of this generation or the last few for that matter but for all it's simplicity does its transcend to the height of AAA titles?	Focused on it's combat Nidhogg offers very little in content, the single player consists of dueling several enemies within the four available stages in side-scrolling fashion. The goal is the same throughout, make it across to the opposite end whist in numerous duels of death. The respawns are unlimited but once either makes it across 3 screens the game is over and the victor is eaten by the Nidhogg, the world tree chomping worm of Norse mythology.	If there is anything that Nidhogg does extremely well is its combat, the intricate system requires quick reflexes, perfect timing and finesse. Considering the simple premise, the multitude of stances and moves offer up a good amount of depth.  Duels expanding across the pixilated canvas aren't uncommon and it's a testament to how deep the combat is. Stage hazards do play their role but in the end the better fighter will come out on top. It's any easy game to get into and one that offers up some intense moments with duels reaching ridiculous heights. 	Without a doubt the visuals of Nidhogg are not the main attraction, it's sprite based aesthetics do enough to portray the environments and figures throughout the world. Though limited the end result gives Nidhogg some visual charm and identity. Seeing the floor and walls painted with the players matter is chuckle worthy and a nice touch displaying the chaos among adversaries. 	However, the small amount of stages leaves much to desire, considering how simple the levels are it's hard to imagine why any DLC has not been introduced. Stages present little in the imagination department with minimal inspiration. In light of how much was presented in the combat one would imagine a larger emphasis in the level design to promote replayability. 	Nidhogg's multiplayer is crippled by the absence of any online lobby system that could in fact strengthen the competitive mode drastically. The limited online mutliplayer consist of single encounters unless played locally via the bracket based tournament mode. The idea behind the mode is brilliant but why it isn't available online is a major misstep in the design. 	Nidhogg is a charming experience that could of been greater if not for it's lack in content and multiplayer options. The simple to execute yet deep combat system is offset by many other flaws in design. Nidhoggs first attempt has the most important aspect of any game of this style right, it may be completely lacking in narrative but definitely a game made for competitive multiplayer. Playing with some buds is fun and Nidhogg does a great job with contact kills allowing you to embellish every neck break or impalement of a friend.  It's simple, stupid, and addicting fun.  Pick it up on a sale, the asking price might be a bit steep for the short but humorous experience.+Great Combat+Unique Identity+The Nidhogg has no Mercy-Lack of online options and lobbies-Cloud stage is weak-Lag can be an issue-Flat soundtrack6.9 ",133,10,1,4,3,0,6

												My first online match had me cackling with glee. Fast paced fencing! You can change from low, mid, high stances plus you can hold up to throw your sword in a last ditch effort. It's the most fun I've had in an arcade style game in a very long time. Don't let the simple graphics fool you, there's a very well thought out combat system here. You win a round and then try to advance screens in your direction so if you want to try to avoid combat after you win a round you can be a coward and beeline for the finish. Ok, enough typing, I have fast paced fencing to get to.			",340,81,29,16,32,3,14

												Give me a moment here, I want to make sure I don't miss any of these. Ahem:•	WINNER: Indiecade Game Design, 2013•	WINNER: IGF | GDC Nuovo Award, 2011•	WINNER: Eurogamer Expo, RPS Indie Game of the Show, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Excellence in Design, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Bloodsport of the Year: 2010•	FINALIST: IGF | GDG Excellence in Design, 2011•	FINALIST: IGF | GDC Grand Prize, 2011Those are the nominations and awards the newly released indie fighter, Nidhogg has listed on their home page. It was enough to make me pick it up without hesitation.I don't often define the quality of a video game by how many awards it's won, but when I start losing the ability to count them on my hands, apparently I do. A good thing, too. Nidhogg is all kinds of awesome.A DUEL TO THE DEATHThe concept is remarkably simple: 2 players go head-to-head in a half duel/half race to the death, both equipped with fencing swords and capable of more than a few tricks to give an edge in battle. You begin facing your opponent in the 'middle' of a map, with an opening battle. Battles are fast and furious beyond imagining, often ending within a few seconds, which ties into the gameplay mechanic wonderfully: upon killing your opponent they'll need to wait a moment to respawn, allowing you to press forward toward your 'goal'. Win a battle and you're given the 'goal light' allowing you to move forward further; lose, and your opponent gains it instead. So long as you maintain the previous kill you can pass-by your opponent without engaging and edge closer to your goal - should they fail to stop your approach.This 'tug-o-war' mechanic is the single most endearing indie game element I've felt in a while. It's relentless, and the feeling of achievement after finally managing to push an opponent back to the end, before summarily being eaten by Nidhogg, is one of much glory and admiration. Simple, sure. But so very, very rewarding. Easy to learn, too, and likely near-impossible to master.MATCH MADE IN HELLSingle-Player Mode consists of fighting steadily more challenging opponents, one after another, on one of 4 maps. So, naturally, if you want to be playing Nidhogg for more than a few hours, you're going to need to go multiplayer.Sadly, the online matchmaking within Steam isn't great. Assuming you can actually find a game, there's a good chance one of you will be lagging horribly — and when you're playing the type of game that you can't play with even the slightest amount of lag, matches can often lead to aggravating experiences. Assuming you have a few friends playing, and you're all within the same global region, this won't be a huge problem. And if you're lucky enough to have more than a few friends playing, then Tournament Mode will likely give you the greatest experience of all. I know, personally, playing live on Twitch, that this feature will make for 99% of all my time playing. WORTH A BUY?At $15~ I can only recommend a purchase here for players with friends planning to play with them - for now, at least. Which is largely a shame, as the gameplay offered in Nidhogg is truly exceptional.Possible improvements include visual upgrades to characters to simulate some form of character progression; as it stands, every game is the same and with 4 maps there's limited variety. You'll be relying on your opponents to entertain you; if they do, you're going to love Nidhogg, if not, you're likely going to get very bored, very quick.ABOUT THE AUTHORCody Hargreaves, better known as  Excessive Profanity[twitch.tv], has been writing reviews and articles in the gaming industry for 7 years, across various websites and publications.

												While by modern standards Nidhogg is minimalistic in both features and aesthetic, the joy and entertainment derived from gradually learning its frenetic, deliberate, and simple combat system is enough for me to consider this one of the best indie fighting games I've ever played. Though it is admittedly lacking in level or character selection, what's present is beautifully realized, from the abstract woodland creatures gambolling in the tall grass to the vortex of light pulsing behind cloud bridges. The soundtrack, while only comprised of four tracks, is perfectly suited to the technicolor slaughter.The game offers online play, but I would only recommend this if you're planning to joust in-person. Any amount of latency would kill the pinprick precision integral to the swordplay. Like any good fighting game, the best part is learning and adapting with each match, and there's little else sweeter than witnessing your opponent wince and hearing the spectators clamor after a meticulously-timed riposte (or a rude and random divekick, whatever works). It succeeds equally well as both a cuthroat, competitive tournament game and a night drinking's casual diversion.			",31,11,0,4,2,0,2

												Short and Sweet Version:  This game is very basic.  You try to go one way, the other guy the other way.  The controls aren't nearly as tight as I would like them (or perhaps too tight?).  And the sound track to doing this back and forth non-sense is very repetitive and uninspiring.  The sounds are about what you'd expect, but perhaps a grade below that and the gameplay, although as responsive (sometimes, sometimes not) is about what you'd expect.I would price this title at $3.  If you spend any more than that, you'll feel as cheated as I currently do.Overall - very disappointed for what I paid for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have a about an hour or two in this game, but don't let that discourage you. GAMEPLAY: Niddhog has very good gameplay, easy to learn but difficult to master at its finest. You hold your rapier in three positions, low, mid, and high. You can strike from any of these positions, and if you hit your opponent who is at the same guard as your attack, it'll be parried. Moving your blade up/down onto your opponent's guard will also disarm them. You can throw your rapier, do a jump-kick, and do a sweep while crouched. You can also roll on the ground, which has the implication of rolling under a high-guard and getting behind your opponent. Overall, the combat is good. Also, each unique stage has special areas and can be used to your advantage. Such as the cloud level where you can fall down if you don't move. GRAPHICS: The graphics, although ""pixellated"", are aesthetically pleasing. However this is where the game starts to fall. The second ""cloud"" level, is very, very bright and flashes very fast. I'm not epileptic, but I was straining to see in this level and I have no idea how an epileptic would deal with it. But otherwise they're good. COMMUNITY: Now here's where the game falls apart further. It has a good, active community. However this is useless as the netcode for the game literally doesn't work. There is no online play, so you can only play locally/LAN. A game that'd otherwise have a very long life is made a gimmick because of this. There are no multiplayer tournaments, matches with friends, or community events. In this sense, the game's simplicity kills itself as it doesn't last when playing alone. The game is good, but I can't recommend it. Due to the non-existant support post-launch, the broken netcode, and lack of news about the game gives it a bleak future. 5/10, good game but it's average.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short, a game of tug-o-war with a variation. A neat side scroll-er with a simple game play idea and graphic. Nidhogg with wonderful controller support is a game that mirrors fencing and you must defeat your opponent and advance to the next stage. When you defeat an opponent, you only have so much time to run to the next stage before he reincarnates. The controllers are simple which include hitting an opponents body or head... and if you catch their swords on an up sweep you can disarm them. You also have the ability to throw your sword. It's a neat game, it's fun for what it is, but the fun doesn't last extremely long. Only reason I got it was it was listed as local co-op. I'll recommend it but with caution.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												This game is very well-made. I say this because it requires skill to play, is fast-paced, has wonderful backgrounds, and simply has an interesting and fun concept behind it. It's also very satisfying to fake out your opponent with a tricky sword maneuver and jam a rapier through his head. Additionally, the soundtrack is phenomenal! However, the replayability of the game is limited, as there are only four maps and the online multiplayer is a bit rough around the edges (it's much better and more responsive while playing local multiplayer or singleplayer), and once you beat the singleplayer campaign you need friends who enjoy playing it as much as you do. Overall, I would highly recommend this game, as it is entertaining, satisfying, and while it is easy to learn, it is difficult to master (but very rewarding when you get it down pat). I actually have more hours on record than Steam reports I do, because I've played it on a different computer and the transfer of playtime between computers was not very good; I have about 10 hours more than the amount shown above invested in this game, and I still play it and recommend it heartily. Well worth the money, and well worth the time you'll spend playing it.			",112,9,1,9,9,1,5

												Right now, not worth the price, at all.  The game isn't even true 16x9 widescreen, game has unexplainable lagspikes on my brand new 700 series GPU Gaming Laptop.  And the combat itself feels more frantic and ""beat to the punch"" based than actual super fast paced methodical skill-based combat.  Has good ideas, and my opinions can change on the complexity and eventual mastery, but right now it's just ""feels"" too frenetic to be any real skill-based 3rd Strike (if you will) type gameplay.  So it's a good pick up and play game.  Soundtrack wise, it leaves a lot to be desired.  nothing really to say there, nothing is really good at all...Visually, it's a minimalist type paintery style, sort of, but I don't particularly think it excentuates the raw gameplay as much as another artstyle could.  But heh, it's unique, and it looks alright.  Multiplayer should be fun at least.  Anyway, just my first impressions.  But definitely not worth a $15 pricetag imo, much better games at cheaper or exactly that price.  And Volgarr The Viking remains the undisputed king of recent Indie games recently with Race The Sun at #2 imo.  So anyway, yeah, 7/10 if you want a score.			",906,209,20,81,42,4,69

Posted: September 25, 2014
												I really WANTED to like this game. I'd heard such great things about it, and it seemed like it should be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it was just let down.First, the gameplay. Nidhogg has simple but slightly awkward controls that certainly can be mastered but aren't particularly fluid on their own. If you're expecting fighting-game style precision, you're going to be disappointed. Once you get past the tutorial, the movement options feel fuzzy and unreliable. The basic combat is... okay. Most actions happen so quickly that it's humanly impossible to react to them, so it's mostly about anticipation and taking risks, and be prepared for a number of frustrating deaths where it doesn't even look like you were touched by the opponent's sword.I realize that everything I just wrote is directly contrary to what most other critics are saying about the game, but I can only call it like I see it. I've played plenty of other games in this niche, and they all felt better than Nidhogg.The one place where the game is fun is local co-op, which is the entire point of the game I suppose, but it's fun for the ""wrong"" reasons. Playing with a group of friends makes all of the ""screw you, that was stupid"" moments fun, because you  all get to taunt each other the whole time. So basically, the game is fun with friends precisely *because* of the stupid and lopsided moments that in any other situation would just be frustrating.Claims that the game's graphics are ""beautiful"" are overstated. There are one or two impressive setpieces that will probably catch your eye, but the game as a whole isn't particularly nice-looking. The style is unique and expressive, but it's not objectively pleasing by any measure. Also, the game really needs a colorblind setting, because my character is practically invisible to me against the backdrop of the second stage.My final complaint, which others have echoed, is that there's not nearly enough content to justify the $15 price tag. I normally don't mind paying a little extra for a good game, but this is definitely more of a $5 title. If it's on sale for that much and you're looking for a new game to play at parties, maybe this is for you, but otherwise you're not missing much by passing it up.			",221,43,1,27,21,2,34

												First things first:This is a party-game, meaning it´s supposed to be played with many people on a couch, screaming, laughing. Think Smash Bros, Towerfall, Samurai Gunn, etc. Don´t fret though because the game does have online multiplayer.The simple goal of Nidhogg is to get into the endzone, that´s it. Too bad your opponent has the exact same goal.What ensues is a glorious tug of war, because who ever got the last kill is the only one who can proceed. And killing there will be lots of, because besides being a race for the goal, Nidhogg also excells at being a Prince of Persia-style fencing game. Although appearing rather simple, the fighting system is pretty deep and complex with parries, blocks, feints, jumps, rolls, wallmoves, different attack stances, you can even throw your blade at your opponent. All of this lightning-fast action is presented in a very stylized fashion, reminescent of the good old days of the Commodore 64 and it fits the game perfectly. Animations are fluent (and very gory in a cartoony way), backgrounds are very retro and sometimes deliberately convoluted or hard to see your character in. Though featuring only 4 Stages on the date of this review, it´s more than enough to get going and further deepens the Retro-Arcady-Feel of this game (yes, leaving things out can actually give a product more character rather than taking it away)Sound and music are nothing to write home about but they get the job done with little screams and clangs here and there.Nidhogg is a game it would definetely reccomend if you grew up with titles like Barbarian, International Karate (Karateka) or even the wonderful Moonstone (which NEEDS a remake). It´s fast, deep, satisfying, a definite skill- AND mindgame when it comes to the fencing. People looking for a lot of content and fancy graphics will surely be turned off by this game but tournament-fighters and retro-fans should try it.One final word about the pricing, I can understand that 11 bucks (or how much that may be in $) is a steep price but devs gotta live too and I´m sure it will be in a sale sooner or later. So consider helping the guys (the guy?) from Messhoff out by getting it right now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game if the devs would ever fix the netcode. Whoever is hosting the match gets priority. Good luck being able to jump at all if you're not the host. It seems they've abandoned updating altogether. As a single player game, it's fun but it gets redundant fast. This game would only be worth it if you can do local multiplayer. At least this game has that.			",257,40,2,11,11,0,5

												 I just had a five minute one-on-one duel with a random person.  It can be ♥♥♥♥in’ INTENSE.  You can die and respawn as many times as you like.  The goal is to get to the end of the level in whatever direction you have to go, right for me, left for him.  Stab, jump, kick, punch your way through him.  Even if the game ends up with him almost winning, you can push your way back to your end of the level just because it becomes so nerve racking for the other person that a chance for you to push back opens up and you make a mad dash for the right side of the screen.  The battle wages on room through room, back and forth.  Orange and Yellow blood bathes the floor while sword upon sword exchange hands as they are thrown through the air.  A lucky stab in the face brings your opponent’s hands to your sword as you stand still for but a moment, the character grasping at the sword.  You thrust forward and the color orange floods the floor below.  You run forward.  He spawns in the doorway ahead of you.  You can’t throw your sword.  You have to charge him.  You see that he has put his sword just too high.  You charge.  You duck and roll all the way through the doorway and stand and stab him in the back.  You keep running.  He spawns again, this time getting a lucky sword throw to your face.  Lives are traded.  you finally make it to the next room.  You are beating him.  This is your territory.  The ground is clean of blood and swords.  you charge.  he spawns just before a pit and makes a nervous jump, falling to his doom.  You laugh!  You wait for him to respawn as he recollects himself.  You both realize that that pitfall was a mistake.  An honorable man lets your opponent have a fair fight.   You beat him.  As he dissolves in to orange goo behind you, you run for the final screen.  You make it.The screen flares up in brilliant red as the sky catches fire.  The music picks up.  Everything is waiting for you to make the first move.  You charge.  he spawns.  He knows you could win if you get past him.  You make a jump.  You dive kick in to him.  His sword goes left, his body crumples.  You charge to the right.  he runs to the left, hoping to respawn before you can make it across to the end of the map.  He respawns.He knows your tricks.  he knows you will jump above him as he spawns, sending your foot in to his face.  He is ready.  You know he knows your plans.  You prepare for the inevitable.  There is no time to change plans.  You must act.  You jump.He jumps.One of you will press the kick button at the right time.  If you press it at the wrong time, he will kick you to the ground and rip your proud head off your yellow neck.  You kick.  Your feet meet his feet.  He falls.  You charge.The croud is doing the wave in your favor.  You have done it.  You bow to your opponent.  Your hands are sweating.  You crawl to the finish line, barely able to stand.A giant worm flies towards you.  You are eaten whole.WINNER.			",171,22,5,11,15,1,14

												I will recommend this game for the near perfection of a duel.  It offers strategy, depth, and no overly complex rules.  It's very well put together and can make some amazing situations.As always there are things to watch out for:Technical issues-  These are not too terrible, but be preprared in every 3rd or 4th game to lose or win a fight due to a network hiccup.  As always I assume they'll be fixed as I played this near release.No idea the future:There's no communication on what the future for this game is now. There's a great game here, but all games have room to grow. I have no idea if any improvements are incoming.Complaints I would not worry about from other people.Only 4 maps.  Consider it like a fighting game.  They may have 12 maps, but it's really a background swap.  Here each 4 maps represents a completely different battlefield.  If people clamour that much for more maps they could easily doa pallet swap and call it a day.			",279,39,7,26,29,5,66

												This game is fantastic. Super simple, but has a lot of strategic depth. Matches are a quick tug-of-war game of fencing, but can turn into epic bouts with mindful opponents. If you like PVP at all, and are looking for a game that can be a ton of fun without a big time commitment, you can't go wrong with this. Online play is fun but it's best doing Local Co Op with a friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have some local friends to play with, this game is excellent. The combat is surprisingly deep and even after a few days I still find it really fun to play in a local setting. Spectating people chanting and cheering when someone is disarmed and slain is one of the things that just can't be coded in to the game. Eight player tournaments are also spectacular, but this is an even less likely scenario for most prospective buyers. There is a single player game that is adequate for times where you'd like to play but have no one to play with for the moment, but this mode is not nearly as interesting as battling with other humans.Yes, there is an option to play online. However, online multiplayer still has a lot of issues that seem to vary between being ""fine"" and ""massive desync; abort everything"". It's a shame, but I can't recommend this game that doesn't treat this game as a local multiplayer game the time being. There may be a day where that's untrue, maybe even soon, where it'll be absolutely fine online. Until then, consider this game only if you have at least one other person to play with. If you are willing to slog through some horrible connection problems with some people, there may be some fun matches to have, but the cost-benefit of that could potentially be very low.In short: great game for local multiplayer. Very interesting and fun mechanics. Promising online multiplayer that is currently very unreliable.			",393,100,2,42,33,3,48

												Nidhogg is about competitive dueling. I first played EggNogg that was way more hilarious with the swords bouncing around, so I entered Nidhogg disappointed as it was more 'bland' and the different parts of each level are too short to allow longer play and more frequent comebacks. EggNogg had one single level with more variety inside, while Nidhogg has less variety inside a single level but more variety overall with the different levels and their unique twists (grass field to hide in the Wilds, narrow corridors and moving floor in the Mines, concealing clouds and bright colors in the Clouds, and a few pits plus a big central area in the Castle). I will give something important to Nidhogg over EggNogg though: the controls are more reactive and the game is more balanced. It feels good to play, and it leaves a lot of room for improving skill and reading the moves of the opponent. (Edit: However EggNogg+ now has reactive controls that even includes wall-jumps!)So what else does Nidhogg have? AI players for a single player mode, these opponents are actually quite good and each AI seems to have its own way to fight and unpredictable movements. Good point here. There are nice local multiplayer additions such as an 8 player tournament mode, and the possibility to change the game rules for local 1 on 1.Last but not least, there is an online multiplayer mode. Having friends to play with seems like the only reasonable way, as the matchmaking is literally empty and on the rare occasions that there is someone else playing, expect painful lag as they are likely at the other side of the world.So then, here comes the big question. Why am I not recommending this game? I enjoy playing it, I want it to have more success but.... It took so many years and does not seem polished enough. It is not possible to change the color of the players, my logitech controllers are not recognized by the game, the different areas in each level are too short to allow for more tense play (the central area in the castle is the best place for comebacks and tension building up), the online part of the game has the merit to exist but didn't get enough love, there are no arrows at the start of the game to show who is who, and, for all of that, I find that the game is too expensive for what it is. And apparently I'm not the only one thinking that way, seeing all the comments in the forum and the fact that the online multiplayer is quite empty.I can only recommend this game on sale or if you know you will often have friends over to enjoy the duels. I realize that I am too severe because I probably expected too much and the free game EggNogg biased my judgment a lot, but Nidhogg was around for a long time and the result still lacks polish. Although I guess that it is expensive to compensate for the small niche market. But a fundamental issue for me is the lack of players online, and the insane lag on the rare moments that a player is found (it can even happen often to see the same scene rewind with each time a different player dying, wtf?).

												Entertaining, but the game desperately needs additional features and some bug fixing before I could ever recommend it, or play for more than the odd rare match.  Online multiplayer is incredibly laggy, there is no option for local lan play which I see as a huge omission, there is no way of directly choosing to play with a friend so you can't arrange to play people, and the menus need better mouse support or a different UI entirely.But, the gameplay is there, and that's the biggest hurdle.  The aesthetic is solid, the gamemodes are varied and interesting, it's got most of what it needs to be a good multiplayer game between friends.  It could be lots of fun, if they could make it so you could actually play with those friends without dealing with 20 rounds of matchmaking roulette to get paired and a ruberbanding stuttery mess when you finally play.  It's just pretty hard to actually enjoy the game.  I hope for future updates, but I'm not holding my breath.			",512,150,5,89,66,4,79

												Don't get me wrong, this game *is* fun. However, at full price, in my opinion, it isn't worth it: You need to play multiplayer to have any real enjoymentThe barebones graphics are bland rather than charming, the levels repeat (3 levels)There is an easy exploit (run, roll, strike).If this game *was* $1, it is okay... but I have payed for and played **MUCH** better games at the same price.The positive aspects of this game: The controls (on XBox controller) are *great*!It's great fun to play with a friend (but gets boring quickly)Very cool idea... it just needs more to it. This feels like the base of a greater game. If this game is on sale, and you want a good local multiplayer game to stab your friends with... go for it.However, on it's own, I do not recommend this game.			",344,103,10,51,49,2,56

												Only get this game when it's on sale (-75%)! It's a fun multiplayer game. You can confidently play it during a house party and you'll see that it'll be a hit (though I only did it once since the game ""Broforce"" is much more entertaining at house parties)! Also note that the achievements are very easy to get (except one, which is super hard, bordering on impossible).

												I.... personally don't think this game is worth the full price. If you can find it cheaper, like less than $5, then it is totally worth it! You may get a good couple hours out of it. This game is definitely fun with others and I got plenty of laughs out of it with friends. There just isn't a whole lot to it. There are 4 maps and only one really good game mode. Still I would reccommend it!			",73,19,1,9,2,1,12

												Really fun game to play with your friend. Jump on Skype and just go at it for tons of fun. Single player is meh so unless you have someone to play with dont really bother with this game. There really isnt much of an online function besides being invited or inviting someone to play with you. So you cant really compare you skills with someone random. All in all though I have had a pretty good time playing.			",160,25,0,22,23,2,20

												Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends. However, if you like to play with your friends, then this game is for you, but if you do not like the local multiplayer, I still recommend that the game is not very long, this needs improvement.In Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row. After you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, the first one being the easiest and the last one. I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.As I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates. The art style is what I love the most about this game, the player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone. On the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches.

												Now, this is a must buy! Nidhogg is a 2D fencing game, all about raising up the ranks to get sacrificeid by the Nidhogg, a pink space worm. Now, this game is great. Great single player, and has good amount of moves to plan ahead. Very solid AI to keep the game intresting. Maps are fun and all set up a good diffrent form on each one. Now some downsides, the multiplayer is really bad, with connection problems a lot. It registers as you stabbing a guy, yet he is running away 2 secs later, and also, we need a couple more maps. But this game is fun and addicting, and I recomend it.7/10. Is rlly good			",179,30,0,18,11,3,22

It's mainly the price that's the big problem. If it costed maybe about $5, then the cons could be neutralized by the low price, with the exception of the Controls con.

Yet, I do not feel as if this warrants a $15 price point as it feels quite unfinished. Rushed? Perhaps, but it feels like a wasted opportunity.But what's there is ****IN HYPE AS SH**, which is a damn shame.So I will go with Yes because it's still an amazing local experience regardless.

												Let's start this review slightly differently. This is an amazing game and you should be ashamed you're not playing it right now. I think many of you will agree that there are very few genres that can compete with fighting games when it comes to a local multiplayer experience. While RPGs, FPSs and RTSs are usually played alone with headphones on, it's the fighting games that not brings the whole circle of friends together. And the neighbours as well, since they're jarateed off that you are still shouting for several hours straight. Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Skullgirls - these games are the first ones that come to mind whenever you think about playing together on the same couch with your buddies. Hell, even on the Wii, that's notorious for being the best console to play with your buddies in the same room, the best selling game that's not Sports or Mario is... Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A fighting game. The sheer competitiveness of fighting one-to-one or two versus two is already thrilling and excitement-filling, but the possible moves, combinations and strategies can leave an incredible impression to anyone. And Nidhogg, well, is a fighting game. Kind of.Truth to be told, it's a fighting game in the purest form. No different characters. No varied movesets. Perfect. Symmetry. Both players get to play as a diffent-colored fighter. Part stickman, part pixel-man(?), he wields a sword of sorts. It's probably a rapier. I mean, you stab the other part stickman, part pixel-man with it. The stages are perfectly symmetrical as well, meaning that the only advantage you can get is the one you build yourself.The gameplay isn't traditional in fighting game sense: two players try to stab/divekick/rip-spine-off one another. Such actions result in an instant-kill. Although this is not quite near the Divekick level, where one touch means someone is dead already, the fights rarely last more than a few seconds. Once the morbid deed has been done and your opponent is bleeding all over the place, a huge GO! arrow appears in the direction where your opponent should be. If he was alive, that is. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves slightly and now your opponent has respawned, standing a few meters away from you, weapon ready. Kill him, see the arrow, run towards the arrow, move screen even more. In a way, this might remind you of those classic beat-'em-ups, where you have to punch down all the guys in the screen, see the GO! arrow appear and then move the screen slightly, getting yourself an inch closer to victory. The process in Nidhogg is pretty similar, except that in the way of killing>running towards arrow>killing, you will most likely be pierced like a kebab and left pouring blood all over the carpet. If such an accident happens, and it will, a GO! arrow will still appear. This time, for your opponent. If you fail enough times and get killed more, the screen will move to the final stage. Dying here will usually mean that your opponent wins. As he runs towards victory, you block his initial lunge, jump to the air and land on his head. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ manages to roll back and pick up his rapier. However, this time, he is on the defensive, while you are free to run towards him, roll just under his blade and swipe his feet, knocking your foe down. It all culminates with a glorified spine-rip, with extra crunchy sound effects as a bonus. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves and you feel a little bit more relieved, knowing that you managed to push away your fate slightly farther away.Such is the beatiful fencing of Nidhogg, where you use the responsive and fluid control to out-skill and out-wit your opponent. Fights last mere seconds, but they are just as exciting as a whole round of Street Fighter. You'll never feel cheated if you die, since you were not out-gunned. I mean, who the hell picks Chun Li while playing with your friends, anyway!? Erm, sorry. The whole game can be controlled by 6 buttons - 4 for movement and 2 for attacking. It's incredibly simple and easy to pick up, but just like the aforementioned Divekick, this game is immensely complex. With a few button combinations, you can jump, divekick, roll, cartwheel (!), taunt, throw you goshdarned rapier into the unsuspecting victim's face and more.Not only the fencing is beautiful, however. The arenas you fight in are as well. There is some variety and creativity here and there, but not too much to distract you from the true goal. To appeal to the mighty Nidhogg. Oh, forgot to mention him! Reader, meet Nidhogg, the giant pink nordic dragon-snake-thingy that eats you once you win. All jokes aside, this game is filled with incredible design decisions, even if some of them are accidental. Even the mere fact that the whole point of the game is to get EATEN with a loud *CRUNCH* sound following makes this game perfect for parties. Sure, your opponent won after that hard match and he might have been using his cheap running technique, but he got eaten. The silly Nidhogg's eyes are enough to soften up even the sorest losers. And the awesome design doesn't stop there. The sound effects are great to cheer people up as well. Alongside the general rapier sounds, you also get a whole bunch of *slash*, *slush* and *GWEAAAARRRRGHHHhhhh...* as well. After your opponent misjudges his distance and divekicks right in front of your rapier, impaling himself, it's hard for both to contain laughter after the poor sod releases a complimentary *Erghhwgghhht...* This game also has flaws, as hard it might be to confess. Single-player is pretty much a glorified training mode (aren't most fighting games like that?) with an easily exploitable AI and online-multiplayers suffers from latency issues. However, playing anything but local multiplayer on this game is just a crime against it. Still, the number of stages is underwhelming and Steam Workshop support could help it. Another minor complaint would be that you can't pick your own color during offline multiplayer, only tournament mode.Nidhogg can create new friendships. Nidhogg can strenghthen existing ones. And most likely Nidhogg will. Dueling with a buddy, be it you two are playing for the first time or this is your fifth hundredth match, is just simply a blast, filled with laughter, joy, shouts and pixelated blood. But it's even more fun to play with even more friends. Up to 8 player tournament mode is incredible (and the winner gets something more awesome than being eaten by a worm) and while two are locked in an intense duel, the others can shoutcast, cheer or pick favorites. It's an incredible party game. Tim is strategic, trying to roll under your feet and disarm you. Mike is wrong in the head and he thinks that throwing your only weapon in vain hopes to kill is the best way to win. He's probably right. Johnny? He's an♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to run around the opposition, instead of fighting head-on. Steve is good at dive-kicking. He'll dive-kick when he has the upper hand and when he doesn't. He'll dive-kick anytime. Oh, there's also me, the sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, who rolls around the floor using the same move he calls ""Cartwheel assassin"" trying to sneakily stab you once you're distracted.All of these strategies work. All of them are viable. All of them can win games and they HAVE won games.There are no tier-lists in Nidhogg. There are no combo sheets either. Just pure fun. If you, dear reader, think that this isn't a fighting game, you're probably right as well. But all I care is that Nidhogg is the best local multiplayer game you could ever play.

												9/10Nidhogg is an amazing game, wether the pricetag turns you off or not. This game perfectly revives old arcade style fights with your friends. This game is one of the most intense you will play in a long time. Locally, this game is a wonder and something that everyone will have a blast with. The graphics are simplistic enough that they do not distract from the gameplay, which the game revolves around in the first place. The controls are quick and easy to hop into. Within the first five minutes of the game, you will learn every move the game has to offer, from divekicks to somersaults. The concept of Nidhogg sometimes makes it feel like a boardgame; having a strict set of rules and goals but hundreds of different ways to achieve them. Although the meat of the game purely revolves around playing with other people, the AI is actually very fun to play against in the singleplayer. Obviously, they goof sometimes, but they will often be fun to play with and be a slight challenge at least. This game is great with friends and even the matchmaking is pretty swell. What takes away from this game is purely how laggy the multiplayer can be in some cases. Few matchmaking games will be laggy, but private games that you are invited to can be atrocious. If you have the money, I highly recommend Nidhogg, especially if you have people to enjoy it with.			",153,23,0,20,12,0,18

												Took me about 48 minutes to beat the singleplayer, and then I played some of the multiplayer. There aren't many people online (4 were matchmaking at the time) but I still found a match relativley quickly. The tutorial is broken at the momment, but just looking at the control configuration gives you an idea of things.The game is pretty straight forward, you kill the enemy player and advanced towards your goal before they respawn infront of you. Once you get to the end you sacrafice yourself to a giant worm to entertain a crowd and win. It's a tug of war game with swords and it's rather fun doing crazy moves like disarming your opponents or kicking them off cliffs.I heard the multiplayer was really laggy for some people, but it seems playable if you're playing with somebody on the same continent. I expereinced a bit of delay in my moves but did alright against a random player.If you're hurting for cash, I probably wouldn't recommend spending more than 10 dollars on this game unless you are planning on playing it with a friend, I'm assuming that's where most of the fun comes from.If this game every goes for sale at a cheap price, I'd defintiley recommend it. It's very entertaining.			",177,22,2,24,14,3,20

Based on the amount of fun I've had so far, it is without question worth picking up to play with your friends.

												It would be a fun game with a pretty deep fighting mechanic. The fencing is fun and we don't see a whole lot of those. And it's pretty nice and whacky in local. Too bad the online aspect is so hideously broken. This game uses P2P netcode that was made from whatever backwater developer had leftover. I understand it's not going to be on the level of GGPO, I get that. There's going to be imperfect lag. But this is position-switching lag on a grand scale. This is the computer animating your death, then your opponents death, then you falling on a cliff, all in around 15 seconds. This is unforgivable. Don't play this The music is redeeming, but that's about it. The developers should have fixed this a long time ago. I dread whatever new abomination they create.			",66,2,0,1,2,0,3

												With 25 hours into this game, I find it difficult to recommend in its current state.  The single player experience is barebones and really just a training ground for the Multiplayer experience.If you are playing this locally with a buddy, then GET THIS GAME.  Controls are tight as Sh*t, matches are fun, and enough settings to tweak to keep things lively.   If you are playing this online, DO NOT get this game.  Nidhogg has issues finding you anyone to play, and if you are lucky enough to get paired with someone after a 10 minute wait, theres a 50-50 chance the connection will be too laggy to play.Its sad that a game geared for multiplayer implemented such a poor online experience, killing its customer base.

												This game is ill and represents the poverty gaming label quite strongly. Should be a standard for all poverty and poverty-related (mystery game) tournaments.1) Gameplay is strong and simple. Easy to play, difficult to master. The fact it was brought out to major tournaments has developed a small cult following as a result.2) Art style is simple and effective. Concentrating on the meat of the game, which is gameplay.3) It brings the hype. Plain and simple.It brings some of the best mechanics from fighting games. Simplicty in mechanics. Parrying, low sweeps, divekicking, roll dodging, throwing. All optional to use, but when used effectively will lead to victory. Rewarding good reactions and good reads. Of course, one could totally avoid fights all together to victory as well. This leaves many options open towards fighting.I would bring this to local tournaments. Nuff said.			",268,37,8,33,14,1,39

												Nidhogg features the kind of gruesome online multiplayer where, after braving about ten minutes of crashes and other malfunctions just to even connect, you are greeted with a game that's only functional for the host player, while his opponent experiences extremely laggy movement and can't even use basic gameplay features like the sword throw or clinging to walls.A scam, with this netcode.Potentially jolly only if you have available local opponents.P.S.: It doesn't get better when in interviews, the developer of this spouts things about his game's netcode like I spent a lot of time working on a system that attempts to be as fast and fair to both players as GGPO, when the reality is it's entirely host-dominated.

												Nidhogg is a PvP Platformer where 2 players are pitted against each other in a side-scrolling map. Players are only equipped with a sword. However you may perform various moves, such as lunging, diving and rolling. The aim of the game is to run to your side of the map. However, you may only do so if your marker is active. You receive the marker when you slay your opponent. The player that wins gets to sacfrifice themselves to the Nidhogg!The game offers excellent gameplay. Although there are only four maps, it is still quite addictive. Gather some friends, and enjoy every second of it... that is, if you have friends that are willing to play this. Otherwise, don't bother getting this game; the online matchmaking system does not work! Due to this, the $15 price tag is just not worth it. There is singleplayer, however it is only a race against bots, moving through each map sequencially with bots that increase in difficulty as you go along. The aim is to see how fast you can win against 16 bots. Hence, singleplayer is rather repetative and only good if you are new to the game.In terms of game development techniques (i.e. graphics, media and physics), the developers have done a great job! Everything suits the theme of the game, the music is very motivating, and the graphics are substantial. The physics are also quite precise, with minimum glitches.Overall, a fine effort. It is a shame though, that the matchmaking system doesn't work. This game has so much potential, and could be made into something extraordinary! I would love to rate this higher, but the price tag and high amount of potential just brings it down. One thing is for sure though... this is certainly unforgettable. ~ Rating: 7.5/10			",35,1,0,1,3,0,2

												This game was a hit at my LAN party, if you have an opportunity for local same-screen competitive gaming this is a must play! We threw the game up on a wall via a projector and everyone had to try. It was also fun to watch being played as well - everyone cheering, gasping, or groaning to the on-screen action. Very responsive controls, easy to pick up and enough nuance to master.			",147,11,1,13,8,1,23

												My girlfriend practices fencing so I got this for us to play as a joke. What I failed to realize was how much fun it would be and how much I'd be laughing during our bouts. It's got that same quick gameplay and strategic timing of old school vs arcade games like Joust. The graphics even herald of the golden days of pixel based gaming. It is just you vs the computer or another player and you have to advance all the way to the enemies side of the battlefield across several screens. Your only weapon is a fencing foil that you can hold high, level or low and depending on the positioning you will have an advantage when swining at the enemy, a disadvantage, or a cancel/parry. Throw in a jump, a roll, a throw, and the ability to punch/kick when disarmed and you have a simple move set that is difficult to level against your enemy if they are every bit as conniving as you. It's a great game to play with friends, and though it doesn't have lasting appeal, it's always fun to throw in for a quick match as a palette cleanser betwee other multiplayer games. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it.			",299,92,3,22,7,3,15

Nidhogg is appealing in so many ways.In fact, it's a game full of so many good design choices, that it's a shame it is often overlooked. Gameplay is easy to grasp, but leaves the player with a lot of room to fine-tune how they approach combat. It's a tug-of-war that rewards strategy, and which lends itself to some really satisfying wins. Coupled with colourful, stylized pixel-art - and a soundtrack that's unconventional, but incredibly catchy - I have a hard time complaining about any of Nidhogg's design elements.However, it suffers from the same problem that a game like Gang Beasts does (in its current state): for a game that is so clearly meant to be played with friends or a community, multiplayer is just far too inaccessible. Matchmaking in Nidhogg is painfully vacant. But where a game like Gang Beasts is making strides towards things like community building and online play, Nidhogg has already moved passed them.So, while I recommend Nidhogg to anyone looking for something easy to pick up, challenging, visually striking, and relatively cheap; they'd better be prepared to play it alone.

												Best enjoyed in local versus mode despite its lack of a ""shared/splitscreen"" official Steam tag. Nidhogg is a simple concept; You kill your opponent you get to move forward progressing level screens, he kills you, he gets to move forward. First one to reach the end screen their designated direction wins. This makes for a great tug of war, insane comebacks, and thrilling grudge matches. They tried to give the combat some nuance with the ability to hold your fencing sword at three heights (plus throw) but like any basic player vs player combat it comes down to timing more than anything. All the technique in the world isn't gonna stop somebody from timing the perfect roll or jump to run right past you. And that's where the game gets interesting. Besides the beginning stalemate for the first kill, combat only hangs on the ""defender"". Once you get your kill and control the ability to press forward, that's what your focus is on. Many times its better to just get past your opponent and continue your run rather than engage. It really levels the playing field and makes it fairly easy for anybody to pick up and enjoy. Then you toss in four levels with decent variety and things stay interesting enough for a competitive sitdown.With the advent of in-home streaming, HTPC's, etc. Nidhogg finds a comfortable home in the living room to get the competitive juices flowing with friends and family on the ""bigscreen"". I'm a fan of local shared/split-screen games on the PC that are done well. And while utterly basic and simple (and thus probably overpriced) this delivers pure fun. Wait for a sale, but if you like making temporary enemies with friends on the couch, this is good stuff. Recommended.			",349,99,30,51,32,9,68

												It's like a low-fi, super simplifird smash brothers with some interesting independent elements that are born of the swordfighting theme. There's a lot that can be said about a simple engine that produces complex situations and gives such a wide flexibility to gameplay. It's one of those games that when you win or lose you never feel cheated and it's fun to end a match on either side of the divide.I would say however that the price seems a little insane for the small amount of content, however if that's the price you pay for such a fittingly simple and robust online facility and touch perfect controls then I can understand even if I don't agree. The game really needs some free updates to it, perhaps even workshop level-editing. This really does feel like a proof of concept, albeit a really, really good one.			",166,55,2,12,19,4,26

												Nidhogg is a fast pace fencing game with tug-of-war elements. However in this tug of war you don't just have to fight and kill the oposition. You can evade his blade to by pass the opponent compleatly, but watch out as one quick thrust or thrown sword can cause your body to erupt in colorful blood all over the stage. As you become a better nidhogg-er you can pull off some sick plays by reading your opponent's habits and punish them. The cost of the game may be high for an indie title but having a good friend either next to you or in a call is the best experience I have had in a long time. (laughed for 10+ min strait at one point) I highly recommend the game and just to note this game does have a single player mode and online mode but only has 4 stages. (castle, mine, cloud, and wild) In online mode you can do matchmaking and private matches. With okay net code you can decided on what type of experience you want from the game. Have fun and happy frog jumping (inside joke not a reccomended fighting style)			",35,7,0,1,3,0,5

												My naked yellow man started with a sword and so did the blue man. After we were both disarmed, my opponent began to tun through the forest. I jump-kicked him in the back and broke his neck. Afterwards I ran past a cheering crowd and sacrificed myself to a huge worm-monster-god.Great multiplayer content.10/10 would murder again			",82,26,0,8,8,0,6

												It's like a low-fi, super simplifird smash brothers with some interesting independent elements that are born of the swordfighting theme. There's a lot that can be said about a simple engine that produces complex situations and gives such a wide flexibility to gameplay. It's one of those games that when you win or lose you never feel cheated and it's fun to end a match on either side of the divide.I would say however that the price seems a little insane for the small amount of content, however if that's the price you pay for such a fittingly simple and robust online facility and touch perfect controls then I can understand even if I don't agree. The game really needs some free updates to it, perhaps even workshop level-editing. This really does feel like a proof of concept, albeit a really, really good one.			",166,55,2,12,19,4,26

												Very fun game. Not worth $14.99, especially when the multiplayer service doesn't work. But for $1.49 it's definitetly worth playing by yourself until the Dev team can fix this. Nidhogg is even better when played with Fencing Music!  Here are 2 YouTube playlists for fencing music:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi2-TRz5ikTQN84h2TM1VdXriGm7etBuBhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFC7hUB_K5-v1W7Q-qV8lGTndOVuOlviB ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nidhogg is a fast pace fencing game with tug-of-war elements. However in this tug of war you don't just have to fight and kill the oposition. You can evade his blade to by pass the opponent compleatly, but watch out as one quick thrust or thrown sword can cause your body to erupt in colorful blood all over the stage. As you become a better nidhogg-er you can pull off some sick plays by reading your opponent's habits and punish them. The cost of the game may be high for an indie title but having a good friend either next to you or in a call is the best experience I have had in a long time. (laughed for 10+ min strait at one point) I highly recommend the game and just to note this game does have a single player mode and online mode but only has 4 stages. (castle, mine, cloud, and wild) In online mode you can do matchmaking and private matches. With okay net code you can decided on what type of experience you want from the game. Have fun and happy frog jumping (inside joke not a reccomended fighting style)			",35,7,0,1,3,0,5

												I get nostalgic feelings of Karateka (1984) as I go from screen to screen in quickly decided encounters that involve deft dodges and counterattacks.  The change from karate to fencing and the introduction of a second human as my opponent serves to create bursts of raucous comedy interspersed between moments of focused tension.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So this game, is very miniscule and that's not a bad thing.  It knows exactly how much you need to put into the game to make it fun and to make you and your friends hate each other.  This game gets so damn intense.  I'd have to say one of my favorite go to's whenever i wanna lay the smack down onto my buddies self esteem.  I don't often see fencing games, nor do I see this type of hit and run games.  It's interesting and weird and artsy for how little bulk there is to the game.			",429,50,8,21,32,1,26

												Think Fast!Whether you want to settle a debate like a gentleman or just swing swords until something happens; Nidhogg is the game for you. Two people are dropped into a world armed only with a sword and the objective is simple; get the most recent kill and run to your opponents side without dying for a surprise.With simple gameplay controls, retro pixel artwork and beautiful music, you can fight your way; want to parry your opponent? Sure! Use a door to protect yourself like a baby? Go ahead! Throw your only weapon and go with only your fists? Why not?!Just remember to watch that step, you don't want to look like a fool do you?

												It's a great game as it is, but here are some suggestions that would make the game even better:- New levels (with more music, maybe haha);- Customization options (player colors, for example);- Steam Workshop integration;- A level editor;- A matchmaking system for playing with random people, instead of only against friends.These are things that would make the game more diverse, and thus it would be more enjoyable for people to play it for more time. I recommend it, but it seems like it will get boring as time goes by, specially when you want to play it, but you don't have many friends to play with.			",60,7,0,1,3,0,0

												This is a game for parties. I first was introduced to it at IndieCade, where it was projected on a large screen with two people duking it out via arcade sticks surrounded by a cheering crowd, and that is where this game thrives. You can play it by yourself, but that's not the point. You can also play it via online multiplayer, which is better, but it still thrives only when there's an audience, or at least when you can yell at the person you're fighting against. The game is brutal, fast paced, quick to pick up, and insanely fun. Just know that you'll need other people to play with (I mean, it comes with a built-in tournament mode).			",280,99,2,40,36,3,51

												I do fencing as an amateur and I have to say, technique and physical ability aside, Nidhogg captures brilliantly everything that represents the real spirit of fencing: the unnerving waits to lure your adversary into attacking you, the sudden resolutions, the continuous pushing back and forth, the quick clashes that make you go ""WTF JUST HAPPENED?"", the giant worm that eats the winner at the end.Main flaw, the game boasts ""full controller support"" but that's full only in a world where XBox controllers are the only controllers (hint: we're not in such a world). So to actually achieve that ""full controller support"" just download a software like JoyToKey. Other than that, it's kinda repetitive contentwise, I haven't seen matches in online multiplayer, and if you play too much local multiplayer you're going to lose friends fast. It's as ragequit inducing as they come when you lose many times in a row. Maybe not worth its full price, but while it's on sale, the genius minimalistic design and gameplay make it definitely a little gem.			",206,65,1,34,18,3,57

												A brilliant, balanced, entertaining game. Manages to capture the utmost excitement most games can achieve in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds, time and time again. A balanced, simplistic game built upon skill and reflexes, there are only 7 attacks and each has a potential counter resulting in death. This game is easy to learn, hard to master, and playing with friends is epic. I have only played this game for an hour but I am already hooked, I would recommend this to anyone who has ever liked Smash Bros, Street Fighter or any game similar. Actually  would recommend this to anyone who enjoys competition, which is what this game focuses on. For what it is it I have to give it 10/10, it's wonderful.			",63,4,0,3,1,0,0

												Grab a few friends for an online tournament and you can have fun for hours with Nidhogg, but not days. This game is sadly a one-trick pony and you'll feel the brand-new game buzz wear pretty damn thin much quicker than you'd like. If you look past the shear lack of longevity to this game, you can no doubt appreciate the nice visual take on a classic look and the quirky and fresh (in the modern gaming world anyway) style of gameplay. If you're looking for a fun indie game to play solo (for more than an hour or two at least), in my opinion, this isn't it.6/10Pros/Cons+ Gameplay is fluent, intense and varied enough for a well-balanced and fun showdown.+ Classical visuals matched with frantic visual effects and modern music make for an interesting mix.+ With friends this game creates rivalries and offers a few hours of fun gaming full of laughs.+ The crossover between Nordic mythology and fencing is so miss matched it adds to the games charm. - Has to be one of the most repetitive games I've played with no variation in gameplay whatsoever.- There is such little content even for the select game types with only 4 environments available.- For the price of this game, you'd expect much more from it and not just a glamorised minigame.- The single player mode is tiring to work through whilst multiplayer options are just as limiting due to content.

												A very fun game that's incredibly overpriced and performs too poorly in multiplayer to justify its cost.The game is incredibly simple but it can also be incredibly fun. If multiplayer were better designed and actually stable, MAYBE this dev could justify their price. MAYBE.As it stands, this game is so simple that even at 75% off it might be too much given the technical problems you have in MP and that SP is only entertaining for an hour, max, given how the content provided feels more like a bonus loading game for a bigger game than its own game...

												A very fun game that's incredibly overpriced and performs too poorly in multiplayer to justify its cost.The game is incredibly simple but it can also be incredibly fun. If multiplayer were better designed and actually stable, MAYBE this dev could justify their price. MAYBE.As it stands, this game is so simple that even at 75% off it might be too much given the technical problems you have in MP and that SP is only entertaining for an hour, max, given how the content provided feels more like a bonus loading game for a bigger game than its own game...

												If you like fast, twitch reaction and medieval combat, armed and unarmed. this is the game for you.it is especially challenging with friends because the game has so many mechanics. if you don't have friends (if your that 1%) the game is still great fun when you slash through the npcs, even if they learn your tactics and adjust to them.if your a hardcore medieval lover, like me. you should enjoy this game to bits.9.8/10 still some glitchness and somethings do feel slightly off.

												Fun game, but absolutely infuriating. The gameplay is innovative and complicated, but it basically goes to waste because of the glaring flaws in its mechanics. It is far too easy to simply run past your opponent and prevent them from attacking you. All you have to do is evade their attacks when the arrow is on you and you can skip right to the end. You can also cheap-shot them if their sword isn't in the right place, making it even harder for a defender to turn the tide. It's advertised as a fencing game but it's really about trolling. If you want to get good at this strategy and use it to♥♥♥♥♥♥off everyone you play against, absolutely, buy this game. Otherwise, skip, it's not worth the price tag, especially considering how short it is.			",150,23,1,20,21,1,21

												Nidhogg is solid but extremely simple - it's a nice diversion but it can't hold your attention for very long. The mechanics are cute but they get old really fast. I played the game quite a few times on Xbox, mostly local multiplayer with friends, and it was good for a few laughs, but we'd turn to something else after twenty minutes, tops. This Steam version plays the same for better or worse, but it also adds on *extremely* poor netcode. I was really shocked by how poorly the game runs online...a friend and I labored through fifteen minutes of stuttering, jerky matches that made it practically impossible to land an accurate hit or jump over a chasm. I'm struggling to understand why such a seemingly simple game would have such bad networking. There's a single player mode where you fight against a series of AI opponents, but it gets boring pretty quickly. I think that this is really a game that is meant to be played against other people...however, you won't be able to do so online.On top of these issues, this is a simple little multiplayer game that can't really be played online, so you would think the price should reflect that. Nope...it's 15 dollars or 16.99 CAD. You can read up on the game and watch some clips to decide if it is worth that price to you, but I definitely don't think it is. I actually got the game in a Humble Bundle pack so I didn't pay too much for it, but for everyone else, I'd say that this game isn't anywhere near worth a 15 dollar investment. If you're really interested in it, you should wait for a sale...but even then, remember that online play is functionally broken and the game probably won't be enough to hold your long-term interest.

												This game is a lot of fun. The combat is simple, fluid, and downright amazing. The soundtrack is very nice, and provides a nice backdrop to the ""civilized"" art of fencing.

												Prepare to shout AHA! over and over and over again as you play a game of stabbing footsies with your friends.  While the single player is entertaining since the AI emulates a variety of playstyles, the real core of this game is multiplayer against your friends.  The visuals and mechanics are incredibly simplistic but are executed so well that every sucessful stab feels like a major victory.  No feeling is greater than facing your friend on the final screen and killing him as you shout ""AHA!"" and running to the next screen to begin the tug of war all over again.			",166,31,0,28,14,1,20

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/nidhogg-game-review/Nidhogg, also referred to as Fencing Simulator 2014 (by me, at least), is an excellent example of what a casual, multiplayer indie game should be. Be prepared to engage in very fast-paced swordplay, with friends of course.The objective in Nidhogg is very simple: reach the end of the map on the enemy's side before he/she can reach your end of the map. Upon reaching the end of the map, you're promptly eaten by an Alaskan Bullworm. No idea why, but that signals your victory. However, a lone enemy stands in the way, ready to commence fencing at any given moment. This is where the real fun in the game lies, the fighting. Well, that's basically what the game is, so there's a plus.There are three stances that one can take whilst wielding a sword in Nidhogg: Low, mid, and high. If your opponent attacks you low, and your stance is low, then you block their attack. This applies to the other two stances as well. There's also a stance that you can take if you just hold your sword up high. This stance is only used to prepare for throwing the sword, which, when thrown, can be deflected if your opponent has a mid or high stance active. Once you're without a sword, you must revert to your fists, which don't always help out much. However, you can pick up a fallen sword.The game has a very minimalistic style to it. The characters are very low-res, solid-color sprites. This is an interesting style for such a game and it does add to the fun a bit on a certain stage, the Cloud stage. Because of the game's style, it is very difficult to see where each character is on this map, which is both a good and bad thing! All that said, the game does have one massive flaw. That flaw being the complete lack of content. For a game that has been in development for several years, I would at least expect more than four maps. Four years and only four maps? Very disappointing.Nidhogg, overall, is just an excellent game. Highly recommended if you have a friend to play it with!

												I'm definitely recommending that you play Nidhogg. The controls and mechanics are simple enough for you to learn them quickly, but they also have enough depth for complex, skill-based play. At first, fighting doesn't appear complicated, but there is a lot going on. Positioning is crucial; standing above your opponent or blocking a doorway can make all the diffence. You also have a few different ways to approach fighting. Fencing is an option, but you could also try tossing your sword and rushing ahead for some melee attacks. One of my favorite tricks is ""playing chicken""; I throw my sword and charge ahead, and right before my opponent attacks, I roll past them and just keep on going. Local versus is one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I've had in a long time. The visuals ooze retro style, and I absolutely adore the soundtrack.As much as I love the gameplay, I can't necessarily recommend that you buy Nidhogg, at least for $15. You don't get a ton of content for your money. Apart from multiplayer, all you get is a single-player mode that is just a series of AI matches. The AI makes it clear that Nidhogg is a multiplayer game at heart, as it lacks the complexity of a human player. Playing with friends is great because of the atmosphere, the intensity, and the psychology. Messing with your opponent's head is just as important as the onscreen action, and when playing against the AI, you lose that crucial component.If Nidhogg were around $7.50, I would have no reservations about recommending it. I'm still setting my review to ""recommended"" because the game itself is so fun, but you might want to wait for a sale.			",159,16,4,11,6,0,21

If they whine because it wasn't fair, there's no lag (I only play local multi) and it's pretty freaking simple. Swordfight while running.  Better person wins.  Pass the controller, not the best 1 v 1 over and over against the same person.  Needs more maps, only fail is no level editor.			",40,1,2,0,3,0,4

												Fast paced, ability based fighting game.Although at first glance it seems a bit limited, because of the small number of levels and simplicity of controls, the game is extremely flexible and allows for a wide range of playing styles and options. It also allows to modify gameplay options to make gameplay even more varied.It's best enjoyed by playing two players in the same screen, I have still to check the online mode.Personal Experience: I once played this with an entire group of actual fencers. Although it obviously lacks the depth of real fencing, we had a real good time and felt the combat was actually compelling and similar to fencing. Except the victory part, of course, they are still puzzled by it.			",111,34,1,9,5,0,12

												As of 1/26/14:I can't recommend this game, especially at 15 bucks at this moment for the following:-Limited maps: only 4 maps currently. Which one (Clouds) contains very strong strobing colors that sometimes make it hard to see if your enemy is armed or sometimes where you or your enemy is. This is not helped by sections of the map having a bridge that decays in less then 3 seconds when you stand on it, (which no other map currently has).-Busted online: some weird errors with inputs will occur where they don't read and net code will have you repeatedly teleport around, sometimes to your repeated death. Or it will TAKE BACK A KILL on your screen, for an example of a similar occurance look up ""GGPO rollback"".-Weird Frame bugs: currently people who can play some of the the highest ends games at a solid 60fps can barely get this to run at 30. I was able to play it at a smooth frame rate in the high 50s to a solid 60 yesterday and earlier today couldn't make it past 15 fps-Limited single player: a simple gaunlet mode that really only factors in time. Also a tutorial and that's it.-No visual customization options: in single and mutliplayer modes you see a range of colors if you have more then 2 players, but you can not select them! if you or another player are not assigned the color, you can't be that color.-No way to mod it at this moment: Can't make maps, modify existing maps, add weapons or anything. I'd think personally that a two person team of creative people would open it up to the public.There are some great variant options for multiplayer:- Boomerang sword, which is a fun way to tag the other player who might have rolled behind you- Spine sword: Kill a person with your barehands and you'll get a sword.- Low Gravity: If you like high jumps and/or more controls on your jumps.- Turbo mode: for those who think the game is a bit too slow, this cranks it up to what it would be like to have Quicksliver fight the Flash.-Ability to turn off throwing/swords: Make it harder for your enemy to fall back on old favorites. The latter is great if you mix it with spine swords.I felt like 15 bucks was too much simply because, I've gotten better games from steam or other online services from indie devs or smaller devs, then the activisions of the world, brand new for around the same price. Not only were they filled with more content for a person who wishes to play single player only. They had better online as well. I didn't expect that much from Nidhogg, but I expected more than I got especially with how busted the online is at points(I couldn't seem to do the basic function of throwing my sword, and before you say anything the other guys threw theirs). Which yes, while it's a 2 person team, it was a project that took them what? 4 years from concept to retail?Up to you if you want to spend the money, but I wouldnt recommend it.			",5,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game.Fast.Lots of fun with friends.Not for you if you get mad.Don't be mad, okay?It's a game.I absolutly recommend this game, just not for full price (currently $15 USD), because there's not that much content. I bought it on deep sale. Not too much re-playability, just something to have some fun with sometimes. The singleplayer is good, but I'd recommend gettings some friends up with it. Local co-op is fine if that's an option. Only uses 6 buttons. Music is fantastic, and the tension is tactile. It's very well balanced and there's no leveling or any sort of nonsense.

												I love co-op games.  The problem is most of my immediate friends aren't ""hard core"" gamers and want something simple.  That explains why we play console FPS games alot together.  This game changes EVERYTHING.  The controls are simple to use yet very difficult to master.  I will hopefully be playing many hours of this with my friends.  I might go as far as to say it's one of the best co-op games of all time.  Nidhgg has Local (LAN), ""couch co-op"", and online (currently quite wonky) modes.  Grab a friend and two keyboards/controllers, it's NIDHOGGIN' TIME!			",460,101,11,36,22,9,44

												Overall, it's a fantastic little Local-Mutliplayer game to play with some good friends. With low system requirements, you can bring it to a friend's house on older laptop for portable fun. However, $15USD is pretty steep for the amount of content in the game, but it's a steal at around $5USD on sale (what I paid for it). Pros: - Hours of fun with friends.- Low system requirements. The pixel art style gets the job done.- 10+ gameplay settings to mix-and-match to create interesting matches.Cons: - Price. - Only 4 maps, but would be more acceptible if the price was lower (around $5USD).- I needed to use JoyToKey for my older controllers, despite it claiming to support DirectInput.- The Pause key (Esc) can't be rebound in the game.

												Prepare to shout AHA! over and over and over again as you play a game of stabbing footsies with your friends.  While the single player is entertaining since the AI emulates a variety of playstyles, the real core of this game is multiplayer against your friends.  The visuals and mechanics are incredibly simplistic but are executed so well that every sucessful stab feels like a major victory.  No feeling is greater than facing your friend on the final screen and killing him as you shout ""AHA!"" and running to the next screen to begin the tug of war all over again.			",166,31,0,28,14,1,20

												Compared to the usual  ""cover"" based run and gun games on steam, this is an unusual gem. Nidhogg is for people who are sick of all the usual games on steam nowadays. With a brutally excalating learning curve, luck is only half a factor in Nidhogg. ""I want it, but for 15 bucks! I'll pass."" STOP RIGHT THERE MISTER. This game makes such a good mix of brutallity and ""Oh my god, how did I do that?"" feeling. So, Cost: 15$ Worth: 20$. Sure, you'll fail horribly, but lucky for you, there are no lives or time limits. Which makes this my favorite indie game so far.			",115,8,4,9,20,2,4

												Nidhogg was a pleasant suprise in terms of combat, endless hours of fun, many people complain about there only being 4 levels but the combat makes up for it, it would be nice for there to be more levels but its still amazing,			",159,19,2,12,32,2,19

												This game is simply amazing. While some people will try to claim that that multiplayer is ""tacked on"" that simply isn't so. The singleplayer campaign has 4 maps with a single, respawning enemy, with each level adding new levels of soul crushing difficulty, but the curve is very well done. Winning is very satisfying, and offline and online multiplayer only adds to how much fun can be squeezed out of this title			",76,12,4,9,16,0,11

												When you stab someone, you can alter the swords height up and down while the person is stabbed, for as much as you'd like. So you just see the blood flowing through your victim. My friend looked at me with disgust, my face however was priceless.10/10 would stab again			",72,4,0,2,2,0,2

												Nidhogg is a side-scrolling, “holy♥♥♥♥♥♥what-the-hell-is-going-on,” mixed with “I-don’t-know-why-I-can’t-stop-laughing.” It is played in a tug-of-war style fashion where the objective is to reach the end of the stage before your opponent reaches theirs by playing a friendly game of…fencing? The mechanics are simple to learn and run with, but definitely take at least moderate skill to master. From fencing, to CQC, you’ll find that there’s quite a few ways to maim your foes and book it to the end stage (have you stuck someone on your sword and moved it around yet? Brutal!). A game like this could be daunting had it been slow – the speed and fluid motions of the gameplay really shine in this high speed fencing brawl. A game like this reminds me of a single-player buy that you kill about an hour or two on and then never touch it again (unless you achievement hunt). The multiplayer adds so much more to the game, including at least several more hours you can kill in multiplayer. I’m not sure I’m 100% sold on a $15 dollar tag for the game. Granted it IS fun, and there IS a chance that I could play this for longer than I’m advertising, but I honestly can see this game sitting idly by once the novelty wears off. The part that sucks is close range strafing with your opponent. Too soft and you don’t do what you were hoping to do. Too hard and you just ran yourself right onto your opponents sword.Beautiful pixel graphics, interesting mechanics, and a unique game overall with brilliant music, I definitely recommend this game to those interested in taking a chance on something fresh and original. If you're worried about the price, catch it on sale. Between $4.99-7.99 is a must buy, $7.99-9.99 is what I would have expected.			",106,25,1,18,12,0,6

This is taking fencing to a whole new level with the inclusion of fisticuffs, parkour, and neck-snapping. It can be infuriating if you've got a very short temper. But I've got a slightly less than normal temper and I really enjoy this way more than hate it. You should definitely buy it. Especially if you're thinking about torrenting it.

												Nidhogg is a game that can bring u lots of fun as well as LAUGHS :PIt's a kind of relaxing game that u don't need to use ur brain too much to think abt it. Simple painting style and easy operation is the biggest characteristic of this game. It's a nice option for u if u wants to play this game on coach to relax urself and have some fun. There are four maps in this game and they are all excellent. The BGM in the cloud is awesome! But the color of the background in clouds always makes my eyes feel dizzy. Hope the producer will update more different scenes for the players to play. Unicorn worm is my favorite thing in this game, coz that means VICTORY.(Hit: It’s more fun with friends. If u don’t have friends play this game with u, do not buy it. Coz u will be so boring by your own!)So, if u has lots of friends, and u likes to spend ur time on the sofa, this game is totally worth for u. Btw: wait until a sale to buy it. The price is way too much. ;)			",44,10,0,1,2,0,4

												Nidhogg is trash.I'm not gonna leave it at that. Nidhogg is trash for a couple of reasons, and the developers just dont deserve your money. In terms of core gameplay, Nidhogg is great fun. You run around with one of your pals, you stab em, you roll under em, you jump into their sword a couple of times, but that's basically where it ends. This game is broken and limited in a lot of ways. Underwhelmingly short maps, only four maps in the first place, couple with a frustrating and bugged lobby system and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unecessary connection issues. You can only ever play this game online 50% of the time you try to play it online (speaking from experience). Sure, the ""story"" mode serves as a fun and challenging hour of gameplay, but after the first playthough, you have no real reason to replay it.Don't buy this game. ",128,24,0,16,5,0,2

Nidhoggs Presentation is simple but charming; looking like a mix of pixel art and papercraft, with high-tempo electronic music fitting very nicely with the action. Its a neat little package of elements that work just perfectly, but because of the simplicity of the game $15 feels like too high of an asking price and has probably scared off many steam customers.

												Amazing game.  It thrives on simple gameplay, and has some of the most crisp mechanics I've ever seen in an action-platformer.  This allows for a competitive experience purely based on skill; whether you win or lose, you feel as if you've earned the result.  The ""advancing-room-gameplay"" and evident verticality allows for on-your-heals strategizing, tense standoffs, and miraculous comebacks.  Keep in mind that this game is really meant for multiplayer.  Its mechanics are specific to the human element, and are best seen in player versus player combat.  This game is best played with a friend on local co-op, and should really only be bought for that purpose.  Online multiplayer is good, but does not contain the same enjoyment as facing down your oppenent eye-to-eye.  Online mode can lag as well, which can be frustrating in such a skill-based game.  Single player is nothing special, and should be seen as something to do when you don't have someone to play with.  It has a very arcadey feel and relatively challenging, but is not a time consumer, and furthermore, not is fun or rewarding when playing against another human.If you have a friend that is willing to play with you, you have to buy this game.  It is one of the greatest player versus player experiences on the PC.  If you are looking for a single player experience, you might want to stay away, as that is not what this game is meant for.  Although the base price of $15 ($12 now for sale) seems expensive for a low-budget indie game with only one game mode, it is suprisingly worth it.  You will have more fun playing this with a friend than in any other game I can think of.			",73,6,0,6,7,0,7

												I spent the entire weekend playing this at the 2014 Global Games Jam. A great game with a retro arcade feel yet all the fluidity of modern controls. Fast-paced, addictive gameplay that's great to play with friends, especially in the Offline Versus mode (I'm pretty sure this is the preferred mode for most players).My only gripe with this game is the cost. As great as this game is, it shouldn't be retailing for more than £5, considering the potential AAA titles you can pick up for the £12 price tag. It simply doesn't have the content depth to justify it. Also, if you're going to offer buy two copies and give one to a friend, it should at least be 50% off the second copy, not a £2 saving. My advice: Chip in with some friends and buy this for some pick up and play tournament action.			",62,7,0,5,2,0,4

 This game is so much fun. Probably one of the most fun local two player PC games. It's fast paced and even though there aren't a ton of levels it's hilarious and tense EVERY SINGLE TIME WE PLAY. We absolutely love this game, and think everybody should give it a shot. It's easy and just so fun! 10/10			",740,241,19,96,74,11,108

												Nidhogg is a very simple game that is hard to be extremely good at. There's a limited amount of things you can do and it's kind of beautiful how there are counters and weaknesses to everything you do. You can only do 4 actions, really. Attack, roll, throw sword or divekick. The most advanced move is you can press up and down to change the level of your fencing sword. And if you change the level of your sword into the level of your opponent's fencing sword, it disarms them. Maybe being the buttonmasher is an advantage? I haven't quite figured it out, but this is a game to play against any friend.This is a 1v1 combat game. If you kill your opponent, you are allowed to move forward to pan the screen in your direciton. You must run your designated direction for a few rooms to 'win the match' and choose another level. When you kill your opponent they'll repeatedly spawn in front of you. A stalward guardian of your path to your victory. Defeat them over and over the become the champion.			",469,87,4,77,23,3,48

												Fast-paced competitive mayhem! If you have two controllers and ANY friends (luckily I have kids, so I don't need friends), you should own this. The gameplay is extremely simple, and the controls are well calibrated so that anyone can pick up and play. I see how one might feel that $15 is a little steep for this. I picked it up for $10, and don't regret it.			",175,61,3,10,13,1,19

												I love co-op games.  The problem is most of my immediate friends aren't ""hard core"" gamers and want something simple.  That explains why we play console FPS games alot together.  This game changes EVERYTHING.  The controls are simple to use yet very difficult to master.  I will hopefully be playing many hours of this with my friends.  I might go as far as to say it's one of the best co-op games of all time.  Nidhgg has Local (LAN), ""couch co-op"", and online (currently quite wonky) modes.  Grab a friend and two keyboards/controllers, it's NIDHOGGIN' TIME!			",460,101,11,36,22,9,44

												Before now, games that duplicate the twitchy tactical joy of fencing have been nonexistant. They still stubbornly refuse to exist, but Nidhogg does a fantastic job of hinting at the complexity while totally failing to be a realistic fencing game. Lunging, disarming, punching, sweeping the leg, divekicking, and throwing the damn sword at your opponent are the only options you have but they make for a deep and textured fight. There is always a different technique to master and there are players out there that will take the fight in directions you never suspected in single player. The pace is fast but the response is so tight you never feel out of control. I love fighting protracted battles back and forth over a stage and then realizing the level is soaked in your and your opponent's blood. I love blitter feedback, the whole game looks like an Amiga demo.			",831,249,28,88,80,8,120

The game is centered around a style of swordfighting similar to fencing, with a few twists. The soundtrack and art design are amazing, and the multiplayer, when it works, is very enjoyable.

												As of 1/26/14:I can't recommend this game, especially at 15 bucks at this moment for the following:-Limited maps: only 4 maps currently. Which one (Clouds) contains very strong strobing colors that sometimes make it hard to see if your enemy is armed or sometimes where you or your enemy is. This is not helped by sections of the map having a bridge that decays in less then 3 seconds when you stand on it, (which no other map currently has).-Busted online: some weird errors with inputs will occur where they don't read and net code will have you repeatedly teleport around, sometimes to your repeated death. Or it will TAKE BACK A KILL on your screen, for an example of a similar occurance look up ""GGPO rollback"".-Weird Frame bugs: currently people who can play some of the the highest ends games at a solid 60fps can barely get this to run at 30. I was able to play it at a smooth frame rate in the high 50s to a solid 60 yesterday and earlier today couldn't make it past 15 fps-Limited single player: a simple gaunlet mode that really only factors in time. Also a tutorial and that's it.-No visual customization options: in single and mutliplayer modes you see a range of colors if you have more then 2 players, but you can not select them! if you or another player are not assigned the color, you can't be that color.-No way to mod it at this moment: Can't make maps, modify existing maps, add weapons or anything. I'd think personally that a two person team of creative people would open it up to the public.There are some great variant options for multiplayer:- Boomerang sword, which is a fun way to tag the other player who might have rolled behind you- Spine sword: Kill a person with your barehands and you'll get a sword.- Low Gravity: If you like high jumps and/or more controls on your jumps.- Turbo mode: for those who think the game is a bit too slow, this cranks it up to what it would be like to have Quicksliver fight the Flash.-Ability to turn off throwing/swords: Make it harder for your enemy to fall back on old favorites. The latter is great if you mix it with spine swords.I felt like 15 bucks was too much simply because, I've gotten better games from steam or other online services from indie devs or smaller devs, then the activisions of the world, brand new for around the same price. Not only were they filled with more content for a person who wishes to play single player only. They had better online as well. I didn't expect that much from Nidhogg, but I expected more than I got especially with how busted the online is at points(I couldn't seem to do the basic function of throwing my sword, and before you say anything the other guys threw theirs). Which yes, while it's a 2 person team, it was a project that took them what? 4 years from concept to retail?Up to you if you want to spend the money, but I wouldnt recommend it.			",5,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nidhogg is a side-scrolling, “holy♥♥♥♥♥♥what-the-hell-is-going-on,” mixed with “I-don’t-know-why-I-can’t-stop-laughing.” It is played in a tug-of-war style fashion where the objective is to reach the end of the stage before your opponent reaches theirs by playing a friendly game of…fencing? The mechanics are simple to learn and run with, but definitely take at least moderate skill to master. From fencing, to CQC, you’ll find that there’s quite a few ways to maim your foes and book it to the end stage (have you stuck someone on your sword and moved it around yet? Brutal!). A game like this could be daunting had it been slow – the speed and fluid motions of the gameplay really shine in this high speed fencing brawl. A game like this reminds me of a single-player buy that you kill about an hour or two on and then never touch it again (unless you achievement hunt). The multiplayer adds so much more to the game, including at least several more hours you can kill in multiplayer. I’m not sure I’m 100% sold on a $15 dollar tag for the game. Granted it IS fun, and there IS a chance that I could play this for longer than I’m advertising, but I honestly can see this game sitting idly by once the novelty wears off. The part that sucks is close range strafing with your opponent. Too soft and you don’t do what you were hoping to do. Too hard and you just ran yourself right onto your opponents sword.Beautiful pixel graphics, interesting mechanics, and a unique game overall with brilliant music, I definitely recommend this game to those interested in taking a chance on something fresh and original. If you're worried about the price, catch it on sale. Between $4.99-7.99 is a must buy, $7.99-9.99 is what I would have expected.			",106,25,1,18,12,0,6

												A tight, simple, multiplayer FENCING game. Only 2 buttons and your movement keys are needed, or joystick if you're using a controller. Definetely a game better with an X-Box or Logitech controller. A few gripes, there are this strange black bars along the sides of the screen, which you can never rid. Also, very little customization options, no windowed mode, pretty sure you can't change the controls as well, although they're so tight there's really no need. All in all, pretty good find, the price though is a little steep at $17, but if given an update, adding features would make it more bearable. 8.5/10			",98,24,0,10,9,2,4

												This makes me feel very confused and tired. The computer is very good at moving quickly while I am not. I like the music and the way my eyes water if I play for more than 5 minutes. I give this game 4 Tired Dogs out of 6. It could have been 5 out of 6 ""TD""s, but the only weapon is a small white line that is horrible to touch and there are not many move to do with it. Will change rating if any different lines or magical spells are added to the game.			",92,12,2,12,6,0,3

												Fast paced, ability based fighting game.Although at first glance it seems a bit limited, because of the small number of levels and simplicity of controls, the game is extremely flexible and allows for a wide range of playing styles and options. It also allows to modify gameplay options to make gameplay even more varied.It's best enjoyed by playing two players in the same screen, I have still to check the online mode.Personal Experience: I once played this with an entire group of actual fencers. Although it obviously lacks the depth of real fencing, we had a real good time and felt the combat was actually compelling and similar to fencing. Except the victory part, of course, they are still puzzled by it.			",111,34,1,9,5,0,12

												Nidhogg is a game that can bring u lots of fun as well as LAUGHS :PIt's a kind of relaxing game that u don't need to use ur brain too much to think abt it. Simple painting style and easy operation is the biggest characteristic of this game. It's a nice option for u if u wants to play this game on coach to relax urself and have some fun. There are four maps in this game and they are all excellent. The BGM in the cloud is awesome! But the color of the background in clouds always makes my eyes feel dizzy. Hope the producer will update more different scenes for the players to play. Unicorn worm is my favorite thing in this game, coz that means VICTORY.(Hit: It’s more fun with friends. If u don’t have friends play this game with u, do not buy it. Coz u will be so boring by your own!)So, if u has lots of friends, and u likes to spend ur time on the sofa, this game is totally worth for u. Btw: wait until a sale to buy it. The price is way too much. ;)			",44,10,0,1,2,0,4

Also there are only four maps and you can't choose which color person you want to be in multiplayer, but I think those are the only two downsides. If you don't already own this game then I suggest buying it, it is the most fun when you play it with friends.			",70,23,1,4,21,2,3

												I first played Nidhogg after dinner at a friend's house. Things were looking boring so I whipped out my laptop that everyone could gather round to watch me play Freecell.Luckily, someone grabbed it from me and logged onto their Steam account to set up a tournament of this game.You each control a fencer and have to kill the other guy then run across their body to get to the next screen. Do this enough times and you win.You can throw your sword at your opponent's face, disarm them, and even roll like a ninja/bowling ball along the floor before sweeping out their legs and pulling the still-beating heart out of their body.It's great.And it has graphics like on an old-timey computer, but really slick animation, so the whole style is warm and milky all over your face. Haha! But seriously, the animation is great. I heard the guy spent four years on it. Or the game as a whole. I dunno. But it was four years well spent whatever.Oh, and what's the Nidhogg? You'll find out. Just whatever you do - and I can't stress this enough - don't get eaten by it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You may be looking at the game trailer for this game and wondering, ""15 dollars?""All you see in that trailer is swordfighting, fly kicking, neck breaking, gorgeous pixellated art style, great music.But does that really justify 15 dollars?!Short answer: No. They better drop that price someday.Long answer: It's worth 10 dollars at least though. Because this game is FUN AS HELL. Not since the arcade days of Joust, have I had such a good time playing a 1 vs 1 game like this.The BEST thing about this game is the accessibility of it. The controls are literally your W,A,S,D directionals, and two keys for jumping, then attacking. There's a tiny bit more technique to it as well, but I am able to fire this game up and play it with just about any family member in minutes. It's also neat because either two people can play on one keyboard, or if you smell bad and don't want to be that close to someone, they can use a 360 controller while you rock the keyboard.This game evokes laughter, screams of defeat and terror. It's seriously THAT fun. Nidhogg is an excellent game with a price tag that is a bit too steep to buy it at full price.What's worse is the fact that it's online multiplayer is still broken. I have owned this game for quite some time now and to this day, cannot start an online match.But that's really my only gripe with the game. So get it! If it's on sale.			",61,14,1,3,15,0,1

												The gameplay makes this game worth every penny. If you like fighting games and you have some friends who like fighting games, it's a great purchase. Better if they're local, until they fix the netcode. But it's great anyway! To be honest, there's not too much content. Single player is a simple series of fights across the 4 available stages. There's only one type of character. But if you like snappy, fluid gameplay with great tactical depth, you'll find that there's a lot to learn and love with Nidhogg.Also I love the soundtrack and how it reacts to the match. When there's a lull, it slows down and the drums fade away, only to start back up again at a player's untimely demise. Find me online (and hopefully the netcode gets fixed soon!).

The controls are literally your W,A,S,D directionals, and two keys for jumping, then attacking. There's a tiny bit more technique to it as well, but I am able to fire this game up and play it with just about any family member in minutes. It's also neat because either two people can play on one keyboard, or if you smell bad and don't want to be that close to someone, they can use a 360 controller while you rock the keyboard.This game evokes laughter, screams of defeat and terror. It's seriously THAT fun. Nidhogg is an excellent game with a price tag that is a bit too steep to buy it at full price.What's worse is the fact that it's online multiplayer is still broken. I have owned this game for quite some time now and to this day, cannot start an online match.But that's really my only gripe with the game. So get it! If it's on sale.			",61,14,1,3,15,0,1

												Nidhogg is a very unique game, but it can be compared to this: Imagine you are playing rock, paper, scissors. Now take away the rock and the paper. Now, imagine you can either lift up your scissors, lower your scissors, or attempt to attack with said scissors. Your scissors are now a sword and you can now cartwheel for whatever reason.That's Nidhogg for you.			",151,18,0,12,8,1,7

												First and foremost: Get a friend to play with you on the same TV. Trust me. Get a few friends, a small party. This game is at its best when you have a crew of folks with you playing tournaments.It's a very simple game that's damn near impossible to master, and every single match with a human opponent can offer more range of emotion than your average title simply from your own progress -- or loss of.If you're only interested in single player, this game will SEVERELY disappoint at just four maps and very few modes. However, these maps are finely tuned and feature everything you'd need for a game like this, and the modes are just interesting enough to throw a curveball to your opponent. So go in with the thought that you're going to find someone to play with. Trust me.			",701,212,7,82,47,3,72

												What a brilliant, perfect game. A better arcade twitch fighting game could not be made.If you stripped a competitive fighter game down to its very core elements, sped it up, and balanced it perfectly, you'd get Nidhogg, or something like it. It's a joy to play. I read somewhere that ""every kill is victory, every death is shame"" and that is spot on. It's so simple yet so deep!Play Nidhogg. You'll like it. People watching will like it. Everyone will like it.			",590,167,10,85,43,4,95

												Nidhogg is a great game where two players engage in a fencing duel of throwing, kicking, and stabing. This game can easy for two players to play on one computer (for instance one player using w,a,s,d and another up, down, left, right). You can set up tournaments where players can battle in a series of battles determining the best player. Nidhogg includes has a single-player mode. In singleplayer you fight different computers in hope of getting the fastest time. One great feature is variants where you can customize the gameplay for a new experience. Variants include time limit, low gravity, turbo mode, slow mode, boomerang swords, and more. I would highly recomend this game for any group of two or more people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disregard all the posts about shotty internet. Sure, the matchmaking system is pretty poor, but if you buy the game with a friend that lives nearby, the connection is alomost seemless. My friend and I bought it two days ago, and have been playing for quite some time now. The game is a fast paced yet grueling tug of war. Every duel is tense, and there are a variety of different combat options to murder your foe with.Overall, I am having a hard time remembering a time were I felt so intensely immersed in a 2D indie game.Final verdict: A must buy if you plan to play it with friend(s) that live nearby.

												I actually really like nidhogg the game reminds me of some old arcade game with sword fighters its really fun and challaging and also i could consider this game a rage game it made really mad here and there because of how competitive it is but i actually really like it so try it out some time if you like 8 bit graphics and competitive sword fighting games that look like they could have been from an arcade if you do this is the game for you			",60,10,0,2,9,1,1

												I picked it up for a dollar thanks to humble bundle. Definitely not worth buying for full price.Far too short with only four levels that can be completed in a couple minutes each. The singleplayer mode just recycles the same old levels over and over.Mechanics are fun and original, but they are not enough to give much replay value.Multiplayer and singleplayer are essentially the same mode, as the only difference is that a player controls the enemy instead of AI.Later levels of singleplayer decide to make the game harder by having the enemy change colour rapidly so as to induce a seizure.Highly overrated game. You might as well go play a flash game for free in your browser.I'd recommend Abyss Odyssey for a better side scrolling action game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basically a great game to play with some buddies. I can't imagine this being even mildly fun alone, but with some friends and some intoxication this game becomes a hell of a good time. I can't say it has enough content to justify the $15. This is more a game I'd suggest spending under 10 bucks on.			",51,6,0,21,13,2,36

 A Nidhogg is a mythical creature in Norse mythology which is a giant, man-eating serpent. In this game two fencers battle it out for the glory of being eaten by the Nidhogg in the ultimate sacrifice to the gods, or something like that. GAMEPLAY I have to admit when i first started playing I had no idea what the heck was going on. Bashing random keys hoping something would happen, but the AI continued to outsmart me; Keyboard is not recommended. When I used my controller (steam controller works great! xbox too) the controls seemed much easier to get the hang of but it is still complex enough to keep me interested. You can choose a high, centered or lower stance to stab your opponent.Just aim above or below your opponent  right?  wrong.Besides stances there are a ton of strategies for you to employ: running, rolling, jumping, jump kicking, sword throwing.If you're feeling really daring there's even a way to disarm your opponent, but beware you can still get knocked out and strangled to death (seriously) and lose the arrow.The arrow is something that's been there in loads of games, but it works pretty well in this game. At the start there is no arrow until one of the fencers kills the other. Then the power of the arrow is all yours and you don't have to actually kill your opponent. Then run for your life! the Nidhogg awaits! SOUND Meh. The soundtrack is more or less what you'd expect, I like it :PThe sword swings and the death screams are what you're hearing most of the time, and they are fantastic. Not to the point where they are haunting, but they aren't silly either. And the sweet sound of the crowds after you have bested your opponent is one of the best feelings in this game. GRAPHICS Well lets be honest here, if you've already looked at the game its clear that graphics are not the main focus. You could probably redraw this game in MS Paint. But hey, its an art choice, right?The effect of the pixel art is kind of nice and makes the game feel a bit unique (to me at least, if you play a lot of pixel art games then maybe not) and as you spill your opponent's blood, or they yours, you notice the area becoming absolutely soaked in blood, which is also the same colour as its respective carrier before it was splattered everywhere making it easy to see who the real lamb to the slaughter is. CONCLUSION It's a complete package, no DLC adds a few points in my book, death screams and for added fun, you can always roleplay as the fencer (en garde!) with a friend if that's your thing. Challenging single player modes, and multiplayer is double the fun. 7/10. Very replayable and keeps me coming back too.Get this game if you like stabbing people, annoying your friends, or if you want to play it with me because I love this game for all the right reasons.

I think the right price should be around  $4.99-Haven't really tried playing online matches myself, but the forums are full of people complaining about it hardly ever working and being laggy and game-breaking when it actually works.

												Holy crap this is a rush, its like a thumb war with a friend. Your up your down, your up your down. So basically it's a fencing game, there are several ways to kill your opponent, but one sword strike will do it. You can also snap their neck when un-armed, and kick them away.The main goal is to progress three screens to the right on each stage, and murdering the enemy at least once to do it.If the enemey kills you, then you must kill the enemy again to progress right.Its a game of tug of war, but with swords and fencing.

												Alright we been waiting for this game to come out in awhile already and they been pushing this game back when it will come out. I must say i think they did hell of a good job on the game controls and how they made it llike a old school game. AKa  my first 2 games i played was the first doom and James Bond games. It sure made me feel great when i logged on this game. Don't let the looks of this game fool you....its a hard.....you need to out think you enemy in a sword fight.  What makes this game really cool if you play pirates of the caribbean theme song in the background...then its amazing....I will give it 10/10 and a Hell Yea Badge to it....I must say this game is awesome and I think this is a great buy.

												This is an amazingly addictive and fun platforming game. It mixes swordplay and smooth platforming to make an awesome game. The fact that it supports local and global multiplayer only adds to the ridiculousness you can have. The a.i is a bit derpy at first but their intelligence increases as you progress further through the storyline. The areas which you explore are all interesting and keep you on your toes with the natural hazards. Even the most boring one, The Castle, was very fun to run about in.			",208,11,0,11,9,2,7

												Holy crap this is a rush, its like a thumb war with a friend. Your up your down, your up your down. So basically it's a fencing game, there are several ways to kill your opponent, but one sword strike will do it. You can also snap their neck when un-armed, and kick them away.The main goal is to progress three screens to the right on each stage, and murdering the enemy at least once to do it.If the enemey kills you, then you must kill the enemy again to progress right.Its a game of tug of war, but with swords and fencing. Very fun!			",375,125,6,68,65,5,58

												Before you start playing this game, don't be confused, LOCAL multiplayer is really it's strong suit. Now I don't have many hours played on my account, but I've played this game plenty on a friend's, and it really is an excellent game. It's definitely a game of skill. No outside forces are going to impact whether or not you come out the victor, it's simply you against your opponent, and occasionally taking advantage of your surroundings. The swordplay is easy to get used to but hard to master, and when you snap the neck of an enemy that's on the ground, it's amazingly satisfying. The visuals are a retro style done right, and the music and sound effects make the game come alive. One of the best local multiplayer experiences I've ever had. However, connections with online multiplayer seem to be giving other people problems. (I don't have experience with this myself, as I've only played it locally) so if this is a turn-off for you, keep that in mind. If the local multiplayer experience is enough to warrant the $15 for you, go for it. If not, get the game on sale. One way or another, Don't pass up on this game.			",50,10,0,2,4,0,0

												Do not buy this game for online play. You will be disappointed.I love looking for new games to play with friends, and I was ecstatic to see this finally released. The gameplay is fantastically unique: You fight past your opponent to run to their 'endzone.' Killing them is not always necessary; you can just run past them, but it'll usually get you killed. After all, combat is what the game was made for.When fencing, there are three different stances you can take (low, mid, high), which can be used for parrying, or, if swift enough, disarming. But if you get disarmed, you can still roll under your opponent, kick them off their feet, snap their neck, and take their sword. But then they respawn at the other end again! So here's where you just chuck your sword into their head and pick it up again as you run past.This is one of very few games where I have wanted to practice different techniques, guards, and attacks. The depth of gameplay is great (Even if there are only four stages), and the idea is unique. The one downside is the online play, which, more often than not, gives players too much lag to even be playable.I wouldn't recommend this if you don't have friends to play with locally, but if you do, enjoy!

Its not ""the quicker you mash the buttons the faster you win"", its a lot about timing, action and reaction. Great fun and the controls are easy to master. This game does not have the variety that makes you addicted for hours, but it certainly will be a good option at each gaming session.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Between the parrying, disarming, dodging, rolling, wall-jumping, punching, sweep-kicking, throwing your sword in rage to kill a fleeing adversary, having the satisfaction of idly jiggling your sword into your impaled foe's innards, and ultimately coming down to fisticuffs until you tear out your opponent's heart (or, as so often happens, they tear YOUR heart out), this game allows the players and spectators alike to enjoy the chaos of swordfighting in a 2-D world in good ol' fashioned, nitty-gritty one-on-one PvP, done arcade style and done right. Highly recommended for a game to settle a beef, make wagers, record the inevitable rage of at least one of the combatants, or just to pass the time with a gruesome yet addicting game of pixelated tug-of-war (just replacing the ropes with rapiers). 9.5/10 (because there is just a tad bit of lag occasionally online, but that's partly my weak internet connection).

												There's something to be said about a game that feels as balanced as Nidhogg does. Every offense has its countering defensive stance, every defense has an offensive move to get around it, and none of them require any more or less effort than the other, making it a simple game of preparation, reflexes, and psychology; the true essence of a fighting game.The graphics could be described as 'minimal', or it could be described as 'clear'. I choose to view it the latter way. All necessary information is communicated in an understandable fashion without sacrificing artistic integrity. Daedelus' soundtrack provides an excellent support to the atmosphere of the game and its individual levels, from the intense and aggressive Wilds, to the tense and deliberate Mines, and the quick and nimble Clouds.Nidhogg's design is flawless in nearly every aspect, the only regrets being the lack of content. But why should you care about that, when you can throw a sword at someone to force them to block high, roll underneath them while grabbing a sword, then stab them in the back in a series of grand maneuvers that will make you feel like a god among men?

												It is super intense, involves lots of posturing, feinting, chasing, and stabbing. The AI seems to know what it's doing and can offer a consistent challenge (more time to improve may change that) and keep me on my toes. The matchmaking is kinda slow and has problems inviting those on your friends list. The multiplayer is a barrel of laughs and frantic swordfights. The tutorial is buggy and essentially incomplete as well.Kinda pricey for what it ultimately is, but but for the time being I find it worth it, Maybe hold out for a bundle or steam sale if you're on the fence. Definitely if you have someone you can regularly play it wth on the same keyboard.			",252,67,12,47,28,5,59

There wouldn't be much to recommend playing against strangers online though.  I'm not convinced it has enough content on top of that to justify the asking price as it stands ($15), but it's worth considering at anything below $10.  Definitely recommended though, there's a lot of fun to be had here.			",322,123,3,15,12,4,16

Mabey STOP WITH THE ♥♥♥♥ING FLASHING SCREENS, REALLY THEY HURT MY EYES. It would be alot more fun. I also like how they made this more of a fenceing type game. We need more of this game. But really developers. Make the scenery not as hard to see. Alot more slow paced (because I fell like im on drugs when I play this game). And alot more longer. (mabey even make the characthers have more hit points).Now guys dont get me wrong, you guys should really get this game. Its amazing.

												This game is a blast to play!  The singleplayer is fine, but the meat and potatoes of this game is when you're facing a human opponent either online or locally.  The online can use a bit of work because some matches can be pretty laggy.  However, when you do get in to a match and everything works, it really works.  Still, the netcode needs improvement and I hope the fixes for that come sooner rather than later.There's a lot of hidden depth to the gameplay as well.  You have to decide when it's right to let yourself die in order to respawn in front of your opponent before they make it to the next screen.  When is it the right time to make a break for it to get to the next screen?  When you decide to let yourself die in order to respawn as a barrier for your opponent, is there is even enough time for you to respawn in front of them?  Should I hold on to my sword, or should throw it and make a run for it hoping it distracts the opponent? These are some of the thoughts that will constantly be running through your head while playing this game and it's made all the more intense when facing off against a human opponent.I also really dig the old-school Atari 2600-esque look of the game.  The use of colours makes the levels look really nice and I just like the simplicity of it.  The super colourful neon blood is also prety great!The soundtrack to the game is also fantastic!  Each of the 4 levels in the game has a unique song that plays in the background and it makes the one on one battle so much more enjoyable.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a lot of local and online (when it's properly working 100% of the time) MP fun!			",54,24,0,4,2,1,12

												I strongly recommend this game. Even with the people complaining about lag in the forums, I played it with my friend and had no problems at all. And being a huge fencing fan, I think this game is perfect in the format it was made. You really need to approach the fight strategically or you'll get your derrière sistematically handed to you. The game is one hit kill when armed with sword and when disarmed if your opponent strikes you on the ground he'll snap your neck and kill you, but this is just a mean to an end, since your main goal ain't to kill your opponent but to get to the last screen you need to push to be devoured by the mythical serpent Nidhogg, hence the name of the game, and to do that you need to kill you enemy and  move forward through each screen, being lead to a fence-fueled tug of war. And the graphics, soundtrack and sound effects match the game perfectly and until now I didn't experienced any major flaws on the gameplay of the game which is fluid and easy to get the hang. The single-player can be fun enough, but the game really shines in the multiplayer, the local versus can make for a really neat party game. So scrap some cash and buy this gem.

												Wow, well that was short...I was under the impression this game would be a fun and frantic sword-em-up where I run through level upon level fighting similar sword wielding stick-men.Fun? Admittedly yes, and the combat system requires precision and timing. If you fail, it was your fault, but when you succeed, you know you earned it.Swords? Yea, there's a f*ck-ton. I gave it an extra point in the score just for this reasonLevel upon level? Here's where we nosedive... There are four... And they're not long. The 12 or 16 stages that make up the singleplayer shamelessly reuse the levels, making progress repetitive.I'd go on but I'm being given *the stare* for not ironing my shirt. So we'll leave it at this:With completion in just under 2hrs of total play time, and a default cost of £10.99! A worthwhile purchase this game is not. [4.0]			",185,58,1,11,12,0,21

												♥♥♥♥ing awesome for local multiplayer with friends. However, with all the content it has to offer, I cannot recommend it at $15 or whatever the hell the price is in your country. Wait for it to be at least 50% off. Very addicting, fast paced, wacky and fun. Mainly recommended if you actively play with friends or duel it out online.			",276,43,2,14,16,4,13

												This game is absolutely terrible, I got this game to play multiplayer with my friend. The game was just glitchy to begin with in multiplayer, one of the guys (Not us) literally could not jump. You were stuck hopelessly trying to get out of the wall hang- which it would endlessly warp you back to where you were.Do not buy this, simply do not buy this. It is crap.			",44,9,2,2,6,0,3

												Even if the concept is nice, the online multiplayer is asynchron and makes this game unplayable.I played with my friend and he would have to run left and me right AT THE SAME TIME.These programers are rich because of this game and not intelligent enough to fix this bugs or implement a better online multiplayer.But its a Game made with ""GameMaker: Studio"" so I guess this programmers dont even know real programming.

												A truly fun game with very smooth gameplay. There's not much singleplayer content other than fighting a line of swordmen with the difficulty increase per time you defeat the next in the row. The multiplayer seems to have a bit delay for now, other than that it's great fun killing your enemy. Your goal is to get to the right of the level and enter the next screen, while your enemy have to get to the left side of the screen. You are only able to move to the next scene when  you have the GO sign in the opposite corner of yourself, It's a tough process and can take a good amount of time if you're playing against a mighty fencer. There are various ways to kill and disarm your enemy or yourself :3You have 5 different ways to hold your sword, with different range depending on you're trying to target the enemies feet or head. The higher you aim, the longer range. The lower you aim, the shorter range. When holding the sword in the upper position, you'll be able to throw it (also when jumping in midair), hopefully killing your enemy or die trying... When you jump, you're able to strike downward, this is a great ability if you've lost your sword and still want to go offensive on your enemy. You can also roll and kick when approaching the player if his sword is in a high position, else you'll just die horribly by getting stacked in the chest or face. The sound effects makes it quite enjoyable to stick your sword through the chest of someone else and keeping it inside, making it ""bleed""  more and enemy scream even longer is just very satisfying.The different set of levels gives the player a good amount of space to use his different moves and feature lots of movement to make the scenes more alive, the game does have music but it's quite ambient and might not get noticed because of the  screams coming from either you or your enemy..:CONCLUSION:.It's really good fun and plays great, the price point might be a bit high but there's online multiplayer which makes the price acceptable in my opinion. There's not much content for the single-player type and the online multi-player can be slighty laggy at times but based on being very unique, play very smooth and the gameplay have great combat, I would very much recommend this game.

												Nidhogg solely focus on a combat system, combining fencing and tug-of-war together to create a simple yet fun gameplay. There are a lot of options there to create a strategy. You can fight your opponent with rapier or goes unarmed, you can thrust, punch, parry, disarm opponent, throwing weapon, do a sweep attack, and even do a dive kick. Running away also a one good strategy here in Nidhogg for you to consider as the objective is to reach the goal not to defeat the opponent until he/she run out of life.Nidhogg's concept is good and the video that show is even help make it look very interesting.Anyway, one big flaw of Nighogg is a lacks of contents, especially in a lacks of solid single player content. The only thing you will find in a single player mode is a series of 16 AI opponents that not really different in terms of difficulty, pretty much the same. There are only 4 stages in the game as you can see in the video. No unloackable contents pretty much make this game suffer a scarceness of solid contents and no replay value.It is true that the core design of the game is quite interesting. I am able to enjoy a single player mode to some extent but that's that. Once I beat the single player mode I went to try multiplayer mode with someone, unfortunately online matchmaking show that no one playing Nidhogg online and none of my fried owned this game as well.I guess the game could deliver a better experience if you has a friend to play together offline or online but for a gamer who focus on single player experience I recommend you to avoid Nidhogg. Even with a 66% discount for this game is seem a little pricy to me after I bought it.			",48,14,0,8,3,1,4

												It's a bit frustrating trying to learn with no experience, but after a few matches when you start to get it down the game becomes incredibly addictive.

												This game is pure fun! It can't really be described, other than fast paced fencing-martial arts-divekicking-combat - oh yea, and you get eaten by a huge wyrm at the end of every level to top it all off. The combat system is unique, in that there is surprising depth for such a seemly short (and by short, I mean a ton of deaths every level. This game isn't exactly easy) single player game. Developing your own style really feels like you own it, and every time you die, you don't feel cheated. Multiplayer is where this game really shines, and it's really meant to be played against a human opponent, whether someone online or someone sitting beside you. The CPU opponents put up a great fight though, and it's perfect for developing your own style of play before you face off with a friend. The price is slightly high, for what this game is, but if you feel like it's something you might enjoy, I would say possibly wait for a sale if you are strapped for cash. That being said, I do not regret my purchase. To me personally, this game is worth it.			",306,46,2,46,32,5,33

												While it is an enjoyable game with an original playstyle and tight as ♥♥♥♥ controls, I cannot recommend it. The single player is boring with only 4 maps and little variation between opponents, with only a single gamemode. Multiplayer was good fun but the developers managed to ♥♥♥♥ it up somehow in the new update so playing with friends is virtually impossible.Asking £10.99 for this small game is an insult as it only provided some brief entertainment before I became bored and tired of the concept. I understand that this was a kickstarter project so I would rate this game 9/11, because it is suspicous and requires futher investigation.It looks like the devs pocketed all the money and then released small uninspired updates which add no actual content but instead break a fun little game. It's horrendously overpriced and has broken multiplayer.			",44,4,0,5,3,1,9

												I highly reccommend Nidhogg. The single player modes is very short, but the combat is fun when you are challenged. I would suggest buying the two pack so you could play with someone who is similarly skilled. The game itself is about fencing, and the controles are fairly simple, so the game comes down to skill more often than memorization. 10/10			",112,21,0,7,4,2,1

												An absolutely brilliant title that is an essential edition to your Steam library, assuming you have friends. This game is a blast to play with a buddy or a group of friends. It's easy to play and incredibly satisfying to master. The duels you encounter will be well worth the hefty fee for this game, although I do recommend picking it up during a sale. This game is a 1v1 sword fighting game with very simple controls and it also features a built-in tournament mode for eight players making it a great and essential party game. I can almost guarantee that you will not regret this purchase when it is on sale for anything less than the listed $15.			",133,35,0,15,18,1,33

												Half a year on, and the developer doesn't seem to give a damn about supporting this lackluster game.The foundation of Nidhogg is solid. It's a fun little game, with a surprising amount of depth. But with only four levels, AI opponents that are easily circumvented, and an online multiplayer that is tricky to get to work... asking €13,99 for this is absolutely ludicrous. It's the kind of game that's A LOT of fun to play, for an hour. And then you're done with it. You leave it be, hoping that the developer will release some more content for it later on - free or paid. But no, nothing. Not even a tiny little patch with minor fixes.The game IS good, but the fun is extremely shortlived. ONLY BUY THIS GAME if you see it on sale, and only if it is heavily discounted. I'm talking a couple of Euros/Dollars here. THEN, it will be worth it. And only if you buy it with a friend, so you can play together.			",329,55,5,29,30,2,35

												Nidhogg is nice for the first few hours within which you'll probably repeatedly fight the singleplayer AI until you release it's occasionally either far too stupid or far too difficult (it can do things that you simply cannot), at which point you'll probably feel experienced enough to try the multiplayer.It's at this point that the game completely falls apart. The multiplayer is consistently laggy and it always seems to take at least a few minutes to get into a match - if finding a game wasn't arduous enough, attempting to transfer your SP tactics to MP is nigh impossible since you'll find the controls simply aren't responsive enough. Nidhogg absolutely requires you to have quick reactions and MP makes this impossible.The Tournament mode is useless without at least two other experienced players able to use your computer (since it's local MP) and if you were looking to practice against the AI then enjoy having to play through the entire game just to get to a point you feel is difficult enough because you can't skip levels.Oh, and the super bright cloud level is absolutely horrible to look at, I personally can barely see anything. I wonder how exactly the development time on this game was spent when there are such obvious flaws (why would you choose a bright background when the player is bright yellow and the sword is white?)I do honestly like the gameplay but I can't in all good conscience recommend this game to anyone looking for a competitive multiplayer experience. Some cool stuff can happen but on average, Nidhogg will leave you simultaneously annoyed but wanting to play more since it could get better.			",169,23,4,9,20,1,22

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.

												First impressions: Easy to get into, good tunes, fun to play with friends (local VS play). Played the waifu and also some dudes at work. There were some good laughs.Online play: There are some really good players out there. Good times. Played several people online who were complaining about experiencing a lot of lag. Seemed okay to me most of the time. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. EDIT: booted me out mid-game with some find of CTD error. Maybe that's what's been happening with some people I've been playing (they'll unexpectedly quit the game)I'd like to see more maps - 4 is kinda spare. They're decent, though.I think $12 is asking a lot for this game, but hey, stop eating at McD's a few times and pack a freaking salad and a sandwich and you just earned that $12 back. Oh, and make your own coffee for a week so you can buy another game.EDIT 2: It's $5 on the Steam summer sale. $5 is about right, but look at how many hours I've played - 4h or so. Maybe I'll get back into it if the online play was ever fixed or if there is a more open version where people can make their own maps. Lots of games out there that have compelling 1v1 action, and this one is okay.			",102,21,2,8,14,1,16

												Part Super Smash Bros, part Divekick, part ""I'm-totally-gonna-cleave-your♥♥♥♥♥quot; Simulator 2016. Nidhogg was one of those unfortunate indie games, that went under the radar in my case until my good old friend RTRIX insisted he'd buy me this game as a gift. Reluctantly, I accepted his gift, and quickly got surprised of the game's competetive feel, smooth fighting mechanics and the sheer fun. However, do be mindful of the lag, stuttering and the input lag when joining an online game with your friend. That said, this game also has offline multiplayer, much to some people's chagrin of playing local multiplayer - on a PC/Mac. With a price tag of 3€ on sale - not 13€, seeing the small amount of content present in the game - Nidhogg is worth a try. Oh, and do play this game on a soundproof room: you'll be cussing a lot, especially when playing with your friends ;)			",86,5,3,4,3,0,4

												This game is great when you have guests or friends coming over, although this game is a game you don't play everyday, it's a good game to keep especially when guests come over. You can even make your own custom tournaments (not literally) such as when five people are at your house you just pretend to make a branch. Fun game but just a type you wouldn't play a lot.

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.

The game is difficult to master, and the game is still buggy following it's Steam Release. However, you won't regret the time spent, as dueling with Ai and friends alike is immensly fun.

												I learned about Nidhogg after I played a game based off of Nidhogg, back when Nidhogg wasn't even released yet. The game was called Eggnogg, and it was said to be the closest thing to what Nidhogg was probably going to be. At the time, people couldn't get enough of what they saw of Nidhogg, and they really couldn't wait for it to finally come out, so much so that they would start making games based of it.When Nidhogg was finally released, I had already forgotten about it, having had my fill of copies and games based off of the copies.I did remember this game again, eventually. I won it in a giveaway, and now here I am. The game fulfills a lot of promises, for me. And I jump and stab my way through the stages, listening to engaging music, shouting at my opponent in anger and glee. It's all around fun that I'm sure I'll get every time I load the game.Get Nidhogg, play it with your friends, stab someone in the face, and sacrifice yourself to the great dragon while having lots of fun. I know I am.10/10			",322,102,11,40,26,3,25

												First impressions: Easy to get into, good tunes, fun to play with friends (local VS play). Played the waifu and also some dudes at work. There were some good laughs.Online play: There are some really good players out there. Good times. Played several people online who were complaining about experiencing a lot of lag. Seemed okay to me most of the time. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. EDIT: booted me out mid-game with some find of CTD error. Maybe that's what's been happening with some people I've been playing (they'll unexpectedly quit the game)I'd like to see more maps - 4 is kinda spare. They're decent, though.I think $12 is asking a lot for this game, but hey, stop eating at McD's a few times and pack a freaking salad and a sandwich and you just earned that $12 back. Oh, and make your own coffee for a week so you can buy another game.EDIT 2: It's $5 on the Steam summer sale. $5 is about right, but look at how many hours I've played - 4h or so. Maybe I'll get back into it if the online play was ever fixed or if there is a more open version where people can make their own maps. Lots of games out there that have compelling 1v1 action, and this one is okay.			",102,21,2,8,14,1,16

												For an indie game that has been on the radar for so long, sweeping up critical praise for years, there was a lot of expectation for this oddly titled game and it has delivered. Nidhogg has that quality that seems lost in most 3D AAA titles, and is becoming rarer even amongst 2D indie games. It gives you memories of titles as diverse as Flashback and the first Prince of Persia game, whilst the competitive play is on a par with classics such as Mario Kart, Unirally and Super Smash Brothers. I fear how many hours I could lose to the acid enduced lucid dream of a game and for that alone I must place it on the highest of pedestals along with the likes of only Speedrunners. This game justifies the price tag - Period. The animations are faultless, the levels well designed and engaging. The screenshots and video do not do this title justice. It needs playing.The only critique is a few spots of lag during online play, but the mode is still very playable and competitive.   ",161,19,7,10,12,0,7

												It's a fighting game, but not really: there are no ""super"" moves, power bars, or frame timings; just run, jump, and stab. It's easy to pick up and play, and within a few minutes you'll feel like you're accomplishing the most amazing series of maneuvers. There's no need to log 300 hrs of practice to get ""good"" here.I love the simplicity of it: movement, 5 ""stances"" (overhead, high, mid, low, crouch), a jump button, and an action button. That's it. Using combinations of those controls, you have access to a surprising variety of moves that help you push past a constantly respawning opponent, only to celebrate your victory by jumping into Níðhöggr's waiting maw.The one downside, though, is the price. $15 is crazy. $10 would've been MUCH better. I hope they continue to develop levels/content for this to help justify the price.There's a damn good reason this won so many IGF awards, and I'm glad it finally made it to a full release version. Thanks to the option to hold tournaments of up to 8 players, I can see this being an awesome party game, but hopefully they can flesh out the online multiplayer, as well as add more content, to keep people playing even after the party's over.

												One of the best 1 vs 1 games ever made, no doubt about it. It may look simple and the controls are simple as well, but the fighting is very complex. It's essentially a mix between rugby/american football and sword fighting. It starts with a duel, and whoever wins immediately gets to run in one direction, while the other keeps spawning in their way in order to kill them. If the defender kills him, he instantly becomes offense and gets to go in his direction, and the first person to their end wins, and is eaten by a dragon.Fast paced, swords, football, dragons. tenouttaten.

tl;dr -> If you ever wanted to stab your friends in the face while avoiding jail time, get this game and invite them over. 11/10 awesome fencing simulator.I got this game when it was a Steam Daily Sale, and was very happy with my purchase. A fantastic party game to play with friends, both online and locally.If you like 1 versus 1 gameplay, fencing, and fast-paced action, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very simple, but still good - the blood leakage effect whenever someone dies can result in the battlefield being painted in a variety of colors. The music and sounds are decent, but I prefer to play my own to add to the intensity of the combat. Controls are very simple, but mastering the combat system may take some practice. There is a quick tutorial that will help you learn everything you need to know. The learning curve is minimal - the most difficult thing being training yourself and your reflexes/reaction time. I've tried using both a controller and the keyboard, and either works perfectly - I personally prefer a controller.The gameplay is fast and relentless - your goal is to reach the opposite end of the map, while also preventing your opponent from doing the same. There are a series of areas to pass (the map is mirrored) before the ""final area,"" and if you pass this area you will continue on to the winners section. You can lunge with your sword or punch/divekick if you are unarmed. Throwing your sword is risky, but may be fruitful in the right situation. You can pick up any dropped sword, and an area may have plenty of swords (and blood) on the ground if you and your opponent are rapidly killing each other. You can do tricks like disarming your opponent by hovering up or down on their sword, and you can also sweep their legs to drop them to the ground. The ""right of way"" arrow shows who can continue down the map, and this is provided to whoever has achieved the latest kill. There are situations where both players can die - mostly falling to your death - and the right of way will be reset to no one. An interesting concept - and advantage - of having the right of way is that you don't necessarily have to kill your opponent each time. Instead, you can also try to dodge them and just keep running down the map. To counter this, you need to run in the opposite direction in order to spawn in front of the person with the right of way. There is a singleplayer mode that is fairly challenging, as well as a tournament mode (or just straight up versus, both online and local). Overall, the game is a fantastic party game that is very easy to learn and begin playing. Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",250,87,0,51,38,2,49

												Nidhogg, where do I start. Not much content, graphics simple yet fitting, laggy multiplayer, a seemingly boring soundtrack, and pretty decent combat. Fifteen dollars is not worth the lack of content this game provides, unless you have friends who live in your house, as tournaments are only local. The lack of maps is another downside to this game, but can be overlooked, as the maps included do have noticable differences. Swordplay is interesting, and takes some work to master. Matchmaking turns out to be horrendous unless you have friends to play with, as the matchmaking takes ten minutes to find a match, but when you do it is enjoyable. The gameplay provided is minimal, but what is provided is enjoyable. Overall, this title is not one for those who don't wish to put the work in to learn to master the excellent swordplay presented to them, but fifteen dollars is too much, this game is worth five or less.If however you do decide to purchase this game, watch the first duel in this video, as it shows all the tricks needed to suceed in Nidhogg-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWMlU8eKOsg ",182,20,1,15,22,2,17

You can block, parry, stab, drop, spin, twirl,  lunge, even throw your dang sword at your opponent. The only downside to this is you realize you would be helpless in a real sword fight.10/10 Would cry againP.S. The ending to each level is terrifying. I nearly cried the first time I saw it.

												The game that my girlfriend and I are evenly matched in. The butt clenching is real and the button mashing can be evident. Nidhogg is one of those games that remind you of classical combat games in an arcade, it is one of the best indie platformer sword fighting games on the market at this price point. Saying that I think it is the only indie platformer sword fighting game around this price point.			",28,5,11,1,9,0,0

												The game is great fun, Especially with a friend, However, On my first time playing, I completed the whole single player campaign with only losing once, The game is WAY too easy. Also, Only 4 levels??? I payed 12 bloody pounds for this game, This is the sort of game you download for free off of GameJolt or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its fun, But there are too many downers to this game that holds me back from reccomending it. Also, i was expecting an epic final boss of some kind. Because on images of the game, they are fighting on top of a huge shaking platform. That never happens in the whole game. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.

												Incredibly fun, fast-paced, fencing duels galore. The visuals and music are great and the gameplay, although simple to learn, is challenging to master. Not to mention hilarious with a group of friends. Nothing makes you feel more badass than timing a sword throw to the face or stabbing your foe in the chest and twisting it back and forth as you revel in victory.Now that I have said that, probably the biggest problem with this game would have to be the incredibly steep price tag. I bought it when it was about $11 and I regret it for even that price. There are TONS of games that are much cheaper and have waaaay more replayability. There is absolutely nothing justifying its ridiculous price. There are only 3 stages (or 4 I can't quite remember at the moment), a laughable tacked-on single player mode, and barely working multiplayer. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun, it's just not worth 15 freaking bucks. There isn't nearly enough content to warrant a 15 dollar price tag (or even $11 for that matter). Whoever decided that must have been on drugs. The game as it is should be priced at around 5-6 bucks. If it was around that price I would recommend everyone to get it. For the time being I honestly feel pretty cheated out of my money. If it was cheaper the devs would make more money for it in the end, I am almost positive everyone on my friends list would have bought it. Not to mention the multiplayer would have more value since there would be more people to fight. Also it only supports 360 controllers which sucks.			",425,73,10,56,34,5,40

												Nidhogg is absurdly fun.  The combat is similar to Divekick with its simple controls and surprising amount of depth in combat.  Once you kill your opponent you'll only have a few seconds to get as far as you can before you respawn.  Then you must decide if you're gonna take down your opponent again or try to run past him and go for the goal Randy Moss style.Nidhogg is not without its issues though.  There's nothing for PC specific options aside from volume sliders and the online play has a few issues which could potentially be a dealbreaker.Creating a lobby at first was an exercise in frustration.  The invite friends list is not alphabatized which isn't a huge deal if you don't have many Steam friends, but I have 200+ and it added extra time to what should be a simple process.  Once you invite someone the other person doesn't get a Steam notification, they have to hit ""Join Game"" from Steam friends.  There's no indication that you have to do this either.  Once you have this all figured out it works, but come on.  These are basic menu functions in any online game.In the games I played with my friend the host had a huge advantage because of latency, we had to swap hosting every few rounds to make it fair.  If you can play locally then you won't have to deal with this.  It's a perfect couch game if you are thinking of a Steambox solution.Despite my complaints about the game I've really enjoyed it so far, though with the issues I've mentioned above it's a little hard to recommend at full price.  Buy it on sale for sure.TL;DR version:  Buy if you have a friend to play with and can deal with a few online issues.EDIT1/14/2014 - The invite system works with Steam properly now, but the friends list in game is still not in alphabetical order.

												Nidhogg is a very simplistic representation of fencing where the goal is to reach the opponent's start point and get eaten by some giant creature presumably called the Nidhogg. The gameplay has a bit of a tug-of-war feel to it as dead players respawn a bit further back from where they were slain meaning you have to continuously battle all the way to the end without failing to win. Combat consists of moving your blade up/down, thrusting, rolling, throwing the blade, and jump kicks, combinations of which can be used to confuse and disable your opponent, setting them up for the kill. Once you kill an opponent, you gain the right of way and place him on the defensive, meaning that if you were to jump over him and continue towards his start, he would have to pursue you or allow himself to be scrolled off and respawn in front of you.Due to the overall simplicity of the game and small number of levels, it seems to suit itself more towards multiplayer than single player which is unfortunate because the multiplayer can get downright unplayable due to latency causing your inputs to get ignored or delayed. Additionally the controls can be awkward when shifting between stances not to mention you risk throwing your sword when shifting to stab high from a mid-stance. I originally had a bit more positive of a review for this game but after re-playing it I decided to drop my recommendation since the content is really lacking and not worth the base price (or really even the sale price).

												It might look like hot garbage, or art, depending on where you fall in terms of visual preference. It might be stupidly simple, or elegantly uncomplex, depending on how you feel about the gameplay. It might be the greatest fighting game ever made, or an overpriced hipster art project, depending on if you like the damn thing or not. In development since 2011, this side-scrolling two-player fighting game where you duel with swords, kicks, runs, jumps and fistfights has been turning heads. Either towards it, attracted to the bright Atari-style low-fi graphics and immediately comprehensible combat, or away from it in disgust because… reasons. It’s an incredible fast paced game when both players (or the player vs A.I.) are reckless. Pixel blood flows down the walls as each fighter tries to get past the other. If you make it, you move to the next screen and your opponent is placed in front of you once more. It’s a tug of war, in a sense. The victor not decided by who kills who the most, but by whichever side reaches their goal first: a giant flying worm on either end of the level. If you can get eaten by the Nidhogg, you have proven your prowess in combat.But it can also be a slow, methodical and beautiful game of lethal Chess.			",227,35,9,25,26,1,33

												Nidhogg is absurdly fun.  The combat is similar to Divekick with its simple controls and surprising amount of depth in combat.  Once you kill your opponent you'll only have a few seconds to get as far as you can before you respawn.  Then you must decide if you're gonna take down your opponent again or try to run past him and go for the goal Randy Moss style.Nidhogg is not without its issues though.  There's nothing for PC specific options aside from volume sliders and the online play has a few issues which could potentially be a dealbreaker.Creating a lobby at first was an exercise in frustration.  The invite friends list is not alphabatized which isn't a huge deal if you don't have many Steam friends, but I have 200+ and it added extra time to what should be a simple process.  Once you invite someone the other person doesn't get a Steam notification, they have to hit ""Join Game"" from Steam friends.  There's no indication that you have to do this either.  Once you have this all figured out it works, but come on.  These are basic menu functions in any online game.In the games I played with my friend the host had a huge advantage because of latency, we had to swap hosting every few rounds to make it fair.  If you can play locally then you won't have to deal with this.  It's a perfect couch game if you are thinking of a Steambox solution.Despite my complaints about the game I've really enjoyed it so far, though with the issues I've mentioned above it's a little hard to recommend at full price.  Buy it on sale for sure.TL;DR version:  Buy if you have a friend to play with and can deal with a few online issues.EDIT1/14/2014 - The invite system works with Steam properly now, but the friends list in game is still not in alphabetical order.

												Recieved Nidhogg as a gift on steam from my boyfriend when he purchased the 2 pack in the steam sale. Good game, fun andf I like it but I find it unplayable. It lags so so so badly and I had no idea where I was or where he was or who was alive or anytrhing so terrible. We have the virgin media 200Mb gamer package and over LAN it was so bad I just gave up on the third game. Dissapointing			",84,28,4,11,11,0,7

												Be warned: very iffy netcode! The possiblity of you and an online friend having a lagless game is very low.It has already been said  that the game is very short for the price it's going, but I'm still recommending Nidhogg, in local multiplayer.The beauty of Nidhogg lies in its comical gameplay. Everything is very stabby-runaway-spawn-around-the-corner franticness, which benefits this game massively. So if all of this:-Throwing a sword in the back of the head of your fleeing foe.-Losing your sword but gaining the advantage by a combo salto-kick. -Snapping your foe's neck after you've tripped him.-Earning the right of being eaten by the almighty Nidhogg and thus showing the world that you're a worthy meal. sounds like fun to you, you should probably get this game.

												PRAISE THE NIDHOGG! Nidhogg takes the modern day overly complicated fighting genre and flips it the middle finger complimented by poor(puposely), yet perfect graphics. This basic stickman sword fighter simplifies everything down to only two buttons(not counting movement of course)yet has more tention and requires more focus than most modern day fighters. There's no health bar so if you ever get stabbed you're done until you spawn back in allowing the opponent to capitilize on the positioning. This makes the game into a masterfully made tug of war accompanied by great sounds with the ultiimate goal of getting eaten by our lord and savior, the Nidhogg. ALL HAIL THE NIDHOGG.

												A very good game with pretty simple, yet very compelling and complex, mechanics. You use few buttons, but it is hard to master it. The game works pretty well and everything makes sense. Nothing, here, will feel really unfair.You can have a good time with friends, offline or online, and may even like to play a bit in the singleplayer mode (although it is too simple and not that fun). But, I can't really recommend this gameThe reason is that this game, for some reason, has almost no online player playing it and it is almost impossible to find a random person online to play in the matchmaking. I don't know if this is a problem of the game, or what, but it is a problem. For those that don't have too many friends to play with, this game will fall shortly of things to do. And, also, for a considerably high price. But go for it, if you want just to play with friends.			",1078,435,19,150,102,11,152

												I personally loved this game, it encompasses so much that I use to love as a child all in one package.The game plays like a mix between Marshmellow Duels (an old DOS based Super smash Brlos styled game) and Prince of Persia Classic (I doubt this needs exaplining)The game might look simple and to be honest it is and it isn't. The amazing thing about this game is when you play as a noob with another noob you can pretty much have fun screwing up togther. If you are both hardcore u can stay minutes on one level, and feel your adrenaline rush.Now if you play as a noob against a good player expect the match to be over ina  matter of seconds in some cases. The game is simple but it's also very skill friendly, so if your good > bad players and luck plays very little here.There are only a hand full of levels but you will want to keep playing them over and over again. The online and local multiplayer is where the game shines. It turns this great game into a fantastic game. You will only play with Ai when you have no internet or people over, other than that you will never want to vs ai again.9.0/10 at full price9.5/10 on saleThe reason for different scores is because the game is fairly expensive for what it offers, but the mechanics are so clean and simple that it can make up for it even at full price for some.If your not a fan of retro or fencing styled games (ninja fencing in this case) don't bother with this game. It's graphics are charming to those that can appreciate them, and the game play to those that love the genre:)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nidhogg is a down right brutal fighting game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. There are only a few moves you can do, but this means it's less of a button smash than the likes of Street Fighter. It also means that it can be anybody's game, and many times matches will go for minutes on end because there are so many comebacks.The presentation is very slick. The fighters and their animations stand out well enough to keep the focus on the action, but the backgrounds can be as pretty as ever, even though they are largely simple. The music is brilliantly fitted to every stage, so it's all wrapped up with a neat little bow.The singleplayer will take anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour to complete, but the real heart of this game is in the multiplayer. The store page cites a lot of issues with online multiplayer, yet I haven't had any issues outside of one match where there was some lag. Either way you owe it to yourself to play this with local multiplayer instead, to see the reactions of your opponents.It's more worth $10 in my opinion, but if you can find this on a sale, there's no doubt that you should pick it up.

												PRAISE THE NIDHOGG! Nidhogg takes the modern day overly complicated fighting genre and flips it the middle finger complimented by poor(puposely), yet perfect graphics. This basic stickman sword fighter simplifies everything down to only two buttons(not counting movement of course)yet has more tention and requires more focus than most modern day fighters. There's no health bar so if you ever get stabbed you're done until you spawn back in allowing the opponent to capitilize on the positioning. This makes the game into a masterfully made tug of war accompanied by great sounds with the ultiimate goal of getting eaten by our lord and savior, the Nidhogg. ALL HAIL THE NIDHOGG.

												Be warned: very iffy netcode! The possiblity of you and an online friend having a lagless game is very low.It has already been said  that the game is very short for the price it's going, but I'm still recommending Nidhogg, in local multiplayer.The beauty of Nidhogg lies in its comical gameplay. Everything is very stabby-runaway-spawn-around-the-corner franticness, which benefits this game massively. So if all of this:-Throwing a sword in the back of the head of your fleeing foe.-Losing your sword but gaining the advantage by a combo salto-kick. -Snapping your foe's neck after you've tripped him.-Earning the right of being eaten by the almighty Nidhogg and thus showing the world that you're a worthy meal. sounds like fun to you, you should probably get this game.

												When I first got this game, I played it and realized me and my friend had immense ping lag. So we couldn't play. My computer is crap, so even in windowed mode it still kind of lags, but that's my pc's fault, not the games. Anyway, after playing it for a while, I've fallen in love with this game. It's gameplay is tense, and can be extremely fast paced, or slow and strategic. Sometimes you just trash people, and are able to get eaten in half a minute or so. Or their are those matches that are slow, and you have to plan, parry, and use every skill available to you to complete it. It's one of the funnest games I've ever played, and I definitly reccomend.			",51,4,0,9,6,0,2

												Contrary to it's 87% approval rating, this game is garbage.There is almost no content.

												Fun game, it is a very fast pace capture the flag sort of game. There is a major con however, it does not have support for directinput it seems and based on that alone I will not recommend this game. If I am going to play a game with friends then I do not want to be hacking around just to set it up to play.A game like this should be plug and play simple. The devs need to update it to support all controllers, not just partial support for xinput.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game with online multiplayer in mind. The game's online multiplayer is insanely broken. I tested it with two of my buds and I was the one invited both times. Each time they said it ran fine while I was struggling to even thrust the sword or even make a simple ♥♥♥♥ing jump. If you don't plan on playing multiplayer, then feel free to download it, otherwise, it really isn't worth the buy.EDITI recently picked it back up after hearing of the patch for online play. As far as I could tell, the patch was a complete success. I could play it completely fine and there was no trouble for either end. The reason I still don't reccommend this game is simple because of the price. The game has many mechanics that I can't even begin to wrap my head around, but I still feel $15 is way too much for what it is. I'm not trying to make little of the game itself, but I personally think I could find a game that would last longer for less than the price of this game.			",72,9,0,12,1,0,0

												Fun game, it is a very fast pace capture the flag sort of game. There is a major con however, it does not have support for directinput it seems and based on that alone I will not recommend this game. If I am going to play a game with friends then I do not want to be hacking around just to set it up to play.A game like this should be plug and play simple. The devs need to update it to support all controllers, not just partial support for xinput.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome, don't get me wrong. To make your friends rage in a local battle is simply amazing but overall, I don't recommend this game. Internet multiplayer is dead, I could not caught a single person to play with. The content is very minimal, featuring only four maps and singleplayer gets boring really quickly. I bought Nidhogg on sale for a very low price (aprox. two euros) and I don't feel like I got my moneys worth. So don't even think on buying this game for its full price. If you want to have some fun play sessions with your friends, I would recommend it for a low price during sales. But no more than that.

												I bought this game with online multiplayer in mind. The game's online multiplayer is insanely broken. I tested it with two of my buds and I was the one invited both times. Each time they said it ran fine while I was struggling to even thrust the sword or even make a simple ♥♥♥♥ing jump. If you don't plan on playing multiplayer, then feel free to download it, otherwise, it really isn't worth the buy.EDITI recently picked it back up after hearing of the patch for online play. As far as I could tell, the patch was a complete success. I could play it completely fine and there was no trouble for either end. The reason I still don't reccommend this game is simple because of the price. The game has many mechanics that I can't even begin to wrap my head around, but I still feel $15 is way too much for what it is. I'm not trying to make little of the game itself, but I personally think I could find a game that would last longer for less than the price of this game.			",72,9,0,12,1,0,0

												Nidhogg is perfect example that fighting games can offer more variety than what most of its competition would lead to believe.The game is ultimately a game of tag with the objective being to run to your goal. You become ""it"" when you defeat your opponent or they suicide. Whenever you die or trail off-screen, you will generally respawn in your opponent's path a few moments later. When you spawn, you are given a fencing sword to use in combat with the other player, but you can also fight unarmed if you throw your sword or you can also pick-up a sword dropped earlier on that section of the stage map. There is a decent variety of options that are simplistic in execution but add a lot of depth to the game, especially when used in conjunction with the terrain of the stage.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys versus multiplayer games, not just fans of the fighting game genre.

												This game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥It's a fast-paced two-player dueling game. You can fence madly, cartwheel away, throw your rapier, somersault through the air, snatch a rapier off the ground and skewer your opponent through the guts, you can rush unarmed at your opponent only to roll beneath his drawn rapier at the last moment, trip him with  a sweep of the leg, tear his heart out, grab his rapier and keep running. You can pull off all kinds of insane stunts, and I can't help but laugh every time. This gameplay is accompanied by an equally frenzied soundtrack and trippy neon graphics. The great art direction and style of this game is undeniable.Multiplayer is online and local, and there is also a singleplayer mode where you fight a computer opponent. It's not as fun as desperately outsmarting a human opponent. The online multiplayer introduces a ton of lag and causes many maneuvers to be impossible to pull off. That said, I've been mainly playing online opponents (haven't had the chance to play local yet), and it's been some of the most exhilarating multiplayer gameplay I've experienced, despite the lag.There aren't many games where you can do a somersault, but this is one of them. It feels great.On the downside, there are only 4 stages. What you'll get out of this game will depend on how much you put into it and on the people you play against. Best suited for playing with friends, two controllers and a tv.			",127,26,0,19,12,0,7

												What looks like a fast-paced tactical fun bit of fencing, is a stressful torturous sequence with poorly laid out rules, and no victory or defeat passing without ""That was Bull****!"" from your opponent.The psychadelic backgrounds in certain stages work far too well at being disorientating, as the game becomes physically painful to play, bringing on headaches and RSI after bare minutes of playing.

												I don't know what ""Messhof"" was smoking when he deployed this game. You can't charge 15 bucks for a game with 2 HOURS OF CONTENT.I can say nothing bad about the gameplay in Nidhogg. It's solid. It's tight. If you're a fighter-nut, you'll probably like this game. But to hell with gameplay. For this price, it doesn't matter how good or fun your game is: if it only lasts me an hour or two, the game is a rip-off. That's what Nidhogg is. A big, fat, Mexican-style rip-off. I can't get my money back, but hopefully I can convince some other person who is dumb like me not to buy this turd-nugget.The game's main selling point is the multiplayer. If you don't have friends to play with locally, you can't play it, because the matchmaking can never find anyone and even if it does, online matches are super laggy.Don't buy this game. I swear, the nerve of some game developers nowadays...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While stabbing your friends in over 40 different ways is a complete blast, the amount of content in this game is severely lacking!

												Judging from the videos (and user reviews) I thought that this could be a very fun game for vs matches with people. That's why I decided to support the developers (even though the price seemed a bit high). The problem here is that first and foremost I bought having in my mind that this game will provide a very fun experience in online multiplayer, trying to beat someone in one-on-one fights. I'm certain that if it worked it would be extremely fun. But that's a BIG if.In the description of the game it says that it supports online matches, and this is the main (if not the only) reason that I bought the game. The severe lag in every single match makes this game practically unplayable in the online environment. It's worth also mentioning that the single player mode can be finished in less than half hour and certainly isn't a mode worthy of the price tag.Because of the broken online multiplayer mode I feel ripped off by this game, considering that I payed 12 euros mainly for a feature advertised that isn't working.

												Bah. I want to like Nidhogg, but the arbitrariness of the outcome of the fencing leaves me frequently frustrated. Sometimes you can disarm an opponent and run him right through, only to find the kill doesn't register. The AI is particularly dangerous when disarmed - it will almost always respond with a lightning-quick head-kick, then steal your epee and skewer you with it, all in the split second after you've sent his own weapon spinning!I'm also puzzled by what governs the respawning time - sometimes opponents will return almost immediately, while at other times there's a long wait.Since this core duelling element is really all there is to the game, you'd think it would be much, much tighter. For £10, I was expecting either a lot more variation or a simple mechanic honed to perfection, but you don't really get either.			",105,31,0,1,0,0,2

												Having played a bit of the single-player I can honestly say this game is not for me. I heard it's all about the multiplayer, but I haven't tried it yet and I don't think I'll ever will. The single player portion is just so frustratingly boring that it couldn't hold my attention for even 30 minutes. The art style is nice and the game is nicely animated, but if you're mostly a solo gamer (like me) don't buy this. If you play multiplayer too, then by all means give it a try.[Rating: 65/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This game has a lot of potential.It's a fun and frantic dueling game with simple pixel graphics. The game is a lot of fun when played with others wether online or  locally. There are some glaring problems though. It's controller support is lacking as I can only get my wired X360 controller to work which just won't cut it for such a precise game. Using the keyboard makes the game impossible as it requires faster input then a keyboard can offer. Unless you pay for a non-ghosting keyboard which is expensive then you'll lose every battle. The perfect controller for this game is a USB NES controller which for some reason isn't supported at all.This game has been in development for like 4 years and it's not like it's very advanced or deep. Knowing this and seeing low quality graphics, the lack of digital controller support and bugs all over the place I can not recommend this game at $15 or even at it's sale price. It just seems lazy and unfinished. I was hoping for a much better experience then I recieved. Spend that $15 on something else.			",422,166,5,62,26,3,34

												Buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Literally every time I have tried to play it (about 9 tries, spread across two days), a different bug has rendered the game unplayable: I might not be able to attack, for example. Or the game might suffer incredible slowdown, to the point that it resembles QWOP. Or I might be unable to pause. Or unable to stop running to the left. I have continued trying, closing then reopening the game several times for a few hours at a time, and while there are a few stretches where it plays well and I could recommend it, it just isn't worth the hair-pulling. Until or unless it recieves a patch, I would warn anyone considering buying Nidhogg that there are better ways to spend your money.			",92,12,1,15,1,1,14

In Nidhogg you play as a yellow fencer guy who tries to be the fencer which means to defeat the toughest enemies. So how is this game ? Its actually quite fun and i would suggest everyone to buy it. Now for the good things. Graphiclly the game looks great and its a blast to play. It also has a great soundtrack and plus its a challenge to play because every level you play gets harder as you go. Now for the bad things. The game is incredibly short you can beat it in half hour. Now for the price its going for that feels like a rip off. Many of the levels repeat themselfs as you go on. Theres only 4 arenas and all of them repeat which is bad since the game is short as it is. Theres also a Multiplayer feature which is pretty fun. Overall the game isnt worth it at full price and only worth it if you get it on sale. I give Nidhogg a 7/10			",905,350,32,94,59,7,85

Now for the bad things. The game is incredibly short you can beat it in half hour. Now for the price its going for that feels like a rip off. Many of the levels repeat themselfs as you go on. Theres only 4 arenas and all of them repeat which is bad since the game is short as it is. Theres also a Multiplayer feature which is pretty fun. Overall the game isnt worth it at full price and only worth it if you get it on sale. I give Nidhogg a 7/10			",905,350,32,94,59,7,85

												The game's polished as could be hoped for, and is reasonably good detecting hits (in local games) and giving a variety of environments to fight in (doors, tall grass, clouds, etc). It's different, for sure. And if you're more into playing something new rather than playing something that you'd like to love forever, Nidhogg is the game for you, and I recommend it.Unfortunately for anyone who wants to be competitive, or has played games for more than a few years, the achilles heel of Nidhogg is its controls. They're sloppy. It's very difficult to translate your decisions into game actions, and generally leads to both players in the game twisting their faces and going ""what? Why is it doing that? That's not what I'm doing. Are you seeing this?""In Nidhogg, there are only six buttons. left/right/up/down, jump, and lunge. Left/right and jump/lunge are pretty straightforward - they only do one action apiece. They move you left/right, or they jump or lunge you. No ambiguity. However, up/down are extremely overloaded. They toggle the state of your guard (low, mid, high) as well as allow you to throw your sword (up + lunge), *and* allow you to crouch (down, but only from a low guard), *and* roll (down, but only while sprinting). The problem with this is it leads to needing to combine too many identical keys for totally different actions. You'll find that the game decides you wanted to throw your sword, even though you only tapped up to go to a high guard to lunge at your opponent. Or it will dutifully force you into a crouch when you just wanted to go between low guard and midguard. There doesn't seem to be event queueing, so while you wait for one animation to finish, any further input is discarded. This means that if you're trying to rapidly go between high and mid guards, more often than not you'll press the keys *too fast* and get stuck between a high guard and the ""throwing stance"". Don't believe me? Make a macro and try going between guards to quickly.It's an intentional design, but it seems wrongheaded. A better system would have been to have a button dedicated to throwing the sword, a button specific to crouching, and allow modifier keys to go between guards. e.g., right trigger moves you into a high guard, left trigger to a low guard, and if neither are held down, then you're in a midguard. Throwing would be a separate key, and crouching could be opposite the jump key. With this setup, every decision you make can be unambiguously done with two keys, tops.Even if the designers wanted the default behavior to be limiting and sloppy, they could have at least given more thought to the keybindings - to at least give players the *option* of having the sort of system i mentioned above. The controls are so crusted together than you can't even bind mouse buttons to game actions. Aren't we on PCs? Isn't part of the point of PC to have customization and playstyle adjustments?If you're determined to like the game, you can always get used to the controls and hope they don't bite you too often. I'm sure that with ten or fifteen hours, anyone could get used to the game's quirks. But ask yourself if you really want to go through that.			",214,33,1,23,31,1,18

												Literally unplayable online. The problem is most likely on my end, but I get 500 ms ping and 500 ms input delay when I try matchmaking.But that's fine, I mean, that's the LEAST of netcode related issues for me. Get this: I don't know if it's latency related, my computer's net name related, my connection type related, the DNS server I'm using or whatever, BUT MY FPS DROPS TO LITERAL SLIDESHOW LEVEL IN MULTIPLAYER. And I mean SLIDESHOW, like 3 freaking frames a second.Barely anybody is trying to play online, so I guess I'm not the only one having this issue.What the hell, dude? I knew netcode is absolute garbage in this game, but then I heard an update fixed it somewhat. How bad it must have been to begin with if THIS is the ""fixed"" netcode? I cannot even begin to imagine.PC gaming wiki doesn't tell me how to fix this problem, and it's not in the FAQ on steam forums. Probably won't refund it on an off chance I'll play this locally one day, got it dirt cheap anyway. Game's reasonably fun even against AI opponents, who get stupidly hard after you cycle through 4 maps this game has.And another funny thing happened: I bought 2 copies of this game, and offered it to 5 of my steam friends who were online at that moment. Nobody wanted to accept it. Steam users? Declining free games? I wonder why that is.TL;DR: great game in here somewhere, brilliant idea killed in its infancy by the ♥♥♥♥♥iest netcode known to man. If you're not a friendless loser like myself you've probably played this do death in local versus mode already.			",38,2,1,0,0,0,2

												It's good for a cheap laugh.  Thing is, it's $15.  I've spent an hour at it, and...frankly, that's about all the time I can see myself spending with it, having ""beat the single-player game"", unless perhaps I decide to sit down with company and have a quick game.  It's about as basic as a game can get.  It'd be great if it was $5 or under.  That, I could understand.  But unless this person was hunt-and-pecking the code or something, I can't see this warranting the $15 price tag.  If this goes on sale, pick it up, it's a good laugh.  If it's full price?  Unless you've really got money to burn OR you entertain company a lot(I don't), I don't think I'd do it.			",89,16,2,23,20,1,17

												The game is very stale, gets boring quickly, they'res only one way to play the game, if you want to win. The skill ceiling is extremly low, after about thirty minutes I already could beat people with 50 or more hours. It's a very simple game that blew up for whatever reason and definatly not worth ten dallors, even five would be pushing it.			",87,7,1,7,22,1,25

												frantic, accurate, tense. The three words that first pop into my mind when I think of the heart-pounding matches I've played in Nidhogg. Play with your overly competitive neighbor for best results. Watch as the boundaries of society melt away after only two short matches! Yelling! Incomprehensible guttural sounds! Flying controllers! Nidhogg is a competitive 2D sidescrolling fencing game. With four levels to choose from, players compete to reach the great Nidhogg, a gigantic worm creature who eats champions of battle in order to honor them approximately 8 hrs. later through projectile elimination from the tippy top of the stratosphere. That's right. You're competing for the opportunity to be eaten and♥♥♥♥♥♥out in a blast of glory. Do I even need to say more? 10/10			",280,24,5,24,9,2,32

If you don't have instantaneous reaction times, the best you can do is delay an inevitable loss. If you lose your sword, the AI will kill you, 100% of the time. If you manage to disarm the AI, they will punch you in the face until you die. The controls are unresponsive and half the time I'm throwing my sword away when I want to lunge.			",63,8,0,10,4,0,4

												This game seems sorta bloated, as it looks like an old 16 vga game but still somehow manages to have terrible slowdown when switching rooms and hitches on my modern laptop which really ruined the fun- especially  since this is a very twitchy fighting game. It was also advertised as being controller friendly but I couldn't get it to recognize my 2nd controller no matter what, and I ended up having to use JoyToKey  >:EIt IS fun, but I also don't understand why this was in development for so long. We basically cruised through all the available levels within 20 minutes.I was really looking forward to Nidhogg but it didn't quit fufill the hype. I'd highly recommend Samurai Gunn instead of this.			",179,46,3,3,16,1,6

												This game is SO ♥♥♥♥ing instense! Playing through the single player, I was sweating profusely and yelling at the screen in excitement. The gameplay is entirely skillbased, making for very fun competitive play. Also I absolutely love the aesthetic of the game. It's as if you the player are trapped in some hellish drug induced nightmare, with a whole crowd of faceless stick-men watching you die over and over again. Unfortunately, The multiplayer is lacking. A friend and I tried it and found it to be extremely laggy for whoever isn't the host. However so, I still highly recommend giving this game a try considering the discounted price of $1.49 (Steam Summer Sale 2015).			",326,58,4,48,61,4,58

												Very simple game but still fun. Not hard to kill a few hours playing it. I'm not sure its worth the price as I have recieved it as a gift. Maybe if it were under $10 I'd recommend it.			",50,9,12,1,14,1,3

												For all the hype and hoopla surrounding this game it's little more than a 20-30 minute distraction.  A FUN little distraction though.Any game where 2 players can go head-to-head with the exact same move/abilities in a streamlined game world is a good thing. Nidhogg succeeds in presenting this basic and streamlined local co-op experience. It is just Player vs Player with fencing swords.  No powerups, no game assists, no anything. And that's why, after 20 minutes of play, my co-op partner and I realized that it was time to turn it off and not ever play it again.I estimate that for the average player the game has at most 1 hour of playability.  Consider that when evaluating how much $$$ you think this game is worth.			",132,16,5,15,7,4,16

												Nidhogg is a minimalist game at a MAXIMUM price. The core concept of the game is very sound, with sword fighting mechanics that feel balanced and fun. However, the amount of content you get for $15 is absolutely appalling. There is a 30 minute single player mode with no story or explanation of what a Nidhogg is, in fact there is no story to the game whatsoever. Every character is the same with no unique stats or abilities, and there are only 4 stages to play on. Some variety can be found in multiplayer, where you can set up custom rules like low gravity, sudden death, and no swords... but none of those options are available in online matches. There is also only one game type, albeit a fun and exciting one. Online is fun, but about 1 out of 10 matches suffer from lag, which is absolutely ridiculous for a game this simple. There is a leaderboard only for times clearing single player, the game does not track your win/lose record, you can't even pick the color of your character online... it's always yellow vs orange. No ranking, nothing to unlock. Offline multiplayer is far better if you have a group to play with... it's definitely a fantastic party game, but could have been so much more. Nidhog doesn't even have a widescreen mode or any resolution options, so if you are playing on a widescreen monitor or TV, you will have black bars on each side. Thankfully the music is fantastic, because you'll be hearing it over and over again on the same four stages. Controller support is also very limited, the game will recognize a Xbox 360 controller, but fails to register my Mad Catz Fightstick Pro (although I can get it to work using joy2key). Nidhog feels like an early access game, and certainly does nothing to justify a $15 price tag. I got the game at 20% off and I still regret it. This will be my first and last Messhof game.

												This game is one of the most annoying games I've ever played in my entire life. And the sad thing is, it's not even much of a problem with the game itself. It can be quite fun if you can get the hang of the gameplay and its modes.So why is this game so fricken annoying?The Community who plays it.CS:GO is basically running around Dust II with an AWP for 7 hours straight with middle aged men who sit in their mothers basement all day.The community finds pleasure in wasting hundreds of dollars just for a stupid rainbow camo on their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ $95 knife they bought with their dads credit card. I can't stand having to play with these people, and that's a shame since the game isn't all that bad. But this lame community really bogs down the experience.Dont buy this casual, uninspired, nameless shooter. It will either annoy you, or you will become just another pawn in this corporate conglomerate of a game. Do yourself a favor by avoiding CS:GO at all costs.			",5,4,0,1,0,0,0

Even that was actually worth something when it came out though.. so this game... is an insult to Pong when compared to each other.The controls are horrible, there is no such thing as ""swordplay"" as you stand toe to toe switching the height of your ""sword"", there is nothing you can do if you lose your sword and only the computer can block a thrown sword.. and once your sword is gone, you're dead.  No chance at all.Worst game I've played.. and I've played hundreds of thousands of bad games.			",2063,794,71,240,256,21,325

												If you don't know what somebody means when they praise a game for its tight controls, look no further than Nidhogg. This game is just as fun to watch as it is to play, whether the players are both novices or experts. You'll get sucked in by the approachable simplicity to this dueling game, but it has incredible depth before you can claim mastery. If you can play single-player mode all the way to the end, you'll have mastered it or gotten very lucky (it happens).Nidhogg is like Joust meets Street Fighter. Or maybe Ninja Gaiden meets Bushido Blade.			",346,137,2,33,28,2,29

												NEED PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH! Do not buy if you do not have real life people to play. Great party game to big picture on the TV. Is worth the cost but recommend getting on sale due to limited levels and content for a $10 plus game. IS a game of skill and luck is RAGE inducing. Avoid if flammer/hot head will have you hating your friends. Its a sort of like a fast paced fighting game but encourages running away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a bit mixed on my review on this game so I'll stick with the classic Pro's and Con's list:PROS:-Entertaining-Great game to play with a friend-Pretty nice retro artstyle-Quick, fast paced -Back and forth action-Decent soundsCONS:-Can become a bit repetitive-Multiplayer is lacking -A little obnoxiously bright in some spots-A bit overpriced ( I would say 7 or 8 dollars would be a proper amount )Overall it is indeed an alright game. However there are some things in it that could've been done better.6/10  ",141,11,8,7,22,1,6

												Much like Picasso's one-line drawings, Nidhogg boils competetive deathmatch swordplay down to its essence. Every movement is fluid, every thrust and parry a hectic yet purposeful battle between life and death, each death a beautiful reminder of your own ineptitude, and a grand finale that reflects on the constitution and merit of what it means to be a winner. It's a gorgeous pixellated dream, best served with a friend.			",117,34,6,4,15,2,11

												I really like Nidhogg, but I wish there was more to it.  The sword fighting can be intense and I really like the minimalistic, but still expressive, art style.  However, with four levels, and only one game type, there's not much to keep the attention.I'll give the developers props for including some customization options, but they're almost entirely related to the abilities of the characters, and not the game itself.  Moreover, some of them are just odd.  Baby mode?  Where you characters are constantly ducking and crawling around?  It's funny, but the novelty wears off really quick.If there were a way to modify the game modes themselves, I'd be incredibly happy with this game.  Right now, it's basically just a race to one side of the level or the other.  Kill your opponent and you can progress.  You only need to kill them once, and if you're lucky, you can get all the way to the end without any other kills.I'd like the option to force a new kill each time your opponent respawns.  How about certain kinds of kills are required to progress?  Maybe a multi-tiered, one-screen arena with a required kill count.I feel like there are a lot of ways the game could expand, and I hope it does.  As it stands, I still recommend the game because it is a lot of fun with a group for a tournament or two.  Also, if you're the kind of person who really gets into the nuances of a game, Nidhogg seems to offer a lot of potential depth.  I want more, but that doesn't mean I'm unhappy with what I got.

												Nidhogg is, in many ways, one of the greatest local co-op games of all time. Having gone through years of developement, many of those spent circulating it's way through indie shows, it had become something of a myth by the time it released.Suffice to say, it lives up to it's hype. Nidhogg's graphics are stripped down, and it's gameplay is simple to learn, but spend time with it, and you will find it has both frenetic, lethal action, and surprising startegic depth. Each of it's maneuvers can be combined in many ways, to create long and complicated plans, that play out in mere seconds. This, combined with the game's beautiful art style, and excellent soundtrack, make Nidhogg a game that thrives in it's own tone and feel.Though Nidhogg has online matchmaking, and singleplayer versus AI, it truly comes into it's own when played using local, couch-style co-op. The game's tense action scenes are most suited to a fac to face setting, and are even better with an audience.To put it simply, Nidhogg is a very good singleplayer, or online multiplayer, side-scroller action game, and an exilharating, edge-of-your-seat tense, majestic piece of videogame performance art, when played with face-to-face co-op.

												So this game is a retro-style fencing ""simulator"" that requires quick fingers, some friends, and a really loose♥♥♥♥♥♥ The gameplay is ridiculously innovative and I end up with a pretty good laugh every time I play it, but it's not particularly addictive. Like, it's really fun for about twenty minutes or so but then you sort of go, ""meh"" and go buy some other game so you can finish it halfway before coming back to this. The singleplayer's fun, but it gets old fast so you need some friends to play with, but even then the multiplayer has some lag. It's been improved upon, but not that much.Another gripe I have with Nidhogg is the price. With the limited gameplay and mechanics it has, it shouldn't be 15$. It should be worth at most 10$, maybe even less. If it was worth 5$ I'd probably give it a higher rating because of the fair pricing, but Indie games in general shouldn't be worth this much unless they're really exceptional. Also Steam makes my wallet♥♥♥♥♥♥out money like it has chronic diarrhea so I don't really think I need any more overpriced games on the market.Now don't get me wrong, I like this game. It's really fun even after you lose interest and it's still fun to come back to for like five minutes every week or so. The absurdity of the gameplay and the ability to just stand there with your opponent impaled on your sword, refusing to move for about fifteen seconds just to♥♥♥♥♥♥off your opponent is magnificent.Also your body disintegrates into brightly coloured rain when you die.Yay.7/10 would not touch boys with, but a decent game anyway			",83,8,0,19,14,0,12

												I apologize for downvoting this game, but there is a major problem that needs to be fixed. When I play online, the game lags terribly. If I grab onto a ledge, I can't get off because the game keeps teleporting me to the ledge, and even besides that, the game becomes really choppy. It's a real shame, because the game works fantastically when I play locally.			",49,7,0,1,1,0,4

												This game has changed the way I look at video games. It is the very thing that makes me a firm believer in the fact that video games are indeed an art form. Not Shadow of the Collosus or Ico, its all about the Nidhogg. If you have not played this game before, the story will suprise you. Although the motives of the characters are not immediately clear, a few matches in and an analysis of various motifs will reveal the true underlying themes. Of course although this is art, this is also a video game. The gameplay rivals the finest games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and last but not least Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two.Ill leave the rest of the game to you. Godspeed.			",21,1,0,1,5,0,2

The online multiplayer is very good although sometimes slightly laggy but also good fun at testing your skills. The single player is very good fun and lets you test how good you are by trying to get your quickest time. For the price I think Nidhogg is a great game to get and is a fun fencing game.

												Two things:A) The normal price of the game ($14.99) is absolutely ridiculous for the content that you receive - particularly considering that the developer has been working on this game for like... four years? Seriously? Four years. Goodness.B) Looking to play multiplayer online with your pals? Yeah, go somewhere else. Find another game, because this one isn't gonna work. I've tried playing with three different friends, each of us on a direct wired connection with zero interference from outside sources or internal issues such as downloads, caps, streaming, etc. The lag is so bad (and one-sided with the host being entirely lag free) that it is literally impossible to play.I don't suppose this is a scam, and as an offline game it's fantastic. Great little game. I absolutely recommend it for offline singleplayer/multiplayer play, though I assure you that the singleplayer gets boring quickly. For multiplayer online? Nope. Go buy a different game. Seriously.			",164,27,0,32,17,0,7

												An utterly brilliant game just itching to be included in tournaments. It's almost entirely about skill and timing. Tragically expensive at $15 normally, if you see this thing up during a Steam Sale, grab it. It's fantastic.			",306,84,2,29,39,4,71

												This game is absolutely brilliant. Easily the most fun I've had with any game I bought from the steam sale. Very simple but absolutely addicting. Would completely recommend buying if it's on sale, as even though the game is brilliant I think the original price is still a bit much. However, if you like to play local co-op, this is one of the best possible games to play. So fast paced and ridiculous.			",117,25,0,12,13,0,23

												Very fun game if you plan on getting it for Summer Sale. The objective is to run towards the goal while trying to take out the opponent in front of you. It's a fast paced game with a ridiculous, funny combat system that will keep you from focusing because you'll be laughing so hard. This game is best when played with a friend online, but local multiplayer is probably even better since you and your friends will have a blast with it and you can see and hear each other's reactions as funny deaths occur. The different level designs forces you to think of a way to get an advantage over your opponents, such as running through doors quickly so your friend won't be able to chuck that sword at you since it auto-closes or if you're playing on the cloud level, watch as you pitfall to your death even after killing your opponent. Though there are only about four levels and online multiplayer lags only a little here and there, it's a a worthwhile game if you plan on picking it up during the Summer Sale as it is currently $8.50 for the 2-pack at the time of writing this review.

												This game is loads of fun, the controls may seem weird at first but once you learn them it gets better. It makes you feel so successful when you manage some crazy ninja-esque move to take out your opponent and somehow not die in the process. It is slightly pricey for the content but nonetheless worth it and I would definitely recommend it.The only problems I have with this game is that there is not a large amount of people who actually play multiplayer, which isn't the game developer's fault, it just isn't popular enough yet. Also, there is a cloud level that has a stupidly bright background on one of its sections, and yes that is so far my only real complaint ",189,25,0,27,20,1,32

												I dare you to come at me with all your might and technique...but I think you might fail as I am a lover of sword fighting games dating back to the dark forces, jedi outcast, and jedi academy days.  I have really been waiting for a true sword game with the right physics and now it's finally here.  This is a great little gem to kill time when it comes to the single player... but be prepared to die... as you have to relax and practice your techniques in order to defeat your opponets.  However their is a lag issue when playing with your friends online and hopefully that will be fixed in the future...BUT you can still locally play with your friends via a keyboard and joystick/controller (which is way better in my opinion--lag free).  Despite those shortcomings it's a cute, amazingingly addictive, and smart little indie game.  En Guarde ♥♥♥♥♥EZZ!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fast paced combat, colorful visuals, and weird but surprisingly catchy music bundled up in an ultimately surreal package. Battles are intense bouts of skill, twitch, and a little bit of luck, making for a great experience in both online and offline multiplayer. The elements of the game that are actually game I cannot recommend enough.The biggest flaw in my opinion is the lack of content. A measley four maps make up your stage selection, and aside from a few entertaining variant modes (boomerang blades being my personal favorite), the gameplay is more or less static from match to match. A smaller issue is trying to share a keyboard when playing offline multiplayer where the game truly shines, but that shouldn't be a problem for anyone with a USB controller.In conclusion, Nidhogg is a strange little indie game that accomplished what it set out to do: be fun. It's definitely worth a look, and if you can enjoy the dreamlike graphics and sound, more than worth your time and money.			",118,11,1,14,9,1,21

It's deep, but you can pick it up and go.  It's the same thing over and over with variation made by YOU as you try to guess your oponent's next move and trick them away from guessing yours.  Word to the wise:  play this with a friend, hotseat, and make sure at least one of you has a controller.  At this point I have only used XBOX controllers with it, so I don't know if other types will work without something like joy2key.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So this game is a retro-style fencing ""simulator"" that requires quick fingers, some friends, and a really loose♥♥♥♥♥♥ The gameplay is ridiculously innovative and I end up with a pretty good laugh every time I play it, but it's not particularly addictive. Like, it's really fun for about twenty minutes or so but then you sort of go, ""meh"" and go buy some other game so you can finish it halfway before coming back to this. The singleplayer's fun, but it gets old fast so you need some friends to play with, but even then the multiplayer has some lag. It's been improved upon, but not that much.Another gripe I have with Nidhogg is the price. With the limited gameplay and mechanics it has, it shouldn't be 15$. It should be worth at most 10$, maybe even less. If it was worth 5$ I'd probably give it a higher rating because of the fair pricing, but Indie games in general shouldn't be worth this much unless they're really exceptional. Also Steam makes my wallet♥♥♥♥♥♥out money like it has chronic diarrhea so I don't really think I need any more overpriced games on the market.Now don't get me wrong, I like this game. It's really fun even after you lose interest and it's still fun to come back to for like five minutes every week or so. The absurdity of the gameplay and the ability to just stand there with your opponent impaled on your sword, refusing to move for about fifteen seconds just to♥♥♥♥♥♥off your opponent is magnificent.Also your body disintegrates into brightly coloured rain when you die.Yay.7/10 would not touch boys with, but a decent game anyway			",83,8,0,19,14,0,12

												Probably the most incredible fighting game that I've ever played. Simple and elegant yet deep and rewarding, this game pits player versus player in a battle to the death to become the sacrifice to the great and powerful Nidhogg. A simple fencing and combat system along with a neat 1v1 MOBA mechanic keeps this game moving back and forth across the battlefield. Killing the opposing player allows that player to advance further into their opponent's territory. After getting through the final screen of an opponent's territory, the player wins. Simple enough, but these fights can sometimes grow into these epic, 10 minute long brawls that swing wildly around the area. I can't recommend this game enough, but make sure you play it with a controller!			",371,67,5,52,38,2,41

The singleplayer is pretty shallow, but is a good way to hone your skills or kill a little time if nobody is around to duel.

												Good: This is a good game, in a fantastic and woefully underdeveloped genre (I'll call it the ""fast-paced shared-keyboard chaos"" genre)Bad: Despite how small the genre is, there are several games that dramatically outclass Nidhogg. Jump n Bump is fantastic that allows for 4 players and has similar pacing and enjoyability even with only 2. And it's free. Marshmallow duel is a 2 player duelling game with some incredibly tense standoffs. And it's free. See a pattern here? Both of those games I have well over 200 hours played and I'm sure to play hundreds more hours in future. Nidhogg? Well, I've played 2 hours and I might play 10 more.In summary: Nidhogg is a good game, but there are much better games available for free. I'd still recommend it, but only if you've already played the better (and again, FREE!) games in this genre and you really want something else. Or if there's a big price drop.

												 Nidhogg is a game that has been wowing the tournament crowds for a little while and now the rest of us get a chance to see what all the fuss is about. A one on one fencing the game, it is a pure test of skill against an opponent much in the same way Street Fighter or IK+ is. On the service Nidhogg is a simple game. You have to get your fencer to run across the level and reach your opponents end zone. Here you are eaten by the big worm Nidhogg thing and pronounced the winner. In order to do this you need to repeatedly best your enemy as you progress. Starting in the middle of the level you need to kill your opponent and run, after a short time your opponent will respawn and you fight again. If your opponent kills you they can then run the opposite direction in an attempt to regain ground.There are four levels to fight on which offer different environmental challenges and obstacles to use to your advantage. The castle has rooms and pits, so you can try and force your opponent to jump a pit and land on your sword or stay in a room so they can’t jump over you. The mine has a low ceiling which nullifies the ability to throw the sword or jump over your opponent, The clouds have disappearing ledges and the wilderness has platforms and long grass which allow for more manoeuvring and hiding.The only stage that doesn’t really work is the cloud stage as it’s just a bit much for your eyes to deal with; it’s also a bit dull compared to the others. The Wilderness reminded us of a 2D version of Bushido Blade which is certainly no bad thing at all.The fencer has a range of moves and techniques at their disposal. They can roll, cartwheel and jump which can be used to try and sneak past opponents if they have their sword at the wrong height. You can also perform a dive kick which knocks opponents over and makes them drop their sword. When an opponent is on the ground death can be dealt via a swift neck break. With the sword in hand you can thrust at three different heights. This works in a rock, paper, scissors kind of way and also defends against things like dive kicks depending on where you have the sword set. If you wish you can also throw your sword, however, if it’s parried you then leave yourself open to almost certain death.These basic moves form the crux of your sword fighting strategy and can be used in a number of different ways in order to best your opponent. If you are feeling super confident you can also disarm your opponent by moving your sword to the correct position at the exact right moment. Get this wrong though and you will find your own sword flying away.Essentially, this is a two player game and anyone going into it expecting a lengthy single player component will be disappointed. Single player acts as an arcade mode where you continually square off against computer controlled opponents on the games four levels. It’s practice for multiplayer and while a nice distraction it will only last you half an hour or so.The game uses a bright, 8-bit styled, colour palette to build its world. The colour scheme is garish but somehow seems to work. As a fencer is slain they explode into coloured dots and quickly begin to cover the arena in pixelated blood. It helps to highlight where the choke points are in each level as well as provide some visual flair.There’s no denying that Nidhogg is an excellent two player experience. It provides the same sort of adrenaline rush as all the best one on one fighting games and the mechanics work really well. However, we can’t help but feel that more could have been done here. There is certainly scope for a roaring Prince of Persia or Defender of the Crown style single player adventure. Even something like taking the Blood Valley (it’s an old, bad, 8 bit game), template and adding the superior gameplay of Nidhogg could work. Another option would be to have more stages. Having just four levels does make the package feel a little sparse. You could have had stages requiring some basic climbing or less footholds etc. Anyone who plays the game is going to have a great time and this is some of the best multiplayer action around at the minute. However, it could have been much more fleshed out in both single and multiplayer. The mechanics are great; we just hope there’s some further development of the other elements in the future as it could lead to something really special.Overall 7/10			",134,40,0,21,7,4,35

												Nidhogg is one of those games that you really have to play to understand. You try to explain the game to somebody and you end up making it sound like a horrible game.It is anything but. Nidhogg is an adrenaline fueled rollercoaster ride with fencing, karate moves, one-hit KOs and most importantly, dive kicks.To even attempt to describe how hype this game is would be a crime. I purchased Nidhogg and my friends and I were playing it for two hours straight and yelling the entire time.A must purchase.			",349,75,8,49,23,4,41

												This game is extremely fun, simple to play and hard to master.Unfortunately the biggest downpoint is currenlty the lack of people playing this online, perhaps if it was cheaper more people would buy it but it is worth $15 while many of the big budget titles do not deserve your money.Most people are going to be scared off by the retro graphics but this would be the very definition of judging a book by its cover.  The screens might show an archaic game but the game mechanics and enjoyment are far superior when compared to many of my games.If you like Divekick or any fighting game you'll love this.If you like platformers and have friends you'll love this.If you like entering or making tournaments you'll love this.If you want a party game to put on you'll love this.More people should buy this game.

												Nidhogg is a deeply tactical fighting game that's been distilled down to its very core. The simple graphics, distilled game mechanics and ultimately satisfying battles makes Nidhogg simple to pick up but incredibly difficult to master. The single player is a great introduction to the various tactics that you (and other players) can use, preparing you for the ultimate showdown with your opponent sitting right beside you. It might not draw me in as much as Soul Calibur did but it's a great fix for someone who's been aching for a decent fighter for a while.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/02/21/nidhogg-surprisingly-tactical/ ",251,98,2,15,18,0,22

												Nidhogg is a bit of a gamble; the lack of stage variety and the price-tag can be offset by the gameplay if you happen to enjoy it enough, but the only way to know is to have played it. As many others doubtless noted the mechanics are simple but diverse and encourage a somewhat surprising degree of tactical thought or the development of a refined intuitive grasp. The four extant levels are quite nice, but a minimum of eight stages would still have been preferable. Daedelus' musical score for the game shines surprisingly bright; in tandem with the trippy stage backgrounds the tracks create a very surreal and otherworldly experience that I would never have expected from the game, but I find the atmosphere highly captivating and very much want more of it. A shame that it may never come.While I can't really say what others might take from it, I've had more fun with Nidhogg than anything else I've played in a long time. As player death is common and quickly followed by a new life, you're free from being all that concerned with dying to more greatly enjoy the wild and often hilarious interplay of the two fencers, which can range from skillful bouts to ridiculous hamfests. For most people I can't recommend the game at its full price; more stages and perhaps another type of single player game mode would help justify a 15 dollar purchase. Unless you're quite certain you'll love it, seek it out when it's eight dollars or less. Personally though, I would sacrifice the full cost for the glory of being eaten by the Nidhogg.

												Beware this game is highly addictive, I haven't played long and I can already feel it becoming the type of thing I'd sink days worth of hours into. The combat is superfast, quick and dynamic. The visuals are very lo-fi but quite psychedlic and occasionally jarring. This is a game without pretense, it is simply pure gameplay. That's not an issue because the gameplay is tight, feedback is intense and it's the first game since hotline miami to get my heart pumping whilst feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ The controls themselves are simple yet combined with the movement can be used to great effect and the best battles are the ones where you are back and forth in the same screen, losing weapons, fist fighting, regaining and throwing weapons only to die or kill your opponent, you'd pause for victory but they'll respawn before you get to the end if you do which drives you forward and keeps the intensity high. I will be recommending this to everyone.			",196,55,2,17,22,3,20

												Nidhogg is very good for several reasons.Usually I'm not a fan of having games with the whole atari 2600 theme due to the nature of so-called ""indie"" as a genre ruining retrostyling. nidhogg, however stands in the face of all that.the game revolves around you and your opponent fencing and fistfighting one another witht he ultimate goal of clearing the most screens to finally [s]be eaten by the Nidhogg[/s] be eaten by the Nidhogg. the gameplay is unbelivably fast paced, oriented around two player (or even more, if done in rotation) competition, has simple controls, isnt hard on your computer, and will make you have an incredible time playing.if you're a fan of an old school style game developed in modern day, nidhogg eats you.

Nidhogg is a surreal fencing game pitting your keyboard/controller skills against a computer or other player. Admittantly, I know little to nothing of the real thing beyond, ""stick 'em with the pointy end"", so the initial frustration level was nearly controller-throwingly palapable. But the retro-Joust-esque graphics, combined with some enjoyable background music, kept me in the groove long enough to finally get into the zone. With enough training on Nidhogg, I believe I could confidently have my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by even my most uncoordinate fencing friends IRL, but would then be able to level the playing field in-game. I picked this title up in the Humble Store when it was on sale, and have enjoyed every cent of it.			",124,37,5,12,25,3,22

												This game can get really fun, especially when playing Offline Multiplayer, side-by-side with someone.I haven't tried the online multiplayer yet, since there are 0 players online in matchmaking. I guess it's hard to find a game unless you have a friend to play with online.It feels like this game isn't worth that much money.The mechanics are interesting and you can master them pretty easily, but that's all you'll get. The solo campaign isn't very hard either and this game just rotates throughout 4 levels: Mines, clouds, castle and wilds.It would be nice if the developer added more levels to fight in with some obstacles that could make the fights even more entertaining.Unless the dev adds to this game, only buy this when it's on sale, it's not worth the full price.

												This is one of the most fun ""quick fun"" pvp games I've ever played. Every round has a natural pacing, going from slow standoffs in tight corridors, to fast brutal deathruns to the finish. And it's filled with so many turnabout moments where you think you've almost won only to go back 3 screens.I love the way the combat mechanics are handled. The sword feels deadly and indeed, even jumping onto someone with the sword will kill you instantly. You can move the sword between high, neutral and low guard to block where the other person is moving their blade or aim your blade into an opening. You can even quickly push their sword up or down to knock it out of their hand. Some of the best moments come when one player DOESN'T have a sword however. Without one, you're extremely vulnerable and the dynamics change quickly. You either need to run, pick up a sword or attempt a risky disarm. It's moments when been swordless, tried to run and my opponent threw his sword at me only for it to hit the environment and land between us leading to the most desperate scramble to pick up a sword ever seen that make this game worth it.Pros: fantastic fast-paced risk vs. reward gameplay, naturally paced battles, interesting stages with unique gimmicks.Cons: Hit detection/netcode is off over the net so best for LANs, sometimes you'll clearly die but no, it was your opponent who died. Content is a little sparse but what's there is very polished!Please this game a shot, it's fun!PS: when disarmed, aerial attack. Trust me.			",191,13,2,20,7,2,7

												Wow. Simply spectacular. Consider it a combination of Receiver, Hotline Miami, and Bushido Blade. The goal is simple. Reach your endzone after passing through multiple screens. When you kill your opponent, you get a few moments to run as far as you can without running into his rapier as he respawns. That's it. This is one of those excellent games where you can make your own game with a little imagination and elbow grease. Try king of the hill, or a super-sudden-death slo-mo game mode where the only possible attack is to throw your boomerang sword. Fast, twitchy gameplay, beautiful backgrounds (and admittedly well animated though slightly lacking character sprites--which I think mesh well with the concept of function over form), and a nice techno soundtrack.Wow. I can't stop saying wow. If you liked Hotline Miami--seriously, pick this up. It's a lot of that games greatest concepts distilled into a plotless breeding ground for couch co-op and epic 6-player tourneys.			",352,35,8,24,28,2,37

												I had the fortune of being a part of this game's journey. I was there in the audience at the IFG awards at GDC in 2011. It was in THAT year that I was excited for this game to be released. Who knew that it would take an addition 3 years to come to fruition. Thankful, the day has finally come. This game is great. It is a testament to the meaning of ""Less is More."" It is all about the experience and the adrenaline that surges through you when you play it with a friend. I bought this game Day 1 and in no way do I regret it. This is a game that needs to be played by everyone with anyone. ""5 Stars! A+! 4 Stars!""			",37,6,0,5,0,0,0

												It's tense. It's fun. Nidhogg is a fast paced fencing game, where you stab eachother to get to the other's side. It's very addictive and super fun to play with a friend  ex-friend. There's an alternative single player mode to sharpen your skills in, and the game has seriously delighted me for the few moments i've got to play it. I would not pay 13,99€ for it but if you find it on sale sometime, do consider picking it up for yourself and a friend....And oh yeah. The game features controller support, so for you guys that enjoy playing with a controller it's fine.			",123,24,1,17,18,2,24

Although the pricetage is a bit steep I still find quite a bit of enjoyment playing with friends locally.  the online runs very smoothly (for me at least) and I ultimatly have a great time with it.  steam workshop and modding support would be a must later in this games lifetime and I hope the devs add some content as well.  All togetherr I think theis game is very well excuted and a great competitive title with simple controls and smooth gameplay.  great game to play at get togethers and parties.  also would be fun to get some people together and play some tornament style matches.

												(Though I recommend the game on account of gameplay value, I recommend waiting for the game to be discounted.)An excellent hotseat game in which friends who are left watching will be as engaged as those who are playing. The phrase ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" holds true for the gameplay, as no strategy is foolproof except knowing the weakness of each method. Combine that will the cleverly designed maps that award different strategies depending on their layout, and Nidhogg is a game that yields an infinite number of ""Holy s***, that was nuts"" moments. So long as you have two gamepads, this is an awesome game to play with a group of friends.Again, though, unless you plan on playing with friends a lot, you may feel buyer's remorse if you don't wait for the game to be discounted.

												This game is loads of fun, the controls may seem weird at first but once you learn them it gets better. It makes you feel so successful when you manage some crazy ninja-esque move to take out your opponent and somehow not die in the process. It is slightly pricey for the content but nonetheless worth it and I would definitely recommend it.The only problems I have with this game is that there is not a large amount of people who actually play multiplayer, which isn't the game developer's fault, it just isn't popular enough yet. Also, there is a cloud level that has a stupidly bright background on one of its sections, and yes that is so far my only real complaint ",189,25,0,27,20,1,32

												 Nidhogg is a game that has been wowing the tournament crowds for a little while and now the rest of us get a chance to see what all the fuss is about. A one on one fencing the game, it is a pure test of skill against an opponent much in the same way Street Fighter or IK+ is. On the service Nidhogg is a simple game. You have to get your fencer to run across the level and reach your opponents end zone. Here you are eaten by the big worm Nidhogg thing and pronounced the winner. In order to do this you need to repeatedly best your enemy as you progress. Starting in the middle of the level you need to kill your opponent and run, after a short time your opponent will respawn and you fight again. If your opponent kills you they can then run the opposite direction in an attempt to regain ground.There are four levels to fight on which offer different environmental challenges and obstacles to use to your advantage. The castle has rooms and pits, so you can try and force your opponent to jump a pit and land on your sword or stay in a room so they can’t jump over you. The mine has a low ceiling which nullifies the ability to throw the sword or jump over your opponent, The clouds have disappearing ledges and the wilderness has platforms and long grass which allow for more manoeuvring and hiding.The only stage that doesn’t really work is the cloud stage as it’s just a bit much for your eyes to deal with; it’s also a bit dull compared to the others. The Wilderness reminded us of a 2D version of Bushido Blade which is certainly no bad thing at all.The fencer has a range of moves and techniques at their disposal. They can roll, cartwheel and jump which can be used to try and sneak past opponents if they have their sword at the wrong height. You can also perform a dive kick which knocks opponents over and makes them drop their sword. When an opponent is on the ground death can be dealt via a swift neck break. With the sword in hand you can thrust at three different heights. This works in a rock, paper, scissors kind of way and also defends against things like dive kicks depending on where you have the sword set. If you wish you can also throw your sword, however, if it’s parried you then leave yourself open to almost certain death.These basic moves form the crux of your sword fighting strategy and can be used in a number of different ways in order to best your opponent. If you are feeling super confident you can also disarm your opponent by moving your sword to the correct position at the exact right moment. Get this wrong though and you will find your own sword flying away.Essentially, this is a two player game and anyone going into it expecting a lengthy single player component will be disappointed. Single player acts as an arcade mode where you continually square off against computer controlled opponents on the games four levels. It’s practice for multiplayer and while a nice distraction it will only last you half an hour or so.The game uses a bright, 8-bit styled, colour palette to build its world. The colour scheme is garish but somehow seems to work. As a fencer is slain they explode into coloured dots and quickly begin to cover the arena in pixelated blood. It helps to highlight where the choke points are in each level as well as provide some visual flair.There’s no denying that Nidhogg is an excellent two player experience. It provides the same sort of adrenaline rush as all the best one on one fighting games and the mechanics work really well. However, we can’t help but feel that more could have been done here. There is certainly scope for a roaring Prince of Persia or Defender of the Crown style single player adventure. Even something like taking the Blood Valley (it’s an old, bad, 8 bit game), template and adding the superior gameplay of Nidhogg could work. Another option would be to have more stages. Having just four levels does make the package feel a little sparse. You could have had stages requiring some basic climbing or less footholds etc. Anyone who plays the game is going to have a great time and this is some of the best multiplayer action around at the minute. However, it could have been much more fleshed out in both single and multiplayer. The mechanics are great; we just hope there’s some further development of the other elements in the future as it could lead to something really special.Overall 7/10			",134,40,0,21,7,4,35

												Nidhogg is one of those games that you really have to play to understand. You try to explain the game to somebody and you end up making it sound like a horrible game.It is anything but. Nidhogg is an adrenaline fueled rollercoaster ride with fencing, karate moves, one-hit KOs and most importantly, dive kicks.To even attempt to describe how hype this game is would be a crime. I purchased Nidhogg and my friends and I were playing it for two hours straight and yelling the entire time.A must purchase.			",349,75,8,49,23,4,41

												Mother of god...this ""simple"" pixel based game that could be played with an NES controller with ease is actually incredibly deep. I picked this up after watching a youtuber play it briefly... again, mother of god...I used to play a hyper realistc fighting sim on playstation called Bashido Blade.. to me, this game is Bashido Blade reimagined on Atari. The one hit kill, fencing based combat combined with the push style arenas are absurdly intense. After playing the CPU about halfway through all the levels, all i could think of was calling up all my childhood fighting game rivals over to check out this new beast. The bumping beats and intense gameplay make this a helluva game for enthusiasts of intense melee combat.			",185,36,1,21,34,1,22

												I would like to be able to recommend this game, though because of the price tag I cannot. $15 dollars is incredibly steep for what 'very little' this game actually has to offer. It can be very fun if u play against a mate to fill in 10 minutes every now and than, like waiting for other friends to come online to play a game together. It really isn't worth it though sorry. Wait for it to go down in price, way, way down. It should only be $5 to start with anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beware this game is highly addictive, I haven't played long and I can already feel it becoming the type of thing I'd sink days worth of hours into. The combat is superfast, quick and dynamic. The visuals are very lo-fi but quite psychedlic and occasionally jarring. This is a game without pretense, it is simply pure gameplay. That's not an issue because the gameplay is tight, feedback is intense and it's the first game since hotline miami to get my heart pumping whilst feeling like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ The controls themselves are simple yet combined with the movement can be used to great effect and the best battles are the ones where you are back and forth in the same screen, losing weapons, fist fighting, regaining and throwing weapons only to die or kill your opponent, you'd pause for victory but they'll respawn before you get to the end if you do which drives you forward and keeps the intensity high. I will be recommending this to everyone.			",196,55,2,17,22,3,20

												Nidhogg is a throwback to old 1 v 1 ""dueling"" games that just aren't seen anymore. It brings it together with style, combining frenetic gameplay with simple, effective graphics. Your character can use different stances with their sword and can also fight barehanded and, while I was dubious at first, it draws you in. There's that rush of adrenaline as you and another character are going toe-to-toe, cartwheeling back and forth, thrusting at each other and parrying blows. It results in something surprisingly visceral. Four out of five - loses one point for unpolished multiplayer, having trouble with online matchmaking and I had great difficulty playing one on one with someone from my friends list, which should be simple. Hopefully a bug they iron out soon! Nevertheless, solid recommend.			",132,12,4,9,7,2,20

Great soundtrack and a lovely art style as well.The only thing that sucks about it is that there are only 4 levels and that the online can be quite laggy, which is extremely painful in this type of game. I still think it's well worth the money. People saying it's overpriced definitely aren't seeing the game in the same light as I believe most people will.

												If this game is on sale, BUY IT. This is a gem can be a challenge with interesting mechanics and great replayability especially when facing friends. For the singleplayer, it can take about an hour to finish depending on how good you are. For matchmaking, I haven't had the chance to experience this yet because no one is ever online to play it sadly. If you play against friends though, it is a very enjoyable, competitive party game. Overall, the game delivered with its unique gameplay except in the matchmaking. Although I enjoy the game, it isn't at the top of my list to purchase, so I reccomend laying it on your wishlist, waiting for a sale, and then snatch the game.			",166,26,0,28,31,1,45

												The price is a bit steep for some, which is why I waited for a steam sale, just like the current one on the date around posting this review. This is on of the most competative one on one games I have ever played, matches can be over in a few moments or in tens of minutes on that of the skill between the players.***DISCLAIMER*** While the game is played just as well with keyboard, I found it much eaiser with a controller. Also, I found that when playing with a keyboard and controller in a versus match, the player with the controller had the upper hand in most matches, however when played with both on keyboard, it seemed to equal up. The sale price is particularily important as the online is kinda dead. Once you get a good match going with someone it seems to run pretty great with its netcode and everything.Ending Statements:+Barrels of fun.+Controller is recommended.+Not really much lag, netcode is good.-Online is dead, or at least whimpering.

Your fight against your opponent is a duel which alternates between tense moments of fencing and barbaric running and punching. It's an incredible multiplayer game, with lots of ""wow wait how'd you do that"" moments.Butbutbut what are the cons, good sir?Well. Online matches suck. The two screens don't sync up well, and the community is a ghost town.The soundtrack isn't great.If you have no friends, the game loses its appeal fast.BUT these are blemishes on an otherwise beautiful tapestry.

Long story short: it's great fun and awesome fast-paced game for multiplayer -being the controls in local waaaay much more responsive than in online-, but in comparision to other games, rather expensive, and it feels it needs some more content -though I won't say it's an unfinished game-. Get it if it's an offer, or maybe a 2pack. If any of your friends has it, invade his house.Solo and Local Multiplayer show Nidhogg at its best, in terms of Controls/Latency (ofc no latency at all)/technique/skill. Online multiplayer is also a blast, but you won't always find players to play with unless you add them as friends, and the netcode makes it really frustrating sometimes. It's either you or the other player the one who hosts the game: there are no servers you can join and stay (I'm thinking of Toribash) and this make online less active. As there's some latency due to the internet conection, the triggers are not always recognized properly, and you have to press the keys slightly longer (really small differences on the keyboard, but so real on the gameplay). This means that some tricks you can do at Local are impossible to make at Online.Tehre are a couple of different attacks, but the possibilities are multiplied per 100. I've played more than 100 online matches, and each one of it was different, because you're not playing with Nidhogg or swords, but with the opponent's mind and with your awareness. And that's the most beautiful thing of this game. Tricky and fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It could be cheaper, but if you measure is against the amount of fun and frustration you'll get from the game, I'd say get it.Let me say this, I'd rather have my friends over and play this, than going out and doing something like going to the movies.

												Nidhogg is a very fun game that is easy to learn.  The controls are simple and so is the concept, and with the fast paced combat it makes Nidhogg a very good party game.  There is also a  tournement that allows more than 2 people to compete for the 'trophy' (there is no trophy but rather just the first place spot).  The only problem with the game is the price and lack of content.  Nidhogg only has 4 stages which don't really get old, but more would be appreciated.  Lastly $14.99 is quite a stretch, so I suggest that you pick it up on a sale.Pros:-Easy to learn/simple controls-Fast paced combat-Good party gameCons:-Overpriced-Lack of contentOverall: 8/10			",51,3,1,3,0,0,2

												Probably the most incredible fighting game that I've ever played. Simple and elegant yet deep and rewarding, this game pits player versus player in a battle to the death to become the sacrifice to the great and powerful Nidhogg. A simple fencing and combat system along with a neat 1v1 MOBA mechanic keeps this game moving back and forth across the battlefield. Killing the opposing player allows that player to advance further into their opponent's territory. After getting through the final screen of an opponent's territory, the player wins. Simple enough, but these fights can sometimes grow into these epic, 10 minute long brawls that swing wildly around the area. I can't recommend this game enough, but make sure you play it with a controller!			",371,67,5,52,38,2,41

												This game is fantastic. It brings back not just the nostalgia of playing heated matches with your friends on the couch, but also the pure skill and difficulty to truly master the game. This is not something that will give you instant gratification while holding your hand the whole way, like most games that are released nowadays seem to do, and yet anyone can pick it up and play it within minutes. It has to be said that those who bought this game expecting a single-player experience, or a game with a lot of combos and superficial depth, are going to be disappointed. Since the beginning of development, the game was, in my opinion, clearly focused on local multiplayer. This was meant to be a party game, or something that you and your friends could enjoy giving each other grief over on those late nights. I am pretty old school, and have gotten weary of the online matchmaking systems that most games implement - you just can't be certain you will be paired with someone that will make the game enjoyable for you. If you really want to have fun, you should be playing with your real friends anyways. And if that's your opinion on gaming as well, do yourself and your friends a favor - buy this game. It is absolutely worth it.			",142,20,4,11,14,0,12

For such a simple concept, the game has amazing atmosphere, quality combat, and an overall extraordinary game play experience.  The single player AI is well programmed and is challenging enough to enjoy, but not difficult enough to be frustrating. This is a really great game to have at parties because of the quality single-keyboard controls and short entertaining games. Overall all these aspects come together to from truly enjoyable game.

												This games price is apauling, i came here expecting it to be £2, and its £10. BUT, it has the most best 2D sword fighting ever, and you can VS friends, so i had to get it. i would recommend this game when it is on sale, but right now it is a rip off.The objective is to get to the opponents end of the level, and be eaten by the nidhogg, to do this you must battle it out with friend or AI, throw your sword, do a backflip, cartwheel and land in a baddass pose, all to impale yourself on the dudes sword he held at max hight. 10/10 would impale on max hieght sword again.

												Nidhogg is a fast paced, local multiplayer focused fencing game developed by Messhof. In Nidhogg you take up fencing and fight one on one matches against AI or other players through local or online multiplayer. The aim of the game is to make it past your opponent and run to the other side of the map.+Awesome pixel graphics+Simple gameplay, all you have to do is stab your opponent and run to the other side of the map, it might sound boring but it's actually really entertaining, especially when playing with friends+The different maps are very different to each other which provides some nice variation for the game+Nidhogg can be enjoyed in Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer/Matchmaking+The fast-paced side-scrolling nature of Nidhogg makes it perfect for playing in Local Multiplayer and things get pretty intense, making Local Multiplayer pretty exhilirating and the best way to enjoy the game+Nidhogg features a tournament mode which allows 3-8 players to play Local Multiplayer+The soundtrack is great and fits with the game well+The fighters in the game are all brightly coloured and blood basically acts like paint for the maps so you end up with some pretty cool designs on the floor if one area of the map gets particularly bloody+Both the KB&M controls and the 360 Gamepad controls are very good and very responsive-Nidhogg has a severe lack of content due to only having four maps, for £10.99 that kind of content really isn't good enough-Singleplayer gets repetitive (thanks to the lack of content) very quickly-Until recently Online Multiplayer wasn't very good (due to lag mainly) but it has been fixed, sadly it would seem not many people who own Nidhogg know that it was fixed since the game's Online Multiplayer remains pretty much deadVerdict:Highly Recommended, but Only When Discounted (6.5/10)Nidhogg is a great, fast paced fighting game with awesome graphics and simple gameplay, sadly the game is very much let down by its lack of content and high asking price. If you're looking for what is one of the best Local Multiplayer games on Steam and you don't mind paying the high price then give Nidhogg a go, if not, wait for a sale.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

												Great game to play if you have friends over at your house who know how to play. Lots of people do not like this game, and it is hard to teach others how to play, BUT when they do learn to play, it can be a great game to play at partys. Some achievements are almost impossible to get. If you buy this game, buy it for your friends aswell, as it is boring to play alone. it is only worth buying if it is on sale. there are 3 good maps out of the 4, and there have been no new maps, EVER (as far as i know).  Simple controls, Decent maps (although limited choice), Good combat, kinda funny and good to play with friends.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was incredibly excited about this game.  When I first heard about it during development (when it was just an arcade cabinet), I even contacted the creator and urged him to put the game on steam.  Then I bought it right when it was released, and I've had it ever since.  Well, the good news is that the actual gameplay is really fun and fast-paced.  The HUGE downside is that online multiplayer simply doesn't work.  I literally can never get it it work at all, it is entirely broken.  I've managed to enter a couple matches, but I always get disconnected.  This doesn't happen with any other online game I've ever played.  And I'm not by myself in this, almost everyone seems to have enormous problems with the online multiplayer.  And since this is basically exclusively designed for multiplayer, the game is unplayable,  I'd like a refund, since I was sold a product that doesn't work, but I'm sure Steam will not help me in this.  DO NOT BUY THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.EDIT: I've just managed to get a couple matches today, but it's still pretty hit-and-miss.  Also I just remembered that the game is way overpriced.

												First of all, this game is not worth anywhere near a tenner. Absolutely not. There are four maps for god’s sake and one game type. That’s the entire game. It’s worth no more than five quid at best.Ok, so right off the bat, this game is fun. It is simple to understand, difficult to master, as all great games are, or should be. Playing with a friend is great, playing local multiplayer is even better. I have no quarrels with the game itself, what I have a problem with is how unplayably unfair it can be really randomly. I genuinely think this could be an esport if it had more depth and they fixed the broken AS ALL HELL  spawning system. The worst thing it does is when it spawns an enemy right in front of you as you’re walking and you just immediately die. This can loose you the single player tournament almost instantly and it’s infuriating. What really takes you out of the game is how outlandishly stupid the AI enemies are. Here is a prime example: you’re stood on a conveyor belt that is feeding into a pit from left to right. Your enemy is on the right of the conveyor and will fall in if he doesn’t move. You can guess where I’m going with this. They never move, they just fall. Any difficulty, any enemy, every time. Incredible. At higher levels, the best way to beat the game is to abuse this stupidity. Make the AI throw swords at ledges designed specifically to stop sword throwing (The only exception is the tunnel section of the mines level, AI rarely throw swords there.)What annoys me most  is that this could be an incredible game. Stupidly easy to understand and it’s really easy to tell if you’re at the same level as someone else. All the games play out like a tug-of-war and it’s just begging to be played competitively but it never will because it’s unfinished.All-in-all, I would recommend picking this game up when it’s on a good sale. Don’t pay more than half the RRP.Sidenote: Imagine if this game was f2p and it had hats. It would make millions in days.			",112,25,8,9,13,0,8

												Honestly one of my favorite fighting games. I unfortunately have no one to play with and the singleplayer is lacking and the online multiplayer is non-existent. That aside, this game is an incredibly unique fighter. Matches can end in a minute or last upwards of an hour. Unfortunately the game has nothing to stop people from just running to the other side of the screen. The mechanics are simple and easy to learn, but hard to master. A lot of differenet settings you can mess with to keep the game fun with friends.			",43,15,3,0,11,1,4

If they would've at least added workshop support, I would've been happy.Also this game is only ever entertaining when you play locally with a friend, the online mode is torture to play.

												For $15 I've found a lot more staying power in many other games than Nidhogg. I have yet to see any visible additions to the game let alone updates to gameplay. It is a gimmicky game to me that I would play with a friend on occasion and nothing more. Latency creates huge issues. Having said that, my advice to playing this game: Losing your sword and chasing your opponent to the end of the stage is pointless: run in the opposite direction and commit sudoku so that you can spawn faster.Thrusting and parrying mechanics are lost on any casual player. Throw your sword, jump over your opponent, roll under them or karate kick them from above. Those are your options.Once you lose your sword, karate kick or sudoku.Did you win? Congrats, get eaten. Repeat. On one of four levels.			",334,67,4,55,25,5,39

												I grabbed this game during the Steam summer sale for about three dollars, and it was well worth the price. That's not a compliment - this game is three dollars worth of fun, now at five times the worthy cost.It might be more fun if there was an online community, but there isn't, or at least there wasn't when I was playing.Overall it's a decent game. Fairly fun. The basic idea is that you get to flip, jump, and run around like a normal platformer, with the added bonus of having to fence/fist-fight enemies. Once you kill an enemy, you can start running towards the end goal. If an enemy kills you, HE can run towards the end goal. Whoever dies gets to respawn and try to stop the other from getting there, but the guy running can literally jump over you and keep going. It takes a bit of skill and getting used to, but when you pick up the controls and start really understanding things, you'll get the hang of it. Again, it's a decent game, it's just not worth fifteen dollars. Maybe if there were more people to play online with, or there were more stages, characters, or weapons, but there's only about four or five stages (if even that many), one type of weapon (not counting hand-to-hand), and there's only the one character (you can't even choose your color). So, all in all, it's just not worth it.			",43,10,0,10,2,0,5

												Well, I just guess it's no my type of game. Despite the retro look and feel it just couldn't convince me to spent much time with it. The battling for screen mechanic is somewhat refreshing, but becomes dull after a short amount of time. The grass obsuring the vision on the game charater was a bad design descision from my point of view. As a player I felt, that I was depending on pure luck, not knowing, what my game character or the enemy character are doing obscured by clouds or wheat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the problem when people with pre expectations of what they want in a game with what they get. Nidgogg has in no way try to define it self as something deep or have story or anything beyond what you see, just something fun and intuative and can reach levels of  enjoyment and sociel cohesion with friends little other games can. I feel bad for a game that gets critizised for not supplying more than a simple mechanic when it has done nothing of the sort to promote there being anything more to it, it is what it is, and skill and time have been put in to fine tuning the mechanics brilliently. Tennis, and football are not excpected to supply more, so why this?? This game would even suffer if other quirks and novelties where intoduced, derailing your intuitvness and making it complicated and robbing its essence. Again in a game of football would you expect a next round where you have to do new things. I would love to see a element of where i can pixel my own friends in the character template with simple pixel art and add some red gore to replace the colour gore. This would make a crackingly fun avatar and add even more personal needs to win. Get of Nidhoggs case for not giving a ""richer"" experience or not doing more things, it does what it does brilliently and would be ruined by complexity. Its like complaining at a hotel that they dont have a zoo, its an unfair reason to down grade it. If it promised more and didnt deliver on that, fair enough to complain, but it doesnt, and its a bloody great time while you play!!Recommend x 10 and is a great night in, especially with the chaps and some beers.

												BEST fighting game EVER!!! Let's put it this way, if you don't have any friends in real life then don't buy this game because what makes this game great is playing it with your friends! IDK if the online works or not, and honestly don't care, it's all about the living room showdown!! This game is super EPIC and I have never played a more addictive/competitive multiplayer!!! To all the bad reviws out there, you need to ask yourself, do I have friends??			",486,106,17,43,51,5,62

												It would be a fun game. And it is at times, but the controls are way too sensitive and when you want to move in a little closer your guy lunges himself as fast as he can right into your opponent's sword.  I barely recommended it because it is fun for the most part and once you get used to the controls it's pretty fun.  Nidhogg is especially entertaining to play with friends.			",154,27,4,15,23,0,13

												I like this game, I really do. But 15$ for a single player game such as this one...?Are you guys in a desparate need for cash or something? Because you're basically doing a disgusting thing that a respectful buisness wouldn't have done, You are selling a barely finished product for a very unreasonable price.I bought 2 copies, one for me and one for a friend.. I figured, if I can't play matchmaking(and when I can - it lags like hell) At least I'll probably be able to play it with a friendwho lives in my city (almost my freaking neighbour) and guess what?...WE STILL CAN'T PLAY. It lags to the point the game is almost unplayable,And both of us have very decent internet packages AND we live nearby to each other,so tell me, messhoff.. what the hell did I just pay 15$ x 2 for? THIS? I've been much,much more satisfied from games I've bought for 2-5$, I would have never paid 30$ for 2 copiesif I had known you guys ----want to make money first, and work after----- that's a sneaky snakey way to get paid, you guys. I'm disgusted, and I'd either like a refund for 2 copies or at least♥♥♥♥in show your presence, fix the damn problem, let us play it with friends.. DONT STEAL OUR MONEY. thank you.

												Nidhogg is a fast paced fencing game, the duels you have throughout each stage are filled with tense action packed moments. This game is great to play with friends and can offer hours of fun. The singleplayer 'campaign' is decent and can be a challenge for new players, but once you get reasonably good at it you will have a thirst for pixelly blood that canb only be sated with the blood of near and dear friends. I have no regrets from killing any of them. 9.5 / 10 Wouldn't advise ACTUALLY killing your friends as that got me quite the prison sentence...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nidhogg is a very fun game that is easy to learn.  The controls are simple and so is the concept, and with the fast paced combat it makes Nidhogg a very good party game.  There is also a  tournement that allows more than 2 people to compete for the 'trophy' (there is no trophy but rather just the first place spot).  The only problem with the game is the price and lack of content.  Nidhogg only has 4 stages which don't really get old, but more would be appreciated.  Lastly $14.99 is quite a stretch, so I suggest that you pick it up on a sale.Pros:-Easy to learn/simple controls-Fast paced combat-Good party gameCons:-Overpriced-Lack of contentOverall: 8/10			",51,3,1,3,0,0,2

												SUPER BASIC BUT FUN AS F@#KI'm going to open by saying that the price is a ripoff for the content and design of the game....So make sure you get this when its on sale because this is an amazing game to play with friends. You will be on the edge of your seats in a constant tug of war death match. It is a rise and fall of punishment and glory. At one moment you have this vengeful hatred for your rival and in the next you will be on an exteme thrill ride full of mass murder and precise death blows. In the single player mode you face off against a series of multicoloured opponents. They start out easy but as they go on you eventually face off against, what I can only describe as, flashing technicoloured jedi robo assassins. These killing machines always seen 1 step ahead of every move you make. And just when you hit a good streak and feel like you can make it to the nidhogg (big worm guy who eats you) they push you back 3 rooms. Once you get the hang of moving like a f@#king ninja and can deliver agile sword strikes and swift kicks, they arnt that bad.			",43,11,0,14,8,0,2

And it is at times, but the controls are way too sensitive and when you want to move in a little closer your guy lunges himself as fast as he can right into your opponent's sword.  I barely recommended it because it is fun for the most part and once you get used to the controls it's pretty fun.  Nidhogg is especially entertaining to play with friends.			",154,27,4,15,23,0,13

												Having no idea what I was jumping, surprising this was a really enjoyable game. This game does however require you to have 2 poeple playing and, a controller for max enjoyment. This was no prob with me since I have a younger brother. We'd que this game up and have a very competitive yet relaxing game. We'd find new features or moves and not tell the other trying to best one another. Well worth it and I wish this guy did more with the game. Anyways it was my cocain for a weekend or so and I moved on. 9/10!			",83,12,1,6,3,2,4

												If you go into the game thinking it's going to last you a long time you won't care much for it, the mechanics are simple and if you have a competitive friend who you want to just one on one dual with for a warm up to another game, go for it. I typically played the game as an appetizer before jumping into another experience. Worth my $1.49 just for that. +Game isn't that long, but still amusing-Can get very repetitive quick.

												Was expecting a lot more from this... was disappointed overall. It came recommended by several critics and yet it seems really shallow. It is an interesting concept, but it doesn't play nearly as well as it should. There's only a couple maps worth playing, as the others are very gimicky and aren't fun. The controls are tight and the general concept is great, but there just isn't enough game here to recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But the game controls arn't responsive no matter what people try to say, as well as it just seems luck overall in any encounter. Whoch then leads to one player chasing another to the end.

												This game would be fantastic if it had a tad more variety and good online.Don't buy this game unless you know other people who are interested in playing, single player is kinda bunk and not too great (as it is in most fighting games). The game is simple, fast-paced and a lot of fun. Games can last from thirty seconds to 20 or more mins, depending on how the players stack up. Buy if you have people near you that you can play with, as online can be laggy over long distances. If you don't have people you can play with, i'd skip it.			",57,17,1,5,3,1,11

												This game is awesome for messing around with friends. Good party style game. The combat feels great, but if you are gonna play locally, I have to reccomend you use controllers. I got this game for under a dollar and it was probably the best few cents I've ever spent. If you do plan on buying this game at full price, however, you should be aware that there is a very limited amount of content.

												Nidhogg is akin to a 2D Bushido Blade. Quick and slick fencing controls support a tug-of-war system in which fatal thrusts yield a player more time to push back their opponent's respawn location. It's almost too basic, but this one is all about quality over quantity, from the brilliant graphics and soundtrack to the precision in the combat.http://zbronpsn.blogspot.com/2015/02/steam-quickies-3.html ",79,28,0,15,0,1,4

Cartwheeling over his sword to pick it up, I continued on to the edge of the screen where my foe suddently spawned half a step in front of me. He took advantage of my suprise with a well placed thrust, and took off twords his goal.I spawned in front of him, instantly throwing my sword while staying close behind it. I jumped up and launched into a dive kick as he was busy deflecting the sword hurtiling twords his face. Killing him and takeing control of the screen, I quickly advanced to the next and final screen, securing my victory.My prize was to be eaten by a giant worm.

												This is one of those games that gets exponentially more fun and crazy the more friends you have that want to play it. The game is extremely bare bones, with no more than a handful of levels and really not much else to do other than stab people to LSD graphics. If you're looking for a 2-player game to satiate a crowd at a LAN party, here's your goldmine for entertainment.I'd say $15 is too steep to play just by yourself. Get it on sale if you can, but if you have a bunch of bored friends over looking for something interesting to do for a couple hours, slicing each other up and getting eaten by a giant flying mutant worm is always a romp.

												luv it luv it luv it!!! This game is not made for extreme graphics, or high realism. It's a game meant to evoke emotions whether you're playing in campaign or against a friend! Finally there's a game where I can play with a friend on the SAME keyboard, and they dont need a copy, aka 2 seperate computers. However you can also can do it online with a friend, I'm not exactly sure how that works yet as I haven't tried it. My only complaint is that you have to beat campaign all in one play, it doesn't save. What I most love though is how fast your reflexes need to be, you have to pay attention to every move your opponent makes. As you progress the game you learn new combos, or you can just look it up. There's 3 different positions your sword can be in, and each one has a counter attack, which slowly as you play through campaign you will learn. I totally suggest this to anyone looking for a fun time!			",33,2,0,1,5,0,3

												The game is a really fast-paced, think and do game. You start the game with you on the left and oponent on the right side and quickly you have to think and observe how to disarm or slay your oponent. Think too long and your oponent will charge at you and kill you! Charge without thinking and your enemy will likely see what you are trying to do and kill you or disarm you.I'd  recommend this to anyone who is willing to try out the game, Though I would suggest waiting for the price to drop. 15€ is way too much for this game. I'd say max 6 € is what this game is worth.			",84,24,1,19,5,1,10

												WARNING!: DO NOT BUY FULL PRICE!!!! This game is awesome! I got it for $1.49 and that money was all from selling tradng cards! This game is amazing if you have a kid brother that you want to rek, but it is only worth a few bucks. I think $15 is demanding way too much for a game that will only get you 2-10 hours of fun. 7/10			",101,13,0,6,7,0,2

												Bought it on sale for $1.50 and have been enjoying it so far! Gameplay is fun and it works great with a 360 controller. Even though the ""retro"" look is extremely overdone, I appreciate it in this game, since instead of going for a NES/SNES-style look, this looks more like Atari 2600 game. I don't think I'd buy it for the normal $15 price tag, but if it goes on sale then I'd suggest picking it up.			",126,7,2,7,7,0,3

												This is a fast paced game about one on one fights between swordfighters. The single player is just meh. I've managed to finish the single player game in less than one hour playing. Once you get the mechanics there is no real difficulty challenge.I think this game is really meant for multiplayer. That's where it will probably shine. Anyway I didn't bought it for multiplayer.You can grab it on a steam sale and get one hour or so of fun but I don't think you can make it last much longer.			",426,213,7,73,30,2,61

												I was incredibly excited about this game.  When I first heard about it during development (when it was just an arcade cabinet), I even contacted the creator and urged him to put the game on steam.  Then I bought it right when it was released, and I've had it ever since.  Well, the good news is that the actual gameplay is really fun and fast-paced.  The HUGE downside is that online multiplayer simply doesn't work.  I literally can never get it it work at all, it is entirely broken.  I've managed to enter a couple matches, but I always get disconnected.  This doesn't happen with any other online game I've ever played.  And I'm not by myself in this, almost everyone seems to have enormous problems with the online multiplayer.  And since this is basically exclusively designed for multiplayer, the game is unplayable,  I'd like a refund, since I was sold a product that doesn't work, but I'm sure Steam will not help me in this.  DO NOT BUY THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.EDIT: I've just managed to get a couple matches today, but it's still pretty hit-and-miss.  Also I just remembered that the game is way overpriced.

												Great game but don't try to play online, the lag is awful. If you want to play mulitplayer you will first need to go outside once in a while and make some real life friends and unfortunately the AI is a bit slow/dumb. The game mechanics are a lot of fun if you can get a friend or two. The attacks, ripostes, rolls and jumps all feel really smooth and responsive and the tug of war becomes a really fun challenge against someone of equal skill.8/10			",271,67,6,42,46,3,49

												luv it luv it luv it!!! This game is not made for extreme graphics, or high realism. It's a game meant to evoke emotions whether you're playing in campaign or against a friend! Finally there's a game where I can play with a friend on the SAME keyboard, and they dont need a copy, aka 2 seperate computers. However you can also can do it online with a friend, I'm not exactly sure how that works yet as I haven't tried it. My only complaint is that you have to beat campaign all in one play, it doesn't save. What I most love though is how fast your reflexes need to be, you have to pay attention to every move your opponent makes. As you progress the game you learn new combos, or you can just look it up. There's 3 different positions your sword can be in, and each one has a counter attack, which slowly as you play through campaign you will learn. I totally suggest this to anyone looking for a fun time!			",33,2,0,1,5,0,3

It lacks any real serious content, though, that will keep you playing for anything longer than a day or two. So at it's current price, it's definitely not worth throwing down the cash money. If Nidhogg is on sale for under $5, it may be worth considering. Beyond that, I wouldn't waste my cash.			",86,16,1,17,19,0,4

												Nidhogg, At its best is an excellent designed tense fighting game. 8 player tournements can get incredibly tense especially when the game can be so interchangable between winning and losing. The game favors incredibly quick reactions and slight of hand movements, It can both be incredibly satisfying and infurating when you are best someone or are defeat yourself. When engaged in a tense match you will find yourself and anyone watching on the edge of there seat. The game excells and wants to be played as a split screen co-op game. However thats where the problem of the game comes. If you don't have someone to play with. You will grow tiried of it incredivly quickly. Other than the excellent local co-op the game can't really boast anything enticing, the single player is very lackluster and only warrants 1 or 2 plays. I have been unable to access the multiplayer due to what I assume is poor netcode. I got the game on sale, but it asks a hefty £10.99 for a normal purchase. I must say that as good as Nidhogg is it shouldn't warrant such a high price, Even though the local co-op is good there are only 4 maps so it isn't a game you will invest hours and hours into. As it stands this is a get on sale game. If it drops below £3 its a no brainer get it. But anything more I can't recommend that its worth it. If the game gets a workshop, better net code and single player then it would be worth the £10.99 but for now I don't recommend it. However I will give this game a thumbs up. I feel it deserves one as it is a good game. I recommend the game but just not for whats asked			",18,12,0,2,3,1,2

												Okay, first of all, great game, it takes a sort of genius to make a simplistic game so fun. The single player is fantastic, I have gotten to the hardest of the AI already and I can't beat them.  The difficulty scales well, however there isnt a way to save your progress on that specific person, you have to go through all of them again and again.  Also, the online multiplayer is slightly lacking, only because there aren't enough people playing, perhaps because of the biggest reason.  THE PRICE.  It's a good game don't get me wrong.  But DONT NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE!  Find it on sale such as the holiday sale and it is a must have for $5 or less.			",50,8,2,11,1,1,2

												This game should only be bought if you have local people to play with.Simple yet well designed fighting system. It is all about the tension of landing the perfect strike. Unfortunately the online is bad. It is hard to find anyone else playing, and when you do get a match, most likely lag will happen. From my experience the lag isn't the same for both people playing. One person could be lagging out and the other has a perfectly smooth experience. This game can't fall on a single player experience either. This type of game loses much of its satisfaction with lifeless opponents.			",559,124,3,58,31,4,61

												This game is far too expensive for the sheer lack of content it has to offer.It has barely any maps or variation in the gameplay, the music is sub-par, the graphics are unappealing, and the game overall gets very dull after about five minutes. I guess I could recommend it if it was about ten dollars less, but that isn't the case.I would recommend just picking up a copy of Towerfall, as they are exactly the same price and Towerfall has so much more to give.

												Nidhogg is an amazing game. There is no doubt about it. This game perfectly captures the essence of fencing, and it leads to some pretty awesome quick-reflex games. At first, the controls feel a bit wonky since the up key is not jump and the jump key is right next to the attack key but you can either re-bind the controls to suit your needs or just get used to it. One thing though, definitely play this with a friend. It enhances the experience a lot. I mean it. Although this is a spectacular game and original game, I do have some gripes with it. Namely, the lack of content and the price. There are only 4 levels, two characters, and the same pieces of music over and over again. (Don't get me wrong it's excellent music but still) It seems to me like I could get tired of it really fast. With this in mind, the $15 price tag is just ridiculous. Overall, I rate this game 8/10 because of the lack of content and the price. Definitely put it on your wishlist and get it when it's on sale. To the dev, I think you should release a major content update and reduce the price. But oh well. Why should you listen to just one person? If you hate reading here is the abridged version- Great game much wow fresh gameplay clutch fence skills more stuff less price 8/10 gr8 m8. Also, prepare to give up your soul to the  Níðhöggr!EDIT: Another thing has come to my attention that I forgot to mention (hehe). You know how I said this should be played with a friend? Well everytime I play with my friend one of us is always handicapped because of the horrendous netcode. For a game like this, netcode should not be a problem at all! Not like *cough cough* lack of content *cough cough* Unfortunately, it is, and it severely hinders the experience. TO THE DEV! If you see this, make fixing the online muliplayer your first priority if you even plan to continue this game. Again, an abridged version of the edit: still 8/10 2laggy4me			",30,4,0,0,6,0,2

												Akward controls and boring gameplay are the two main factors of this game . The Retro videogame style wouldn't bother if you could understand what is happening in the game . The level design is dull and repetable . There are times were hitting the enemy blade does nothing and then you die , die , and die over and over again until the enemy wins ( Get eaten by a wierd looking worm ) . The controls are odly placed and when I tried to change them in order to make the game a bit more cofortable I could hardly move . Mastering this game is a big challenge . -80% for Summer . 2,79 Euros SHOULD have been this game's original price NOT 14 .			",29,3,0,0,1,0,0

												luv it luv it luv it!!! This game is not made for extreme graphics, or high realism. It's a game meant to evoke emotions whether you're playing in campaign or against a friend! Finally there's a game where I can play with a friend on the SAME keyboard, and they dont need a copy, aka 2 seperate computers. However you can also can do it online with a friend, I'm not exactly sure how that works yet as I haven't tried it. My only complaint is that you have to beat campaign all in one play, it doesn't save. What I most love though is how fast your reflexes need to be, you have to pay attention to every move your opponent makes. As you progress the game you learn new combos, or you can just look it up. There's 3 different positions your sword can be in, and each one has a counter attack, which slowly as you play through campaign you will learn. I totally suggest this to anyone looking for a fun time!			",33,2,0,1,5,0,3

												The game is a really fast-paced, think and do game. You start the game with you on the left and oponent on the right side and quickly you have to think and observe how to disarm or slay your oponent. Think too long and your oponent will charge at you and kill you! Charge without thinking and your enemy will likely see what you are trying to do and kill you or disarm you.I'd  recommend this to anyone who is willing to try out the game, Though I would suggest waiting for the price to drop. 15€ is way too much for this game. I'd say max 6 € is what this game is worth.			",84,24,1,19,5,1,10

												I finally purchased Nidhogg after enjoying playing against my friends in their homes for the past year!And...well, as a single player game as someone who knows how to play the game there's not enough in the title to make it worth playing alone. Single player is an extended tutorial and gameplay demo. Add in no online multiplayer and it leaves you with two possible thoughts:Positive - I have friends to play against in my home! Negative - No one wants to sit on the PC and play this with me. I'm of the positive side due to my enjoyment of playing games in the same room as my friends, but given I play it in their homes it's unlikely I'll ever use my copy of the game again so is most likely a wasted purchase.Long story short, if your friends don't own the game and they're round your place a lot, buy it, it's really fun. If you play online multiplayer exclusively or your friends already own it, do not invest as it's really not wise wasting £10.99.			",429,120,19,47,27,6,53

												This game is really fun to play with other local players. While there isn't very much to the actual game, this can actually prove to be a positive aspect to it. with only two puttons and either the left control stick or D-pad, this game was able to capture the interst of and entrall multiple extremely-NON-gamers at a New-Years party I hosted. While being a gamer or practicing this game a little can give you a bit of an edge, the game plays in a way that levels the playing field quite a bit to where everyone actually has a chance of winning. For instance one of those said ""non-gamers"" played against one of my extreme-gamer bros and actually won!The game has some pretty fun variant options such as boomerang swords and ""baby mode"" just to name a few, but I would still advise waiting until this game goes for super cheap during a steam sale becuase I can guarantee that it's not worth $15.00.

												A Firm Critique of NidhoggNidhogg is a game unlike anything we have seen before. I agree/disagree with some of the things that have just been said regarding the gameplay, but the reductive quality of the facture brings within the realm of discourse the inherent overspecificity. I find this game menacing/playful because of the way the disjunctive perturbation of the negative space contextualize the accessibility of the work.With regard to the issue of content, the subaqueous qualities of the sexual signifier contextualize the eloquence of these pieces.  The optical suggestions of the spatial relationships endangers the devious simplicity of the larger carcass and the metaphorical resonance of the Egyptian motifs threatens to penetrate the essentially transitional quality. I'm troubled by how the sublime beauty of the negative space brings within the realm of discourse a participation in the critical dialogue of the 90s.  I'm also surprised that no one's mentioned yet that the aura of the purity of line notates the substructure of critical thinking. It should be added that the spatial relationship notates the distinctive formal juxtapositions.			",110,15,1,10,19,0,19

												Way too expensive, first off. But past that it is just luck as to where you spawn and where your opponent spawns. This means that you will be screwed over and over again until you manage to get to the next room. Plus if you die I'v had the opponent get through two rooms before I got back in to play. It also involves no true aspects of fencing, other than holding foil. And the controlls on a controller at least are not that responsive so you are just fumbling around hoping you'll do something right. So just spend the money on a good game like Broforce. Or buy a nice turkey for Thanksgiving!			",404,84,9,46,42,7,45

												I honestly love this game. I can't recommend it to other people enough. I've showed it to every one of my friends and they all love it to. It is an awesome party game. The biggest problem I have with it though is the lack of additional maps. If there were an editor or even a dlc pack I could buy for this game, I absolutely would. Keep up the great work though!

												I love this game, the graphics, the controls, the moves, and the overall feel. However I would like to see a little bit more to the campaign and multiplayer. Maybe like an arena mode, or like 2 v 2, capture the flag. Overall though, I really enjoy the game.			",50,10,0,5,2,1,5

												its fun for the first 2 hours but then you get bored of it, and multiplayer is only fun for the first half hour. and the price is way too high its not worth $14,99 more like $4,99 so get it if its on sale not full price..:(I played it for close to 5 hours because i thought that if i played it for a longer period of time i should like it but nothing changed for me			",20,6,0,2,4,0,0

												Probably one of the best games I have played in a long time, providing an experience based on player skill rather than the character itself or the weapons used. Simple and to the point with plenty of reasons to keep going.			",581,110,3,54,37,5,52

												Good: This is a good game, in a fantastic and woefully underdeveloped genre (I'll call it the ""fast-paced shared-keyboard chaos"" genre)Bad: Despite how small the genre is, there are several games that dramatically outclass Nidhogg. Jump n Bump is fantastic that allows for 4 players and has similar pacing and enjoyability even with only 2. And it's free. Marshmallow duel is a 2 player duelling game with some incredibly tense standoffs. And it's free. See a pattern here? Both of those games I have well over 200 hours played and I'm sure to play hundreds more hours in future. Nidhogg? Well, I've played 2 hours and I might play 10 more.In summary: Nidhogg is a good game, but there are much better games available for free. I'd still recommend it, but only if you've already played the better (and again, FREE!) games in this genre and you really want something else. Or if there's a big price drop.

												This game is a really great game with great gameplay. It has online multiplayer but does have some lag but the offline multi player is probably the best part for buying the game. The lag in online can result in stuff like u stab them and then a few seconds later it shows what really happened unless u r the host. The offline is absolutely awesome for playing with freinds at your or their house, on the go, and on vacation. The graphics arent that good but the animation and gameplay make up for it. A reason it is good on the go is that it is relatively cheap for what u r buying, u can play it on a laptop, and it takes about 5 minutes to download if you have 1 mb download speed. The single player is ok because all u do is just fight a ton of ai and u win but they accually seen to learn your moves and use proper strategy.			",97,1,0,2,6,0,0
