												Alien Breed is an isometric sci-fi shooter where you independently control the direction your character aims and moves. You maneuver through a series of 5 stages in each episode, collecting weapons and items, and shooting aliens as they appear while you move from objective to objective provided on your mini-map.It is difficult to write a separate review for each Episode, as they all largely play the same - you move from point A to point B to pick up access code C to open door D to get to point E to get access code F to.....you get the picture. Lots of backtracking through same-looking corridors, fighting similar looking enemies which pop out of the floor and walls.It's fun, but only moderately so - I would NOT recommend playing through a single episode in one sitting, let alone all three episodes. The gameplay is repetitive and it's the sort of thing you'll want to put down for a while between sessions (I'd actually say on the level of months between episodes) so it doesn't get stale.

												I can't seem to get on with this game. The controls were good, the graphics are okay, the overall feel is good.. It's just the huge amount of backtracking I've had to do so far that puts me off massively. I've completed the first mission and I just felt like it could have been around a 5 minute completion time if it wasn't for the fact that every time I would progress, the game would send me back a few minutes to activate something I've already passed previously.Is it just a technique to make a small map feel bigger? Probably. But it got very boring very quickly.I'm going to keep going at it, and if my feelings change I'll update this review accordingly. But for now I'll stick with changing the game's name to ""Alien Breed: Backtrack"".			",125,15,0,6,9,2,19

												Only recommended if you're a fan of the original game and want to see the it redone in a modern engine with more modern gameplay.Impact isn't a bad game but there isn't a lot to truly recommend it.  The gameplay is similar to the old Alien Breed with the addition of new weapons, enemies, and a 3d camera.  Despite some of the enemies having ranged attacks or special abilities, the AI will charge you the majority of the time or amble about a short distance away not using their abilities.  I'm not sure if this is any different on hard but that's how it is on normal.  This also means the weapons, of which there is a decent variety, are ultimately just another way to dispatch the rushing bugs as nothing requires a change in tactics.  Similar to the original Dead Space, your character, the chief engineer, will shuffle fom waypoint to waypoint fixing everything that needs fixing and believe me a whole lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥is broken.  This can get pretty tedious as the story is not advanced much in this first installment of the three episodes.If you are planning on playing through all three episodes, be aware that your progress does not carry over from each game.  Each episode is a separate executable and there is no way to import a save file to carry over your progress.  This means at the start of episode 2, you have lost all your weapons, upgrades, and items acquired in episode 1.  This feels very strange considering how quickly each episode picks up from the end of the last one.			",249,10,1,36,14,1,42

												Alien Breed: Impact is apparently a remake of a very old amiga game, which is impressive.  It probably takes nothing but a theme from the game, but it's great to see an old game get a remake. Unfortunately that's the last time I'll probably use the word great for Alien Breed: Impact, or really anything in this series.  It's not that these are awful games.  They are technically good games, and functional.  It's just the games themselves do nothing interesting or impressive in the least.  The player goes between waypoints, presses A for a few seconds and then goes somewhere else.  The whole time alien bugs are trying to kill him.  He does this for five levels and there's a boss fight (A boss fight that was easy to not get hit during) and then game is over. While the game lasts 5 hours, I don't even know if I was truly interested in a full hour of the gameplay in total.  The multiplayer is dead, but if you're not playing with someone I'm not sure if there's much reason to even play this game.   The game is just doesn't do anything interesting after a level.  You get more weapons but nothing even worth spoiler.  They all operate about the same, and none feel that powerful.  The levels are mostly start to go to point A. get blocked, side track to open a door, then go back, then get blocked again and sidetrack again, then come back.   It's repetitive, but it's mostly just wave after wave of the same enemy.  There's at least 6 or seven enemies in the game, but I really only remember 3  that constantly harass the player, and there's not much to tell there. Is it a bad game?  No, but it's not a good game.  I don't know who I'd recommend this game to.  Maybe someone who REALLY loves twin stick shooters, wants to shoot a lot of bugs over and over, and has a lot of time on their hands.  But really, I'm sure there's a few games that do it better than Alien Breed: Impact.   Personally I'd recommend Geometry wars, Everday Shooter, Beat Hazard,  or HellDivers.    Note: I got this in a humble bundle I bought to get the Worm games which are also from Team 17, which I enjoy.  This was an add in that I was not planning on buying.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

												What I loved:-Engaging combat with an elegant flow (practically glide from room to room gracefully dispatching enemies)-Rich atmosphere, sound design and graphics (For a UE3 game, this is pretty gorgeous).-Unique setpieces within levels (I LOVED the mainframe areas).-Short and sweet (A lot of my time is AFK, you could beat this in half the time if you wanted)What I was meh about:-Camera is clunky yet manageable (Enemies that flank you make for minor frustration)-Little variety in combat (Same types of enemies, but the combat flow makes up for it)-Doom syndrome (Levels are different, but still similar enough to evoke, for lack of a better word, ennui)What I disliked:-Cutscenes of little interest (I skipped every single one and it didn't affect my enjoyment in the slightest)-Repetitive mission layout (Go here, activate thing, activate other thing, get key, hold the fort, etc)-Didn't care about the characters (I don't even remember who the protagonist was, let alone care)			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

												The good:- Good graphics with Unreal Engine 3- Enviroinment sounds / Alien sounds and music are nice- Different type of Aliens (healer, charger, warrior, guardian etc)- Survival elements (search for medikits, ammo and credits for upgrade and buy items)- Each weapon / item is limited to one upgrade (makes the game harder)- Coop is a challanging mode . You must share all what you find in the map with your partner for surviveThe bad:- The main Campaign is short but challanging (5 maps)- Between Veteran and Elite difficulty it not give many difference (can be easy for some experienced players)- 1 BOSS in all the game -_-Tips:- Always fight in corners or behind doors. Dont get surrounded or you will die- Upgrade your medikits. Will save your a*s- Buy so many ARMORS as you can!You must get this game if you like Alien games.

												I went into this thinking that I would have a separate section for each installment in this trilogy, but (after putting what I have deemed significant time into each of them) I have decided to lump them all in together as there wasn’t much difference between any of them. That being said, let’s get started shall we?I – Story [2/10]The gist of the story is this: Conrad, the Chief Engineer of the Leopold, are trying to restore power to your ship whilst doing battle with hordes of aliens and contending with a possessed AI. And that, kids, is all she wrote. I realize this is a remake, but honestly? That’s all?II – UI [6/10]In part one of the trilogy (Alien Breed: Impact) the UI (or User Interface for the less savvy among us) was colored blue and was infuriatingly hard to see at almost any given moment. Thankfully, in installments two and three, the color had been changed to green and was infinitely easier on the eyes. The mini-map was rather reliable, making it mostly unnecessary to consult the full map often. Apart from that, HUD was minimal and user friendly.III – Gameplay [1/10]Altogether I found Alien Breed to be underwhelming practically at every turn. The game is played from a top-down angle with rigid and irritating camera controls. The objectives were mind-numbingly repetitive and I found myself getting overly bored about an hour into the first game. I present to you a dramatization of just about every thing you do in these games.“Turn on the cranky thing to put out the fires.”*Kills aliens*“Oh no, the cranky thing is broken. Go reboot six computers to fix the cranky thing.”*Kills aliens*“Good job on rebooting the computers. You can turn on the cranky thing now. Also, here are some more aliens for you to kill.”And that, ladies and gentlemen, is quite seriously the entire game. Sure, you get an odd boss battle here and there, but I’ll be damned if they aren’t just as repetitive and underwhelming as the rest of the game. My other biggest complaint about all the games was the weapon upgrading system. This game is how far into the future and I can only have one upgrade installed on my weapon at a time? What kind of garbage is that? IV – Content [4/10]With this being a trilogy, you’d assume they’d add some new content into each game right? Well, they did, but I had you going there didn’t I? Impact was easily the worst game in the trilogy. The campaign (in all three games, mind you) was downright awful. Part two (Alien Breed: Assault) added in a “Survival Mode” which was mildly entertaining. It was a billion times more fun than the campaign, that’s for sure. The enemies felt uninspired; most of them looked like the bugs from Starship Troopers only fatter and more ludicrous. The weapons were a bit boring as well, though I did particularly enjoy using the flamethrower. (Who doesn’t?)V – Visual [6/10]There isn’t much to say here really. The graphics throughout the trilogy were consistently the same, with varying levels of obnoxious explosions everywhere. I realize the ship is crashing, but come on. That being said, the graphics weren’t too bad and the lighting was good.VI – Audio [4/10]I found the sound effects to be rather lacking. The guns weren’t thrilling in the least and the little, face-hugger-esque aliens, I would swear on my non-existant childrens’ graves’, were frog noises. Thank Cthulhu they got the explosion sounds down though. I can only assume that Michael Bay consulted with them on that.VII – Overall [3.9]In closing, I’m glad I got this tripe from Humble Bundle and didn’t pay full price for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[EN]Nice game, which takes place on the spaceship infested with aliens. Simple story, nice graphics and even better atmosphere. Five maps in single player and three in co-op. Three difficulty levels, thirteen achievements, from what a few quite difficult to accomplish. Minuses - you can’t skip movies and dialogues and this can be annoying especially when you repeat missions to earn achievements. Logs we collect stay in our collection permanently if we save our progress with them – after we found any but died before saving our progress on terminal they disappear and we need to collect them once again. Irritating map, which needs to be minimized every time we access it to see it as a whole. Overall it’s worth buying especially on sale.""Thank you for choosing INTEX""[PL]Przyjemna gierka, której akcja rozgrywa się na statku kosmicznym opanowanym przez obcych. Prosta fabuła, fajna grafika i jeszcze fajniejszy klimat. Pięć map dla jednego gracza i trzy w kooperacji. Trzy poziomy trudności, trzynaście osiągnięć, z czym kilka dość trudnych do zdobycia. Minusy to, że nie można pominąć filmików i dialogów, co może być trochę denerwujące zwłaszcza jak się powtarza misje żeby zrobić osiągnięcia. Logi, które zbieramy podczas misji znikają z naszej kolekcji jeśli zginiemy i trzeba je zbierać jeszcze raz, po czym dotrwać z nimi do zapisu aby się zachowały na stałe. Denerwująca obsługa mapy, która trzeba minimalizować za każdym razem, żeby zobaczyć gdzie się znajdujemy.

												All I see is complaints, complaints ... This game is fun ! I admit I got it on a bundle with the other 2 episodes, but overall it was worth it. The graphics are good and the action is enough for me plus it has several difficulty levels. I also tried Alien Swarm and I own Shadowgrounds Survivor, but I still play this game and its siblings much more due to 1 little feature: Xbox Controller Support. That really allows me to kick back on a couch and enjoy the game for what it is and it kinda reminds me of the good ol' Contra III days ... Maybe its just me ... Get it on sale !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short verdict: it's not a complete crap.Let me guess: you got this game in a bundle? Then this trilogy might be worth those few cents you've invested in it. As a remake of the original Amiga title, it's great. But on its own...meh. Modern games just have higher standards. In every aspect, this game is mediocre.It has just enough to get you going and want to finish it. But barely. Often, during the gameplay, I caught myself thinking: ""Do I really want to finish it?"" Because you just walk around, shoot aliens and fix/open doors or other mechanisms. That's it.  It's very repetitive. You do get weapon upgrades, and the weapons and aliens do change a bit in each part, but only a little. The game also throws in a bit of puzzles, there are a couple vacuum scenes, a few boss fights, but mostly it's about navigating through the mazes that are the two space ships in this game. Physics or logic? Don't expect scientific accuracy in this game. I wish you could fix something, by blowing it up in real life, too.There's a lot of backtracking and forced camera angles/close ups. If you can tolerate it, then this trilogy might be worth a few evenings it takes to complete it. After the second half of the Alien Breed 2, I was hooked enough to find out how it all ends. With enough patience, you might be, too.On a side note, the game has a nice design and a cool little comic story between the stages.All parts in the trilogy are pretty much the same. Basically, it's one game, split in three parts, which I think is a cheap move.My overall rating: 6/10			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												Finished it.  This game has a lot of potential with its weapons and atmosphere.  Overall it's very disappointing.  In isometric shooters the last thing you want is to constrain the movement of the character.  In many ways it felt like an on rails shooter with the illusion of character control.  It didn't matter what I did in each room.  The aliens would spawn predictably.  Start the routine for alien control: go for a corner where you can't be flanked, kite, run around in circles, save ammo with infinite pistol ammo, so on and so forth.  It's tedious, and it's the type of tedium that ruins whatever tension the game is desperately trying to create.  I had the most fun when there were more open areas with many different aliens running around, then it felt like a good shooter.  The uninspired key cards and missions make you feel ineffectual,  like there's no agency in this character.  It's sad when you can predict that the computer console will malfunction... Because on the map screen there's an area that you haven't explored yet.  At least it had secrets.  Overall, not worth it, but at least it didn't take too long to finish.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In the interest of full disclosure, I never played the original Amiga release of this game.Alien Breed: Impact is an isometric shooter that is simple to get the hang of.  The game is centered around a spaceship that has been taken over by aliens, and you have to complete various tasks to ensure your survival.  At first, it is a fun game.  However, as you play, you will notice its greatest flaw: it is incredibly repetitive.   There is not much variation in the missions: get to a waypoint and kill things along the way.  There is also little variation in the environments.  Weapons are simple which fits this game well.  Each one has three attributes that can be upgraded: reload time, rate of fire, and damage per shot.  There is some strategy involved as only one of these can be upgraded at a time.I got about 6 hours out of this game, and I was taking my time looking for hidden items.  I imagine this game would take four hours without taking your time.  I have not played the co-op, but that might make this game more fun.Overall, I would not recommend this game unless you can get it inexpensively or you really like these kinds of games.

												Alien Breed is an excellent arcade-shooter released back in 2010. In fact, its original title was Alien Breed Evolution (only available on Xbox Live Arcade at the time) but after that it got its PSN and PC release.You control a guy who tries to solve all kinds of mechanical issues on a ship while eliminating hordes of enemies. Lots of shooting? Check.Explosions? Check.Ugly, alien monsters appearing out of thin air? Check.Few but very efficient weapons? Check.Coop beside single player? Check.Extra difficulty levels for die hard fans / crazy gamers? Check.Great graphics? Check -> Hail to you, Unreal Engine 3, as always.The only downside is the number of sections where you need to do some backtracking to operate a machine; this makes the available 5 levels in single player a bit longer without showing you new sections. Still, the environments are varied and interesting.Cool little game: hours of arcade shooting fun guaranteed!Worth the purchase? Check :)			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												I liked this game quite a bit!  I've played through the second one as well (Assault).  It's a run and gun, isometric alien shoot-em-up.  It all takes place on ships infested and breaking apart.  You kill aliens, repair and bypass things, explode stuff, and reek havoc in general.  The gunplay feels really good because the aliens get knocked down and impacted by gunfire.  This makes even the generic machine gun feel good to use because you can keep aliens at bay with its stopping power.  I even played the second game occasionally with a controller and it felt pretty good (although I went back to kb/m because of the precision).The story reads (literally) as a pulp sci-fi comic book, but it's interesting enough to frame the combat.  This game makes killing aliens fun  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only 5 missions.Cons:- A lot of backtracking- the camera control is a little awkward, and that is noticeable when you get attacked from all sides- the design of the ship makes no sense, and is more like a maze than a floorplan- more backtrackingNot the greatest game you will ever play, but a fun popcorn entry if you like this style of game.

Alien Breed: Impact is a remake of a remake, but still manages to be a video game with a good personality. The gameplay is simple but fast-paced and if you like old-style shooter with a ton of weapons and enemies you won't be disappointed. The main campaign is somewhat repetitive and has little flashes of originality, but given the limited duration of the game (one of the major flaws) you'll enjoy anyway, especially in the company of a friend.

												I bought this thinking i was going to enjoy a updated amiga classic, oh boy was i wrong, first they kill the games fun by not including local coop, only online coop is avalible, and that lack of local coop kills the games immersion and fun stone dead, local coop was the feature that made the AB franschise stand out from the crowd, now its just a bland shadow of its former self, there is no fun to be had in these games in single player, and getting a online game is a pain.Keep your cash and steer clear, unless bland, single player, boring, mediocre, did i say bland, top downshooter are your bag. :(			",346,75,39,26,30,2,51

												From the first 3 missions I played I really enjoyed it. Through out the game I was filled with suspence and jumped evertime an alien broke through the wall(theres alot of that). There is a fair amount of wepons and 4 types of ailens SO FAR although there is a lot of ""Turn on Halogen Suppresent"" or ""Activate _____"".Overall the game tries to be different E.G comic strip insted of cutscene and is a great top-down sci-fi shooter.Well done Team 17!

REVIEWED AS A TRILOGY...A top down, isometric shoot 'em up. That for one reason or another was split into three seperate games but is really just one big one when played back to back. So for the full experience you need to buy Alien Breed : Impact, Assault and Descent, in order to get the full scope of its story.Copies everything from Aliens to Dead Space but does have a few ideas of its own and does from time to time throw some suprising curve balls into the gameplay, in order to mix things up a bit. Though generally, you will find yourself running down dark corridors, blasting the living heck out of anything that moves. Alien Breed also likes you to push buttons, lots and lots of buttons and you may find yours being pressed once or twice too, as you're forced to backtrack, take detours and meander around in order to make your way forward. There is a saying that are two certainties in life; Death and taxes. Alien Breeds universe throws a third certainty into existence. That is, if you push a button, something will either break or blow up. And it does this with a frustrating frequency. Pretty much everytime in fact. It's hard to imagine any videogame character having worse luck than Isaac Clarke in the first Dead Space. But here we have fellow space engineer, Theodore J. Conrad. Who has been lovingly blessed by fate in having total♥♥♥♥♥♥for luck. So much so that Mr. Clarke looks like a lottery winner by comparison. Apart from a few sections here and there. The game offers little diversity throughout. It is just a bog standard shooter after all. But it does this competantly enough. The aliens swarm around you and you blast away with a variety of nice weapons. All of which can be upgraded in the usual way, More damage, faster rate of fire etc. But having the cash to pay for that sort of thing, especially after forking out for the ammo and health packs that are obtainable from the stores that are dotted around the place. Just ends up feeling like an unaffordable luxury. And anything that you buy won't carry over into the sequel parts. So any ammo, items or upgrades you have by the time you reach the end of Alien Breed 1 or 2. Will be gone at the beginning of the following game. In its favour however, Alien Breed does have some decent, if not familar atmosphere going for it. If you enjoyed Dead Space or even further back in time, Alien resurrection on the PS1. You will instantly recognise the similar flavour being passed off here. It even comes in that all too familar colour pallette of ""Space Brown"", that was present in both those afore mentioned games. A shade which is heavily daubed on every surface here. Like it's the only colour Dulux are allowed to produce in the future. With the only break from this being, when all is reduced to pitch black and you are having to rely on nothing but torchlight, which also happens to generate some genuinely tense moments. Though these dark sections do have their points of frustration. As you can get hung up and glued on the tiniest of bits of scenery. And when you can't see where you are standing, this can be more than a litlle nuisance.There is also a feeling that the trilogy as a whole kind of out stays it's welcome a bit. With each part taking upto 10 hours to finish. Which wouldn't be so bad, except Alien Breed does not offer enough variety as one would hope, to keep things interesting. So is liable to faulter here and there. But if you can soldier through some of the more lacklustre, over extended sections. The story itself will manage to keep you interested enough to keep you moving forward, to a point anyway. A story which is all pulpy, comicy and so very ""videogames"". Which isn't a bad thing, seeing as nowadays game plots seem to take themselves far too seriously. And usually end up just being badly written, senseless drivel (Bioshock Infinte for example). But even this ends up feeling overly extended. There is one section where it even feels like the game is coming to a sensible close. And yet it still manages to keep you running around in circles for another 2 hours and over. Which would be a small mercy considering the utterly cop-out, trash ending. Which despite the rest of the game being stretched thinner than a fashion model. Is rushed and ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the story it has been stringing you along with for the last 30 hours. Alien Breed also features that most no, no of gaming faux pas'. The dreaded UNSKIPPABLE CUT SCENE. I'm all for retro style games. But what is this? 2000 and freakin' 4 ? I should also mention that this does come with some sort of a Co-Op mode. Though I haven't tried it so can't offer any sort of comment on that. Though the single Player campaign is more than enough for me as it is.Anyway, this is a nice competant little shooter with some nice unoriginal ideas, but is plagued with flaws and frustrations here and there. And it is nothing that a little editing of the overall script would have sorted out. Worth your time if you're into the right genres, but not something you can play obsessively for hours on end. Not without getting fatigued by the constant hold ups, detours and the all round testing of patience. Worth the price when on sale and worth at least one playthrough. Whether you would want to go through it all again, is anyones guess. But that certainly will not be the case for me I don't think.6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm an Amiga veteran, going back to the release of the predecessors of this game, Alien Breed from 1991 and AB Special Edition '92, and of course the sucessors AB2, AB2 Tower Assault.I bought this because I thought it massively cool that Team 17 was back in action (though the old crew has moved on to different endavours), and because I wanted to see how well the game had been carried 20 years into the future.Initially, its seemed a nice change from the typical shooters, and you recognize both the straight-edged level layouts, as well as the cartoon-assisted story telling from the originals. 3D graphics, advanced effects, advanced audio etc. are of course new additions, which help a bit.What doesn't help is that the level design has you do a fair bit of back tracking, plus some of the ways to move through the levels are simplynot clearly visible until you've put a good deal of level scenery under close scrutiny, after which you'll moan in exasperation because it was otherwise (somewhat)-obvious what you should have done, yet you spent hours figuring it out. The ingame mapping function doesn't really help, because on the map, doorways are indistinguishable from regular bulkheads between adjacent rooms.The alien ""shock"" effects get old and boring very quickly, and the game ends up feeling like a regular shooter with you hosing down the walls with lead in short order. Meh.Lastly, the control system is a study in frustration, and that the dev team went with the system they did is deserving of criticism. I lost count of how often I accidentally turned instead of sidestepping, which may be due to me being keyboard handicapped, but still. It's not easy to learn, and its no fun at all being unable to properly control your character in the heat of battle because of mistaken keypresses. That, and the repeated inability to move in a certain direction because you haven't properly cleared a piece of debris, blocking your path, or because theres an actual, but barely visible, ALIEN IN THE WAY!I'll recommend that you *don't* buy this, with two exceptions:* You VERY much want to relive Alien Breed like I did.* The game is steeply discounted from its regular price (think 75%+ price reduction).It saddens me to not recommend it by default, but oh well, times change.(Org. written 22feb2015)Update: There is a particular sequence of events on the second level where the keyboard control needs to be near-perfect to survive, and where you are not given the aid from the game of any autosave checkpoints. Having tried to do this several times, where minor imperfections in placement and keyboard control means certain death, this underscores the problems of isometric perspective gaming combined with wierd and occasionally problematic keyboard controls. I came very close to uninstalling the game entirely at that point, but kept on till I suceeded through pure persistence. Stuff like this is not only not entertaining, but it is not at all a worthy use of your time.Update 2 (26feb2015): Having finished the game (after an unintuitive end boss fight that I had to chickenshit out of by reading how to do it....) I can say that while the controls become comfortable after a while of learning them and thus removes an element of frustration from the game, the games repetitiveness in both combat and level objectives becomes more apparent. The game ending is essentially absent, it is merely an advertisement to buy the sequel.Summarised: This games controls are unwieldy and takes time to lean before you can play the game properly and not be terribly inconvenienced (or dead), the action is repetitive and gets boring quickly, the weapons are not much different from each other (flamethrower excepted), the weapon&items upgrades system is seemingly useless, the non-action aspects of the gameplay is likewise repetitive, there is no depth to the whole experience, and the ending is a disappointment. The comic-strip storytelling, the occasional pretty backdrops and likewise occasional shock change in environments helps a bit, but simply cannot save this game from its shortcomings.I have yet to try Co-op, and imagine that it can only help this failure of a game.I will still carry on and see how AB:Assault is, out of sheer tenacity... or masochism. I don't know.			",27,8,0,4,2,0,2

												- No map.- Un-needed camera control.- Missions that simply have you traverse the map back and forth 3-4 times, which made the lack of map that much more frustrating, especially on larger maps.Perhaps some of these are less severe when playing in co-op.

Product received for free
My playtime: 36.7h (based on steam, 100% achievement).~9h finishing the game in Rookie difficulty~24h finishing the game in Elite difficulty~3h finishing all multiplayer levelsGrindy Achievement: No.Optional Achievement: Yes (11 achievements, although you'll mostly get 3 of the optional achievements after you finish the game).Difficult Achievement: Yes (2 achievements, might be more or less depends on your skill and (or) internet connection).Developer Response: No (last response is in 10 Feb 2016, i think).IntroAlien Breed: Impact is a top-down shooter game about exterminating aliens. There are 5 single player levels in total which can be completed in around 1 hour each. Additionally, there are 3 co-op multiplayer levels in which you have to finish 3 modified single player levels with another friend without a single checkpoint.GraphicsThe graphics isn't that bad for an old game. The UI also has a nice sci-fi feeling to it. All in all, i don't really have any complaints with it.MusicThere isn't really any bgms in this game or i just didn't remember any. I only remembered the sfxs which mostly repeated everytime (the sirens) and other sfxs which sometimes will surprise you as the aliens come from the ground. I was completely absorbed with the atmosphere due to the perfect sfxs in the game.StoryThere is a cutscene after and before clearing each single player levels. Since this game is one of the Alien Breed series, the game's story doesn't concluded in this serie. However, the story is forgettable enough and you don't really need to know the story to play the game. The story itself tells about a ship, Leopold, which is struck to a ghost ship full of aliens. The reason? It doesn't get caught in the radar.The gameThere are 3 different difficulties for single player which can't be changed after you start the game. There are also a lot of weapons to try in this game, from the pistol with unlimted ammo, assault rifle, shot cannon, flamethrower, plasma rifle, to ionspike, which can make everything in the straight line to a crisp. However, after playing through the game, i only understand how to use the first four weapons; I almost never touched the last two, which mainly because of it being introduced late and sold with a high price.There are a lot of controls in this game and it's gonna be hard to master unless you played it for a long time. Prev and next ""button"" for both weapons and items, melee attack, sprint, walk, rotate camera -- all of them use a button each. Not to mention, there are also wasd buttons for walking. I myself doesn't like how the prev and next weapons are assigned with scroll mouse, as it causes delay in my attacks. When i tried to bind the weapons, i was confused because most of the buttons which are close to my right hand are assigned for other controls already. You also can't assign it with numpad (1-0 keys). In the end, i sacrifice my melee attack for it.In the game, you'll mostly traverse through the map to find something. However, due to this and that, you have to traverse to other part of the ship to get an access card or something similar. This is repeated through all of the levels which might be boring, especially when you're trying to play this game in one sitting. However, if you just want to shoot something and explore the map anyway, you won't really have problem with it.I experienced heavy lag whenever i'm alt tabbing. I need to wait for a few minutes until the game stabilizes before i can move normally. The game also loads map slowly which make me have to wait for a long time whenever i load a save file.There are some cutscenes in the levels which is not connected to the story, like how the generators are turned on or something. However, you can't skip these cutscenes. Some custscenes took a very long time, especially near the end of level 2 where you might want to do some trial and error to clear the area.Lastly, there is a multiplayer in this game. However, the multiplayer is dead so you can't find a partner straight from the game, but finding a multiplayer partner from outside the game is still doable.Pros:- 6 different weapons- 6 different items- 5+3 levels- 3 different difficulties- great atmosphereCons:- too many controls- alt tabbing issue- unable to skip cutscene- slow map load- multiplayer is deadConclusionThis is a top down shooter game where you're exploring the maps to shoot some aliens. There is also a co-op multiplayer where you can play the game with other people with different map. However, it's dead and you need to arrange the multiplayer beforehand to do it.Should you buy this game?Yes.Despite all the cons, the game itself is quite enjoyable. If you like to play top down shooter, buy this game. This game is also very cheap when it's on sale. ",105,50,4,17,11,2,6

												This game is pretty fun.Level design  =        okay -> good. Good thing there is a map.. that only sometimes screws you over.                                 nice little details scatterd everywhere. almost looks habitable.Story =                     fine to me. I mean come on.. its alien breed. shoot aliens. :)Graphics =               50 shades of  brown - grey - and some green. Nice lighting effect though.Sound =                   Invironmental sound, weapons, ect are pretty good. Music is not my taste, but thats me.Animations =           they have ""some"" weight to them, and some details. Could have been better sometimes.Weapons =              have a nice feel to them. personal favorite : damage upgraded flamethrower.. its kinda op.World interaction = way to much press-and-hold. also -                                  some of the ""fixing"" could had have cool minigames instead of hold-it-longer.Enemies =                they have a nice variation to them. from small and anoying -to- big and stupid.Secrets and misc =  if you are a complete kleptomaniac / explorer then you can find everything in your first go.                                 some have realy nice hiding places. credits to the level designer(s)Controles =              Keyboard controles have some getting used to, but nothing to taxing.personal gripes :You can run, but there is no stamina bar. Kinda crap when you're getting a bit overrun.Everything is always broken. Makes me wonder in what state the world/ship was in before I got involved.Items are a bit weird to use sometimes.But in the end, I had fun (burning stuff) with it. Maybe you will to.

												I really liked this game. It has decent graphics and neat gameplay, shoot aliens and activate door systems. You can even search bodies for ammo, health and equipment. As you go on you have to shut down reactors and get door codes. 5 long missions will have you playing for about 4-5 hours.  Controls are great; you can strafe while aiming and change camera views, though i would discourage using a controller like I did. It has nothing to do with the smoothness and precision the mouse provides.Story:In a spaceship lightyears out in our galaxy your spaceship crashes. Aliens seem to have entered the ship through the crash and have to save your crew members and kill all the aliens. Pretty straightforward but playable anyway.Achievements:Achievements are mostly easy; one requires to not use a medkit throughout last mission wich can be tricky, but you are allowed to use armours, which overrides a great deal of its difficulty. Some Co-op mission achievements and 2 collecting achievements.Bad Parts:A somewhat repeated go to next location type of gameplay. Not too interesting cutscenes. Some frustrating parts where you get outnumbered completely and out of ammo, though you always have pistol ammo.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

GameplayBoring game... Go restore power here and then there. Escort this guy from here to there. The most annoying is camera, because it doesn't move smooth, it's moving in parts just like if i had 10 fps. With camera goes another con - when the camera is changing character goes into wall like a blind idiot. Totally 0 voice, all you can notice is text. Few weapons, few grenades, few monsters is for sure not enough. It's just like holding ""W"" button and spamming first mouse button because there is nothing more to do.MultiplayerIt's way better. When i played with my bro i had a lot fun. 1 camera for 2 players was cool and it means character wasn't going into wall as well. Choices had to be done together cause money also was for both players, that also made Alien Breed more interesting. Game was harder than singer player one so it brought more fun.Pros & ConsPros Good MultiplayerSeriously, no more pros! xDCons Single player = go from point A to point B Not enough monsters Not enough weapons Very bad camera (REALLY BAD) Sometimes character gets ""blind"" Only text - 0 voice3/10 ",131,15,4,21,10,0,10

												I managed to get to the end of this game... but it took more than six months, even though you can actually beat the campaign in less than 5 hours. I just found it really hard to get myself to play this game, and I did it just because it was waiting for me there with the rest of the trilogy in my steam library, and I've already got enough backlog. But yeah, playing this game felt almost like a chore. It is definitely playable and I guess you may like it if you enjoy the 'hack and slash' genre but in my opinion this game gets boring very fast and everything you do within it  feels completely meaningless. The writing is horrible, the plot, if you can call it that, could as well not be there at all. I'll sum up this game quickly for you: Go there, kill all the aliens that pop up along the way, come back to the place where you started. Repeat again. And again...and again. ""Sorry, your princess/generator is in another castle/part of the ship, go back through the same parts of the ship you have already ran through about 10 times and then come back here again.""  Urgh, there is a fix number of times a gamer can go through the same corridor before he/she decides to stop playing. Oh, and the main protagonist looks a lot like a less cool Riddick. Conrad? Yeah, right.I'll probably eventually play Alien Breed 2, but I suspect it will be more of the same and it'll probably take me another 6 months... At least as long as it concerns the first one in the series, I'd say I don't recommend it unless you love shooting at great number of enemies in a game with no plot whatsoever in isometric view. If that's your thing, then go for it because this is your game. The two positive things I can recall from playing is that I think it's cool they muted almost all sounds while out in space, and also I think that using comics to tell the story is a valid strategy, specially for those games with no great budgets. Overall, however, this game is definitely a no.			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

			Views: 42		

			SteamPunk Bob admits that he's a bit paranoid, but he's found a much more flagrant example.		

It's... okay, I guess, but suffers from being One Game for the Price of Three. If you're going to get Impact, GET THE OTHER TWO IN THE TRILOGY. Impact does NOT end on any sort of story conclusion. I also found the camera a bit weird, never really got used to it.It's an... okay game, but I wouldn't call it great, and there's such better stuff out there.			",332,86,1,48,24,2,57

												Fun third person shooter with the sci-fi alien theme.  Collect items, find more ammunition and grenades and make your way through the facility to save yourself and the colony.  Good graphics, good controls, and good solid action gameplay.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												It is so bad i haven't finished it. All about going from one broken door to another and searching for keys to open them. Camera work is very clumsy as well. On paper the game looks great, but it's execution is very poor. Very repetitive and boring. Talk about being part one of a trilogy... If you like top down shooters, alien slaughter and can digest repetitivnes this game is for you. All non-masochists avoid this. 5/10			",85,2,0,22,12,1,46

												To be honest in this review, i didn't like this game at all... Alien Swarm which is free, has much better story and it's more fun than this game... Annoying ""move forward,... oops, malfunction, go back and repair it"" is all that game is... and shooting aliens ofc...., maps are really long, but after first level game gets boring and annoying with always doing the same thing.... Online gaming is dead,.. Maybe all that is the reason why none of my friends own this game :( ...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You liked Alien Swarm? You'll like Alien Breed. You loved Dead Space? You'll probably like Alien Breed (because Isaac Clarke and Conrad are stranded in a spaceship, with few survivors and they're alone in that hell).Alien Breed: Impact is apparently a reboot of an older game that I never played. Here, you're a member of a spaceship that found an old ship lost many many years ago. Well, found is perhaps soft as, if I remember correctly, you've collided with it. Anyway, Theo (aka you) has to survive in his ship, after loosing his family years ago, and has to trust a robot to guide him to the older ship. However, when weird creatures are appearing, Theo has to rely on guns and terminals to survive.That's the solo campaign. You have a co-op campaign where you play with a friend as two other members of the ship and you're also trying to survive and to reach the older ship.The game is seen in 3D isometric, meaning that you have a little time to adapt to the command and the view when you're used to 3rd person or 1st person game.I remembered enjoy the game, mainly because you have perhaps normal weapons but also a powerful one, that I should add, different in each Alien Breed game. Yeah, true, when you're in the high difficulty, you have to adapt your way of playing before a game over because you didn't check your health.Anyway, your PDA is also nice as you're finding also notes from other persons, you have also a nice map to see where you are... and the terminals are in reality a save point and a shop for ammo or health.The HUD is blue, like the title in the header. So, everything (texts on the screen) will be blue too. The game is also told with cutscenes drawed as comics. And well, the blue is also the main color.Alien Breed: Impact is a nice game, though I'm kinda sad in co-op, it was kinda lagging and that we lost each time at the end of the level. If you don't own the trilogy, you shouldn't hesitate!			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												Pretty straightforward isometric shooter with casual weapons and some upgrades here and there. Absolutely nothing you haven't experienced before if you're familiar with the genre. Shoot aliens, push switches, find keycards, shoot more aliens.The story is almost non-existent (which really doesn't matter) and the visuals still look amazing on highest settings. Audio is alright, nothing to write home about. Gameplay is tight with mouse+keyboard but I think it also supports controllers. Surprisingly, despite the lack of any kind of innovation or coherence in Alien Breed, I had great fun finishing the single player campaign which takes somewhere between 5-6 hours. There's also 2-player coop mode if you're into that. The game is pretty enjoyable and a good time-waster although seeming like a rip-off of the Alien franchise.Get it on a sale and you'll most likely end up fairly entertained.			",492,214,5,51,25,2,32

												It's ok. I expected worse based on the reviews.It's a bit cookie-cutter, and the objectives exist purely to guide you through the map. You'd do the same without them frankly. Explore around, conserve ammo here and there, fight through mobs, find a switch/item that removes an obstacle in your path. It's fairly slow, but rather than build tension, it just feels slow.But slow isn't bad and the game is polished and well presented with some nice touches here and there. It falls short of being spectacular and must-play, but there's nothing terrible about it, so good effort. I didn't like the controls but after a bit of remaping it was allright.I'd recommend. It's a decent game at a decent price, and it's only fault is that it isn't ball-bouncingly awesome. It's still ok.			",70,24,8,13,26,0,19

												Ignore the playtime, I own the entire trilogy on Xbox 360.Alien Breed is a (painfully) Aliens inspired isometric shooter, a reboot of an Amiga era game of the same name. You control Conrad aboard an Intex star ship under attack from not xenomorphs. These non xenomorphs really like to pop out of everywhere you aren't, and the game involves heavy backtracking. Luckily it's really fun, though if you ran through the whole game in a sitting, you'd probably hate yourself for doing so.The only real downside I can think of is the possible repetition, and also the PC versions of the Alien Breed reboot trilogy is the only port that doesn't have local coop, which is where this game SHINES.

												Alien Breed: Impact is a sci-fi top-down alien game, in which you go around a ship and kill aliens taking over the ship, pretty simple. *MAJOR DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT PLAY CO-OP MODE*Now this game has its pros and cons:Pros:+ Graphics are awesome for an 2010 game they are really good.+ Sound quality is great.+ Survival Elements (ammo count, medkit count, armor count, hp)+ Different types of aliens to fight against+ A few different types of level designs (very far and few)Cons:- The game gets way too repetitive.- Lots of backtracking that takes away from the moments.- Story feels like a chore to complete, not too interesting, and within a few days I even forgot the storyline.- Storyline ends on a very poorly deserved ending, literally all they need to say was ""Alien Breed 2 Coming Soon!""- Why are the cutscenes just a comic and not actual 3d rendered videos?- The whole story are in cutscenes- Only 1 Boss at the end of the game- Short storyline (5 missions)Overall, even with a poor and short storyline, repetitive gameplay, the game displays great graphics, sound, survival elements, and a few types of aliens, and maybe CO-OP I can just barely recommend to buy this game when its less than $5.VERDICT: 6/10 - MIXED BAG			",171,36,8,18,9,3,15

												Boring. Just plain out boring.I couldn't even bare an hour of this thing. Alien Breed: Impact isn't an action game it's a point and click adventure in an action games clothing. All you ever seem to do is find out something doesn't work, find the object that makes it work when you rub them together then proceed to the next thing that doesn't work; oh wait there's aliens, don't forget the aliens. The aliens in it really it has nothing to offer for you, the aliens are far from scary, laughable even I hadn't even realised that they were supposed to be the enemies because of how lackluster they were. The environment are just linear corridors and I swear all the lighting effects are just there to mask how drab and boring the game looks as a whole. You could have the same amount of fun playing this buy going through your system files one by one then stopping ever now and then to grab a pair of keys shove them into your screen and making gargling alien sounds.On the plus side there were no bugs encountered during my small amount of time playing this product. So just keep moving there is nothing to see here.+ Didn't encounter any bugs- Plain boring- Aliens aren't scary and there just to waste time- Level design and level mechanics (find something to make something work) are tedious- Unpleasing to your eyes3/10			",250,31,1,38,11,3,34

												Do not buy this, or any of the Alien Breed games.Team 17 has♥♥♥♥♥♥in a bag and attempted to sell it to people.This is the first installment in the downloadable three part Alien Breed series. The story, while slightly interesting in the beginning, devolves into being completely uncompelling as your character essentially becomes a repairman. In the entire four hour campaign of the game, there is one new gameplay mechanic introduced for the final boss. You are never taught the mechanic, but it is required to not only complete the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, but to defeat the final boss.The graphics and gameplay is essentially Alien Swarm, minus anything fun. The movement feels clunky, the environments feel too small, there are few weapons and the upgrades are forgettable. There is no multiplayer of any kind, which actually could have possibly saved this game.It feels too short, and Team 17 are milking $30 out of people by selling three games that should be $5 each, or one $15 game.

												I avoided Alien Breed: Impact for a long time. This was mainly due to the hum drum demo and the fact that Valve's team (at the time) had released Alien Swarm for free. But (as is always the way) I got this game free in a humble bundle at some point. And as luck would have it, this week, I was in the mood for some alien-shooting adventures!First up, the tone at the start of the game left me feeling unsure about things, with those weird comic-art-with-voiceover-on-top, bits. But, this quickly changed once I picked up a nice weapon and started performing my character's engineer tasks. And...once I started kicking bottom, too! Honestly, I enjoyed this game. There's very little to complain about, overall. However, as always, let me get some downers out of the way first...It's too easy on Veteran (Normal) mode. Although there were some challenging rooms along the way, I probably died around 3-5 times overall. Two of which, were down to me dying from a gas filled room that I hadn't realised was killing my character! It's also worth mentioning that I killed the final boss on the first go, with very little effort! So, yeah, it's fun, but, too easy. Which, as you might imagine, means that there's not much challenge. Perhaps the next difficulty up, would be adviseable?? Oh, btw, the ending is very...abrupt. It felt like those old shareware games that teased the next episode. So, I didn't feel hugely accomplished once I'd beaten the game :PAs I mentioned earlier, I wasn't totally sold on the comic bits at the beginning of each level. These fill in the story, but It felt like they cut corners here. They could've had simple in-engine cutscenes that would've fit, better. Still, that's just my opinion. Maybe they were going for a comic book type look at this point. Oh, and, your character is a little dismissive and arrogant towards your ""friend,"" throughout. I remember saying out loud at one point, ""you're a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥ aren't you?""Apart from that, I enjoyed what Alien Breed had to offer. There were a nice amount of weapons, decent action, a nice amount of enemy types to keep things interesting, and I enjoyed exploring the ship to see what I could find. It almost felt a teeny-tiny little bit Metroidvania. But only a tiny bit. I liked having to look for medkits, ammo and finding logs, etc. That gave it a little more substance.Overall, I give Alien Breed a thumbs-up!			",698,140,29,48,30,6,67

												In short: I got this game for $1.75, and it's definitely worth that. It's a 3D-Isometric shooter - not quite top-view - which has you roaming corridors, following waypoints, deactivating systems, reactivating systems, repairing things, and... shooting a lot of insect-like alien creatures.At its heart, it's a fine game. A very nice upgrade to an old, old classic.Graphically it's great. The ship in the opening act, for example, feels real. You can catch glimpses of its exterior and what's outside as you play, which adds to the atmosphere.  The place is a wreck. It's burning, air is venting, lights are flickering, and creatures keep trying to eat you.Where it fails is in that the creatures just... appear. You go into an area, and they crawl from holes in the ground based on whatever segment you happen to have triggered. This feels a bit ""Deus Ex Machina"" to me. I would have preferred the scripted stuff to have been kept a bit less obvious, with aliens just roaming the corridors, with you shooting or avoiding as per your preference.Just *knowing* that there's a few nasty aliens around the next corner, which you'll need to deal with, could have added a lot more suspense to the game. Having them magically burst up through the floor the moment you reach the middle of the room is... well, cheap.The action is nice. There really is a sense of being over-run in some parts, as you lay down a suppressing fire and fall back into more defensible corridors.  The dead aliens can mount up rather horribly.You can upgrade your gear too, by finding credits as you play, and visiting particular computer consoles. This doesn't seem to make much sense, but it works, so no complaints.The only other thing that annoyed me was the amount of back-tracking you have to do. You have a running gun-battle from one end of the ship to the other, only to get to your goal and be told that you're missing a key-card... which you now have to find... back where you were originally.  Then there's a problem with some power conduits, and you need to head across the other side of the ship... only to be told to come back to de-couple something. This happens a lot.None of this (apart from maybe finding a key-card) is something you can do on the way. You have to be hammering on the damn door before the computer bothers to tell you that you need to turn on the internal security system, which is about five minutes back in the other direction.The idea is to make best use of each map, I guess... but it did annoy me. I would have preferred to have been given a list of things I needed to do from the outset, and accomplish them as I went, before arriving at my goal. That way I'd feel like I had a bit more control.Overall, a fine game, with flaws. Well worth the discounted price, and probably one I can see myself coming back to now and again to move just that little bit further forward.  Not one I can see myself sitting down and finishing all in one go.			",118,34,1,29,53,0,32

Posted: November 28, 2014
												A very decent twin-stick shooter.  This game really does a lot of things right, but unfortunately falls just short of being a great game.  Let's start off with the premise of this game.  You are a battle hardened engineer (which I'm not sure those words go together) who is traveling on the massive ship, the Leopold.  You've just come out of a warp jump and your ship slams into a gigantic vessel that dwarfs your own.  Blah blah blah etc etc etc you can find out the rest in game, but the idea is basically having to go around and fix an enormous amount of problems that seem to never end on the Leopold, all while fighting off thousands of this never before seen alien species.  Nothing too original for the plot, and when it comes to the aliens, obviously borrows a lot from the Alien movies (which is not a bad thing).Now onto the game itself.  We'll go ahead and start with what the game does great and that is the graphics and environment.  The game looks phenomenal for it's price point and for when it was made.  The unreal engine in use here really shows off it's stuff as every room and enemy is very, very detailed.  Even the action itself looks downright awesome.  It's hard to get tired of obliterating countless aliens whenever the guns look this amazing in action.  Of particular note, the flamethrower looks incredible, and so do all of the fire physics.  The environment differences between the Leopold and the alien vessel are also a drastic shift.  While most of the electronics, doors, and corridors look the same (which raises a lot of questions), the alien vessel feels much more ancient and powerful than the Leopold just from the environmental shift.After that though, the game does start to falter.  The story is subpar throughout this first episode, but I will admit curiousity as to where that alien ship came from, and in general where those aliens came from.  After reading the logs, they speak of genetic experimentation that the aliens obviously went through so that only raises more questions.  At this time I'm halfway through the second game and very little more has been exposed.  Other than that, the characters are flat and predictable including the main character.  Any side characters besides MIA are quickly forgotten and seem to have no bearing on the game.  The gameplay itself is mildly entertaining.  Most of the time you'll be navigating from one room to another to fix *enter ship system here* while gunning down a number of random aliens that are constantly trying to murder you.  And....that's kind of the whole game.  There really isn't much else to speak of.  The guns are the generic AR, shotgun, flamethrower, pistol etc.  The enemy variety is also on the bland side as most of them will charge you relentlessly no matter what.  There's only one boss fight in the game and while slightly different from the normal gameplay, does nothing to change the status quo the game has already firmly set.Overall, if you can get this game on sale (like it is currently), go for it.  It's 5 hours of decent entertainment with maybe a few more hours stuffed in if you can find a co op partner.  Just don't be looking for an incredible game with endless hours of fun in store, because it's simply not there.Score - 6.5/10			",321,38,4,53,19,0,49

												Negative review, not recommending.About 7 hours (though I spent three extra getting the rest of the achievements) of tedious, repetitive gameplay. I've heard the other two games following this one have the exact same gameplay, with no improvement. The plot is not very memorable; all I know is that there is a ship that is always broken in one way or another and that the player has to fix it. That being said, it exposes way too much of the environment with this tactic. It's always ""go to this objective, kill aliens, fix it, kill aliens, go back to where you first started off, kill more aliens, rinse and repeat"". They tried to revive the classic Alien Breed, but this developer isn't doing so well nowadays. If you're a fan of monotonous works, it's for you. Otherwise, steer clear of it. I'll be honest, I did TRY to enjoy it, thinking that it was just my preference of games that made this so unappealing to me to play, but after reading tens of reviews about the lackluster gameplay, I feel that I can stand by my review.

												Team17 should have called this game ""Access Denied.""  I think there was more time clocked hearing the overhead intercom voice telling me the way I could not go, than actual cutscene dialogue. Like most games, I played this on the highest difficulty.  Right out of the gate, I play most of my games on the highest difficulty.  Mostly because I have 25 years of experience gaming, partly because I hate myself, but mainly, I hate the option when given.  Make the game one difficulty and don't♥♥♥♥♥♥with it.  Given the choice most people will go with easy and ♥♥♥♥♥foot their way through a game then claim they truly beat it and that bothers me.  Difficulty levels shouldn't exist. Developers should say, I'm going to make my game this hard, and if you can't beat it, that's your problem. Anyways, my point here is that I actually started this game two years ago when I first bought the trilogy and started it on the hardest mode for the achievement, didn't like it, and didn't touch it again until recently.  Still didn't like it, but I beat it and got all the achievements and I'm a little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that this is a trilogy and I still have two more games to play.The ambiance and graphics are nice, and the music knows when to pick up at just the right time to give those tough battles that extra punch.  The music is pretty cool as are the sound effects.  The controls are butt, the interface is butt and the game is slow with burps of enemies coming at you, then more ""Access Denied.""  This is why I stopped.I don't know if all the Alien Breed games play like this.  The first game out in 1991 and Team17 is pretty much a three trick pony. They have survived on aliens, frogs, and worms pretty much for twenty years, so they must be doing something right, and I am surprised this is one of those things.			",328,93,0,109,35,0,70

												Alien Breed is a rather simple but fun isometric view shooter. The game is set aboard a spaceship and the single player campaign lasts around 8-9 hours. Although the game mainly involves walking through dark corridors and shooting at giant alien bugs, it manages to maintain a good sense of atmosphere. The player gets to use 5 different weapons, several items, and faces a healthy variety of enemies, which does well at minimizing what could potentially have been a repetitive game. The situations vary greatly at times you might face one or two bugs at a time, and then at other times a whole wave would just burst out from the walls and floor around you and force you to battle for your own survival. The fact that enemies could come from anywhere doorways, vents, floor creates a sense of tension and keeps the player on edge. The plot is in a comic-book-style cutscenes, most of the things you do don’t seem to have much relevance. For most of the time when outside battles you just go around the huge ship searching dead people and lockers for spare ammo and credits (in-game money) and activate various computer systems in order to gain access to the next area. It could feel repetitive at times, but the main focus of the game is escaping from the aliens, so I suppose it’s not much of an issue really. There is also a chance to upgrade your weapons to give yourself a bit of an edge in combat. Each weapon has 3 different upgrade options: rate of fire, reload time, and damage per shot. Thought you can only ever have 1 upgrade active at a time for each gun, so the player will have to do some decision making and choose an upgrade that they feel is most suitable. This also opens a slight possibility for replay value. Without giving spoilers, I also want to mention that I was a bit disappointed with the final boss of the game. Its attacks kept repeating themselves over and over in a very repetitive pattern. However, this is only a mere 10-15 minutes of an otherwise very engaging and well-polished game. It’s quite simple at its core, but the quality of the presentation that it delivers is very respectable. Now after having completed the game, there are two more parts that await me and it seems the plot is still building towards something. This is not really a stand alone game, but more like a chapter of a book or an episode of a TV show. So I am quite eager to try out the second and third instalments in the series and see where this goes. Lastly to mention, the game also offers a co-op mode, which is a laught at time, thought it doesnt have the story-mode to it.			",82,9,1,9,4,0,7

												Good if you like birds eye view shooters that follow your mouse. Good graphics in all, but just a game to make you run back in forth over and over and over again. Do this, now run back to the other side of the ship. Good, no run back. Wait, maybe it was over there. Felt like a chore instead of a game.			",149,32,9,15,52,1,16

												An old skool style 3rd person shooter that combines combat, exploration and survival as you look to traverse five levels of an alien infested spacecraft.  Graphics are pretty, voiceovers and sound spot on, while enemies and weapons add to the overall Aliens-esque setting.  Nicely designed and well balanced levels provide a good challenge though repetitive in nature, which was not a problem (for me) due to the shortness of the game.  Achievements are all fairly logical and easy enough to get but getting someone to play through coop is an achievement in itself.Overall a very good little game to play the odd level now and again, if and when you get bored of playing your other games.

												I'd give it a 3.2 rating.Graphics, audio, and controls are good. The complete predictability of aliens and repetitiveness of missions make it a boring shooter. The upgrade system is uninspired and slow to progress. There is only one strategy you need to defeat all types of aliens. The backtracking throughout levels is very tedious. This same game with an XP system and improved upgrade system would be a 5/10. Add to that more varied alien AI and missions and it would be a 7/10--a solid game. Sadly, it has neither of those.I wouldn't recommend this, even if you got it from a humble bundle for a dollar. You should feel entertained when playing games.			",205,32,4,27,26,3,45

												This game is an atmosphereic top-down shooter with great gameplay, gloomy and dark graphics, and a not really good story. It's more of a throwback to older DOS and Amiga shooters, and it certaintly succeeds at updating the gameplay of those types of games for modern gamers. I had a blast with it, but to be honest I didn't finish the thrid episode. By that point the gameplay just got repetitive. Give AB:I a shot, and if you liked it you'll probably like the next two.

Posted: September 16, 2016
												Quick Summary: Top-down isometric shooter very similar in gameplay to the Alien Shooter/Zombie Shooter series’ of games. Impact is the first of 3 “episodes” so don’t expect a complete story if you only play the first game. Fortunately, the Alien Breed Trilogy has been bundled before, so chances are you already own all three games. All three Alien Breed’s have co-op multiplayer, but you’ll need to bring your own friends, because the multi-player community is basically dead.You play the chief engineer of the space ship Leopold, which has crashed into a mysterious ghost ship over an alien planet. With the help of Lieutenant MIA (a “synthetic”) you’re tasked with trying to repair the ship as it slowly gets pulled into the planet’s atmosphere to inevitable doom. Unfortunately for you, the ghost ship is infested with ALIENS!!! It’s a good thing you can find guns and grenades just lying around everywhere you go.You control your character with keyboard and aim with the mouse, just like Alien Swarm/Alien Shooter/Zombie Shooter, and like these other games, you have the opportunity to purchase upgrades in game “shops” which also double as save points. Note that you can only upgrade each gun 1 time and there are only like 5 different types of gun. While most of your money will be spent upgrading guns, there are also some other essentials: ammo, health packs, and grenades. Money is found all over the place, including in the corpses of humans that are strewn all over the ship. You’re going to spend a lot of time looting lockers and corpses, many of which are empty. The game is broken up into 5 long levels, each of which take about an hour to beat if you’re taking your time exploring. The layout of each map is available to you right from the start of each level, but you’ll find most doors are locked until you can open them during “story” events. As for enemies, there aren’t that many different types, and they don’t usually come in huge swarms, but they do have just enough life to force you to walk backwards as you lay down heavy firepower. Make sure you’re stocked up on health packs because taking damage from the little ankle biters is almost inevitable when you’re trying to focus fire on the big guys. Note that you walk pretty slowly in this game, and while you can sprint by holding the “shift” key, your stamina runs out pretty fast. This seems to be intentional, along with the slow process of looting lockers and opening doors, to make sure you can’t just run right through the game bypassing a lot of the enemies.Pros:+Decent graphics for a cheap indie game.+I like shooter games where you can purchase health/upgrades in a horror/survival type environment. You can only save in specific areas of the game, so you need to move carefully and conserve ammo/medkits.+Co-op multiplayer if you have a friend who also owns the game. The campaign isn’t co-op but there are 3 multiplayer maps available. Co-op is “harder” because you start each level with almost nothing, and you need to split the loot. With less money for both players, you don’t really have enough for weapon upgrades and ammo/health run out a lot faster. Also, the camera is locked in co-op and you both need to be within a certain distance of each other.Cons:-Dead multiplayer if you don’t bring your own co-op partner.-The camera “perspective” system can take some getting used to because you’re constantly swiveling the camera around to get a good view. The game’s view is a little more zoomed in than I’m used to, so aliens on the edge of your vision are only a second or two away from pouncing on you. -There isn’t that much voice acting during missions, and a lot of the dialogue comes as subtitles in the middle of the action. This means while you’re fighting aliens you will miss a lot of what people are saying.Overall, the Alien Breed games are fun to go through, and won’t take up too much time. Each game is about 6 hours long if you’re just going to play the single player campaign. The gameplay is basically the same in each game as well, with one or two new types of alien in the second and third games, and a few different guns as well. I just stuck to the basic assault rifle / shotgun though, since it’s hard to gauge exactly how strong some of the “fancy” guns are.  ",655,205,34,57,43,12,103

												tl;dr: mediocre repetitive gameplay, meh storyline, pretty graphics albeit uninspired.You get 5 long missions that take you between 50-90 minutes each to complete.Pros: Decent Engine, UE 3, therefore the game features many visually complex effects (dynamic shadows and lights, detailed models and plenty of furniture scattered around) and there's plenty of eyecandy. It runs smooth on a fairly average computer like mine. Didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, just a few graphic glitches and the occasional pathfinding screw-ups of my enemies. Some fights are well designed and pretty exciting (very few to be honest)Cons: Plot revolves around a stereotypical Gruffy McGruff shooting aliens in a starship while taking orders through intercom by a trite Cortana-like assistant (admittedly this time she's got an actual synthetic body). Kill the slimy boss at the end, watch the cliffhanger, yadda yadda yadda. Your ship is badly damaged so there are many random explosions and A CRAPTON of INTENTIONAL SCREEN STUTTERING. So much stuttering in fact that I wanted to stop playing the damn thing just halfway through. Luckily it becomes more bearable in the second half especially in the final mission. Enemy design leaves a lot to be desired. There are 6-7 enemy types. They are all grey-brown insectoid creatures, usually with 4 legs, sometimes standing upright like humanoids. And then you get those obnoxious little insect thingies that explode in your face. They have been plopped into EVERY single level of the game, they are NOT satisfying to kill and they are the most common enemy by far. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The camera is not fixed, it's very close to your character and you must move your cursor towards the edges of the screen to rotate it. Typical scenario: you are ambushed by 8 monsters, 4 in front of you and 4 behind (you see them as dots on the minimap). You can see the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s ahead alright, but the others are out of your field of view. You must rotate the camera, but this means that you won't be able to shoot properly at the suckers ahead because your crosshair is on the edge of the screen, slowly rotating the camera. Too much backtracking: you are constantly looking for a switch that lowers the lever that activates the console that deactivates the security system that grants you access to the control room that gifts you with yet another switch to pull that restores the core turbine number 2. Time for number 3. All the while I had NO idea why I was doing it NOR did I care. This would be fine if the environments were varied and interesting which leads me to... Incredibly samey levels. It's just a sequence of starship rooms and corridors with clutter and garbage scattered on the floor and the walls. There are only 3-4 brief changes of scenery like an hydroponics sector with plants and green lights or a sequence on the external hull of the ship. You only get 6 weapons + 2 grenade types. In general they lack a punch and never feel quite powerful except for the machine gun and the shotgun. You can upgrade them but you might have only ONE upgrade per weapon. Also, upgrades are as generic as the get: greater firerate, faster reload time, bigger damage per hit, THE END. You are forced to use terminals to save and upgrade your stuff. These terminals are quite rare and their menus take a lot to navigate. Ok, it's some thirty seconds but I'd rather just tap F6 and quicksave. Around the levels there are many corpses and lockers to loot. The looting takes about 3 seconds which would be fine if half the times our hero didn't find a whole lot of nothing. I died only once because I didn't notice I was being poisoned by some gas lying around. Enemies give you a hard time only when they literally blow a hole around you in cramped corridors that leave you little evading opportunities. No sense of Enemy/Weapons progression. Compare it with the first alien shooter, which is arguably the worst of its own series. Alien Shooter features hordes of thousands of enemies at a time, this sod does pitch you against 20 at most and usually much less, say 5. AS has tons of gore, this game got almost none. AS has you collecting ever stronger weapons that make your previous ones pale in comparison (the magma cannon pisses all over the shotgun) and then, when you feel invincible, it throws so many enemies at you that you'll feel like a little god on his own divine quest against overwhelming odds; in Alien Breed Impact I've been using the same assault rifle from start to finish (actually it performed much better than most of the later weapons like that puny laser rifle) against exactly the same enemies.

												Completed the first single player level. A top-down 3D alien-shooting game, visually themed like Dead Space. The game is good.  Although there is a lot of going back to the same places to pick-up keycards and all such stuff, it was an overall interesting journey.There are three levels exclusively created for online co-op. No one is playing online nowadays, but the online stuff works. Played online with a friend of mine just before an hour, i.e. on 17th November, 2014.Don't purchase it for $10 or something, you may regret. But if you can get if for up to $1 and if you have a friend you can play co-op with, may be this is a nice game to kill some time.What's more.................Lots of loot, different guns, upgradable weapons and in-game terminals to purchase ammo and medikits, sentrie guns and grenades. Some features are really good.			",568,172,18,47,35,4,71

												(The good thing about no-so good games, is you reward yourself by an harsh yet inspired review)So, what about Alien Breed: Impact? We know it's a remake of a 20 years old shooter by the original team. Seems like a great start.However, the actual Alien Breed: Impact from 2010 is a game about painfully setting camera angles ; while exploring all the rooms and corridors of an heavily damaged spacecraft ; in order to gather as much as possible useful items from storage boxes and corpses (weapons, ammo, medikit, grenades) and also... money ! Money so you can buy more of these and upgrade your gear from Intex's deepspace-proof vending machines ; in order to [butter]cut your way through waves / spawns of [not really] challenging aliens ; so you can reach the next locked door you'll have to open or broken engine you'll have to start or fix... Sorry, I find all of this boring.It's not a question of technical ability : Unreal Engine is solid, and Team 17 has a track record. It's about choices. Sometimes, game design is like pastry : you have the ingredients, but you have to be precise of quantities, order of composition and cooking heat / time - otherwise you end up with nothing.

												It's a good shooter. I will try the next two episodes too I think and the multiplayer. You should try it too.   As almost every game this could be better too ofcourse. There is story I guess but it doesn't dominate the game. It's mainly a shooter. I play in veteran level and it is not hard, so you should probably play it on elite level ;). My biggest problem with the game so far is the camera control. In the beginning I used the Q and E keys, then I discovered that you just have to move the mouse at the edge of the monitor to turn the camera. I am used to it now, but could be simpler.

The mouse is way too sensitive, and when you get rushed you shoot in a circle in all directions. Plus the assault rifle is underwhelming in its damage, as compared to the shotgun.Picked this up on a bundle - it's not worth 10 USD, maybe 1.99.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game....oh man this game...its so bad! The whole ""campaign"" is really dull and repetitive, consisting of the player running around doing chores for the computer-cyborg woman that you see briefly in the beginning cutscene. So the story goes something like this: Your ship captain ♥♥♥♥ed up and rammed your ship into some colony/military/I dont ♥♥♥♥ing know space hulk that was swarming with aliens that kill everyone on your ship and continually try to eat you the whole time. Your character is this buffed out engineer that has the ""badass"" voice about him and is supposed to be seen as a man that can get the job done with little to no words. However, he just comes out as someone that seems continually butthurt that he didnt get his latte for breakfast. He repairs the engine and shoots some aliens, he goes to hydroponics and shoots some aliens, and then he boards the big♥♥♥♥♥ship that you crashed into and shoots some aliens with bigger better guns. Game ends with the main character kinda face to face with the biggest alien he's ever seen and quite frankely looks like he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ his pants with a streched frown on his face while muttering the words, ""Gotta go"" to the cyborg woman that is like, ""the ♥♥♥♥ is going on over there?"". Thats the game. 9 and a half hours of running around and shooting aliens while flippin switches.Yep. Pretty bad. Get Alien SWARM though, that game is free and is wayyyyy more kickass than this thing			",71,3,1,5,4,1,22

												Oh boy is this game bad. Plot: 1/10Story-telling is terrible, gives you no background as to what you're even doing in outer space, why you crashed into a mysterious ship that appeared out of nowhere except that ""your ship sensors were glitchy"", no character background except really boring, wordy log notes in your inventory, no explanation how come the ship is flooded with alien lifeforms. Main character is unrelatable, zero character relations and the list goes on.. Perhaps the previous games in the series may have given some background but if you're to hop into this game without playing them, you're absolutely clueless as to what's going on.Gameplay: 2/10The only good part is its arcade-shootery feel. Those that like a simple shooter game may enjoy it. Other than that, pretty much flaws everywhere. Camera and movement control feels so linear and uncomfortable. Stage design is confusing and terrible, you'll get lost easily if you don't refer to your inventory map every now and then, needless explosions everywhere just to give a sense of urgency and danger. Here is the worst part: Majority of the time will be spent on pointless backtracking to activate something you passed by before you can progress to the next area. Essentially the game makes you run around like a headless chicken just to extend the ""feel"" of each mission length. Progression: 1/10Hardly any here. All weapons have the same upgrade paths, its better rof, faster reload or higher damage, thats it. You can't develop your character in any other sense.VerdictWould I recommend this game? Only to people who have too much money on their hands and too much time to spare.			",15,0,0,1,0,0,3

												Came across this game a few years ago by accident. Played the demo and loved it! Intuitive gameplay, simple controls and GREAT GRAPHICS and Physics! Bought the complete trilogy 2 days ago on steam-sale. It looks even better than I remembered and worth every Euro!Pros:- Great graphics- Great (Nvidia) physics- Great atmosphere- Great gameplay- I really love the graphics-style (but that is personal :)Cons:- Very few adjustable graphic settings- Too much back-tracking (unlogical ship lay-out - I think the architect was drunk designing this ship...)- Campaign too short - I would love a map-editor in this game for designing your own levels)- Multiplayer/Coöp is dead.I would recommend the trilogy-version, so that you can play all levels. Definitely worth a buy!			",51,0,4,4,5,0,15

												ABI is a pretty cool game.  It takes on the feel of a top down shooter, kind of RTS-y but with out the RTS elements.  The story is fairly decent, nothing ground breaking but it is not boring either.The balance seems to be about perfect, there is never a time where the game has felt unfair so far.  You can do quite a bit of free roaming in this game, however it is still linear as far as the story goes.I have not beaten it yet, but it seems like this series is pretty good.  If you are a sci-fi fan, check it out.I give it a 7/10.			",701,169,5,143,118,7,150

												Alien Breed comes in ""3 Episodes"" and if you like games like the Free2Play game Alien Swarm then you should try all three Episodes of Alien Breed. That would Be:Alien Breed: ImpactAlien Breed: AssaultAlien Breed: DescentCan recommend. Only flaw i found was the Co-op part of the game, its a stand alone four diffrent missions that you can play, and not the main campaign played in Co-op (Sadly). Later games even have survival mode.

												Played the second first then the first one since I got the second one in one of the steam events. The plot is actually cool, I like top-down shooters like these, good time killers. Not much customization and can be challenging at times. Worth the couple of bucks it was.			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

												70%Alien Breed: Impact is the first episodes of the new Alien Breed trilogy which is the 21st century remake of the oldie, well known franchise of the same name. While the game is capable to grab the player from the beginning, its fast paced and has a story to tell, it has its faults which is coming out in the gameplay itself. The controls are responsive, but if you ever played with Shadowgrounds, you would wish a similar controls instead of the one you have here, namely the camera and character control. Unlike in Shadowgrounds where you was able to attach the camera rotation to the character, here you have to rotate the camera independent from the character, which is a bit flustrating at few places, especially at one place where you have to escape from an enemy and the camera controls is very annoying. The storyline is offering a mystery as your starship, the cruiser Leopold is crashing into a larger unknown craft. Right after that hell spreads all over your ship as aliens starts to decimate the surviving members of your crew. You, Chief Engineer Conrad have to find out what this space ship of alien origin is, while you also have to ensure the safety of the Leopold. As Alien Breed is an episodic release, you'll get all your answers in the second and third episodes, but unfortunately as you step onboard the alien ship in the first episode, Impact, some of the textures of the alien ship is spoiling some twists from the later episodes. The game itself is a simple fastpaced shooter, with five huge levels to discover and the episode ends with a cliffhanger (Each episodes have 5 levels, so the whole game is 15 levels long.). In the game you may gather credits to buy ammo and upgrade weapons, even sentry guns, while you have to repair critical elements of your space ship and fight your way through dozens of waves of alien hordes. The atmosphere is good, the environment is detailed and beautiful for this game, but the game can be a bit repetative at times. It's a decent shooter, which is not great, but its still a good experience in the very rare sci-fi, top-down isometric survivor shooter genre. But if you loved the original series or if you ever loved Shadowgrounds, give a try for Alien Breed: Impact.			",245,47,4,39,15,2,55

												I could only handle 30 minutes of this game. There was very little action, and most of the time I spent was doing fetch-quests. Getting lost in the copy-pasted corridors slows down progress and makes it very tedious, which is increased by every action taking a few seconds to complete, such as looting corpses.

												I very clearly did not play this game very long. It's not a game that requires a lot of gameplay, however. This is not a JRPG which will eat up all of your team, this is not the kind of grandiose, pretentious indie game that demands you play it through a dozen times over, no.This, is Alien Breed.It's just an incredibly average, top-down shooter. Pass.So let's go over what I did like. I liked... um. I liked the infinite ammo pistol. Those are always fun. I think it's nice that the devs sort of threw you a bone. And, um, what else...Okay, what I didn't like. The graphics. They're terrible for 2010. You know what also came out in 2010? Just Cause 2. I sometimes consider this game a benchmark, at least for that year. It's a beautiful open world game that's incredibly inexpensive on your hardware. Alien Breed is a linear top down shooter, and it's ugly. It's not that bad, but it's just incredibly uninspired. The world itself looks about as generic a space ship as you'd ever see, reminds me of Aliens, you know, the movie.Furthermore, this is Unreal Engine 3.0. This game should look awesome. On top of that, they've actually ♥♥♥♥ed up somewhere, because the post-processing makes everything ♥♥♥♥ing blurry, and the incredibly detailed options menu you know and love from EVERY OTHER UNREAL ENGINE GAME is just gone, there's nothing. You can like, set a resolution, and turn one or two things on or off, that's it. Reeks of console port, and I hate it.Then there's the gameplay. It's just average. Nothing bad, nothing good. What you'd expect. There's like, 5 guns in the whole game from what I gather? That's... that's awful. Just awful. I didn't expect Borderlands, but still. The assault rifle makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. They kind of went a sort of 'survival' angle? When your hp gets low enough, your movespeed slows. You can sprint only so long. But your assault rifle can hold 200 rounds. I'm sorry, what? 200? Are you guys trying to be realistic or not? Pick one. You can't mix and match.If this was a super unrealistic, fun romp through alien obliteration land, I'd be more leniant. As it is, this game on the whole feels like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt at a game, as if the developers were only really doing it for the money. And maybe they were. There's no love, or joy in this game. It doesn't feel at all like they really enjoyed doing what they did. Not at all.No, I don't recommend this game. It's just not good.			",433,58,5,45,25,5,63

												Alien Breed: Impact, isn't the best game ever. It's mediocre at best. This game isn't bad, it's just it's controls I don't like AT ALL. If the camera AND controls were better, i would recommend this game to everyone. But, there are some of you who like this game, and I don't judge. It's really not a bad game.Alien Breed: Impact, (I will call it ABI (Ab-E)), is a mediocre game. The camera angle, and controls are BAD. You move around with the arrow keys, which makes it hard to use the mouse. You shoot using the mouse. They could've fixed this by making the moving controls WASD. And the camera angle is bird's - eye. And it doesn't move around well. Which makes the game pretty hard to play. The game also has way too little achivements, and could use some more. The concept of the game, however, isn't bad. So, there are many cons, and little pros.Overall, this game is mediocre. to say the most. The concept is good, while the controls and camera are terrible. But, if you are used to these kinds of controls and camera, this game is for you. If not, then just keep searching for another game.			",117,11,2,11,9,1,12

												I'll try to keep this short, not only for those who don't feel like reading but because there isn't that much to say about this game.I found this wasn't a very good game overall. Some elements were good but not enough to redeem it as a whole. Its a fast paced, isometric shooter in a futuristic sci-fi settings. You get a small selection of guns in which you use to kill aliens as you progress through one bland environment after another. The combat itself feels fairly solid even though some things like interacting with objects and movement feel clunky. Also, the story feels pretty tacked on to what is already a mediocre game.Score: 5/10(Maybe wait until the trilogy goes on sale for dirt cheap if you're looking to buy)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe I am just too old for this type of game, or don't dedicate the time needed. It looks great, plays great, but I don't get far before I am trying to beat aliens off with my bare hands (ummm, that doesn't sound right).

												These games are much better than what is implied by their collective metascore. If you like the atmosphere and premise of the Dead Space series or DOOM 3, then theres a really good chance youll take to Alien Breed. If you go into it realizing its more of a mini-game than an all out AAA title, you wont be let down. While it may not be a true AAA title, the visuals and sound are of excellent production value. I can say that this game has better sound than half the games I play at 6 times the price. Its very atmospheric and well paced. One important caveat... PLAY THE GAME ON HARD (OR AS TEAM 17 CALLS IT, ELITE) If you play the game on hard, it becomes much more of a survival horror/shooter, where you have to economize your ammo and supplies, and you have to be careful of your next move around every corner. This is how the game is meant to be played. Again, if you like atmospheric, scifi, survival horror shooters with pretty damn great visuals for a small game and excellent sound, then you should absolutely check this out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alought the game used Unreal Engine, the game graphics isn't gorgeous enough. Not like Alien Shooter, this game will be more chanllge, but you still feel a stereotype after a while. I can't see any difference between other normal alien shoot games. If you just want to find a game in order to relax yourself, don't play this because each level is so long.这款游戏用的虽然是虚幻3的引擎，但是画面&效果并不出彩，倒是有可能会不习惯这样的视角（操作？）。虽然这款作品不像孤胆枪手那样无双突突，但是玩多了仍然会觉得很无聊，因为游戏元素孤胆枪手那些相比，几乎没什么变化，更别谈什么创新了。如果你只是想找一款悠闲的作品，而这款作品也不适合当作悠闲游戏，因为每一关的流程太长了，恐怕自己会先累死，那又何谈休闲呢。更重要的是，你可以选择比这更好的悠闲游戏。			",1010,324,33,155,93,7,173

												It's a Third person Space Shooter that has a bit of suspense to it.Nice Graphics,Not next Gen but good enough, Great ambient sounds.So far I'm liking the controls and gameplay.The controls are different than most in this genere, it is still a little odd after an hour of gametime.This is a good game but It seems unfinished.I can tell it is missing the cutscenes, it only has storyboards and voiceovers.It does have bugs.I used ALT+Tab to write this review and it locked up(blackscreen) the game.I'm playing more  in windowed mode these days anyway.

												Since all three games are exactly the same this is the same review as the other two games.Not a great game but it has great weapons and really good graphics and very smooth gameplay. Why it's not a great game:1: The biggest massive problem, CONSTANT AND NEVER ENDING FOCUS STEALING FROM START TO FINISH. Which really is not that prevalent in the first game but is a major problem in the second and third games. The game constantly, more than any game I have ever seen, even Resident Evil 6, steals focus from you during events to make the camera spin a little while zooming in and force you to watch the stupidest most mundane♥♥♥♥♥♥like a grate opening or a switch turning on or ANYTHING. It was like the developers found a little focus stealing trick and went way, way, way overboard with it. It is aggravating to astronomical levels and does not feel like you are playing a game but something where you get to play only sometimes when it lets you. Again, not so bad in game one but a massive problem in games two and three.2: CONSTANT screen shaking from explosions. It caused me to have to play each game from start to finish with a non-stop bad headache.3: The sound is very low. I have to turn my volume way way up when playing this game which is a big problem because of course I am not going to remember to turn it back down when I'm done playing so the next thing I do, like play music or play another much better game, blows my ♥♥♥♥ing ears off.4: There are very few types of enemies. I think 5 or less. And even those 5 all feel the same.5: The game is very, very repetitive. What you do in the first fifteen minutes is exactly what you do in every other minute of all three games. The game offers no variety at all, especially since all 3 games are mirror images of each other.6: The environments from the start to finish of all games is all exactly the same from game to game. Even though each game takes place in a different area of the ship or I think on different ships maybe, all three games are completely identical.7: All 3 games are very short, about 4 hours each.8: Crashes/glitches. I don't think I had any trouble with the first two games, maybe one or two crashes in the second game. The third game has crashed three times now. Once early, then half way through it, and now near the end. Their forum pin says it could be a file validation to fix it, but who cares when the games have the other bad problems I pointed out. And YES I understand it is a problem on my end. But no other games crash so it is a problem on my end caused by something to do exclusively with this game in particular and none of the other 150+ games I have installed.It's sad because the games graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is very, very smooth. But because of the main flaws being so incredibly bad, I can only recommend them if you can catch them on sale like I did for $5.65 for all 3 games. Their normal price of $10 each is laughable. Like throw your head back and audibly laugh loud. Once I play through them I'm never coming back to them, ever.Since all 3 games are the exact same, only one score is needed. Production quality in some areas like graphics and control is 8/10, everything else 5/10. Overall, 5/10. Badly missed opportunity for a all-time favorite cult classic. Whoever made this is jarringly inept.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												This is a TERRIBLE game that I still LOVE because it has the formula and underlying game mechanics that work for me.  But most people will hate this game.You're basically exploring a modular space station, and as you enter different areas, aliens burst out of the surrounding environment and you have to exterminate them with your array of weaponry before they chomp you to death.If that simple description doesn't appeal to you, then run, don't walk away from this game.  Because that's all you'll be getting over and over.PROS:- Simple to play- Very difficult (I enjoy tough games)- Lots of weapon-switching strategy neededCONS:- Repetitive and predictable- Garbage story- No way to anticipate enemies - you'll be constantly jumped from behind- Too much back-tracking- Too much ground clutter makes moving a chore- Screwy aiming controls at times			",132,16,5,15,7,4,16

												This is a very fun and exciting top-down shooter from the creators of Worms.It's got great graphics, it's fun, exciting, and challenging without being overly difficult or annoying.The gameplay consists of your controlling a marine through 5 stages of corridors and rooms, searching for weapons such as Shotguns, Laser Rifles and the powerful Ion Spike, or items such as a Med Kit, Armor, Grenades, or the useful Sentry Gun which can be placed in specific power points in the maps. You will also find Intex Terminals, which will allow you to buy more ammo, sell unwanted items, and save your game.A variety of aliens will burst from walls and the floor and attempt to EAT YOU as you move around the maps, so always be alert and watch your back. Things can get frantic and dangerous if your not careful.I highly recommend this game! Even after completion, you may find it fun to keep playing to get better Leaderboard scores, or to help your friends get co op achievements.			",32,9,2,25,0,0,10

												     Since i picked up the bundle on a steam sale, this review is based all on three games, rather just the first... That being said, the trilogy has been a blast to play, although It's not quite like the original as there's no respawning aliens. Nor is it really like 'Dead Space"" as some have said, other then being set on a derelict ship and the suit telling you your health status -like Issac's rig-which is rather useless since you HUD tells you that very info anyway. As far as the missions go, you DO go from one area all the way back to a previous area, but that didn't bother me.    One last word of advice to those who DO buy the game: there's a little fix on the forums that turns the controls, which by default, as the mouse is moved more towards the side of the screen, the camera rotates, more into those of 'Shadowgrounds"" by merging the two together so that aim and rotation is controlled at the same time. This is done by going into 'C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\alien breed impact\AlienBreedEp1Game\Config\DefaultInput.ini', and changing 'bUsingFPSMouseAim= FALSE' to 'TRUE'. A great fix for gameplay EXCEPT during boss battles. Especially in the third game because you can't face the enemys in the proper direction so I suggest changing it back during these battles. overall though, a solid peice of enertainment.

												I just completed Impact, and I am looking forward to starting the second installment. This isn't the most exciting thing ever, but if you get it on sale it is worth it. The weapons are fun to use, and the aliens are pretty diversified. There are some cool effects- again nothing groundbreaking, but the way that they were implemented was fun. The only frustrating thing is if you get slammed into a corner with a lot of aliens raining down, you can't get any shots off and have to resort to melee which may or may not help. Also, there was a lot of backtracking, but I wouldn't say that it was annoying at any point because aliens are constantly ripping out of the floors and walls to attack. I took a lot of photos during gameplay because the atmosphere was nice as well. The only glitch was at the end boss second phase, the boss was glitching around all tweaked out, but it didn't prevent me from ending it.			",424,213,9,52,22,3,81

Experience pressing and holding the A button to fill a progress bar like Dude-1's never done before.

												In one sentence - Short, sweet and repetitive.I picked it up for free, but worth it if on sale (~50%).Gameplay is fun, even if the standard AR is extremely OP.A few issues that prevent this from being a great game - Graphics haven't aged that well, with some clipping and stutters. Starship Trooper/Aliens enemies are very bland, and can barely be distinguished one from the other. Also, and this is the most annoying - it's in 3 parts. Story ends abruptly and disappointingly.Takes less time, I had about 2 hours of standby (finished in Elite mode).In short, if you like flipping lots of switches and shooting aliens in the face for a few hours, pick it up on the cheap.

												I wish there was an option besides ""do"" and ""do not"" recommend this game.Alien Breed: Impact is a well made game. The graphics are on the Unreal Engine, and well done. The environments are varied, and though the story is linear and the style of telling it is something that is very old in style, it is done satisfactorily.The complexity of this game is small enough and the design/playability simple enough that I would recommend this game be released on tablets, and maybe a dumbed down version for phones. This gave the impression to me like it was a very well made tablet game that had a PC release. I think there would be a mobile market for this game.If the game is on sale, pick it up, if you are into this style. The developers provided a demo, and I would recommend that to find out first.

												A very interesting and playable game by Team 17. The game is a top-down shooter style game, much like the old Alien Breed games of the 90's. The controls are pretty tight and the graphics still look great today, and while the story is not much to write home about and it is the typical ""O noes, our ship just got itself halfway embedded into an alien ship coming out of hypespace! Halp!"" fare it is still great fun. Just goes to show what a competent and experienced team can create. Team 17 has a long tradition of making this series and it shows.This game series even has 2-player Co-Operative mode, which is something not many games have. This alone makes it a must buy for people who enjoy these kinds of games with a friend. I recommend the whole trilogy, it is well worth it.			",676,70,46,55,37,2,65

												Isometric sci-fi shooter. Fix that ship, blast them aliens. Gunfrenzy-facehugger-backtrackfest. Your ship is wrecked and full of aliens. You have guns, an engineer’s degree and an android guide to tell you how to get things done. Test your cardio running all over the place blasting unwelcomed guests while enjoying the smooth animations, beautiful lightning, realistic effects and overall outstanding graphic design (with the exception of the GUI who sadly doesn't look as polished as the rest.)For moments it feels like you're in there, trying desperately to avoid being killed by hordes of vicious aliens, thinking if that tin can of a ship won't give up on you before you can do something about it. Only one thing breaks the illusion: for some reason the camera can turn only on 45 degrees intervals, making it difficult to orient yourself and avoid being attacked by surprise. With some good will and patience you can get used to it, but then you realize you're a space errand boy who's forced to backtrack every single time a task is completed, just to check if everything worked as it was supposed to. With time, that sensation grows and start to erode the fun. You start to wander... Who designed this ship? Surely someone not worried about time, who enjoys long walks and repetitive tasks. Like a puppy (or it was Intex?) Sod off Intex!To sum up, with a more detailed and polished interface; and without so much walks up and down the same corridors this game would have turned out way better. The graphics and animations are great, the sound effects complete the illusion of being 'there' and the music rounds it up well. The plot is what it is and the repetitive nature of the story development kills the fun after an hour or two, but there are quite a few reasons to come back and play again and try your hand on different difficulty levels or even multiplayer.

												I always had fond memories of this game as a youth, so when I rediscovered it recently I was stoked to play it.  Just as good as I remembered, teamwork is key in co-op mode, managing resources and keeping up communication can get you through the tough areas.  Highly recommend buying the pack with all 3 games in it, inexpensive for the amount of gameplay you'll get.			",72,2,1,1,0,0,1

												Shameful cash in from and old Amiga classic? Certainly seemed that way as they rushed these titles out. But while it wont overly win originality points, it actually does what all other have failed to do: improve the original idea , keeping ""fun"" as it's backbone. Less annoying than the original this is a totally new developement from the ground up. But manages to capture the atmosphere and story created in the original. It manages it really well. It's worth a few quid and i thought it would just be a trashy remake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game gives me a massive headache. The camera rotation is terrible. Also the terminal menu has this flashing-warp look to it that is hard to focus on what you are trying to do at each terminal, e.g. buying ammo, upgrades, items.The game seems to have you go from point A to B, then back to A, then back to B, then to C, then back to A. It is like this through the game. Mix in the camera rotation just to get it set behind your character, and it's pretty tough to play. This doesn't even take in the difficulty (or lack-there-of) of the enemy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its a very well made 3rd person shooter, with a story straight out of the Alien Movies, which is executed flawlessly and with some non stop (albeit light) action.I played it at Veteran Mode right away and the dificulty seemed rather mild even at such, so if you want a harder experience go straight for the most dificult mode. There isnt alot of variety and in many ways it does seem repetitive, however even so it grabs a hold of you, making you feel like you must see it through.Overall an enjoyable game - one which is also suitable for younger members of the family.

												OK game in the mold of OK sci-fi movie like Starship Troopers. Not too demanding, just run around the ship and kill tons of aliens popping out from walls and floors. Story and tasks are irrelevant really, the game is pretty linear with occasional secret room. There're no bugs (apart from aliens), graphics, sounds and UI are serviceable. Weapons are varied enough even though there's only 6.Overall it's an OK game, nothing outstanding and nothing underwhelming. I finished it in 8 hours, being slow player and looking under every rock.			",95,46,3,22,36,2,63

The cutscenes between chapters are a bit boring and the voice overs can seem really bad. I give it a 2.5 out of 5 or so.  I would recommend this if you want something to keep your interest for a little while.  Just a note that the final boss battle was glitchy when I played so be careful.			",9,3,0,3,0,0,0

												as a long-time fan of the Alien Breed franchise (at least the top-down ones) since the Amiga days, I was more than just a bit reluctant of seeing these new iterations of the games that I played and loved/hated during my youth (they were and still are among the most challenging games I've played, even in two-player)but I was pleasantly surprised by this game - it truly does 'feel' and [play] like an 'updated version' of a classic game [should be]sure it's not nearly as challenging, [mainly] due to the fact that you can actually [save your progress], but the 'feel' is there and it doesn't just 'look like a prettier version' of the classic, but rather what it sets out to be - an updated version of a classicI am certain that if I was to analyze the game on a deeper level and compare it to other titles of the time of its release, I would certainly be able to find flaws and quirks, [but] this is a good ol' fashioned arcade-style shooter with upgradable weapons and a great atmospheremy only gripe is that the multiplayer part still takes place on 'the same screen' (i.e. the players are unable to move outside of each-other's viewing range)apart from that, I'd say that other companies from the era should look at this as a prime example of how to update your old classics in a way that stays true to its roots and at the same time adding nothing more but the necessities of keeping up with the times.

												If you've played one alien/monster/zombie/critter top down shooter you've played them all. This is virtually identical to Shadowgrounds, Alien Swarm, and that zombie one that I can't remember the name of right now. Yeah, they're terribly original.			",381,117,3,68,29,4,47

												I can't remember how many hours were wasted in the computer lab on the original version of this. And now its been made into a nice little isometric dungeon crawler. Graphics are quite decent and gameplay rocks. Just as much fun as the original. Though, you need to play all three games to actually get the full story (but at my pace which was about 6 hours per game) for an $8 investment, that was a pretty good return! If you're expecting some kind of action RPG, its not and there is no real depth at all. Its really just a nice old-school game with fresh paint. Hours of fun for those who just like to shoot stuff.

												This game is fun in its own right.  The gameplay is very linear and repetitive, but the amount of aliens that can be thrown at you  will make you forget about that for awhile. The cutscenes between chapters are a bit boring and the voice overs can seem really bad. I give it a 2.5 out of 5 or so.  I would recommend this if you want something to keep your interest for a little while.  Just a note that the final boss battle was glitchy when I played so be careful.			",9,3,0,3,0,0,0

												Decent top down shooter, much better with a friend, but the overall feeling of the game is anticlimactic, especially once you reach the larger creatures. Get it if you're looking for a casual shooter to mess around in, but nothing else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game. It didn't do so well in popularity since it competed with a free game released by steam in this games opening few weeks.This game has a lot to offer. Can upgrade weapons and find different weapons. Even though I haven't upgraded everything yet, I feel I wanted more upgrades per weapon.			",245,34,3,53,13,1,25

												I have a hard time enjoying games lately and i must say this was a surprise for me.After reading a lot of mediocre reviews i got this game in a bundle and decided to give it a go.It's linear in a good way. There aren't too many weapons but there are certain upgrades so they don't feel as daunting.The difficulty is perfect (on the hardest setting atleast) I don't die from stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥unless i throw a grenade infront of me by missclick ♥♥♥♥ingstupidrazeronzacontrollercrap)The story is not really.. anything special imo. I haven't paid much attention.Decent variety in the aliens, enough to keep me satisfied at least.The first boss fight felt Really old.. Like a good nostalgic feeling, and it left me with a smile on my face.6-7/10 in my book.Oh, and one last thing. There are too many explosions in this game..			",510,98,23,69,25,4,42

												Overlooked for, well who knows what reason, Alien Breed's trilogy brings back the world of the isometric shooter. And it doesnt do it without the traditional slam-your-head-into-a-wall difficulty factor. Singleplayer is highly enjoyable, with most missions lasting about an hour. A great pick-it-up-and-go shooter as long as you can get used to the idea of the isometric aiming.			",229,27,5,52,31,0,14

												Recommend? Only at a discount.You're Conrad, some chief engineer guy who uh... seems to be lamenting at the begining about his family like any aged action movie hero.  I mean it's such an overused trope but I can't complain too much because this game is a re-imagining of an Amiga game and at the time... yeah.I liked the minimalistic cut scenes, somewhat comic book like and added a little bit to this immersion of some 13 year old wet dream of a sci fi thriller... though I wouldn't necessarily say scary.  If anything it really delivered for what it was, an alien smash fest arcade game.  Good for a few hour joyride of watching a grizzled badass be rude to his robot girlfriend while making everyone else look incompetant.The first episode really starts slow at first, you are fighting two types of aliens but it basically spends the entire level just explaining the core mechanics to you.  Though once you advance further, particularry level 3-5 you REALLY actually start to see some variety in the levels and level gimmicks.  Though it feels almost too late in some respects as most people may not get past level 2... especially when it starts off as some sort of escort mission and like most gamers would immediately respond with ""OH HEEEELLLLLLL NO"".The gameplay takes a little getting used to, typically noting that sometimes you seem to get caught of invisible snags near some objects and you can't always tell what you can or can't walk through.  Also the camera system... personally I liked having Q and E be my camera rotate controls... I just adjusted the direction accordingly depending on the room and corridor with 8 points of view... but for some reason aiming the mouse too far out will arbitrarily change the camera angle with a 360 point perspect.  Like seriously, stick with one... don't do both, it's annoying.I don't even know why you really have this tiny ""pop gun"" at the begining, but there are 5 weapons you and honestly I never really ran out of ammo... though if I did I'd be screwd because aside from the unlimited pop gun your melee attack is equally pointless and worthless.  It doesn't even feel like it has the response time to effectively handle the swarm of little kamikaze ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that bum rush you.Grenades don't start becoming useful till after level 2 when you have more stationary enemies that will hang back a bit.  I still don't know what the point of the stun grenade is... nothing stays alive long enough that would warrant you wanting to stun it.Those aside though, it's not a fast run and gun shooter, well it is if you want to get overruned and hacked to pieces constantly and requires a good amount of pacing.  Aside from the usual ""This is broken, go repair this!"" there seemed to be a nice sense of pacing and encounters.  The maps arn't overly complicated though sometimes you might get a little stuck and for a methodical arcade shooter I enjoyed it especially when it got to around level 4 and 5 when things really picked up speed.I like this game, though I would expect more from Team 17... especially with my only REAL complaint other than the beginning that is slow and a bit tedious IS THE FACT THAT IT'S 5 LEVELS FOR 9.99!!! Seriously the entire game should be all three episodes or each episode should just have that more content.Also What is with ""Co-Op""... why couldn't we just have Co-Op throughout the whole game.  Why does Vance and Barnes have to be in 3 missions and Robo-Girlfriend be unplayable?  What am I supposed to say to my buddy""Hey I found this cool steam arcade shooter remake of some old school amiga game, but co-op was only 3 levels""... this game would be so much more fun multiplayer.I feel like the end of episode 1 is the game I've been looking for in this game.I would like to see it done again, there are some seriously good things for it, though I can't justify the price especially with some of the glaring issues.

												Alien Breed: Impact is a fun little distraction that could fill up an afternoon gaming session or leisurely gaming over a weekend.  A strong atmosphere and interesting comic book style storyline sequence help create a game that is interesting if not enthralling over a short period.  You have to carefully balance ammunition versus upgrade purchases in this isometric shooter that is reminiscent in style to Alien Swarm although much less hectic and more methodically paced.  If you enjoy isometric shooters or just want a game that you can complete before getting tired of, Alien Breed: Impact can fill that gap.  It's not the strongest recommendation in the world but it is honestly much better than many games as it never out wears its welcome.			",258,31,4,56,30,1,77

												This is a decent game, and I have enjoyed playing it. It is a fun time for mindless Alien blasting, but the game is non-stop repetitive-fest and the story is easily forgetable. At least the Shotgun is amazing. >:D I hope the next two games add more to them.  AB trilogy was my first Steam Sale Purchase, so that gave me some kind of motivational boost to endure through to the end. I only recommend this if you just cannot get enough of shooting aliens. The most important thing that you should know before you consider buy this game is..... Disconnect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alien Breed: Impact is an amazing shooter with isometric view. I am not usually into this kind of games but this has captivated me. Since I am not good at this, I am playing it on easy and I am having fun. Not many weapons to choose from but those it does have, are adequate. The enemies are very sneeky and while that would normally be a con for me, I enjoy it in this game.So I suggest you try it even if you don't like this kind of games. It might surprise you.

												I just completed Impact, and I am looking forward to starting the second installment. This isn't the most exciting thing ever, but if you get it on sale it is worth it. The weapons are fun to use, and the aliens are pretty diversified. There are some cool effects- again nothing groundbreaking, but the way that they were implemented was fun. The only frustrating thing is if you get slammed into a corner with a lot of aliens raining down, you can't get any shots off and have to resort to melee which may or may not help. Also, there was a lot of backtracking, but I wouldn't say that it was annoying at any point because aliens are constantly ripping out of the floors and walls to attack. I took a lot of photos during gameplay because the atmosphere was nice as well. The only glitch was at the end boss second phase, the boss was glitching around all tweaked out, but it didn't prevent me from ending it.			",424,213,9,52,22,3,81

												Embark on a journey with Dude-1, who'se bald and his ship, Ship-1 bumped into a bigger ship Ship-2, and find a way to rescue Ship-1 from falling into Planet-1. Navigate from waypoint to waypoint through repetitive corridors shooting Aliens type 1, 2, and 3 with limited ammo. Shop and window shop with very limited money. Explore a technologically advanced spaceship where almost every door, elevator and bridge fails. Branching mission structure allows for epic tasks, such as routing power from a nearby generator to open Door-1, then accessing terminals 1, 2 and 3 as Generator-1 overloads, then maybe finding an access key to the Doors holding terminals 1, 2, and 3 which can be on another far side of the ship. Experience pressing and holding the A button to fill a progress bar like Dude-1's never done before. When the credits roll Dude-1 will be adept at pressing and holding the A button and observing progress bars; a useful skill as his adventure continues in Alien Breed 2.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
