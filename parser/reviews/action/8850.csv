												Why people insist Bioshock Infinite is amazing and that Bioshock 2 is a mistake is a complete mystery to me. One of the few games to actually make me cry, Bioshock 2 is a masterpiece following a masterpiece, a feat few other franchises can claim. I beg anyone who bothers reading this review. Buy this game, it is worth every penny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is an interesting beast: when it first came out, it was largely panned as being a rehash of the first game, and not a ""proper"" sequel. Yet, in retrospect having played Infinite, Bioshock 2 seems to be the one which will age most gracefully, and it has aged nicely thus far.Bioshock 2 is a First-Person Shooter in the vein of the original Bioshock, where you take on the role of a Big Daddy in the underwater city of Rapture. Where the original Bioshock explores the themes of Libertarianism, Bioshock 2 deals with Communism, perhaps not quite as strongly. Combat has been vastly improved by allowing access to both plasmids and guns simultaneously (which was used in Bioshock Infinite), while still retaining the full allotment of interesting weaponry. Additionally, trap versions of basically every form of plasmid are available for use in a series of ""protect the Little Sister"" sequences spread throughout the game.Bioshock 2 also handles the moral choice system much more eloquently than the first game, with some actual balance to the choices that need to be made - arguably the most successfully that I've found in any game.Ultimately, the game absolutely is more Bioshock, and it perhaps took place a tad too close to the original which is why it had as hard a time it did at release. Additionally, there's multiplayer achievements, but I don't expect that there's any real multiplayer activity at this pont, so...buyer beware on that aspect.All in all, it's a great time. and I highly recommend it. Also, I'd recommend picking up Minerva's Den: It's an excellent DLC which distills the formula to its core and is an all around enjoyable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock unquestionably changed the world of first person shooters by setting a new bar for storytelling in video games. With an epic story that pitted sanity versus insanity, gamers played Jack, a plane crash survivor who stumbled upon the underwater city of Rapture. Your goal was not just freedom but also to bring down billionaire industrialist Andrew Ryan whose utopia dissolved into a freakish world of hellish experiments gone wild.It was a surreal experience that pitted the gamer against an army of the strange, the wrong and totally chaotic. Unlike those first person shooters set on alien planets, the future or on the battle field, BioShock was set in 1958 which only enhanced the gameplay experience in this alternate reality through the creepy music and settings. Of course, the stylised graphics and music made this even more plausible. Add in elements from the survivor genre to top it off and BioShock successfully created a worldwide hit.And here we are again, 3 years later and the underwater city of Rapture still breathes but a huge twist has been thrown into the story, thanks to the gamer now playing a Big Daddy. For the uninitiated, Big Daddy's were the huge golem like creatures from the original game who protected the Little Sisters. However, unlike the other Big Daddy's from the previous title, your avatar has free will and let's just say that if anyone or anything gets in your way, the repercussions will be deadly.Before starting your BioShock 2 experience, the viewer is treated to a very interesting cinematic that introduces you to the world of this bizarre universe. Although it begins in 1958 and without spoiling the story too much, you are separated from your Little Sister and you awake ten years later. When you finally do get control of your character, it's all a mystery as to who or what you are. However, just like the original, the story slowly comes together, piece by piece. If you want to get even more in-depth, diaries are littered throughout the gaming environment to enhance the story.As you wake within the Adonis Luxury Resort of Rapture City, you learn that this area was also used for genetic enhancements and so your journey begins of discovery and retribution. One of the main themes in the game is that girls are being kidnapped from islands around Rapture city in order to become Little Sisters for these twisted experiments. For this unnamed Big Daddy, you eventually have contact with Eleanor Lamb, the Little Sister you were once linked with. Unfortunately for her, her mother Sofia Lamb refuses to abide by your wishes and was the person responsible for your vile imprisonment. Needless to say, there are plenty of your in-your-face moments to the story of BioShock.To compliment the story and those wow moments is the amazing level design, especially the underwater areas. The game itself is a first person shooter, however it has elements of RPG and the survival genre to stir things up. Unreal Technology powers the gaming interface as you tackle the denizens of Rapture City from those gone mad on ADAM, the slicers and your gender twisted sisters which all produce a memorable and decent gaming experience.In terms of completion, BioShock 2 takes around 14-15 hours, give or take and has three alternate endings available to the player. For replay value, as the gameplay is so sturdy and the storyline so compelling, most gamers can easily get another play out of the game and go down another path to get that different ending. We've only completed BioShock 2 as a ""good"" Big Daddy, so we're eager to check out some of the other paths available for our character. Speaking of Big Daddy! The control system of BioShock 2 has been well mapped and gamers of all different levels of experience will easily be able to control all facets of Big Daddy, even its deadly drill connected to its arm. If you have played the original, it does take a small amount of time getting use to this monstrous creature as opposed to a human but best of all, Big Daddy has access to some powerful heavy artillery such as Gatling guns and the like. When it comes to combat, the player has options of melee, weapons or genetic powers. With that said, the game is quite violent at times, especially when you're using your drill to disembowel your enemies. Big Daddy's were quite powerful in the original game and to make things fair to your enemies, they have received a slight power make-over. As you fight Splicer's or Big Sisters, it's great how they use the environment to their advantage such as cover and even health stations to replenish their health. Depending on your difficulty setting, the AI can be quite vicious towards the player and does make the game that extra bit more challenging. I played on a medium setting and did get my butt handed to me on more than one occasion but that's where upgrades, new weapons and new powers come into play.When battling enemies, it's quite surreal seeing the enemies fight as they do mimic real-world players quite well. But sometimes you need to fight fire with fire and our favourite Big Daddy has a few of his own powers such as Telekinesis 3 which allows for almost Star Wars based powers as you throw items and even smaller critters around the screen. BioShock 2 supports dual weapons which is generally unleashed when your fighting one of the myriad of bosses but what I like about BioShock 2 is using the environment to your advantage such as flammable pipes, BOOM, or unleashing deadly electrical EVE into the water to dispose your enemies.In relation to bosses, they are quite powerful and if you do manage to die which you will, you will reappear in a rejuvenation chamber to fight again. My favourite battles in BioShock 2 are definitely the Big Sisters that pierce the sound barrier upon their arrival who have the force of a Big Daddy but unfortunately for you, the abilities of the Spider Slicers ""speed"" which will be frustratingly challenging at times but well worth the victory. Of course, not all BioShock is about fighting and you need to hack doors for entry, vending machines for supplies and even bots to fight at your side. ADAM is used to upgrade your powers and abilities and the player uses Little Sisters to harvest this powerful genetic material. Of course to get a Little Sister, the player must first dispatch the Big Daddy that is protecting them. Once a Little Sister is yours, you can them use them to draw ADAM from corpses. This brings another strategy into the game through the use turrets and traps because once the Little Sisters start to harvest, other enemies are alerted, so you need to defend them quite well. As EVE played a huge role in the previous game which allowed you to use your powers, this also needs to be collected and replenished in BioShock 2. Fortunately, there are plenty of EVE hypos littered through the environments and some foods that can replenish it.When it comes to graphics, BioShock 2 is oozing with eye candy and looks amazing on high definition. The level design is brilliant that is complimented with some great lighting and special effects, especially the water. The characters are well animated and contain some great texture details, making it easy to be absorbed into the story of this ""nameless"" Big Daddy. The soundtrack is fitting and has a retro 1940's feel to it as is the voice acting, especially from our villain who is as mad as a hatter.From the very first moments, BioShock 2 holds an iron grip over you throughout the entire experience as you're given a violent tour of the legacy of Andrew Ryan's Rapture and the repercussions of his troubled dream. Some may say, it's the same as the previous game but I digress, it's a whole new chapter to this amazing underwater universe and if you don't believe me - buy it and you'll find out.

												What was wrong with System Shock 2?What was wrong with Thief 2?What was wrong with Fallout 2?What was wrong with... Bioshock 2?Exactly. I'm not sure why many didn't even give Bioshock 2 a chance. It's great to be back in Rapture and the gameplay is improved upon in every single way. Dual wielding plasmids/guns is fun, the new enemy types are great, the Little Sister mechanics are awesome, the level design is fantastic, and the story is solid enough. Tack on Minerva's Den and it's just icing on the cake. If you were a fan of the original and skipped out on this one, all you've done is a disservice to yourself. It's a great game, so would you kindly give it a chance?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bioshock 2 Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: FPS; Atmospheric; Action; Story Rich My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWBioshock 2 returns the player to the vividly atmospheric world of Rapture and reintroduces all of the positive qualities that were prevalent in the first installment of this franchise. It is very, very similar to the first; so expect it to play like a refined continuation rather than an entirely new game. But it does offer a more intimate perspective on the underwater dystopia, as the player will take on the role of a unique Big Daddy this time around and will be much more connected to the city. Most of the features are extremely similar to their counterparts in the original game; however there was definitely fine-tuning applied to some aspects. Perhaps most prominently, the combat and overall gameplay is significantly more exciting this time around. Overall, it is a great game that was mostly successful in living up to the high standard set by the first game.Now, it is essentially a direct sequel. Having played both games, I would suggest that you attempt to play the first one before this, if you can afford the time and money. Although, it isn’t entirely necessary and you could opt to read a synopsis rather than play through the entire first game. But I would suggest you at least do that to get a little background information. Doing so will provide you the opportunity to fully enjoy the subtle nuances throughout the game.As for the specifics, Bioshock 2 is a fundamentally well-crafted game for all the same reasons the original was. At the forefront, there is once again an exceptionally intriguing atmosphere and a wondrous gameworld design. The city of Rapture continues to fascinate. Throughout your adventure, you will probably notice that all of the subtle niceties and ancillary details add up to create a very immersive and pleasurable experience. I personally feel the ambiance of the gameworld is best quality of this game and holds true to the brand.The multidirectional storytelling that was expertly executed in the first game also returns in this sequel. The main storyline will unfold as you progress through the campaign, but you also can learn a great deal about the backstory and lore if you explore and if you seek out the collectibles. A lot is left up to the player to determine how much he/she wants to learn about the lore. The narrative elements are mostly well written and enticing; and the foundation of it all is the superbly idiosyncratic NPCs. It all comes together quite nicely. All of that said, the narrative elements as a whole may feel a little less interesting in Bioshock 2 than they were in the first— perhaps due to the unavoidable loss of novelty of core concepts that is intrinsic to all sequels.As for the actual gameplay, it is significantly more exciting in Bioshock 2 than in the original.  There were nice refinements to the combat system, and the fact you now can maul people with the patented Big Daddy Drill is an added bonus. But also the actual fight sequences are better designed, and the layout of the combat zones provides more opportunities for creativity and hazard-kills. And new gameplay systems like the harvesting of ADAM from dead splicers really brings the high-action combat element of the game to the forefront of the overall experience much more than in the first installment.There is also a multiplayer mode and although it has the potential to be quite fun, it suffers from a low population and not-so-friendly community of regulars. If you have the patience to deal with the wait times and inevitable toxic matches, you will occasionally find yourself in some games that can be pretty enjoyable. But I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer adding too much value to the game; the focus is definitely on the campaign.In summary, I would say that Bioshock 2 is a very good game, although perhaps not quite as masterful as the original. It is strongly tied to its predecessor, and so it would probably be best to play both if you want to get the full experience. But either way, most established FPS/RPG gamers should be fully able to enjoy this game, especially fans of strong narratives and intriguing atmospheres.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												You can't say anything about BioShock 2 without comparing it to the first one. BioShock 2 was an improvement in gameplay, that's for sure. Plasmid in one hand, gun in the other made a fine combination and killing was finally... well, fun.

Gene Tonics added another layer of depth, even though at the end you can easily buy all the slots and fill them with the best tonics. Also, you get to be a Big Daddy, finally. After playing the first one, almost every player had this thought, how nice would be to play as one. So you get a drill and a rivet gun. Didn't change much in gameplay, but is neat.Visuals:-great visuals-really detailed world-some great character design-gives a really creepy feeling to the entire game

												Bioshock 2 was set up almost from the onset to be a colossal failure. It was to follow one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time, by a different developer, with the inclusion of a seemingly tacked on multiplayer mode to a series that had absolutely no need for one. It had every possibility to be a disaster, which makes it almost shocking that it arrived in a state that was not only comparable to the original game, but improved and expanded on it as well in ways that would be hard to go back from. It’s the sequel I never expected; maybe nobody did.And important distinction to make before discussing Bioshock 2’s narrative, is that the first game was first and foremost the story of the city of Rapture and its fall into madness through its own attempts to create a lawless utopia. In comparison, 2 is almost entirely focused around a very small cast of key characters; their relationships to each other, conflicting ideals, and eventual goals which clash with each other and create this very personal, self contained narrative, within which Rapture is merely a setting instead of the star.In some ways this is a good thing. By taking the focus off of Rapture and onto a new, very small collection of characters, developer 2K Marin is able to craft a more personal narrative, spending more time developing the characters that matter and the relationships between them. In other ways, it makes the time not spent directly advancing the plot far less impactful and memorable than they may otherwise have been. Characters outside the very core plot are introduced and then discarded in ways that feel contrived and unmemorable, moving you along but never leaving much of an impact outside of your immediate encounters with them. This also contributes to Rapture being a much less interesting, tangible place to explore, feeling stale and lifeless when at one point it was remarkably well crafted and intriguing.On the whole, the narrative is rather significantly less mentally stimulating, disregard the deeper themes of ideology, morality, and freedom that gave the original such an astounding sense of scope and inspired so much discussion about the different ideas laced within the game. Bioshock 2 tries to mimic what Irrational Games did so deftly, but it comes out as something superfluously intelligent; tossing about grand ideas in the background of a fairly simple plot that never attempts more than it can feasibly accomplish. Simplicity isn’t a bad thing by nature, as the story is still engaging and arguably easier to follow, but I rather missed the more sophisticated philosophical questions posed by the original that was so substantially more contemplative and inspired.  The change to a strictly linear world design was also rather disappointing to me, as though there are logical narrative reasons you wouldn’t be able to return to locations after you went through them, it’s yet another thing taken away from the original that causes Rapture to feel like a rather hollow environment. It’s still full of the same distinctive artwork, excellent sense of place, and fitting music, but it feels so soulless compared to what it once was that it makes returning to Rapture again almost dull at times. There are things later on which actually add interesting, fundamental aspects to the city’s lore, but by that point it’s almost too late and the moment will likely be lost or overlooked by most.Whether the changes are improvements or make up for what was lost is debatable, though by and large the plot failed to leave the impression the original did, despite being well written and interesting in its own right. Perhaps its the issue of being in the shadow of such a monumental achievement that was Bioshock, that anything to come after that isn’t as incredibly feels significantly more of a disappointment that it otherwise would. Had 2 been released as in a vacuum I may have been more receptive to what it was attempting to do, but with the weight of its predecessor on its shoulders there was just - something - missing to draw me in quite the same way as I was to the original.Where 2 far surpasses the original though is through the numerous refinements and additions it makes to the mechanics, turning Bioshock from a brilliantly deep and satisfying shooter, into a smoother, even deeper shooter that streamlines and polishes off the few rough edges of the original. The core of the combat is largely unchanged, utilizing a mixture of firearms and plasmids (essentially superpowers) to take down a variety of different splicers (the enemies of the game), but the introduction of dual wielding, the ability to instantly switch ammo types, a collection of interesting new weapons, a significantly faster and less cumbersome hacking system,  and a scaled back but even more customizable tonic (passive upgrades) system do a lot to make Bioshock 2 a much faster and enjoyable experience.They’re small changes for the most part to be sure, but collectively add up to a much tighter shooting experience that makes it hard for me to imagine returning to the comparatively clunky original. Encounters with the most prominent new enemy, Big Sisters, is another brilliant twist on something the original began (in this instance the Big Daddy fights, which also return), as quicker, more capable and powerful enemies that present a large challenge and require you change your tactics as they are far more versatile and aggressive than their older counterparts.These improvements make Bioshock 2 one of the most enjoyable and dynamic shooters I’ve ever played. Where it falters in its storytelling and world building, it makes up for with the sheer entertainment to be found in its combat, which only grows as the game goes on. It might not wholly surpass the original, but it surely approaches it in a lot of ways, which is something I scarcely imagined there was any possibility it could. In some ways it feels more akin to an update than an entire new experience, but when that update is so fun and smartly designed I can't complain.On multiplayer…Surprising though it may be, 2K has fitted a multiplayer mode within Bioshock 2, and even more unexpectedly it’s not terrible! More than that, it’s actually a rather enjoyable mode that while totally derivative of every other first-person multiplayer shooter in terms of modes, progression, and character customization, it transposes the campaigns fantastic shooting into a multiplayer mode almost entirely intact. Your weapons and abilities might be slightly neutered, but the combat is so strong at its core that I found myself spending a surprising amount of time with the mode and enjoying every moment of it. Bioshock as a shooter is almost completely unreplicated in any other game, so having that in a multiplayer mode that even in every other aspect is fairly uninteresting is rather compelling, and most certainly worth checking out despite its dubious inclusion.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												James Cameron's Aliens (1986) isn't as handsome or terrifying as Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), it doesn't have the same dreary beauty or pioneering tone (and the new aliens look cheap by comparison), but Aliens is a hell of a lot more fun to watch. It's also more moving, and maybe the better movie. Bioshock 2 is the same, and I think better than Bioshock 1 in almost every way that matters. Bioshock introduced the world and set the tone magnificently, but it was only half of a good game. Bioshock 2 gets the combat and enemies right, locations are more dynamic and the plot actually has stakes. It felt like I was fighting for something meaningful by the end, and I felt like more than just a guy with a gun/drill. And the Little Sisters are stunning characters. They're terrifying and memorable every time, and even when they're not around you're dreading the your next encounter, preparing, remembering escape plans, stocking up on ammo and health. After surviving all the mad things in Rapture, you'll inevitably face a Little Sister. You get to choose when and where you'll fight, and this mix of fear, adrenaline and tactics is really special for an FPS. Yeah, the graphics took noticeable a downgrade and nothing here matches the opening minutes of Bioshock 1, but everything else is an improvement and it's a shame more people don't know that.

												[Review only Russian]Игра пройдена. Причем с обоими концовками. Чтож, подводный город по прежнему жив. Нам, как и нашему новому главному герою (объекту Дельта), предстоит побывать в тех уголках города, которых мы не видели в первой части. В комплекте так же будут новые противники, новые плазмиды и прочее. В общем, весьма интересное продолжение которое заслуживаем внимания.Теперь о плюсах:- ГрафикаПо сравнению с первым BioShock-ом, выглядит даже чуть лучше- Сюжет Присутствует. Так же в комплекте 2 концовки. Т.е. есть альтернатива где игрок в праве выбирать какая концовка будет и/или ему ближе- Звук/музыкаОтлично дополняет атмосферу игры и способствует более глубокому погружению- УправлениеУниверсальное и обладает удобством игры, как с помощью традиционного метода (клавиатура + мышь), так и с помощью диванного манипулятора :) (геймпад Xbox 360).Ну а теперь... о минусах:- ЛинейностьИдем только вперед и... вперед. Шаг вправо и/или влево, если это конечно не касается сюжета, сделать нельзя. Просто не предусмотрено.[update 09/06/2014]Иногда, после автосохранения в начале уровня, может без причины выбросить на рабочий стол. Неприятное явление, но, пережить можно. Поэтому... просто почаще сохраняйтесь... и получайте удовольствие от игры. Unterhaltsames Spiel =)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most fun gameplay wise of the bios but the antagonist is so horribly lame that... well it works on that level I suppose... cringe worthy whenever she spouts her lame bullcrap but entretaining on some level at least.Fighting the big sisters is good fun. Overall, underrated to be sure. Sure Bio1 didn't really need this sequel but it's a good game in it's own right with a nice ending I though so... just play it and don't expect it to be BIO1 when it comes to the story and characters and you'll probably like it just fine overall.

 Bioshock 2 Review + How To Fix the Game Crashing  Without any spoilers Game Grade: A-Shorthand Review: Battle against hordes of murderous splicers in the decaying, or more accurately, the decayed city of rapture.  Bioshock 2 will force you to choose between your survival or your morals.Detailed Review:Personally, Bioshock is my favorite series.  You can ask any one of my friends and they will reluctantly agree.  If you have not played the first Bioshock, then I highly recommend that you play it first.  They must be played in order to understand everything.  Bioshock 2 has just about everything the first one had, but I do not want to compare them too much.  There are different endings you can achieve depending on how you play the campaign.  Also, the storyline (which will not be spoiled) is the 'at the end of your seat' game play we all enjoy.  The map tends to be large which gives you countless options on new places to explore.  Bioshock 2 is a wonderfully gripping sequal.The first detail I would like to talk about is the replay value.  If you have read some of my other reviews, then you would know I talk about this a lot.  Replay value, to me, really makes a game worth your money.  As you may know, Bioshock is known to have different endings which rely on choices you make in the game.  There are multiple decisions you need to make throughout the game.  Some of those decisions are more difficult than the others.  To really get your money's worth out of this game, you should play to get every ending.  This will require many hours of game play, but each time you play it will seem like a brand new game.  There is also another game mode you can play called the 'Protector Trials'.  I am going to put this the best way I can.  Its hard.Another point I would like to make on Bioshock 2 is the storyline.  Bioshock 2 is considered a ""weak"" sequel to many people.  Although it is not as good as the first, it was a necessary sequal to the series.  Bioshock 2 focuses on the desperate power grab for the keys to Rapture.  I don't really want to spoil anything so I will leave it at that.Finally, I would like to address the map.  You can expect as much exploration in Bioshock 2 as the first Bioshock (a lot).  There are many secondary objectives and secret rooms just waiting to be found.  You can almost here their faint sceams.. ""Find me.  Please... find me.""  This is another reason why I think it has great replay value.  By exploring the map to the fullest, you will be greatly rewarded in more ways than one.  One thing that you should not expect to change in this game is potential exploration.  The map is a maze and you are the mouse.Overall, the game is enjoyable with countless hours of possible game play.  Although it may not be as good as the first, it is still a clear Bioshock game.  There is still a 'horror' factor involved with the murderous splicers (as in the first game).  This game is definitely worth the time and money as long as you pay attention and find the cules.  I hope this review helped anyone thinking about buying this game.  If this did not help, then let me know by posting a comment.I made the overall review a bit short to help people out with the common problem of crashing.  To “fix” the game crashing and you losing your progress, save the game every couple of minutes.  The beginning is the main place the game will crash.  Once you get about 15 minutes into the game, the crashing should not be a problem.  If you need more help on how to fix it, then post a comment and I will do my best to help you out.

												Bioshock 2 is viewed as the black sheep of the ""Shock"" franchise, created as a cheap cash-in sequel by a different development team that crafted the first Bioshock.  But beyond the initial impressions from fans and critics lies a very competent game, that in some spots actually outshines the original.Good Stuff:-The story is just as good, if not better, than the original.  Most people disliked the story because it didn't add much depth to the mythos of Rapture, but the story in Bioshock 2 is much more personal and is more about the citizens of Rapture than the city itself.-The gameplay is vastly improved.  Plasmids and Guns are duel wielded, making combining them in combat much easier.  -Mechanics are streamlined, not simplified.  Gene tonics no longer have a type and can just be equipped, assuming you have the slots.  Hacking is now done in real time on a simplified  mini-game.  Even the research mechanic is reworked to use a video-camera that gives you more research points depending on how well you combo your plasmids/weapons.  There are also new weapons and plasmids that are fun to use and don't feel gimmicky.-The art design is top notch.  The level designers have fun showing what rapture would look like with 10 more years of rust and decay.-More moral decisions beyond ""Save/Kill Little Sister"".  The game also uses your decisions to inform the last act of the game and the ending.-Final ""boss"" fight is much better than the one in the first game.Bad Stuff:-The first hour of the game stinks. Period.  After you get into the first real level, the game begins to open up and let you start having fun.-Some of the new characters have to be hand waved into existence, especially since they were supposed to be around before the first game but are clearly never mentioned in the first game.-Levels are much more linear and not as large as in the first game. There are few sidepaths, but mostly you'll be running from point A to B without backtracking.-There are a few new enemies but I would have liked more enemy variety.-You can use little sisters to gather Adam, but you have to protect them as they do it.  Most people hated the escort mission from the first game, so it's something to be aware of.   I personally enjoyed this part of the game due to the multitude of alternate amunition that makes setting up traps fun.-It's clear that there were some significant rewrites late in development, some characters introduced at the start of the game are simply left out of the rest of the game's plot.Ugly Stuff:-The FoV is very low and requires ini-rebinding to reset it every time you launch the game.  The problem is going into ironsights also resets the FoV, making you have to press your bound key to reset your FoV every time.-Occasional issues with audio cutting out if there were too many sounds are playing at once. Verdict:Ignore people saying the game is a cheap cash in: the gameplay is better and arguably so is the story.  Although there are fewer levels than in the original, the game actually took me more hours to beat than the first game: around 14 hours.  It’s also interesting that a lot of the story beats and themes end up being used in Bioshock Infinite (although I’m sure Ken Levine hates to admit it).Minerva's Den is also an excellent add-on to the base game, and lasts around 3 hours.  I'd recommend playing through Bioshock 2 on hard mode if you've played many shooters before, the difficulty curve stays pretty good throughout the entire base game.  Minerva's Den is a bit harder on the same difficulty however, so keep that in mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2 is on the same level as the first game, but that is all.  Rather than improve upon the original game, it merely continues what it accomplished.  The story is fitting and complements the first well, but overall it feels more like an expanded campaign than an entirely different game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2 is good.  Not exactly a surprise given the content of other available reviews on Steam, but why is it good seems the more important thing, something I'll try to address here.  I'm going to tell you why I think BioShock 2 is a worthy successor in the series.First things first, to get right down to brass tacks BioShock 2 is a sequel, it is mostly more of the same gameplay (with a few twists) and the few innovations don't exactly break the bank in the inventiveness department.  A few new weapons and interesting plasmid variations and a small smattering of new enemy types don't do much to dispel the notion that the combat is totally more BiShock.  But that's not what makes a BioShock game, not really.  Sure, the combat has to be engaging enough to drive the narrative forward, but in this game it does that just enough.  No, much like the first, the true draw is the dark and twisted story, the narrative tapestry that shows the dark and twisted nature of those living in Rapture.This game has you playing as a Big Daddy, the stalwart if myopic defenders of the Little Sisters.  In particular, you play a “prototype”, a nameless everyman changed into a monster but also a kind of father, and it is the theme of fatherhood that, like the first game, shares the roost with a political ideology to form the basis of the disastrous tale of the fall of Rapture.  Where the first game gazed on what genetics truly determine, on the pure unbridled force of Libertarianism and Capitalism, this game focuses on what it means to be a parent, and the equal sociopolitical dangers of a Communistic ideal that crosses the line into religious fervor.  It is the other side of the coin to Andrew Ryan's Rapture ideal of the individual's power in Rapture, the ideal of not just the social as one entity in a metaphorical manner, but what might happen if science could allow us all to actually become one.  And just as in the first game, the dangers of extremist politics show how such ideas can rip a society, and in particular a family apart.This is the crux of the story: as the first game contained two father figures for the original protagonist, the Big Daddy is one of two parent figures presented in the game. Unlike before where you were being acted upon as a child with two parental figures, now you are one of the agents of change, and your actions effect the story in a more noticeable (if still superficial) manner.It also drips the kind of scary, jarring atmosphere that is at once engaging to behold and terrifying to think about, the constructive and destructive nature of humankind.  Water drips, walls crack, but unlike before the underwater world outside Rapture is at least nominally explored, and it is beautiful, but sadly littered with the detritus of the once grand city.  The decay of the amazing city of Rapture is at once enthralling and disturbing, an emotional range that was demonstrated in BioShock, and is absolutely in full effect here.To add to the positives Minerva's Den, a small DLC adventure contained within this game, is a wonderful look at how every last person in Rapture was hurt, changed, damaged by the vision of Andrew Ryan.  Rapture is a crucible and all it seems to produce is tragedy, and each game with it as it's setting allows us to see something of ourselves in it's tragedy.  With arresting visuals, a story just as dark as it's sibling, and the upgraded combat engine, this game is well worth the time.  It is the other side of the coin, the “2” in this case being a quite literal extension of the first, and that is a very good thing indeed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More fun in Rapture, but not without its frustrations. The political background is a little less clear (in my opinion), but the main storyline still compelling and tragic.In terms of gameplay, elements like Gathering (especially the Protector Trials DLC) encourage you make use of traps and plasmids that you could largely ignore in Bioshock 1. On the other hand, this forced flexibility means you can't always rely on your favourite loadout for the most difficult set pieces in the game.Multiplayer is an exercise in futility. Assuming you're lucky enough to even find a game with enough players, a single griefer can wreck your whole experience. If you're trying to get all the achievements, take my advice and just play enough public games to have finished on every map (and won the DLC ones) and save a Little Sister, and then boost yourself to Level 50 on a private ADAM Grab map.Since the migration to Steam, game crashing is a real problem. There are things you can do to mitigate it (like upgrading your hardware), but save early, save often, save anyway. And if you do crash, go back TWO saves as there's a good chance the last one was corrupted. Then save again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story set in a city build on the bottom of Pacific ocean named Rapture. It's year 1968 and for last 10 years Rapture has been devastated by Sofia Lamb and her followers, who believe in creating first Utopian - Eleanor - by imbuing her combined genius of Rapture's citizens through human sacrifice. Eleanor wants only to escape with her father - Subject delta who was now revived by her after Sofia shot him in 1958. Eleanor now lives like a slave under Lamb. You have to save her from this destiny. I really enjoyed playing this shooter game even though I haven't played the first one. I look forward to play next sequel Infinite. In game there are many interesting features, like collecting audio logs which reveals what had happened before you were revived by Eleanor, improving weapons, traps and other. If you like FPS and storybased games Bioshock 2 is one you can't miss.  8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is possibly one of my all-time favourite games and for good reason. It was this genre defining title that carved up modern FPS adventure games, adding a dash of horror and giving the player to opportunity to play for other team. Exploring the same city you first escaped from seemed at first like a bore, but a whole host of new abilities, weapons and incentives gave the game an edge along with some great spooks keeping the story fresh, enjoyable and engaging. Re-living the game and re-living rapture is a delight, for anyone who hasn’t been blessed with the Bioshock title, I dearly advise you to seek out the triple pack available on steam. You can get this on sale for $20.00 or so, and believe me it is worth playing both 1 & 2 before the third, Infinite. Honestly, great games with real content and staying power, everyone should play or own them at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Daddy! You always save me from the monsters.""Bioshock 2 is the right choice for you if you like the first Bioshock.. If you wish it would never end.. If you really want to continue.. The gameplay doesn't change that much. Hacking system is now much faster but also harder because the game doesn't stop while you are hacking as it was before. But! In Bioshock 2 you don't have to switch between weapons and plasmids. You can have equipped both at the same time, which is probably the best gameplay change they made. Get used to the slow movement because you can't sprint anymore. Maybe it will make you feel little bit better if I tell you that you will be compensated somehow.. You will be able to walk on the bottom of the sea! ;)Atmosphere is great, filled with scary moments. Music makes them even scarier. It increases the tension. It makes you lookout for what is coming. It makes you so stressed that every single after death movement of a body will make your heart beat faster!Dealing with little sisters can take much longer here, especially if you are interested in more ADAM. You can use every little sister for gathering more ADAM for you before you save(harvest) her. She will show you the way to the right body. You must protect her as she gathers. ADAM guaranteed. Meeting with big sisters also guaranteed. But that won't be that pleasant.. They scream too much for my taste.. ;)The story is great. It might get a bit emotional so prepare your handkerchiefs towards the ending. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												That is one of the game series that when I hear a new Bioshock game is coming out, I get so excited.All of the defaults of the 1st Bioshock got fixed, the enjoyment is at maximum level.Bioshock 2 is the direct following of the first but you don't need to play it to understand the story.You are Subject Delta, one of the first prototype of a Big Daddy protecting a Little Sister: Eleanor Lamb, the daughter of the new leader of the Ryan Industries: Sofia Lamb. However, this woman wants her daughter back, she sends a Mind Control Plasmid over the Subject Delta and pushes him to shoot his head. The story begins 10 years after, the Subject Delta revives by getting in a Vita-Chamber helped by a Little Sister and during the whole adventure you will find that you have a powerful connection with Eleanor Lamb.When the 1st Bioshock was a little boring because you only had to save Little Sisters, here you have plenty things to do.- A great multiplayer mode with maps of Bioshock 1 & 2 and new plasmids, but the old Windows Live server closed and it's now working by peer2peer so it's lagging pretty much with some people but still playable.- The Big Sister, the new monster of the game, appears only when you save all the Little Sisters. She is really powerful and has the only plasmids you don't have.- It's now possible to upgrade the weapons and use techniques of combat.- The DLC Minerva's Den shows the end of Rapture.Afterall, this is the most complete Bioshock ever made even though Bioshock Infinite is also good but, it all started here.Everyone of you should have played this game, atleast once.

												Bioshock 2 is a FPS developed and published by 2K Games and is the sequel and successor of Bioshock. Most people think the first game is better than the sequel , but i disagree. In my opinion the sequel improves on everything from the first game alongside adding more interesting and developed characters and story.The Story (Spoiler Free)Bioshock 2 takes place after the events of the first game although the OPENING of the game is set 2 years prior the events of the first one.BioShock 2 opens on New Year's Eve 1958 (two years before the events of the first game), as Subject Delta patrols Rapture with his Little Sister, Eleanor. Eleanor is separated from Delta by her mother, Sofia Lamb, who uses a mind control plasmid on Delta to make him shoot himself. Ten years later, Delta awakens, revived by Little Sisters under the control of Eleanor. Delta is drawn towards Eleanor by their past Big Daddy-Little Sister connection. Brigid Tenenbaum encounters Delta, and explains that unless Delta reunites with Eleanor, he will fall into a coma. With the help of the Little Sisters under Eleanor's control and Tenenbaum's ally, Augustus Sinclair, Delta makes his way towards Lamb's stronghold.GameplayThe game is a FPS with RPG elements to it which includes both singleplayer and multiplayer modes although multiplayer is    totally dead nowadays so i'll skip talking about it. The game has a total of 6 weapons , each with significant weapon upgrades. Unlike the first one , the sequel doesn't allow you to upgrade every weapon to the max although once you pick and upgrade your favourite weapon , you won't really need anything the others. The game also comes with 2 tools: Hack Tool and Research Camera , who both help you greatly on your journey. Unlike the first game , the resources in this one are plenty , so you'll have a chance to buy almost every upgrade and plasmid out there. There are a total of 11 plasmids in this game which most can be upgraded to level 3. Unlike the first game , in order to upgrade a plasmid to level 3 here , you first need to have bought the level 2 version of that certain plasmid , but don't worry , the currency you buy the plasmids with is plentyful depending on if you know what you're doing. The game has several endings depending on if you decide to save or gather the little sisters/spare or kill the people you meet along the way. GraphicsFor a game that was released in 2010 the graphics are pretty good. They sure do bring that creepy and abandoned atmosphere the game offers alive.SoundtrackOne of my favourite soundtracks in a game , the musicians definitely gave their best when they were making it. Here's one of my favourite tracks of the game:


YouTube™ Video: Oingo Boingo - Little Girls 

			Views: 6,349,315		

			video for Little Girls		

ComplaintsMy only complaints are that the game tends to crash at random when you save , so save as often as possible , i warned ya! ^^ There's also a chance that if it crashes right when you save , it may corrupt your save file in which case you gotta find the corrupted save file and delete otherwise the game is unplayable. Only happened to me twice through my playthrough but i tend to ignore it.Overall:The game took me around 30 hours to 100% all of it's singleplayer achievements and all of them were very enjoyable. This is one of my all-time favourite FPS games , i totally recommend you to buy it! If you haven't played it yet YOU ARE COMMITTING A SIN!I rate a total of 10/10 and mind you , i actually mean it unlike all those kids out there claiming ""10/10"" on so many things they aren't even sure they likehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712033396Now would you kindly buy this game and give my review a like? :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back to Rapture in this amazing sequel, this time around... you ARE ""Big Daddy""!!!The guys at 2K Games knocked the ball out of the park yet again with Bioshock 2, further building and improving upon and already near flawless Bioshock series, adding sooooo much more content and switching things up to bring a new exciting side of ""Rapture"" to the playing field in the form of bigger, badder weapons, power-ups, skills and enemies.Visually STUNNING!! even tho the game is a couple years old, it still holds up very well, artisticly speaking, the style is gorgeous and the entire atmosphere just sucks you into the game, from time to time I get lost just staring at the beautiful work of art that is Bioshock 2.Sound design is some of the best in the industry, the old timey 30's-40's music/voice work and magical sounds and explosions from plasmids and awesome steam punk weapons, the screams and laugher of the inhabitants of Rapture and the distant clinks, drips and bangs of a leaky underground City all come together beautifully in 7.1 surround sound, so satisfying!Gameplay... WOW... it almost feels endless the possibilities and combos of each Plasmid and weapon, the multiple ammo types, perks and skills and even the level design itself if used properly is deadly, everything just flows together perfectly, you can tell this game was made with love and attention. The story/lore of the Bioshock series is the bread and butter, the core and the main reason we all fell in love with the series, Big Daddy, Little Sisters, Splicers and that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Andrew Ryan will forever be engraved into our memories, so much to read, listen, see and explore in the vast underground city of Rapture, so much going on at all times, no wonder you'll get lost in this game for hours on end!I can literally go on and on for days about how awesome the Bioshock series is, amazing how each game in the series gets better and better, they out do themselves everytime and I look forward to any and all things Bioshock in the future!!11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In the underwater metropolis of Rapture, lies one of the most exhilerating, tense and memorable experiences that will always be known in the history of gaming. Bioshock 2 tells the untold story of Subject Delta, the Big Daddy who broke free, the Big Daddy that everyone has turned against, and his relationship with a specific little sister of Rapture, Eleanor. 2K Games has designed a game that expands Bioshock's mythology, but doesn’t lose any of the mystery. A game that introduces fascinating new settings and characters, but doesn’t forget or neglect those previously established. A game that gives the player devastating new power, but balances that with devastating new fear. A game that takes chances and makes changes, but almost always for the better. Playing as a big daddy, Bioshock brings destructive and fast paced arcade combat with the help of creative plasmids, setting alight, lifting trash cans and hypnotizing every single big daddy you come across. But in this mysterious dystopia, exploration is key feature to the immersion and overall enjoyment of this title, whether it is the hunting of little sisters, being hunted by big sisters or the spamming of the 'search' button. Much like its predecessor, BioShock 2 is slower and more methodical than your average shooter, but combat feels much more natural and effective than it ever did before. But I never said it would be easy.......nononononono. Being a Big Daddy sure does make you a badass but at the same time a vulnerable slow target that is very well suited to the games strengths. Rapture is a dark, dismal world that envelopes you with a blanket of isolation, excellent art direction, a great soundtrack, and a fantastic voice cast all team up with a powerful story to create an atmosphere so thick and intense that it is at times downright chilling.

												In Bioshock 2, you take control of a ""Subject Delta."" A man geneticly who-knows-what'd to, and then put in a giant blocky diving suit, forced by un-willing love towards a small (Equally who-knows-what'd to) child to seek out and protect her, lest he collapse into a coma, and die.It's a pretty cheerful game.Your tiny, coma-stopping, girl friend is the daughter of a sudo-communist dictator, in an underwater city named Rapture. When that dictator decided you've been Wall-Flowering for too long, she has a bunch of her goons hypnotize you, before she makes you shoot yourself in the head, in front of said coma stopping little girl.It's a pretty cheerful game.You wake up for unknown reasons 10 years later, and the underwater city is in a point of decay. bits of ceiling are missing and rooms are flooding. The only humanity left are insane and blood thirsty, addicted to a gene modifying drug called ADAM. Your little coma preventing girl is now a teenager, and you need to traverse the collapsing Rapture in order to reconnect with her. All the while her mother is sending the entire city in a religious frenzy to stop you at all costs.It's a pretty cheerful game.All jokes aside, I couldn't recommend this game enough. It's a solid and atmospheric sequel to the more philosophical Bioshock, but with improved combat, and visuals. You'll have to explore a more linear world than before, but the set peices and earie vibe more than make up for it. Definitely a must play if you're a fan of the Bioshock series, or just a general fan of shooters, horror, and want to call your games High Art.8.3 / 9			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2 is obvious and palpable improvement of its predecessor. Every aspect of the gameplay has been finished, the action now frantic and without a breather, to level design that manages to hold off the drama of backtracking. The plot is compelling: an equal quality in the narrative will find it very difficult in another first-person shooter and the progress in the adventure can stimulate the player's attention by offering something new, it's a weapon, a plasmid or unusual setting particularly well. But problems remain: the game does not excel technically and many of the additions in the gameplay, as the underwater sections, leave the time they find. But above BioShock it is partly a victim of its own heritage. Too many parts of the game they know they ""already seen"", from environments, and nothing of this second chapter can match or surpass the splendor of his predecessor. BioShock 2 is beautiful, really beautiful but it is a masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game gathered some undeserved hate from many gamers, mainly because it was a rehash of the first game and it wasn't made by Irrational. However, having played it on 360 when it came out and now playing through it again I feel the game retained much of its predecessor atmosphere and there is quite a few improvements, too. People like to hate nowadays, it seems to make them feel better, huh? Why haven't I heard complaints that Bioshock 1 is a rehash of System Shock 2, then? That is far more evident. I enjoyed the first Bioshock A LOT. I enjoy Bioshock 2 A LOT too and will continue enjoying it in spite of the haters :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

BioShock 2 deserves more loveLet me cut straight to the chase. Is BioShock 2 as memorable as BioShock? Perhaps not. Is the story as amazing? No. Is the story flawed in some senses? Yes. Is it a bad game? No, absolutely not. BioShock 2 is great in it's own right. It maintains most of the fantastic elements found in BioShock but (in my opinion) improves game-play in several ways.Positive:- Still fantastically atmospheric- Main story is OK BUT the story in Minerva's Den (DLC) is incredible.- Minerva's Den is really worth your time- One plasmid and one weapon equipped at the same time. YESSSSSSSSS!- Hacking system is greatly improved- Hacking from a distance!- Exploring is still as rewarding as ever - you'd be surprised how many places you can go- BioShock 2 is challenging, especially fights with Big Daddies/SistersNegative:- Main story is not as memorable as BioShock- You have to fight Big Sisters, even if you choose not to harvest Little Sisters (this makes no sense to me). But fighting them is still enjoyable.- I did not enjoy the multiplayer scene. There were very few players and some players were already at max level. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult to play against someone with so many advantages. It is a shame because the concept is really solid. Conclusion:If you enjoyed BioShock I would urge you to give BioShock 2 a try too. Yes, the reviews are not as positive as they are for BioShock, but what really matters is your personal enjoyment of the game. I can say that I certainly enjoyed playing BioShock 2, and I think you would too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-BioShock 2 is a First Person Shooter sequel to BioShock, the second game was released  3 years after the original (Release date: Feb 9,  2010). The game feels very much like you've returned to the city ""Rapture"" for more game play, however events are taking place about 10 years after those that transpired in BioShock 1. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Welcome back to Rapture, please keep your arms, legs, and morality inside your big daddy suit the whole time and enjoy the ride! Jesting aside, this game is dark and twisted... which is what most people seem to love about it.In this game you play as a ""Big Daddy"" (Basically the guy you see on the cover art, big armored behemoths) named Delta who is searching for his ""little sister"" (those little girls with the red demon eyes) named Eleanor.Just like in the last game as you play you unlock new abilities, weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and (""force skills that require that blue stuff"" Sorry, I can't help myself) Plasmids that require EVE to use. The game is very linear with no going backwards through levels, the game is rather challenging (unless you relish huge challenges, in that case this game is probably too passive for you. Basically the difference in difficulty is just how hard your enemies hit, not AI difficulty etc.)Game Play: Controls for this game are standard, the big difference between 1 and 2 is that you can keep more passive abilities called ""Gene Tonics"" active. There are a couple new weapons and a handful of new Gene Tonics.The starting weapons are the same ones you had in BioShock1, I don't want to spoil any of the next weapons just know they're fun, but I tend to find myself sticking with the bread and butter weapons. There are new secondary ammo types, for several of the weapons. I won't lie, I really like setting traps.It should be noted that I felt like I was playing in the exact same city, graphic-wise the whole city feels exactly the same with small changes. I don't like to talk about graphics in video games but for me this actually did feel like a continuation of the first BioShock Game.   Achievements: There are three types of achievement categories in this game: single player main story, Multiplayer competitive, and DLC. At this time I'm still working on many of the achievements (12/17/14) I have a majority of the single player achievements, nothing unusual to report on these achievements. The multiplayer ones require playing until max online level, so that will be a bit of a grind, it is also oftentimes difficult to find people to play with (depends on the time of day). Lastly DLC achievements, which I have always felt is a cheap way to get more life out of a game. (Blame the sims3 and EA, okay? That's why I'm so cynical about paying for DLC. haha) Price:  BioShock 2 is priced at $19.99, I acquired my copy from a Humble Bundle, so as usual I recommend getting the game on a steam sale or in a humble bundle. Since this is an old game, if you don't already own it I recommend waiting for a 75% off or better sale.As far as quality is concerned, I have 14 hours in this game and about half of the achievements, I think it's close to a good buy if you're just playing through the game once, if you're going to play on a higher difficulty, or through the game multiple times this game is a very good quality. Conclusion: Story = Awesome. Game Play = Effortless, natural and fluid to play. Achievements = Meh...could be better. Price = Fair. This game tends to appeal to people who like First person shooters and story games, with the addition of multiplayer it could appeal to the competitive crowd but there aren't nearly as many people actively playing.I recommend this game for people who like darker stories, and tend to enjoy first person shooters, regardless of their difficulty. Rapture will warp your perceptions of ""right and wrong""; as always, I've been impressed by the story.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 10, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for BioshockHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock Infinite ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The main improvement over the first Bioshock is the storyline. To me this is centred on the main characters' unbreakable bond to his 'little sister' Eleanor, for which he would do anything to find and protect. There is also a sorrow and sadness to Rapture, the underwater city the game is set in. The ruined state of the city is captured in superb detail, and the glimpses throughout the many windows of the ocean add to this atmosphere. The diaries of some of the characters help to pull you even more into this immersive world.In Bioshock 2, the enemies were a lot more varied, in both their model and in how they could attack you. Also you could choose who lives and dies out of characters other than little sisters, giving you a greater feeling of involvement in the story and its progression. The music in Bioshock 2 cannot be overlooked either, and is used to great effect in places to give the 'retro' feel to Rapture. The sorrowful sounding string-quartet in the background during some scenes turns them into truly breathtakingly sad moments.Now add to all of this the gameplay, which is seamless and natural, complimenting rather than obscuring the storyline and mood of Rapture.

This game has an incredible story, this city has an incredible, amazing story. I think of it we love him, I would recommend this game and give it an 10/10 points.

												A rightful sequel, that doesn't disappoint, improves a truckload of things and manages not to screw many things either. Hacking is finally fun, even if a little easier. Exploring rich philosophies and thoughtful characters and their visions, motives, fates is the game's main driving force, because the gameplay becomes boring after first two hours, because you are swimming in ammunition (just like in the first game with the exception that here it comes too early to be forgivable) and new genetic modifications that are inspired and original though absolutely useless cannon fodder from the gameplay view. Again the same technical problems as the first one, only a little worse. The story, the world and the characters are very well done and that's what BioShock is really about. Lack of Ken Levine here, will surely be compensated by Infinite, that will maybe even surpass the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.There are moments in Bioshock that will live long in the memory, such as the first time you saw the spooky underwater city of Rapture from the safety of the bathysphere, or being forced to take part in Sander Cohen's sick games. There are fewer stand-out moments like these in Bioshock 2, but the moments that do stick with you are so well conceived and unbelievably well-executed, that they surpass those of the originalThe biggest change made to Bioshock 2's gameplay comes from the fact that this time around you're playing as a Big Daddy, but not just any Big Daddy, you play as the first Big Daddy, a prototype called 'Subject Delta'.Overall: If you are a fan of Bioshock you can not miss Bioshock 2. If this is the first time you play Bioshock game, this game will be Welcoming you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i enjoyed the first bioshock. no more no less. liked and disliked too many things to love or hate it. For Bioshock 2 however, the intro was awsome, the very first few minutes were pretty cool but the first few overall hours SUCCCKKKED. You are now the Big Daddy.... and nobody fears you, you do 0 damage, and get two shotted practically. but at about the three hour mark the game develops a plot, you gain supplies and weapon upgrades and boom. You trully feel like the monsterous beast you wer intended to be. I have not yet completed the game, i will modify the review if my opinion changes, but as of now i would recomend this game on sale, if not then it is up to you, if you would give the first game 3/5 or better then this is a good game to grab. Just get through those bumpy first few hours!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then the drill got added to the inventory and it became extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good.Minerva's Den is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic, and worth  buying the entire game just by itself. They also understood that without the drill,  the game would just be a workable shooter, so they did the right thing and gave you the drill at the very start. Just because of Minerva's Den, and the DRILL, I like this far more than Bioshock 1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holy moly, I don't have any playtime on this game on steam because I played it on my xbox back in the day. Let me tell you, this game and the original Bioshock + Burial at sea DLC for Infinite. Together this is the ultimate video game story! This game has one of the deepest, most interesting and emotional stories of all time. I cried at the end of this game when I got the bad ending.This game starts off continuing from the bad ending for the first game, you have been stuffed into a Big Daddy suit and biologically linked to a little sister, however you are killed and revived in a Vita Chamber years later. Your little sister has since grown up and it is now your task to find her before you mentally deteriorate by not being with her. And while you're at it figure out what to do with your killer who is the sister's mother.That's all I'll say for the story, the graphics are very pretty and unique but starting to get slightly outdated today. Still no one should play this game for the graphics, this game's charm lies entirely in it's story and gameplay.Another thing to boast about in this game is the music, boy is the soundtrack for this game solid. The very talented Garry Schyman is back again and created another beautiful score, it's hard to describe how beautiful it is so just go give it a listen on youtube or something. Also give the tracks from the good old days a listen, there's some really old but good music in here. One song I really like in particular is Boby Darin's Beyond the Sea.So overall this game deserves a solid 10/10. There is absolutely nothing I don't like about this game, in fact there's nothing I don't like about this entire franchise, in my opinion it is the perfect video game franchise. It fits my taste perfectly and all my love goes out to 2k and Irrational Games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sequel 101: Take the original and make it bigger, better and more violent. Bioshock 2 covers its bases well with expanded gameplay, stage design and enemy variation. The story lacks the surprise twist from the original, but it makes up for it in buckets by simply being a better game. The original Bioshock was a surprise hit from 2007. It offered incredible atmosphere, a riveting story and entertaining gameplay. All the ingredients for an instant classic. The sequel had a lot to live up and it took a slightly different approach. Incredible atmosphere, an entertaining story and literally riveting gameplay. For the sequel you get to play as a big daddy, the huge lumbering divers on the game’s cover. Arguably the most intelligent design choice for a sequel since Terminator 2. Bioshock 2 is an insane power fantasy. You play as an armoured badass in the run down districts of the once shining city of Rapture. You are subject Delta, an old cover model and you are called back from the beyond to rescue your daughter from some head-shrink. Yeah, the story is a bit thin, but your motivation is clear: Save your daughter from a psycho and kill, murder and maim anyone who gets in your way. Playing as the big poppa gives you access to the iconic drill, a rivet gun (earlier pun intended), a huge machine gun, an elephant gun that has no business being fired from the hip, a spear gun taken from the bow of a whaler and a rocket launcher that probably fell of an armoured truck. In your other hand you command the forces of nature to shock, roast and freeze your enemies. You are a one man army and you are not going to let anyone get in your way. To compensate, the enemies are more numerous and aggressive. You’ll often fight against dozens while also hacking and setting traps at the same time. You’ll also brave gauntlets against an incoming tide of enemies while you defend your little sister helper while she’s gathering valuable power-up juice. The addition of these standoffs is a welcome one and adds some serious meat to the gameplay. Setting traps allows for some really creative tricks. This goes on from start to finish and gets more intense along the way. No difficulty falloff here. Difficulty in general; Bioshock 2 is quite challenging in its own right. Enemies hit hard and never stop attacking. So even on normal does it present a good challenge (unlike Infinite’s 1999 mode, which was as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.) Furthermore, the city of Rapture looks just as gorgeous as before. Ok, maybe the textures are a bit washed out, but when the place is flooded, everything looks washed out. One major problem persists the game and that is the stability. Bioshock 2 has a nasty habit of crashing to desktop for no apparent reason. I’m still vexed as to why it happens, but it annoys the living hell out of me and it has me save every ten minutes to prevent losing all that progress. Also, the controls are somewhat of a mess. You’ll have to tinker with them, but its manageable. There’s also a multiplayer mode…which I’m not even touching. I came here to drill people and save little sisters; and that’s just what this game lets you do.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sequals usually fall flat when people play them. Not very often does a sequal come by that impresses and wins over an original games audience. Lets face it, Bioshock 2 is a cash in on the success of Bioshock. Despite this, it does not fail as game, nor as a sequel. The overall gameplay of this game is far superier to that of the original. The weapon variety maybe not as diverse, and the weapon designs do not change drastically like the original, but still good weapons nonetheless. I mean, what other game can you play as zeus in a metal diving suit, with a gatling gun? In addition to this, the balence is better, the research process is better thought out, plasmids are not stupidly OP anymore, and you can actually get some neat tonics and upgrades to your Big Daddy. The little sister and escort sections are not tedious anymore either, they offer a nice break from the monotony of the main story. This is broken up with some nice tea parties with  former co-workers of yours, and some swims in the community fish tank. The games pacing is fluid from beginning to end, and does not chug at any point, unlike the original.Originally, my main criticism of Bioshock 2, is that it did not have that ""AHA"" moment the original had. Well lets just say that the DLC Mirvenas Den solves that problem. Everything I thought Bioshock 2 was lacking, that DLC contained. What it did, is offered that ""AHA"" moment that made the original so good. At first, I thought the DLC ending would be generic and terrible, only to find out the big plot twist at the end. This twist, along with the ending area/cutscene, offers a conclusive end to the rapture experiance. It finally wraps up the city in a satisfying way, something, neither game alone could do.In short, this game improves upon even facet of the original, maybe not to a shine, but certainly to some degree, and offers a conclusive ending to the original Bioshock series/Rapture. Giving this God-Forsaken underwater dystopia, finally a sense of peace.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are just a few games that gets stuck in my mind as 'O fekkin' Wow!' This one doesn't give it away in the first few hours. The first time I started to play I left it behind after a hour or two. A year later someone told me I must be out of my mind to not at least give it one play through. I reread some of the reviews and was convinced that I missed something. So I gave it another try.......glad I did. Bioshock is damn damn good. Not only the story. The atmosphere, the story, the weapons....so damn good. I'm playing the DLC now and when I finished that I'm going to do it all over again on 'hard' mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2, brings us back to the Steampunk-styled, dystopian alternate universe, where you have to unlock the mysteries of a city at the bottom of the ocean. I fell in love with the series after a short time playing the very first Bioshock. Bioshock 2 takes the story from Bioshock and continues it, deepening the mystery and making the player hunger for more. I found myself wanting to immerse myself in the story and learn all I could once again, while trying to survive not only the hidden things lurking around corners, but the scattered people who seem to have gone completely insame. I would recommend not only this game, but the entire Trilogy, as it was fun, exciting, and worth at least a playthough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Friend: ""Dude you need to play Bioshock 2 it's so good!""Me: ""Nah man I'm not a fan of shooters""Friend: ""Dude just play it""Me: "" Fine""...Wow, I didn't expect it to be this fun. Only have around two hours in it and I'm hooked, the story is great, the gameplay mechanics are great and the game has a really unique level design & playstyle to it. I love how it has a steady mix between action, and then it has this really creepy susepense to it where you're caught off guard every time.Would definitely recommend, especially for two dollars and to get the HD remaster for free with it.Thanks Rotgrowl for buying me this game bud, you rock!

												I previously did a written review on Bioshock 1 in 2012 which can be found at...http://planetarcane.blogspot.com/2012/11/backlogged-gaming-bioshock.htmlThat might help explain some of my thoughts on the basic premise before talking about Bioshock 2 itself. Now I know this game got a lot of flack when it came out. Both over the fact that it had multiplayer and that many felt it didn't live up to the previous game.I actually have to say I disagree on the second point. I enjoyed the story MORE in Bioshock 2 then I did in Bioshock. At a first glance the idea of playing as a Bid Daddy, these hulking monsters seems a tad absurd. But when you stop to think about it, they're not really monsters. They used to be human. Made all the more clear and horrifying in that opening cutscene where the Antagonist mind controls Delta before making him remove his helmet and shoot himself in the head all while we watch the event through his eyes. No I don't consider that a spoiler, it is literally the first scene in the game.The first game makes you stop and think about actions in games. How we just do what the game tells us. Bioshock 2 takes a pair we basically just saw as objects in the game previously A Big Daddy and his Little Sister, then put us in the shoes of the Big Daddy. But not just any Big Daddy, one who has had his Little Sister taken from him. His entire reason for living, not to mention being separated basically puts his life on a timer.And while I won't spoil it, the ending did bring me to tears. I can't deny that. But much like the first game IMO this one also suffers greatly from all the space in between the major story sections. After the opening, there isn't much that happens that is very memorable until close to the end of the game.I also found it weird that despite the situation your character is in, the game still expects you to kill other Big Daddies and take their Little Sisters for you own in order to make yourself stronger. Seems a bit contradictary to the main story.I can't actually comment on the multiplayer aspect of the game, not for lack of trying. I literally could not get a match started, there doesn't seem to be much of anyone playing online anymore.Overall I'd say it's an average game with an above average story. If you liked the first game and avoided this one because of reviews, you might want to reconsider IMO.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is better than bioshock 1 in every single way.9.9/10.any FPS fan should have it. as well as all other Shock games....details:Weapons are more fun to use and have new upgrades and ammo types.You can now shoot and use plasmids at the same time.You hack machines in real time, in a much more rewarding and skillfull way.Plasmids can now be upgraded too, to give you even more options on the battlefield.New enemy types which are chalanging and fun to fight aganist, old enemies are now smarter and use different weapons.The moral choices actuall have a lot more impact and meaning.The story is as interesting and captivating as ever, and the voice acting that mostly makes it, is stellar.Only drawbacks:Not as interesting to redicover rapture for the second time,the main antagonist, is not nearly as cool and interesting as Andrew RyanThe game becomes a bit repetetive in the end			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, so I've finished BioShock 2 twice now, with different choices and on different consoles.Let me break it down for you.BioShock 2 has an insanely good campaign, utilizing every mechanic you're taught in very diverse ways. BioShock 2 isn't labelled as open world, but there is plenty of exploring to do. There's tons of secrets; whether it be easter eggs, items or audio tapes that reveal the truth about Rapture. The campaign is of average length, depending if you're a completionist or a speed runner. I tried to explore as much as I could, and the campaign took me 8 hours. The campaign is emotional and gripping and leaves you to think over about the events that just occured. It's incredibly immersive and really makes you feel like you are Subject Delta, a deep sea diver who wondered upon the underwater city of Rapture, where he was accepted but not fully trusted. This led to him getting surgically modified; giving him vocal cord modulator surgery and bonding him with his own Little Sister, thus dubbing him a Big Daddy. Also, choices matter which makes it even more immersive as you decide your fate. Overall, I would give the campaign a 9/10, lacking only in some graphical features and seeming rather repetitive in some cases. Still, a MUST PLAY.The multiplayer is very enjoyable. You take the role of plasmid-bearing citizens of Rapture, all utilizing their own looks and characteristics. There is a levelling system in multiplayer, which is pretty cool (only if you play ranked). There are tons of diverse game modes that can keep you rotating through different scenarious and giving flavour (I use UK spelling, sorry Americans) to the multiplayer. There are many multiplayer communities that actively host lobbies (you can check them out on my profile, set as my primary group) which are extremely fun to be a part of. The multiplayer flows very well and has that arcade-y, arena-y feel to it. The multiplayer, I give an 8/10, an intense, fast-paced FPS experience, totally different from campaign.To summarise, BioShock 2 is a great game and a must play. It's one of the best games I've ever played. Don't waste money on the remaster as it does not feature multiplayer and has little graphical improvement. BioShock 2 gets an 8.5/10 from me. Be sure to buy this masterpiece!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sunken, sunken is BabylonI've heard that BioShock 2 is a 'simple shooter', failing in comparison with original BioShock, and I've learned it to be VERY far from truth. This is a great and unique game that actually made me fall in love with Rapture. Some minor spoilers ahead.The level design is superb. Set ~10 years after the end of BioShock, this game features Rapture that now truly became a sunken Babylon, beautiful and forlorn, mysterious and sad. The small underwater parts are a nice touch, I've always wanted to be able to travel the ocean floor! And the part where you are seeing Rapture through the eyes of the Little Sister is also perfect and very creepy, and it adds to the story a lot.And the story itself fits the setting perfectly, and is as interesting and rich as the BioShock's one, or even more so (it's hard to judge but BioShock2 had larger impact on me personally). There are more moral choices you make through the game (a man chooses! *wink wink*), and it helps you to immerse into the narrative, and the narrative reacts to these choices (frankly, hearing Sinclair say 'so a tin man had a heart of gold' made me tear a little). The music and voices are very good too.Gameplay is simply the best throughout the series. You have 8 different weapons/gadgets and 11 plasmids in 8 possible slots, and you can combine some of them (trap+elemental plasmids), and you also use security devices (dear flying bots, Alexander and Diego and Sean and Thoroughfare and Diana and the others I remember each and everyone of you you were my FRIENDS thank you oh I'm gonna cry now), and there are some physical upgrades of various types, and the fully upgraded plasmids felt POWERFUL. The controls and the map demand some getting used to but are handy overall (I hated plasmid/weapon change in BioShock and, though it is perfectly reasonable, having only 2 weapons and a few physical enhancements in Infinite seemed rather restrictive, also, having NO MAP was a nightmare). Some say that guarding Little Sisters while they gather ADAM seems repetitive but I actually liked this kind of challenge - it was fun (with a right touch of nervousness) to prepare the location for the splicers attack using traps and other countermeasures.Overall, I loved the bathysphere atmosphere of the game a lot. There are fewer outright scary moments than in BioShock, but the place itself seems... haunted. Dark, and lonely, and dying, and mutating. Babylon turning into Leviathan.Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?Play it. Obey. OBEEEEY! Ahem. No, really, try it. Open the seashell and swallow the pearl. See it's glowing?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Would I recommend this game"" is a difficult question. The game itself is good. It may be the weakest installment in the Bioshock franchise to date, but the weakest installment of an amazing series is still pretty great. The reason I decided to say ""no"" is because of the amount of crap I had to go through just to get the game to play. I have about 16 hours of playtime logged, and I'm willing to bet a good half of it was spent troubleshooting, checking to see if various fixes worked, replaying segments and sometimes entire levels... it got old, fast. For a game that's been out for so long to not have a single fix for everything is pretty inexcusable, especially one that you're expected to pay for. I ended up looking up various guides on Steam and 2K's support forum to get the game to work, uninstalling and reinstalling the game twice, uninstalling and reinstalling programs on my computer, tinkering with files, settings, and compatibility modes, even editing the .ini file itself. The most prominent issues I had were it constantly crashing shortly after starting the game (just when you get the rivet gun), on the loading screen to Siren Alley, the loading screen for Fontaine Futuristics, and near the end of the Fontaine Futuristics level. All of these required multiple attempts on my part to fix and finally finish.On the other hand, my closest friend also has the Steam version of this game and reports not having the same problems. But for any game to give anyone this much problem, I wouldn't recommend spending your money on a roll of the dice to see whether or not it'll work (for the record, I had no problems with the original Bioshock, so don't assume that just because you played through that with no problems, you won't encounter issues here). It's truly upsetting that what could, and should, have been a pleasant, fun gaming experience turned into a frustrating nightmare, and as soon as I got to the ending, I uninstalled and washed my hands of it. Multiplayer? Other endings? Achievements? Forget about it, not worth the grief.If you do decide to give it a shot (in which case I recommend a console version), here's what I thought, issues getting the game to run aside: like I said, it may be the weakest link in Bioshock's Great Chain, but that doesn't mean it's a total waste of time. A lot of the gameplay was simplified from the first game (such as hacking, researching, even the Tonics all being in one area instead of being in four categories with different slots you need to open), some undoubtedly for the better (it's telling hacking and researching didn't appear in Infinite) and some for the worst. There is the mechanic of carrying around Little Sisters and guarding them as they gather, akin to the ending of the first game only much faster and less frustrating (with tonics to maximize ADAM and speed up the process becoming available fairly early). However, there's up to three Little Sisters per level, and each one can gather up to twice. It's really up to you how you decides to handle them, as in the original, but the fact remains you're still going to have to throw down with a Big Daddy and you're still going to have to deal with them somehow if you want ADAM.The main point that this game got a lot of flack for was the story. The game was, admittedly, a cash grab/attempt to keep the Bioshock name alive while Ken Levine and Take-Two/Irrational were working on Infinite, farmed out to 2K Marin. I, personally, think they did a decent enough job with what they had. The story lacked the symbolism and social commentary that made the first one so powerful, and a lot of the mystique and creepiness that Rapture had during the first outing is absent here. I won't even claim the story made total sense in the end (you pretty much need all the supplemental materials, including the dubiously canon novel Bioshock: Rapture by John Shirley, which did have input from Ken Levine, to make it close to solid). And, to quote the venerable Yahtzee, the original Bioshock's story didn't really need a direct sequel. But I wouldn't say the whole thing is a wash, either. For one thing, there's at least two moments in this game (I won't give spoilers) that I personally felt were some of the most powerful in the entire series to date.It really seems like when they were at the drawing board, whether intentionally or not, 2K Marin got it in their head that in making a game that wasn't basically an exact rehash of the first, they needed to make it as different as possible, and ended up creating the original on Opposite Day. WHAT FOLLOWS ARE SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST GAME!Whereas in Bioshock, you play a man that starts out with nothing and gradually finds his purpose throughout the game, in Biooshock 2, the main character has lost everything, including his identity (he's a Big Daddy), and is on a desperate journey, whether out of compulsion or genuine concern, to reclaim the one thing he had left. Whereas Andrew Ryan was a staunch objectivist who constantly extolled the value of looking out for yourself and acting in your own self-interest, the main villain of this game, Sofia Lamb, is a collectivist, with a cult built around being utterly selfless and willing to lay down your life if it would better serve mankind as a whole. Throughout the first game, you're guided by a man who seems kind, helpful, and sincere, but ultimately betrays you and reveals you were an unwitting pawn in his grand plan all along. In Bioshock 2, you're largely guided by a man who is a confessed and mostly unrepentant sleezeball, who makes no secret of the fact that he's mostly using you as a means to get him out of Rapture as well so he can profit off of the technology there. As he knows his plans hinge on you achieving your goal, he's willing to play ball. And let me add that 2K Marin deserves some major props for making a character that is so slimy, yet ultimately charming and likable.All in all, it's a fun game. You won't miss anything for skipping it, especially now that Infinite is out, and I personally wouldn't blame you if you decided to give it a pass and not bother with this slightly subpar installment in the franchise. But with 2K Marin now in charge of the franchise as a whole, it might be worth it if you're a fan of the series just to see how they've handled it in the past. Just, for the love of little yellow duckies, play it on a console and don't waste your time, money, and possibly hours of frustration trying to play the Steam version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												KNOW THIS, the game is great, I enjoyed it alot.The reason it is not recommended, is strictly dueto technical issues.Gameplay:You go through 9 areas in Rapture City in justthe same fashion as in the first game; Taking onBig Daddies to get to Little Sisters, looting deadenemies and every kind of containers you comeacross, obtain and upgrade your weapons, plasmidsand gene-tonics. It's all in there.The main differences being first off how thisinstallment is not as free roaming as the firstgame was, where you could move between the areas.In this sequel, you have to make sure you've doneall you want to do in a level before you move on,because there is no chance going back once you do.Then you have the so called Big Sisters, a newenemy that will make Big Daddies seem like a 90year old, compared to Bruce Lee.Not only are you merely playing as a Big Daddy,you can also do his main-duty of adopting LittleSisters and protecting them, while they collectADAM from corpses to give you more.Controls:Not much to say, the controls are fluent.I can't see anything amiss in them, there areslightly more features than in the first game.Music:It's music includes old real life classics, a newcollection of course, mostly in the Jazz genre.You can tell from the background music when atough enemy is on the way, it gets dramatic.Graphics:The graphics are done exactly in the same delicateway like in the first game, having great water andfire effects.Story:Takes place 10 years after the first game, whichshould then be 1969. You are a Delta model of aBig Daddy, having been shot dead, but resurrectedand stored within a Vita Chamber by your ownLittle Sister, this back in 1959.The 10 years pass, and you awake with your goalof reunite with your, now grown up, Little Sister.Bug and Drawback Listing:*Random crashing, which is the most common issueyou may experience when playing. It may differon exactly how it happens, depending on who youask. For me, the game just shut down without anyinformation at all, close to 20 times in totalduring my whole playthrough.*Hits on enemies just refuse to register alotof times while in battle. This occurs often ifthe enemy is doing some kind of animation whileyou hit it, and is therefor seen mainly on HoudiniSplicers and Alpha Series, as they are using alotof graphical effects. But sometimes even a slowwalking Ledhead Splicer at distance, can somehowbe invulnerable, the shots will just go throughwhilst leaving its impact on the wall behind.This leaves little to no use for the improvedzoom upgrade to the speargun for example.It feels like the game design was primarly aimedfor the player going for the drill and plasmids.While the gun selection is showing a great mix,the hit registration sometimes drags it down.*Enemies can suddenly spawn out of thin air.This causes a problem if you have cleared a roomand are setting up traps for a planned battle.Suddenly random enemies can spawn behind yourback and trigger your traps that you have put timeand effort on for a upcoming fight.Conclusion:I'm afraid I can't recommend this specific portversion of the game.By purchasing this, you are putting it all up tochance. Its a lottery how the game will run onyour PC, depending on a combination of yourhardware, drivers and other OS softwares.Such application behaviour is by me, unacceptable.Get a console version instead.

												What an excellent game! I bought it a while ago in the Bioshock Bundle (Bioshock + Bioshock 2) and finally played through it. In the beginning I had problems to play the game without crashing but found a solution in the Community Hub. The game was amazing and I really liked the story. The playtime was just perfect, I dedicated an evening to each chapter, but I just had to play the last three chapters in one session because it was so amazing. To everyone hesitating to buy the game, buy it when it is on sale, it should be -75% from my experience. But if you don't want to wait, buy it full prize, I think it's worth it. I already bought Bioshock Infinite and can't wait to play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Plain and simple: The story to Bioshock 2 pales in comparison to Bioshock 1.The good news is that when not compared side-by-side, the plot seems to the second installment of the Bioshock franchise is decent. And the better news is that the improvements to gameplay are fantastic. The stupid pipe-puzzle hacking game has been replaced with a new ""stop the dial in the green (preferably blue) zone"" that DOESN'T PAUSE COMBAT. And now you can use plasmids in your left hand and guns in your right. The controls are sooo much smoother. Researching, AI, and enemy diversity are all improved.And then there's Minerva's Den. Get Minerva's Den.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After having finished it, I will never quite understand why Bioshock 2 was panned the way it was. Mechanicly, it's equally as impressive (and in some parts, more so) than its predecessor. Of course after having played the first (and the first being one of my favorite games, period), the mystique of Rapture is worn just a bit, however that doesn't make it any less of an awe inspiring enviroment. The story, whilst lacking a ""game about games"" meta narrative (at least, from what I could pick up), is still well written and superbly delivered. The game is also as good looking as the first. The visuals as well as the haunting orchestral score create a tense and decrepit atmosphere that completely absorbed me, just as the first game did. Bioshock 2 stands shoulder to shoulder with its brothers, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're a fan of either of the other two games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2, the very definition of a misunderstood sequel!And so here I was, about 4 years after I played the original BioShock for the first time (the one on steam was the second) and was left amazed by the marvellously haunting underwater world and history of Rapture, the time had come to see how the story moved on.Truth be told, I am by nature negatively biased towards sequels of great games, since the result rarely is on par with the originals.At the same time, from online reviews and friends opinions I was expecting a generally mediοcre sequel, not really bad, but a lot inferior.What I got instead was a great game that was a lot reminiscent of its predecessor and that at the same time managed to put it's own touch and distinguish itself from it!The game is vastly big, since, except from its main single player story, which is already long enough to be comparable to the first one's, it also includes a multiplayer campaign, plus two more DLCs, so let me analyze them one by one!- The single player campaign, for starters: you start out as a Big Daddy (an older model of it actually), with it's two trademark weapons (the drill and the rivet gun) and the ability to escort Little Sisters at their ADAM gatherings, which I found to be a really nice idea to stand out from the first game, since it gave you the opportunity to see the world from a different perspective.The story is a bit confusing at first, you don't know who you are and what you are doing and I'll admit that, while I initially liked that, as the game progressed on this ""amnesia"" of sorts got a bit tiresome, since it prevented you from enjoying the story and its (small) twists.The first game was ahead in that aspect, since it made you start out pretty much confident about who you were and what you were doing, only to destroy that all at its half, with an amazing twist, one of the best of its kind. However the remaining half of the original BioShock wasn't as thrilling as the first one, though it definitely wasn't bad, just decent.Now, BioShock 2 took another route, to the end of the game you get to know very few things about the protagonist, as, little by little, you learn something more, all until the final levels, where the big twist kicks in and you find all the truth about yourself! The twist was, maybe, just a little inferior from the one of the first game, but it was still very good.Continuing on, aside from the story, the game made some great additions in the gameplay, that improved a lot the old one. For starters, the weapons/plasmids system was positively changed a bit, making them easier to handle, while at the same time new weapons and plasmids were added, greatly differentiating themselves from the older ones.Speaking of gameplay, when I first played Dishonored (another great game) I remember describing it as a ""stealth based BioShock"", well... upon playing BioShock 2 I found even more similarities to Dishonored than the first game and not just in gameplay, but storywise too (ie, in Dishonored you have to save a little girl named Emily and in BioShock 2 one named Eleanor). After all, Arkane Studios was involved in the making of both games, so that probably played its part. However, there too, Dishonored took it's own distinctive path, so I wouldn't call it a ripoff, in fact it even improved on many of these similarities that I noticed between said games (like a fast teleporting plasmid present in BioShock 2's multiplayer, named Aerodash, which was a lot similar to the vastly superior Blink ability in Dishonored... and how much I missed that ability in BioShock 2... ).Moving on, aside from the improved weapon and plasmid mechanics and some new splicers, BioShock 2 introduced an amazing foe: the Big Sister, who essentially was an evolution of the Big Daddy! I found them great for a change in the game's world, since they were really tough to beat and getting ready to ""greet"" them was scary enough, sometimes (I even remember getting ready to fight one and getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked, only to be saved by, not one, but two cluelessly walking Big Daddies, that, upon being caught in the Big Sister's attacks, started attacking her as well, saving my lucky self!).Another big change in the gameplay was the ability to ""wirelessly"" hack machines, a change which I ended up really appreciating, despite the hack being done in real time, with enemies potentially attacking you.The graphics and soundtrack were, more or less, similar to the first's, with the former being slighly improved, but nothing too great. In itself that was a good thing, since it made the game stay closer to its predecessor.The game's levels dimensions were also changed, since the first game had many levels split in two parts (maybe because of limitations PCs had at that time), while BioShock 2 had 9 huge levels, which I mistakenly thought to be few at first, though being slightly smaller in total.Lastly, the game's main antagonist wasn't as thrilling as the two ones of the original BioShock, but she was good enough.Thankfully the final levels, upon learning your true identity and onwards, were quite good and action packed, so much that they even provided you with a great ally, which I won't spoil and I'll let you discover for yourself (for a single level you also got to play as a Little Sister, which was cool)!The ending was, once again, faithful to the original, where some of your choices in the game affected its outcome (much like in Dishonored, too).- Changing subject, I'll now go to the multiplayer campaign: overall, I didn't feel satisfied by it and that being because the game had some, difficult enough, multiplayer achievements, while at the same time it was not optimized well enough, resulting in a lot of lag (myself aside, I found others having the same problem too) and in almost empty lobbies, making the achievement hunt quite frustrating.However, that said, the multiplayer part was not all bad, it's gameplay was in fact quite good and balanced (though not entertaining enough) and it took part in a period before the events of the first BioShock, during Rapture's civil war, making it a bit more interesting.- And to the final part, we get to the game's two DLCs: the Protector Trials and Minerva's Den.The first one was not much related to the main story, but not totally unrelated too. Once again reminding me of Dishonored's first DLC (Dunwall City Trials), it comprised of many challenges were you once again assumed the role of a Big Daddy and had to protect a Little Sister during her ADAM gatherings, but with a specific set of weapons and plasmids each time, making the whole thing fun enough, while mixing just a bit of story in it and awarding you with some extra art and trailers of BioShock 2, for every succesful gathering you made.The second DLC was, instead, a continuation of the story and ended up being really good and long just enough to keep your interest on. You once again took the role of a Big Daddy with a mysterious story on its back, immersing yourself in the game's levels to find it out, all of this happening in another, unexplored, part of Rapture, with new weapons and enemies mixed in (the Ion Laser gun being its coolest addition).The DLC's ending was good enough, with the final twist being slightly more predictable than the main game's, but not too much, while at the same time providing a good closure to the world of Rapture.All in all, I found BioShock 2 to be a fantastic game and only slightly inferior to the original, most of it being due to the fact that you were already introduced and familiar to the world of Rapture from the latter. Hopefully the third game, BioShock Infinite, will manage to reignite the marvel of discovering a hidden city, this time in the sky (can't wait to play it as well)!But don't let that frighten you, since you are once again in for a Shock, so... would you kindly play BioShock 2?

												The second game in the Bioshock franchise and some say it is better than the first, I can't make that statement on either of them because of how much I loved them both.Just like the first Bioshock this one changes the game on how you play a First Person Shooter and adds a whole new way of doing things with perfection to a tee and the added a multiplayer to this as well although it's not in the campaign it is still fun provided you have people to play with but thats no fault of the game. I personaly started out not being able to get into the game and could only get myself to play 2-3 hours at a time (also do to the crashes this game is known for) but then at some point I was hooked and could'nt put it down. The story picks up around the middle and becomes extremely challenging and a lot of fun with coloful characters to fight and get help from and playing as a Big Daddy made a hige difference in the play style of the game. The game looks beautiful just like the first and lets you explore a much different side of Rapture and they also added a bit of religious undertones to the game which I think were an amazing addition because it added to the story a lot without making something a huge part that you were confused if you missed.The only negative to this game is that on PC it crashes a lot and will induce a ton of rage but other than that perfection again.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can call me a hipster, but I like this one more than the original or Infinite. There's just something about this particular story, these particular characters and this particular Rapture, that was amiss in the other two. While Bioshock established Rapture as a location and told a story of its founder, Bioshock 2 focuses more on the lives of Rapture's ordinary inhabitants, and boy, does it add to the immersion. The storyline is less linear, allowing an option to spare or kill not only Little Sisters, but bosses as well, which leads to one of 6 endings.The core of the gameplay stayed almost untouched since the original Bioshock, but with some new features. Action-packed harvesting sessions and Big Sister fights are intertwined with the calm and tranquil seabed walks. In addition to previously seen weapons, you have Big Daddy's iconic drill and Rivet Gun at your disposal. Also, you can use both weapons and plasmids in a fight, without swapping one for the other (for me personally it seemed kind of stupid that it wasn't like this all along).In short, if you just finished Bioshock, and can't get enough of Rapture, get Bioshock 2 in a heartbeat. You won't regret it.Also, playing as a Big Daddy is beyond cool. 10 drill dashes out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Exploring BioShock 2's Rapture side places, I was totally confused of the amazed grapping city!The original BioShock and BioShock: Infinite were so much better than BioShock 2; The two of them had over the top elements in each hand also BioShock 2 had it too, but BioShock 2 ""can't"" be compared to both, although is BioShock 2 is alot more than you think right now. The BioShock franchise is totally uncompared to others.to me, no other developer can make a franchise that counts over the 8.9 rating. BioShock franchise have the best unique stories, endings and gameplays. If I say, what is the best franchise in gaming over all the had been playing franchise? I would ratherly say, It's a piece of cake question, goes to pretty eaisly BioShock franchise.BioShock:Story: 10/10result: 9.2/10BioShock 2:Story: 10/10result: 9.1/10BioShock Infinite:Story: 10/10result: 10/10BioShock Franchise:94.3% AmazingBUY THEM ALL!

Where to begin...The game is really fun to play, pretty long campaign,Graphics are fine(but who cares about graphics).Tho my game crashed sevreal times (Actually alot) but the storyline is well made so i continued.One of the reasons i played this game is because the adorable creature named ""Little sister"", how can you not love them, Learn to be True daddy and take good care of your “Little sisters”.So far this is one of my 4 Favorite games to play.To sum up, i recommend the game to everybody, it does worth the time and money to play itPersonal Score 10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found this to not be as ""scary"" as the original, but it had a lot more action in my opinion. There were definitely improvements in the combat (i.e. plasmid in the left hand, weapon in the right hand). This is a great ""sequel"" to the first game. It essentially leads off right where the first one ended. I will not spoil the story in this review, but this game provides great insight into the big daddy and little sister relationship.I played this game on the hardest difficulty for my first play through, I have not tested the other difficulties, but I would only assume them to be child's play. If you played the first one through, I would recommend playing this on the hardest difficulty.I plan to complete the game again and acquire all the achievements I missed from my first play through.If you have played the first Bioshock and enjoyed the story and game play I would recommend playing this one through as there is a lot of interesting backstory and improvements in the game play.*Purchased Bioshock Triple Pack from the Steam Summer Sale			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is a huge disappointment in comparison to Bioshock. The game's story was kinda blah, and well felt in it's own way too similar to the first. Unlike some I thought it was cool that it was in Rapture again, but they did not have to have the story completly the same.In Bioshock 2 the game is much different. In Bioshock 2 you are a Big Daddy. Instead of tommy guns, pistols etc. for weapons, you get Big Daddy weapons. This may sound cool, but it is not as exciting as it sounds. The game is in many ways babified, in they simplified things that did not need it. The hacking was simplified so easy a child could do it, and they give guides for things like the eve system that were straightforward to begin with. The game in general also feels more simplistic than the first Bioshock.The Multi-player was really blah and I think they could have made a better single-player if they spent more resources on the single-player instead.I originally owned Bioshock 2 on the Xbox 360 and got it in a 3 pack on steam for PC. On the Xbox 360 the game was stable, on the PC you have to turn off advanced graphics features offered by DirectX 10 to prevent it from constantly crashing, which is pathetic. I guess I would be mad if I did not get it almost free.I highly recommend getting Bioshock 1 if you have not played it, I only recommend 2 if you want to see what the story is like. I warn you, you will probably be disappointed. The only reason I am playing through it again is to get the steam achievements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: Bioshock 2 is better than Bioshock 1 and you should definitely buy it.Improvements over Bioshock 1:-Dual wield plasmids and guns-More smooth gameplay-Level 3 plasmid upgrades-More moral choices-Your choices having a more detailed impact on the ending-Better preformance on newer systems-Some cool new Plasmids-A few new guns-More unique gun upgrades-Deeper exploration between litle sister/big daddy link-Cool multiplayer (pretty much dead now, but it's there)Improvements in my opinion (subjective):-More empathetic main villain-A better final boss fight-Cooler companion characters-I love the little sister defence sectionsNeutral:-Same environment style. Just as good as 1, but we're used to it by now so it's not as effective-Several Plasmids are reusedWeaknesses to Bioshock 1:-Stealth is nowhere near as prominant-A few bits of the story drag (Looking at you, Siren's Alley)-You'll be swimming in loot at the end of the game, removing most challenge-Doesn't have a huge twist in itOverall, this is a game that got alot of bad rep at launch just because it wasn't made by the orignal creators. Still, it's easy to see lot's of love went into this game. In fact, a few of the ideas from Bioshock 2 were taken into Bioshock Infinite. Now, more than ever, it's totally worth picking up for a blast of the Rapture experience.Now, would you kindly go and take your daugter back?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was a good sequal to its predecessor. More variety of enemies than the first, the characters were memorable but not as memorable as the first Bioshock. The music choice was very good for this game and it was so good that you would listen to the loading times longer than you need too cuz of the excellent choice of music. This is way much better than ""Infishit"" and has the most polished gameplay out of all the three Bioshock games because of dual wielding and it didn't feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing CoD game like what Inifnite did and the drill was very fun to use.

												Bioshock 2 is another great game to the series. There are alot of aspects of this game that I liked and some i didnt like about the game.I'll start off listing the positives: + Great immersive gameplay.+ Wide variety of guns to use and some old ones from the past game.+ Story takes place back in Rapture again for the unique atmosphere.+ This game still had a creepy vibe till the very end.+ DLC was enjoyable and really expands on the game.Here are some negatives that come to mind:- I had 5 random game crashes where my game didnt end up saving. (To fix put ""-dx9"" in launch options.)- Some sound issues were present while shooting and getting hit by enemies.- While playing on the hardest difficulty I still found the game pretty easy.- Big sisters will♥♥♥♥♥♥you till the end. :(Overall this is a good game and I do recommend it to anyone.My Rating: ★★★★☆PS: Play Bioshock 1 for the story.Play Bioshock 2 for the gameplay.Play Bioshock Infinite for both aspects.

												BioShock 2 is one of my favourite games. Some time after it came out, I saw it was getting spit on and dismissed, but I didn't really pay attention to that, as I assumed it was the all too well known kneejerk reaction of the smug fanboy portion of the players.I got it and went in unbiased. I don't want to compare it to the others in terms of which I think is best, because I love them all separately and as a whole, but it does quite a few things better than the other two titles. What I can say is, I think 2 had the best combat out of the games, because there were so many possibilities, especially with the dual-wielding and the plasmid trap combos. That's not to say I think the combat in 1 or Infinite wasn't good; in fact, I liked it in both games, although less in Infinite. Of course, the latter had a variety of Vigor and weapon combos as well, but not nearly as big as 2.BioShock 2 also improved on many mechanics like the Camera, plasmid use, hacking, Little Sister interactions, upgrading, as well as things like the visuals and more. However, what I most love about it is the bond I felt with Eleanor and how my actions actually changed her character and demeanor. I really wanted to help her, I wanted her to be safe. And seeing the statues of me rescuing the NPCs through the Little Sister's eyes really made me emotional, as did the whole Little Sister adoption and subsequent saving mechanics. It was so touching to see how playing a merciful, forgiving Delta changed how the NPCs reacted to you and pretty much established you as the most human character in the game, even though you were, as Sinclaire roughly put it, a ""tin man"". And who can forget the Big Sister fights? They were the ultimate test for your skills, weapons, plasmids. And the ending monologue Eleanor does for the best ending, as well as that pan of Rapture with the main theme of the first game and her saying, ""And then, Father, the Rapture dream was over."" Man. That was one of the several moments in the game where I teared up and felt introspective about the whole (at the time) BioShock world.""The Ocean On His Shoulders"". How fitting indeed.I really like Lamb as a villain as well, because she was so different, yet almost as well-designed as Andrew Ryan in some aspects.I was invested all the way throughout BioShock 2, as I was with 1 and Infinite. I went in without prejudice and I got one hell of a good game out of it, so I can strongly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The are several guides that easily fix that, so I highly recommend to switch to direct X 9 to fix it. I still strongly suggest you to save as often as needed in case the game crash. The online capture / defend the sister may crash sometimes. Even if I played a few time, mostly 4 or 5 times. I still strongly recommend this game !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2, and indeed the entire BioShock series, is not a game, but a work of art. The story is a tad abstract, but also deeply relevant: what is the essence of humanity, of self-improvement? How far is too far?If you are looking for a thinking man's FPS, this is what you've been searching for. Even if you don't enjoy FPS/story-driven  games, you need to play BioShock and its sequel. I also strongly suggest getting the Minerva's Den DLC, which is fantastic.That being said, if you don't own the series yet, wait until September when 2K release the remastered collection. Highly recommended otherwise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bioshock 2After passing the first game of which is a great production that does not change the fact that the second part of Bioshock is very good. A series of this game shows that production has an interesting storyline and of an unusual atmosphere. The story tells us about the subject Delta that as a result of the forced suicide act on it goes into a coma and after 10 years we wake up and our goal is to find our little sister. The story is very interesting and suspenseful. The graphics are old but on her age is quite pretty. As in every Bioshock the climate, soundtrack and voice acting stand at a high level. The game includes a single player and multiplayer. The game also includes a new mode which is called the Protector Trials there and our job is to protect little sisters when they collect Adam. For each mission unlocks made ​​various interesting information about the game. As for the multiplayer I did not played too long but a lot of people still playing and they have a really high levels. Multiplayer has a leveling system but I do not know really how it works. Before fun with the game on the network you will choose one of the characters that will be shown to you but differences is only in appearance and gender. With this game, I spent many happy hours at the playing the main storyline and I did it twice. My final score is 9/10. Bioshock 2: Minerva's DenAs for the DLC that is called on Minerva's Den, I must admit that I have not played as good DLC a long time. The story concerns about the subjectf Sigma and his cooperation with Tenenbaum and C. M. Porter on the machine called The Thinker and a person called Reed Wahl, Porter enemy. Also, we are going to learn something new about our main character. The truth about who is our hero can be shocking for some people. These DLC estimate at 10/10 and why 'cause it is very engaging and climate. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like most of the first person shooters in here this one was good. It kept me entralled for hours. It was tough and grueling but doable. I threw up my hands and turned it off a whole bunch of times but when I came back in the answer was there. Good fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best Bioshock. The combat is actually pretty fun, and the weapons convey the heaviness and power of a BigDaddy in a way that is, dare I say it: ""immersive"". Instead of plinking away at bullet sponges, you are tearing most enemies (even late game) apart like so much water-logged toilet paper. Very few games are willing to let the player feel like a mini-Boss, and I really liked it here. I also enjoyed the plot more this time around. It doesn't have any bits as cool as the ""Would you kindly"" twist, but overall the combination of the story, and the characters fits together better.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of people told me that Bioshock 2 is terrible, sucks and I should just skip to Infinite. I thought I'd see for myself when the game was on sale for cheap and I have to say I disagree completely. The game is a lot more shootery than Bioshock, and a lot of the things that made everyone say ""wow"" when they saw the first game for the first time is not that effective anymore, but this is still a really good game. The story takes a little to pick up, as the inital 3-4 hours are glacial, confusing and seem to go nowhere, but after that it's awesome.Highly recommended			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review for Bioshock: Here.Review for Bioshock Remastered: Here.**Note: This is NOT a review for the Remastered version. If you would like to see my Bioshock 2 Remastered review, please click here.*Excuse the play hours. I've much more on console and the Remastered version.When Bioshock 2 was announced, it unleashed a shock-wave of excitement throughout the gaming community; its predecessor had been a monumental success, and people could not wait to see what the sequel had in store. Born three long years after the original title, it's safe to say that Bioshock 2 did not disappoint in terms of gameplay, visuals, and setting, although many fans agree that the plot and characters are not quite as memorable as those from the first installment.The game begins in the year 1958, two years prior to the events of the first Bioshock, and shows the main character that you play, known as Subject Delta, patrolling Rapture with his Little Sister, Eleanor. Some events happen, and the game fast forwards ten years later to the year 1968 (not 1970 as the store page misleads you to believe). Subject Delta, also known as Johnny Topside prior to his conversion into a Big Daddy, has set out to find Eleanor, who is now a young adult in her teens. Time is pressing, however, as the longer a Big Daddy is away from his Little Sister, the higher the odds of him slipping into a coma are. There's but one problem standing in your way, a highly manipulative and slightly insane woman named Sophia Lamb. She has replaced Andrew Ryan as the main antagonist, while Augustus Sinclair helps guide you throughout Rapture through radio messages. Yes, you read that right. This time around, you get to play as an actual Big Daddy; arguably the most appealing feature of the entire game. You can also take on other Big Daddies to take their Little Sisters, and you can protect them as they're harvesting ADAM from angels. After letting the Little Sister gather from two angels, you take her back to her vent and choose to either harvest or rescue her. Harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters has an impact on the end game cutscene, and there are a total of three different endings. New to the tried and true Splicers and Big Daddies are now Big Sisters, which wear much of the same gear as a Big Daddy but they're much slimmer, quicker, and deadlier.Another improvement to the gameplay is the ability to wield both a weapon and a Plasmid at the same time, where as in the original Bioshock you had to constantly swap between the two. However, there's a huge glitch in the game that causes your left arm, which is the one that uses Plasmids, to disappear until you either die or get talked to by Eleanor. There are also a new assortment of weapons, such as the drill, grenade launcher, and speargun, and there are a mix of new and old Plasmids to enjoy as well, 11 in total.Bioshock 2 feels a lot more linear than its predecessor, as there aren't as many non-essential rooms to explore. However, the lush environments and fantastic atmosphere more than make up for the overall closed maps. A huge feature, aside from being a Big Daddy of course, is being able to occasionally venture outside of Rapture, onto the ocean floor. The oceanic scenes and moments spent underwater are beautifully crafted, and make you realize just how small you are in comparison to the immense structure that is the city of Rapture. The Art Deco style has been down-scaled in this installment in lieu of a more steampunk style, which ends up coming full circle in Bioshock Infinite.One thing that really brought this game down was the inclusion of a multiplayer element. I'm not even sure if the servers are still active anymore, but I did play some multiplayer on console when the game was brand new. Like most games that should stay as a single player experience but don't, the multiplayer was terrible and mostly consisted of death matches between Big Daddies and Splicers. I'm not alone in my distaste for the multiplayer element, as you will see most other reviewers also scorn it as well. This 'feature', however, has been dropped in the Bioshock 2 Remastered version.Is Bioshock 2 better than the first game? Absolutely not. It's nowhere near as memorable in terms of story or plot, but the gameplay is where this title really shines. Playing as a Big Daddy is satisfying in every imaginable way, from the killing and being able to use a drill, to protecting Little Sisters and helping them harvest ADAM. It's the experience that fans would've been continuing to ask for until we got it, but luckily 2K had the foresight to just go ahead and do it. Sophia Lamb is definitely not as charming a villain as Andrew Ryan or Atlas, but she does have her moments. It's a worthwhile experience for the fan of the Bioshock universe, just don't go in expecting as gripping of a tale.Rating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The red headed stepchild of the Bioshock franchise, Bioshock 2 was the game that was made by another studio, has a multiplayer mode people felt it didn't belong and continued a story people didn't think needed to be revisited. That's probably what you know about this game. Well, I for one say Bioshock 2 is great, worth playing and shouldn't be skipped. It feels more like a side story that takes place after than a true sequel but Bioshock 2, and its DLC Minverva's Den, has a enjoyable story on its own rights with a better implementation of morality and multiple endings than the first. It's also the only Bioshock game I found to be balanced and enjoyable to play during the entire run. It offers more insight into the Big Daddy/Little Sisters relationship and true nature and its themes tie arguably closer to Infinite's than the original Bioshock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a proper sequel which expands not only on the story but also on the gameplay of the 1st. The only problems it has are technical issues such as broken DX11 mode and the occasional glitches, but despite all that I think this is the best Bioshock game all the way through. Minerva's Den DLC is excellent as well. I recommend playing this one first and then playing the 1st one which is also phenomenal in it's own right, then play Infinite.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Bioshock 2 > Bioshock > Bioshock Infinite.And with this statment I could end it here. Bioshock 2 is an incredible steampunk thriller rpg fps game. OST at its finest, the story will definetly catch you. Multiplayer is something you can avoid, for the single player mode is the MAIN thing.You'll have a large variety of weapons as for powers (both active and passive abilities), high interaction with the environment, AI smart enough.Highly recommended, but only after you played the first chapter of the saga!Vote: 9/10. One point missing because they tried to make something as basic as the first weapon more powerful as the game goes on, but they forgot about some other weapons, such as the second, which is kinda useless after the third level.

												With minor gameplay improvements and noticeable graphical improvements over its predecessor, Bioshock 2 is a worthy successor which delves further into the dystopian city of Rapture. The storyline is not as gripping, perhaps because so much is already known about Rapture from the first game. But a few new gameplay tweaks make the combat much more interesting than in the first game and as a result make up for what the game lacks in unique atmosphere and interesting storytelling. Overall, it is worth a purchase for fans of the first game looking to see more of Rapture and enjoy the gameplay a little more during the ride. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   Though not lead by the same team that made Bioshock 1, Bioshock 2 somehow surpasses its predecsessor in many aspects. Little annoyances from Bioshock have been fixed, and core pieces of the gameplay have been expanded upon to deliever a more fufilling overall experience. Things like the Hack Gun, which allows for long distance hacking, and the much needed duel wielding of plasmids and primaries smooth out kinks and polish the Bioshock formula to a shine.   The little sister/big daddy system from the original has also been expanded, and the gameplay and story integration really hits a peak here. You are the big daddy now, and these little girls are yours to protect. No other game has been able to match the sheer burst of primal anger you get when the sound of that child crying for help echoes through the room. Pitty the poor fool who dared to lay a hand on Your little sister.    Not spoiling anything here, the story is quite heartfelt: Your role as a big daddy delivers some crucial context to the lives of these hulking protectors, and the relationship they have with both the little ones and the city as a whole. You'll come out of the experience (assuming you didnt harvest the girls like a complete monster) feeling, for lack of better words, like a dad. A proud one at that.   Though not anything really new in relation to the first game, Bioshock 2 delivers what I personally believe to be Bioshock at its smoothest and most polished. Worth every penny. tldr: Its Good, You're a Dad Now. Congratulations. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is very similar to Bioshock, which is a steam-punk version of System Shock.The story is as interesting and with the same gradual build-up to the peak dramatic intensity of the ending, which is great. Although, some things are confusing, e.g., only after watching an explanation on YouTube, did I understand that Bioshock 2 protagonist is not the same as in Bioshock.They simplified the hacking system, made it more faster. The hacking in the first part was overkill.The enemies are basically the same, only brute splicers and big sisters are introduced. And it's fine with me. What else to think of, if it's the same environment with the same inhabitants?In overall, I can say that Bioshock 2 doesn't offer nothing radically new, it feels more like a remake – the way the Bioshock should have been made.Bioshock 2 offers a smooth RPG-FPS experience with an interesting story. It feels somewhat repetitive, as I approach each level in the same way and all the levels feel the same, too, although the difficulty is gradually increasing. At times I felt almost bored, but the last 2 levels compensate for that, as the story gets really interesting. And the ending is really, really cool. As in the first part, it is determined by your moral choices during the game.My overall rating is 7/10. It's a good game, but I wouldn't recommend to play it right after you have finished the first part, as they are very similar and you might get fed up with the Rapture environment.It's also quite short (less than 14 hours to complete the story), but, I guess, if it was longer, it might have been overkill.The game also has extra missions (to defend little sisters in different levels), which I personally didn't find interesting to try, and MP, which also offers some co-op challenges, however it is almost dead and it's hard to find at least 4 players to fill the arena.The Minerva Den DLC: a nice addition to the core game. 7/10. Reveals the true identity of the protagonist.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Outstanding game and sequel, I actually enjoyed Bioshock 2 more than the original due to the new weapons like auto turrets, rivet gun & the drill. I liked the fact that the game emphasised using strategy and teamwork at times in contrast to just mowing down all the enemies by yourself and the auto turrets were especially a nice addition which complimented this.  In terms of the story, Bioshock 2 had a few twists but I felt the story wasn't as fleshed out this time around, however don't be mistaken, as the story is still very powerful in Bioshock 2 and is by no means a slouch. There was plenty of new characters who had convincing back stories and the game also alluded to some of the characters from the previous game which was a nice touch. On the contrary though, the plasmids could of been updated a little more as if memory serves they were the same ones from the original so it would of been nice to see new plasmids.

												Outstanding game and sequel, I actually enjoyed Bioshock 2 more than the original due to the new weapons like auto turrets, rivet gun & the drill. I liked the fact that the game emphasised using strategy and teamwork at times in contrast to just mowing down all the enemies by yourself and the auto turrets were especially a nice addition which complimented this.  In terms of the story, Bioshock 2 had a few twists but I felt the story wasn't as fleshed out this time around, however don't be mistaken, as the story is still very powerful in Bioshock 2 and is by no means a slouch. There was plenty of new characters who had convincing back stories and the game also alluded to some of the characters from the previous game which was a nice touch. On the contrary though, the plasmids could of been updated a little more as if memory serves they were the same ones from the original so it would of been nice to see new plasmids. Overall though, i'd definitely reccomend Bioshock 2 to fans of not only the series but fans in the fps genre as well & anybody who enjoys a thought provoking story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An outstanding sequel to the original.  Graphics and sounds are clearer, crisper, and eerier than before.  The story brings you back to Rapture for an entirely new adventure that you'll absolutely devour.  Deeper and richer lore for Rapture, a story with plenty of twists, and new enemies that will freak you right the f*** out and push you to the edge in battle.Controls have been modified a bit and might throw you off if you play immediately after BioShock, so I highly suggest customizing them to suit your comforts.  Many of the weapons/powers are the same as the previous game and the upgrades operate in the same manner, so this might strike you as a tad bit stale (but it's still a blast regardless).9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To help put things in perspective, know that I first had completed Bioshock 1 and Infinite in my gaming lifetime. An odd order, yes. But it did help put things in perspective, both the evolution of the series as well as the reviews associated with it.In terms of gameplay, Bioshock 2 is a straight upgrade from 1. The looting and exploration is just as enjoyable as it was before, and bullet stock micromanagers will have a moderately satisfying day. The game isn't too hard, even on the highest difficulty. It may be rough to start out, as you don't have the Plasmids and Tonics yet that befit your playstyle. But as time passes on, you will be able to gather your bearings. As long as you somewhat try to use your ammo sparingly or at least wisely, you will have maximum ammo on most of your weapons, and your wallet will be full as well.A feature I've always liked, as money in this game isn't as much a currency as it is a resource which you can hold only a limited amount of. I've always admired how Bioshock's ""Money"" dynamic made it stand apart from many other shooters and RPG's and what not.When keeping visual design in mind, changing from a 'human splicer' in the predecessor to an 'alpha version Big Daddy' brings a visual change that really helps you immerse in the role. All the former weapons are present, but in bulky versions befitting what you are. The revolver is replaced with a Rivet Gun, but still fires just like it, the pump shotgun with a double barrel one and the crossbow with a spear launcher. It's a detail, but an important one.As a Big Daddy, you are still tasked to defeat other Big Daddy's to lay claim on their LIttle Sister. With the new weaponry and evolved plasmids, this task has become much more interesting. Setting up traps and following your plan like a script will help you get some proper first blood damage in, and then you can finish off the bugger with your weaponry. A task that is still quite intimidating, as the melee Daddies still know how to quickly close in on you, and the ranged ones carry some very hefty firepower. Even as a Big Daddy yourself, you'll need to Tonic up before you can take a prolonged beating. Wits are still very much required.And these wits will serve you well, as now you can fullfill your role as Big Daddy when finally claiming a big sister. Beyond the options you had in the first game, you can also have the Little Sister harvest ADAM from specific corpses. Each little sister can only harvest twice, and there's always more corpses than can be used. So exploration for more ideal locations does pay off.Which is where your trap laying skills yet again prove handy. Instead of taking on a mobile Big Daddy, you now need to strategically defend a stationary target while she drains adam. The act of draining seems to always attract a big crowd of Splicers. And it needs no explaining that the Splicer AI is well capable of ambushing you now if you think of cheesing it out.Not to mention the Big Sisters, who always come for you when all the Little Sisters in the level have been dealt with. They are pretty much twice as strong as a Big Daddy, much more agile and beat your face hard with an array of Plasmid skills. Being unprepared generally leaves you dead and beaten.But worry not, because you've got a new wide array of new and/or improved Plasmids to help you defend. Whirlwind Trap alone is a poster boy of this, as you can now imbue Level 2 traps with any other Plasmid skill you have, adding a unique feature to the trap. Ranging from Shock and Fire, to Hypnotise traps. The latter is especially handy to place with a Little Sister, in case a Splicer reaches her. Send that f*cker right back to fight his friends, or into another trap.Pretty much all Plasmids gain unique features with every level. But the Tonics get very interesting as well. Basic ones as Boozehound are now accompanied with reducing Eve usage, and there even is a Tonic in the late game where you can drastically reduce your Eve usage in return for only using your Drill (your new Melee weapon). I have tried the Melee build, using damage reduction and melee damage increase, and I can guarantee you that it's quite viable. Doing a Drill Charge (a skill the storyline will teach you) is very satisfying and lethal, although quite taxing on your Drill Fuel.Speaking of the Story...It's a mixed feeling. Of course it's not as impressive as the first one was. That said, it would take exceptional work to make that even possible. The story isn't bad, and certainly gives you enough encouragement to go on, it's just not as good...Which does explain why Infinite tried so hard to focus on it's story counterpart, sadly leaving behind some of the features we had loved the first two for.If you liked Bioshock 1 and want more of it, this game is absolutely worth it. If you think Infinite couldn't get any better... well, maybe you'll like it less, but it might still be worth it to put some context to some of the Infinite DLC.All in all I would say it's been a worthy successor, filling that Bioshock hunger I was having.

												This is another great game, though it doesn't exactly live up to its predecessor. The mechanics are much the same as the previous installment, though some minor improvements have been made to the combat and genetic skill trees to make it slightly more fluid. All this taken into account however, the story feels like much more of an afterthought than did that of the first game (probably because, to a point, it was). Although it is still a great shooter, you don't lose much of the bioshock experience by leaving this particular installment out. Great mechanics, great atmosphere, great graphics, but the story is definitely lacking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is a great game...If Levine took the work on it. But we got rehashes of ideas of the first installment, no more categories for tonics (you have only one very big slotplace to put everything you want). Chemthrower now merged with ADAM, and hacking now is remote (which VERY ease whole gameplay,thanks autohacking darts). For every harvested\collected little sister, you somehow get present as was in the first part but also frustrating bossfight with big sister, its the worst part of this game from my opinion. Gameplay now is linear train ride, you cannot come back to previous locations. Talking about locations only last one (Persephone) is greatest map in whole game. Multiplayer is dead, maybe because its boring. I would not advise not recommend this game, even with multiple ending it got low replayability. Buy it on sale.Oh and one thing, inside there is two DLC's: Protector Trials and Minerva's Den. First one is boring escort the sister get the points, cant say more.What about The Minerva's Den. This is the great DLC to play on, even better than the game itself. Really recommend buying bioshock 2 only for minerva den.P.S: Your saves can be crash at anytime! Be careful!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of my tasks was to throw away criminal amounts of ""expired"" foods.

Most of it. I would take care to save any raw dough, preferrably those Pillsbury biscuits in a tube, and I would see how high I could throw them against the back wall of the building.

												It's absolutely fascinating - and a trademark of the Bioshock series - how Minerva's Den manages to turn a plot about regaining control of a central computer into one of the greatest love stories told in videogames.Also, one little detail at the end of Minerva's Den gives us - in retrospect - a measure of the savvy with which the world of Bioshock is constructed: in the office of Charles Milton Porter you find a color TV (http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/File:Standby_tv_color.png) powered up by three brightly colored tubes that stick oddly into it. Playing through both Bioshocks you see so many grayscale / sepia monitors (most of them with that frozen 'Please Stand By' logo on them) that they actually become a trademark for the series. And at the end of Minerva's Den when you see that color monitor you cannot help but feel that it doesn't belong there, that it cannot be 'in' Rapture, it must be there from somewhere else, from another world, like a seed of a new world that sprouts in dying Rapture, maybe, and you get the feeling that not only the ocean is finding its way into the ruined city, but another - more colorful - world is also leaking through the cracks in Rapture's broken reality and this could be, in retrospect, the moment that Bioshock's universe opens up to the Multiverse that will take the stage in Infinite.

It can really let the exprience down so yeah, unless they fix it or patch it to support Windows 10 I'll recommend it but for now its a No at the moment.

												For those of you who have played the original Bioshock, you will be right at home in Bioshock 2. For the rest of you, go play the original Bioshock first; if you don't you will be more than a little confused.A little background first: both games take place in a city called Rapture located on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. It was created as a utopia where you could choose your own destiny without the interference of governments or organized religion. As you can imagine this didn't last, and by the time you show up in the first game Rapture has deteriorated into a big free-for-all. The man who created Rapture, Andrew Ryan, serves as the main antagonist in the first game.The second game takes place eight years after the first one, which is surprising because I can't believe that the city continued to function for that long. You play as a Big Daddy who has been gone from Rapture for ten years.The city is now under the control of a psychiatrist named Sofia Lamb, and you have plenty of reasons to hate her. In direct contrast to Ryan's exaltation of the individual, Lamb is all about everyone working together. I find it interesting that all of these people who came to Rapture specifically for self-determination are suddenly working for Lamb.In Bioshock the end cutscene depended on what you did to the Little Sisters you found: did you save them or harvest them? In Bioshock 2 there was more to it. In addition to the Little Sisters, there were several characters who you could decide to spare or kill; different situations surround each choice. I have heard that there are something like 12 different endings to the game depending on what you decide to do. This is one of the significant things that they improved over the original game in my opinion.Other than that though I felt that the story wasn't quite as good as the original. While it wasn't too difficult to understand where Andrew Ryan was coming from when he went on his rants, I really couldn't understand the reasoning behind Sofia Lamb's plan to create a perfect society. Speaking of Ryan, many of the characters and recordings talked about him and their opinions of how he ran things; clearly Rapture was still living in his shadow 8 years later. I felt like Bioshock 2 was similarly living in its predecessor's shadow, especially because the creative minds behind the first game (read: Ken Levine) weren't directly involved in the second.The area that Bioshock 2 made huge improvements in was the gameplay. In the original game you had to switch between your weapon and plasmid, but in the second you always had both available to you. This alone made battles much more fast-paced and hectic. There was also more variety in enemy types; the splicers are a lot more deformed, presumable due to the extra years since the first game, and there are now brute splicers. They aren't quite as tough as Big Daddies but they fill in the gap between weak foes and really tough ones. The scariest enemy that they added was the Big Sister. They come after you sometimes after you have rescued a Little Sister, and they are tough. They use plasmids and melee attacks, and they are extremely nimble. I couldn't get a screenshot of them while they were alive because I was too busy trying to shoot them, but here is a dead one.There were new weapons as well: the metal pipe you wielded in the original game is replaced by the Big Daddy's Drill, and I took malicious pleasure in pinning enemies to walls from afar with the new spear gun.raphically Bioshock 2 is beautiful. The environment was almost identical to the original, but you can immediately tell the difference when you look at character models from the two games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After I finished the original Bioshock 1 I immediately wanted the sequel to see how it would continue and what happened after the first game. I wanted a game that would show me just what happened after Jack left Rapture and the city was left to rot for 10 years at the bottom of the ocean. I guess I got just what I want, which is probably my main complaint about this game. It feels like afterwash from the original in a way that it feels like I'm playing a DLC for the original or maybe even reading a fan continuation. The environments you got to explore, while still pretty cool, weren't usually as big or as major to Rapture as the ones and Bioshock 1. I feel like they should have added the older locations into this game on top of the fresh environments to make it feel like you're going through the same city. Also, to make sure that people don't get confused about the lore, no more bathyspheres. The story isn't anything to write home about, either. You control a special Big Daddy named Subject Delta who, can you guess what the main conflict is going to be? Yeah, he's looking for his Little Sister who was kidnapped. I mean, she was already kidnapped, but she was... Kidnapped... Back... It's a bit predictable, unlike the Bioshock 1, but the story still held suprises for me, even without a major twist in the middle. The characters have to be either the best or the worst thing in this game when it comes down to it. I really liked the characters like Sinclair, who reminded me of Atlas from the first game and Eleanor, your little/big sister. The antagonist was... Okay to say the least. Like the first game it had a pretty powerful message with it but I felt she talked a little too much. I know. It's a pretty stupid thing to complain about, but when she radios you every 5 MINUTES SAYING THE EXACT SAME f*$#ING THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU GET A BIT TIRED, OKAY? As for the other characters, they were kind-of forgettable. Each section has a different character belonging to it, and at the end you get to either kill or spare them. Now, the endings system is alot bigger than Bioshock 1's was as in there are 6 endings instead of just 2. It has the same Harvest or Rescue Little Sisters system (with a fun Little Sisters protect minigame thing!) But, like I said, it also has different characters to kill or to claim mercy on. First is Grace, who I could understand sparing. The second guy I could also understand sparing and still being labeled as good. But the third guy, oh my gosh why are you even supposed to spare him and still be labeled as good? He begs you to kill him in audio recordings because he's insane and he is a giant mutant blob who can't move for Gods sake! How are you helping ANYONE by not killing him? I actually didn't know what to do when I got to this point because they both seemed bad thing to do. If you do kill him, you get labeled as a murderer in the ending, though! But what about those hundreds of splicers and big daddies you mowed through like overgrown weeds! They're insane too, but don't they deserve a chance at life if a giant mutant blob who can't move does? All in all, I liked the new gameplay and plasmid system. The weapons for your Big Daddy self were also really cool. I especially liked the one where you could hack from a distance or place mini turrets. Anyway, that's just my two cents on this game. If you enjoyed the first I would recommend it for everything it has to offer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I will keep the short but sweet. First let me answer any question about the game.1- Do I need to play Bioshock 1 to know the goings on in the 2nd?. Answer is no.You will get many spoilers of what happened in the 1st game though.2- Is the 1st game worth playing? Extremely it is held by many as the best game of the bioshock series,its a personal favorite game of all time of mine. 3- Is the Minerva's Den DLC worth playing? Yes it is, its about 5 hours long depending on how much explorinig and 100% stuff you do.The story some consider better than the story of Bio 2. I personally found both stories to be about the same but not impressive like Bioshock 1.Now on with the short n sweet review.Bioshock 2 has a improved combat system over the 1st game. Everything moves more fluid and does not feel lagged at all. The A.I. is as always an enjoyable treat to encounter though the creepy & horror filled vibe that the first held us to seems not present here.However the story of the character you're playing contains the majority of the horror. I won't spoil but you really feel for the guy but not attached to him. Weapon variety is the same as in Bioshock 1 along side the 3 ammo types per weapon/tool. New though is a hacking tool which lets you remotely hack from a distance,very handy and needed in some situations.New plasmids and tonics make a debut as well increasing the variety without detracting ones from the 1st game.There are new variety of Big Daddies this time around along side the old ones of Bioshock 1.New splicers and turrent turrent types make a debut. The enivornments are familiar to Bioshock 1, but not as horrific as it. Quite a few pieces of background info regarding the 1st games characters are found throughout the game shedding more light to the behind the scenes of what happened. The game has a lot going for it, its just many story telling elements were a miss unlike in the first game.If you are a Bioshock fan its worth playing,just I doubt you will make a return to Bioshock 2 unlike 1.Like it or not, its a part of the franchise but story wise skippable in relation to the bigger story of the trilogy.This game is more a ""day in the life of a rapture citizen"" type of thing.Just you are a V.I.P.Tech IssuesThere are some steps you may or may not need to go through before you can enjoy the game as much as possible.I have a Nvidia 450 GTS 1gb vram with its latest drivers and a AMD Phenom II X4 920 2.80 ghz on Win7 64 Pro  and even after doing the crashing tutorial I got crashes periodically. I had the game on Win Vista compatibilty mode with admin privilages turn on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While BioShock was a statement game and served as evidence that creativity doesn't come at the cost of commercial success, BioShock 2 follows along a familiar path for sequels. It doesn't take extreme liberties with elements that worked before; it improves them in simple but effective ways.To those who've been playing FPS games for years now know that this genre can be different from the default patterns.Still, like many sequels, what you get with BioShock 2 is a number of tweaks and improvements to gameplay.When it comes to story, unfortunately, none of the characters introduced in BioShock 2 are quite as fascinating as Andrew Ryan in the first one.My point is, if you enjoyed Bioshock, you'll like this one. But if in the end of the game, you were already tired.I don't think this is the game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What an awesome game.The story is a bit weaker than that of first game, but its good enough to get the player involved into it.The gameplay is fine, the fact that you play as a Big Daddy is really awesome and it gives another view for the player of Rapture and its inhabitants.But outside the new elements, the game stays mostly true to the first installment and that is definitely a good thing and if you like to hear every bit of the story and the side stories, its really awesome to explore every room and hear every recording, then Bioshock 2 is the game for you.The DLC, Minervas Den is also a great story for players who werent satisifed with just playing the main game and want more action, and then, you have the Protector Trials which are great if you just want to relieve stress and kill some Splicers.9/10. I loved this game and i think you will too, this series is really well done and the story was great with memorable characters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2 is a really fun game. It's a well made shooter with interesting gameplay mechanics. It has a lot of the charm of the first BioShock, albeit with a weaker storyline. View BioShock 2 as more of an expansion for the first, and you can get a good 8 hours or so of solid enjoyment out of it.Also - the DLC for the game (specifically: Minerva's Den) is another interesting expansion pack that warrants a playthrough. It is basically a smaller scale of the full game, but with a more interesting story.It was amazingly fun to come back and play BioShock 2. As I said earlier, I haven't played BioShock 2 since it came out, so it was like playing the game for the first time again. Could not recommend it enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 doesn't quite excel as much as the first one did at a viscerally innovative experience and unexpected journey, but nonetheless does a great job of constructing a fun and interesting second foray into the underwater city of Rapture.The simultaneous use of weapons and plasmids is welcome, and the game is still plenty challenging, provided you pick a normal difficulty level. It doesn't come with an equal share of memorable moments to the first Bioshock, but the story of the search of Johnny Topside for Eleanor is peppered with the same gripping atmosphere that made the first game so haunting, with only slightly less of a punch, but nonetheless draws the game to a memorable finale.Considering Bioshock 2 takes place 8 years after the first one, I scratched my head over what the still sane and human denizens of Rapture had done all those 8 years in Rapture, considering it was in more or less an identical state in the first iteration of the series, but if you ignore that, the game had a great story and the gameplay, with its numerous weapons and plasmids, and chances to upgrade both, and similar moral dilemmas that the first one presented, I think it's a very competent follow-up to the first Bioshock.

												 First of all I want to say that this is a review on the singleplayer + minerva's dlc since I've played only those, multiplayer wise I didn't try it or know if there is anyone playing it. I know people think about these game a step backwards from bioshock 1 but I'm inclined to say that I enjoyed bioshock 2 more, I say this because combat wise I say it's better having the ability of just having one power in one hand and on the other your weapon is such a better way of playing this game, I found that bioshock 1 was a bit clunky with that.  The difficulty on this game was harder (played both on hard) than bioshock 1 it had more variety and although big daddies were easier these variety made a difference, in minerva's den though lancers and alphas were much harder even on late build but big sisters were the same it would be just a matter of having the resources or not which I found on Minerva's Dlc to be harder to come by which made a huge difference in most battles. So this is what I liked a lot on bioshock story was also really good, found it more appealing than the first one.  Now for the bad parts which enraged me I will say that for you to play this you need to save manually instead of quick saving because you will get your save corrupted and it will not be fun the only thing that made me keep playing this game and finishing was that it was really good, which is a good thing but for the interesting part about why your save gets corrupted it's the constant crashing to your desktop that happens, I probably had only one boss battle that I didn't had to beat twice due to this constant crashing. But this is not the only bad parts, the controls are cr*p who the f**k uses the ""T"" key to zoom in your weapon? But it's rebindable so you can put your right mouse to zoom in which previously was for your plasmids which in your screen is the left hand so you are shooting plasmids in your right mouse? Wtf and also the game has a mechanic which I don't know why when you have a lot of ammo the game automatically changes from time to time to your other ammo and I got parts in the game where I was shooting with the rivet gun or spear gun trap rivets into bigsister face which she really enjoyed because it did crap damage. In the end though with these 3 negative problems which were persistent to say the least I enjoyed the game a lot and if it was not for that I would be bashing this game but it was good and I recommend it, can't compare it to infinite though because it's the next on bioshock series that I'm going to play.

												Bioshock 2A different approach to this one compared to Bioshock. You play as a big daddy and can use guns and plasmids at the same time, which is rather nice. You can adopt little sisters to gather resources for you and you need to defend them with traps and stuff. It is rather enjoyable. The story is not as good as the first Bioshock game but if you like big guns and plasmids this is one worth getting.7/10Welcome Back to the city			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also the Multiplayer is not as bad as people say, it still has a lot of players and it's easy to get into it. Also the SP DLC is great since it delivers another well written Big-Daddy story that takes about 3 hours to complete!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I will keep the short but sweet. First let me answer any question about the game.1- Do I need to play Bioshock 1 to know the goings on in the 2nd?. Answer is no.You will get many spoilers of what happened in the 1st game though.2- Is the 1st game worth playing? Extremely it is held by many as the best game of the bioshock series,its a personal favorite game of all time of mine. 3- Is the Minerva's Den DLC worth playing? Yes it is, its about 5 hours long depending on how much explorinig and 100% stuff you do.The story some consider better than the story of Bio 2. I personally found both stories to be about the same but not impressive like Bioshock 1.Now on with the short n sweet review.Bioshock 2 has a improved combat system over the 1st game. Everything moves more fluid and does not feel lagged at all. The A.I. is as always an enjoyable treat to encounter though the creepy & horror filled vibe that the first held us to seems not present here.However the story of the character you're playing contains the majority of the horror. I won't spoil but you really feel for the guy but not attached to him. Weapon variety is the same as in Bioshock 1 along side the 3 ammo types per weapon/tool. New though is a hacking tool which lets you remotely hack from a distance,very handy and needed in some situations.New plasmids and tonics make a debut as well increasing the variety without detracting ones from the 1st game.There are new variety of Big Daddies this time around along side the old ones of Bioshock 1.New splicers and turrent turrent types make a debut. The enivornments are familiar to Bioshock 1, but not as horrific as it. Quite a few pieces of background info regarding the 1st games characters are found throughout the game shedding more light to the behind the scenes of what happened. The game has a lot going for it, its just many story telling elements were a miss unlike in the first game.If you are a Bioshock fan its worth playing,just I doubt you will make a return to Bioshock 2 unlike 1.Like it or not, its a part of the franchise but story wise skippable in relation to the bigger story of the trilogy.This game is more a ""day in the life of a rapture citizen"" type of thing.Just you are a V.I.P.Tech IssuesThere are some steps you may or may not need to go through before you can enjoy the game as much as possible.I have a Nvidia 450 GTS 1gb vram with its latest drivers and a AMD Phenom II X4 920 2.80 ghz on Win7 64 Pro  and even after doing the crashing tutorial I got crashes periodically.

												Even though I disliked Bioshock, I thought I'd at least try this game though it's sort of more of the same, I liked playing as a Big Daddy at the end of the first game so I thought it may make me enjoy this game more.I enjoy this game more, overall the game is much more fun. I don't feel bored playing it like I did with the first Bioshock. I like the story of being a Big Daddy, the story is very interesting and gameplay has improved you can now use both a plasmid and weapon at once, it makes things quicker instead of feeling so sluggish like the first Bioshock was so slow having to switch between a plasmid and a weapon.And I like that hacking seems better and you can now hack cameras as well instead of just destroy them.I reccomend having several saves as saving can be glitchy. I saved my game and it crashed in the process deleting the save that I was saving over, I previously had 4 saves and now had 3, so it must of deleted the save which caused it to crash or the crashing caused it to delete?? Iam not sure. It's a joy to be able to alt tab out of game without getting a black screen of death.When you open a map, you can't close it again by pressing the map key, but by clicking on a button at the bottom of the screen that says close or by pressing B on a XBox controller with no way to remap the key for PC controls. Controller exclusive controls on a PC game is annoying.I like this game much more than the first Bioshock, Iam enjoying it and rate it 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 has a rather unfavourable reputation. It's seen as so non-canon, so unambitious that rarely is it discussed by fans and critics in the same breath as other 'Shock games. But Bioshock 2 isn't for those people. Bioshock 2 is a game for people who want to creep around more of the Bioshock 1 universe, were rather fond of the gameplay of the original and fancy properly stepping into the shoes of a Big Daddy as opposed to the shallow facsimile at the end of the first game. Even though it might be hitting on the same beats, Bioshock 2 isn't aiming to be the revolutionary, disorienting, dramatic tour-de-force the first game was, or the one Infinite was trying so hard to be, and that's just fine. Instead, it just wears the first game's clothes and tries really hard, like an endearing little brother. It's almost like a ridiculously well-produced fan game or total conversion mod. Accept the game for what it is, and Bioshock 2 actually becomes a rather lighthearted experience. It's easy to have fun with it when you know not to take it so seriously, especially when its got the presentation and solidness of a Bioshock game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Walk into the footsteps of a Big Daddy in Rapture. 10 years ago, you were doing a routine walk with your Little Sister. Now, she is kidnapped and you were knocked out for that duration. Welcome back to the beauty and glory of Rapture...now, quit standing around and work with Sinclair to save your Eleanor who is being manipulated by Lamb!This game has the same single-player feel from the first Bioshock, but with a few changes(i.e hacking). Your actions will affect Eleanor, so choose wisely on what you want her to become! During that time, as Sinclair says, ""You and me, kid. We're going places.""For the multiplayer version, however, could have met it's potential. There are many problems with it. First thing is that it uses peer 2 peer technology for connection with players around the world. There is no option whatsoever to host a dedicated server. You just find a room with the type of game, and that's it. Second, there are a lot of disrespectful people that come online. There is no option to mute them or ignore them, and even ignoring them on Steam doesn't help. Third, by default, your mic is on by using whatever settings you have on Windows(even if you don't have a mic, it goes onto Stereo Mix recording).TL;DR. Single Player is awesome. Multiplayer is good, but with too many problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please note this review assumes you have played the original game 'bioshock'Bioshock 2 is a direct sequel to the previous installment 'bioshock'. Set years after the orignal release in bioshock 2 you play as a failed 'prototype' big daddy which i think was a great feature. Similar to bioshock, in bioshock2 you have to kill big daddy's, and rescue or kill the little sisters. However bioshock 2 expands on this where you can also use the little sisters to harvest additional adam. In every level after saving all little sisters, a big sister will hunt you down which you can kill for additional adam. I like how bioshock2 expanded on this and it gave the game the feeling that you really are a big daddy looking after a little sister.The new Toxins concept is brilliant and far better than bioshock1. Also hacking was a nightmare in bioshock1 and in bioshock2 i actually loved hacking, it felt fun to do unlike in BS1 where it felt like a grind.Pros-Combat is far superior compared with bioshock1-Guns are more fun to use compared with bioshock1-Does not get boring near end game unlike bioshock1-Improved Toxins conecpt-6 Endings compared with bioshock1's 3 (This could be good or bad)-Hacking system is wayyyyyyy better than bioshock1'sCons-Short game length (less than 10 hours on standard difficulty)-Bioshock1's story was more indepth and superiorIn conclusion i dont see why this game gets criticized compared with the original bioshock. It improved from bioshock1 in almost every aspect. The story is better in Bioshock1 but the gameplay is far, far, far superior in Bio2.If you enjoyed Bioshock1, you will most likely enjoy this game.

												A wonderful sequel to the first BioShock but this time developed by 2K. BioShock 2 does not really offer anything new; it just improves upon the first game. It is an interesting concept to put the player into the shoes of a Big Daddy - it should be mentioned that it is an alpha version, though, so it's not like you are an all powerful being incapable of dying. Still, it is a nice touch as you can finally use a Big Daddy's drill and while in the prequel you just killed these monstrous creatures to get hold of the little girls now you have to protect the children while they harvest ADAM from the fallen citizens of Rapture. Again, these encounters are optional but well worth the trouble. And once you completed all harvests the Big Sister appears. This is an addition to the boss battles and while the Big Daddies are slow their sisters are much faster so you need to use different tactics.Other than the harvest part the gameplay remains similar. You keep progressing further and while the game is linear you should look behind every door and open every box to find loot and the good-old audio diaries that further explain the background. Morality choices return but with greater impact and this time you have 3 endings available. Hacking can be done from the distance by shooting darts into the target objects and instead of taking pictures you have a camera that can record your battles with your foes. Again, recording here results in bonuses against the various types of enemies. Many plasmid types return but there are new additions to an already varied rooster and levelling up them offers better bonuses. We now have multiplayer but personally I found it just average - I guess this was the usual attempt to lengthen the game's replayability but the single player offers at least 3 playthroughs so I believe it was unnecessary. I do not think anybody plays multiplayer anymore, either.This is the first BioShock that comes with a DLC. On Steam the DLC is part of the game and it should be mentioned that they got rid of GFWL (good riddance!) so we should not bother with this, thank god. Minerva's Den offers us a completely new plot - again, we play as an Alpha Series Big Daddy - and we get a deeper insight into the city's inner workings.BioShock 2 is an example of what a true sequel should be. It improves upon an already very good BioShock 1, thus, it feels like as if we continued the story where we left off and did not stop playing BioShock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Walk into the footsteps of a Big Daddy in Rapture. 10 years ago, you were doing a routine walk with your Little Sister. Now, she is kidnapped and you were knocked out for that duration. Welcome back to the beauty and glory of Rapture...now, quit standing around and work with Sinclair to save your Eleanor who is being manipulated by Lamb!This game has the same single-player feel from the first Bioshock, but with a few changes(i.e hacking). Your actions will affect Eleanor, so choose wisely on what you want her to become! During that time, as Sinclair says, ""You and me, kid. We're going places.""For the multiplayer version, however, could have met it's potential. There are many problems with it. First thing is that it uses peer 2 peer technology for connection with players around the world. There is no option whatsoever to host a dedicated server. You just find a room with the type of game, and that's it. Second, there are a lot of disrespectful people that come online. There is no option to mute them or ignore them, and even ignoring them on Steam doesn't help. Third, by default, your mic is on by using whatever settings you have on Windows(even if you don't have a mic, it goes onto Stereo Mix recording).TL;DR. Single Player is awesome. Multiplayer is good, but with too many problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If popular opinion is to be believed, Bioshock 2 is a game that suffers under the shadow of the remarkable first game in the series, which is mostly regarded as being the better of the two journeys into the depths of Rapture (that is, if one can actually classify separate journeys into the depths of madness and depravity as being somehow being “better” than one another).  Some of this opinion is warranted, but in other crucial ways this game actually manages to outshine its older sibling.Let’s talk a bit about story and setting, as I feel that these two elements define the heart of the Bioshock experience.  Much like its antagonist, the first game was responsible for creating Rapture, the ugly, decrepit, and rusted out undersea dystopia.  In Bioshock 2 well you’ll sure see more … of the same.  The trouble with a setting like Rapture really is that it’s a bit self-contained, both literally and figuratively.  It’s wonderfully detailed, and there are hundreds of stories to be told (as evidenced by the many audio diaries that reappear in this game), but it’s still a microcosm.  So Bioshock 2 returns you to the same old Rapture you've seen before, to visit the same old menagerie of drug addled psychos you've set on fire before.  In a lesser setting this might prove to be an issue, but that’s just it; the world of Rapture has enough texture and atmosphere that it can still stand strong even if you do have some sense of déjà vu upon your return.  The weight of dread, hopelessness, and despair bears down on you every bit as much as the weight of the ocean around you, which in turn allows you to once again soak in the experience of Rapture.In terms of story, your reaction may depend on how you feel about canon and its role in a larger story arc.  Indeed there are some potential issues here in terms of overall canon.  It takes some firm suspension of disbelief to swallow the premise that the Rapture we saw in the first game survived another 10 minutes after our first departure, much less another 8 years.  The character of Sofia Lamb is bolted on to the canon in such a way that it begs the question, if Lamb was such a prominent figure in Rapture, why did we not hear of her in the first game?  How are there still splicers down here, being that they seem to be a pretty nonfunctional self-destructive lot, and I can’t imagine that they’d be capable of reproduction (nor would I want to … ewww).  So yes, there may be some issues with Bioshock 2 in terms of the overall canon of the series, but here’s the clincher, and a statement which may net me some detractors.  If you can look past the minor issues above, the story in Bioshock 2 is actually better than the first game.  Sorry Ken Levine, but the boys at 2K Marin may have managed to top the amazing story set forth in the original Bioshock.  In the first Bioshock, one of the major premises of the game revolves around the question of, “Why am I doing this?”  (And I’m hoping at least someone answered, “A man chooses, a slave obeys”).  The original Bioshock is brilliant science fiction populated by a colorful rotating sideshow of psychotic freaks.  But it missed a bit of the human element.  In Bioshock2 you know immediately who you are (in a basic sense), what you must do, and crucially why you must do it.  This opens up the opportunity for a more humanist approach to Rapture, being that the resolution of this tension allows for huge opportunities in characterization.  And Bioshock 2 seizes upon that opportunity in spades.  In the first game I was purely vested in the mystery itself which was great, but in this game I was actually attached to the characters as well.  This manages to add some emotional heft to the story which I felt was missing a bit in the first game.  (In truth this is probably helped by the fact that I myself am a parent, and the central themes of Bioshock 2 revolve heavily around what it means to be a parent … err … Daddy)So how’s the gameplay?  Well a lot like the first game, the difficulty curve here is a bit frontloaded.  As you gain plasmids, tonics, and weapons upgrades the game becomes significantly easier.  In some ways this is a bit unfortunate at least insofar as it would have been nice to feel that rush of badassery immediately upon stepping into the brass boots of a Big Daddy.  As it is you start off a bit weak and underpowered, slowly growing into your role as a walking fortress.  And that’s fine really.  It wouldn’t be super-fun or challenging if you started out as the biggest badass in Rapture.  Just as in the first game, Bioshock 2 really finds its groove when you start gaining power-ups to assist you in your endeavor, and it’s at this point that the gameplay absolutely shines.  It’s still an absolute blast to figure out interesting and advantageous combinations of plasmids, tonics, and weapon upgrades in order to rain death upon the doomed denizens of Rapture. There was one element of the first game that I did miss in Bioshock 2 which was the open world component.  In the original Bioshock  you felt the massiveness of Rapture in that you could travel from one end of the city to the other if you were so inclined.  In Bioshock 2 your experience is firmly divided into a level-based structure.  There are plot devices in place to help make some sense out of this particular element, but it warrants a mention.  To say that the game plays on rails is an understatement, being that your conveyance between levels for half the game is in fact a train.  It’s a minor thing, but I certainly would have loved to have the ability to return to previous levels for more in-depth exploration.  Oddly I also found some issue with repetitive tasks in the game, which I feel is also partly related to its strictly structured levels.  The way in which you’re tasked with the repetitive task(s) of rescuing a Little Sister, gathering Adam, dealing with the Little Sister, fighting Big Sister, wash, rinse, repeat … starts to feel a bit grind-y by the end of it.  It also impacts the pacing of the story a bit.  I think an open world setting might have relieved this issue somewhat in that it would have been nice to set my own agenda for handling the Little/Big sisters rather than being forced to handle everything in a level before moving onto the next without hope for return.  Once again this is a small issue in the grand scheme of things, but one that definitely became noticeable to me.  Luckily the combat allows for so much creativity and improvisation that this cycle rarely becomes a dreaded chore (despite my comments on grinding).So there you have it.  I must say that after two games of being trapped at the bottom of the ocean with the worst sort of abominations imaginable, I’m looking forward to taking my Bioshock experience to the sky in Bioshock Infinite, drifting through the clouds … with the worst sort of abominations imaginable. At any rate I found Bioshock 2 to be an excellent game particularly suited for fans of dark science fiction and horror, as well as anyone that enjoys story driven first person shooters.

												Bioshock (1) is a masterpiece.Bioshock 2 is awesome, but overall not as awesome as Bioshock (1). What is better:Gameplay: it's almost the same, but it's improved, I'd say it's a bit better than Bioshock 1. encounters with Big Daddy and Big Sister are awesome, the combat is definitely better.minigames are improved too. What is worse:Story\Locations: Nice story\locations, but for some reasons, I think that Bioshock 1 wins without doubt.Graphics: no improvements, Bioshock (1) was released in 2007, with nvidia dsr is still nice. Bioshock 2 was released in 2010 and with nvidia dsr is still nice too, but they look barely the same game. TL;DR If you are looking for a great sequel, you could be a bit disappointed, Bioshock 2 is a nice game, but you'll probably join the ""Bioshock 1 was better"" club. If you are looking for a nice game Bioshock 2 could be a good choice  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't help but rate this game in relation to its predecessors. System Shock 2 was the scariest game I had ever played back then, and Bioshock was a fine successor.  Bioshock 2  is also a fine game.  Primarily a first person shooter, but with enough customization along the way to feel a bit like an RPG, I would certainly place Bioshock 2 alongside System Shock 2 or Deus Ex as  games that are good enough at letting you do things your own way that you never feel like you're just playing a FPS.

												This game picks up sorta how the first Bioshock left off, you play as a Big Daddy, all big, all oafy and loud.  For fun make sure to play the game on the Hardest Difficulty, anything less and its just too easy.  This game is much shorter than the original but the pace feels good, it never drags, so dont let the length fool you.  The games mechanics are not as fun as the original.  Playing up until Dionysus Park a player can survive if they use resources carefully practicing ammo conservation, but on the Dionysus park level it all falls apart.  Enemies respawn real, real, fast.  Often times an enemy is killed then you walk around the corner and the same enemy respawns so fast and is shooting you in the back.  This is a HUGE problem because enemies dont always carry money to buy more ammo or supplies.  The lack of ammo or money to buy things is where the game breaks down due to this.  This broken gameplay of the weapons running out of ammo way to fast is compensated for by placing vending machines every 15 feet it feels like.  This could have been done less if either ammo was cheaper, or players could carry more ammo.  Being a big Daddy should be all about using the drill, but the drill requires fuel, fuel that evaporates way to fast even after upgrades making those vending machines every 10 feet useful.  The gameplay feels broken spending the whole game going to vending machines, the fuel should have lasted longer or there shoulda been an infinite fuel upgrade for the drill since its kind of the trademark big daddy weapon.  Hypnotize 3 is kinda useless, it lets you hypnotize big daddies which lasts for about ten seconds and worse if they throw a turret hypnotized or not it attacks you.  A good story and a fun game, def a must for bioshock fans.  Kinda thought this would suck and its nice that it isnt too bad.Rating:  7/10  Value:  $7.99			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2 suffers a curse that riddles many first sequels: being awkwardly hammered in between an absolute storm of a debut and an absolute killer of a third game. BioShock 2 is the disappointing middle child of the BioShock franchise, a product of a schism in 2K's original BioShock development team, bowing under the pressure of following up a global phenomenon in gaming and coming unfortunately before the series has decided what it actually is. However, in order to discover that, BioShock 2 had to exist.But there's more to it than that - just being a catalyst for BioShock Infinite's success. Although quite lacking in any rigid sort of philosophy, unlike BioShock which revels in it's nihilism and investigation of the perception of ethics, BioShock 2 works hard to reiterate the series' strengths. What it focusses on is everything but the original's cognitive plot, you get graphics, rich world, terror, heart-in-mouth action and an occassional tug on the old heartstrings. The opening movie and introductory level are superb, not matching the iconic opening of BioShock, but that is not an easily done thing by any game. The story and script are not stupid by any means and the game is not bad either. In actual fact it is quite fun playing as a Big Daddy but not as fun as you'd think. If it had gone all out in the brutality that Big Daddy's are known for, fast-paced chaos, carnage and bloodlust, it might have warmed me to it a little more. BioShock 2 however stays safe and tows that line between smart story and brutal, unflinching bad-a*sery, and we are instead given many sequences of wave upon wave of enemy with mines and traps and the occassional drill and plasmid.Still, it was good enough to make me happy as a BioShock entry and it was more than worthy of its namesake. Rapture, as always, is a pleasure to wander around and there is much that is new and much to be discovered. Despite the player character being hard as nails and heavily armoured, the game stays suspenseful throughout and the battles with Big Sisters are always huge slug-matches on the scale of King-Kong vs. Godzilla.Job's a good'n as we say in the UK.

												With high expectations, I believed that I would be disappointed. Luckily I was wrong. Yes the game looks and feels very similar to the first one, but there is so much new, lengthy content in this game that makes your visit back to Rapture captivating and memorable. The story is not QUITE as epic as Bioshock 1, but is still intense and keeps you interested until the very end. The combat has changed just enough to feel very new with just slightly modified elements (eg. the ""dual wielding"" plasmids + guns). The weapons are fresh, and I love what they did with the hack system. Bioshock 2 stands as an amazing single player experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also thought that the multiplayer wasnt that great and it was under my expectations, i would have liked it a lot more if there was a multiplayer campaign. there were a lot of downs for this game and i only recommended it because i really liked the prequel (Bioshock) but Bioshock 2 was kind of disappointing. i was expecting more from the multiplayer mode, butIF YOU LIKED BIOSHOCK 1 THEN I RECOMMEND THIS GAME COMPLETELY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While BioShock made me love Rapture, BioShock 2 satisfied my craving for more Rapture. I was so hyped I had to complete all the Protector Trials to earn more achievements. This comes free with the base game and is prefect for those not willing to replay the entire campaign.BS2 brings back the awesome BS gameplay with a few improvements. For starters, the hacking ""game"" was changed to be more pleasant (thank god), and also you have the equipment to hack from a distance. Like in BS, you can rescue Little Sisters from Big Daddies. However, you now have the option to let her sit on your shoulder and let her harvest ADAM when you come across an appropriate body. During which, inhabitants of Rapture will swarm in to get to your girl and it's your job to keep her safe. This was a welcoming addition and I found it challenging and fun, and The Protector Trials have the same purpose but with limited plasmids and weapons.While the story wasn't as strong as that of BS1 and BSI, it still showcased a number of gameplay elements that I wish was in the original game, which would have made it perfect. On the other hand, you can't deny the thrill when exploring a new map in Rapture. Splicers are some of the creepiest villains created.Not only do I highly recommend this title, I do the same for the entire series. Try getting the triple pack on a sale. It will be worth it!10/10 would Rapture again. BibleThump			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Up until just recently since they removed that pos GfWL this game was unplayable once I got to dionyses park *probably butchered that name*. It would freeze constantly, crash any computer i used it on, and would also erase saved games making it impossible to continue playing. Thank whatever intelligence that decided to pull that pos program off of this amazing game. The story line is one of the best in just about any game *driven by in game audio tapes and ""real time character exchanges""* that made me care about the Elenor and made me make some tough moral decisions. My first complete playthrough was based solely on saving every little sister and not killing any of the side characters. I have to admit that I was super excited to find out I could finally finish this game once they removed that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pos Games for windows live login. Never had a single issue once it was completely taken out. Whoever did this has my thanks.I would put this game in the Top spot for FPS ever.As a story driven FPS with just incredible overall atmosphere, soundtrack, story, playability *once it was fixed*, diffuculty, and last but never least FUN. easily gets a 10/10. Before GFWL was removed a 5/10. Yes GFWL ♥♥♥♥ed it up that bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A dying father, a sinking city, and a utopian ideal gone horribly wrong. This is BioShock 2 at its center. After a brief, violent glimpse into Rapture before its fall from capitalist glory, players are sunk into the boots of Subject Delta, a big daddy with a bone to pick with the leader of Rapture's newly-mended society, the Rapture Family. The gameplay still has that zap-and-whack feel that gave the first BioShock's combat so much appeal. The blood on the walls and viewable acts of brutality also remind the player where they are: Rapture.In Delta's hunt for his Little Sister, he'll run into some familiar faces, and new ones. Tenenbaum has returned to this leaky ship, Ryan's posthumous voice is audible via recordings, and even Dr. Suchong and his grisly fate come to light. A whole host of new characters awaits Delta here, each of them interesting and memorable. Seldom are new Plasmids, but old weapons have been repurposed (and in some cases, replaced) for use by the protagonist Big Daddy. Deliberating over a Little Sister's fate is just as agonizing as before (even moreso, considering the player's role as a Protector), and pulling off a perfect plasmid-weapon combo is still a very, very satisfying experience. If you liked BioShock 1, you'll find nothing wrong with BioShock 2.Never before has bashing a Splicer's head in been so fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Return to the Rapture the city that sits at the bottom of the ocean. Before you play this one I urge you to buy and play the first game in the series. This one takes a little different approach as the protagonist is different, the atmosphere is still great and is the strongest aspect of the game. It is just little bit more psychotic, and schizophrenic in its nature as the city is transformed into sort of asylum. Combat is still fun, story is great and soundtrack just underlines the awesome emersive atmosphere of this game. If youl ike FPS genre, a tiny little bit of horror atmosphere, great universes with interesting characters you should definetely pick this one up. After 5 years since it release the graphics still look more than decent, but as I said that isn't the biggest pro of the game... The biggest one is its comabt mechanics, and storytelling + atmosphere... 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, serious review time.This game brings back nostalgic memories from Bioshock 1, but then amplified by playing as a big daddy.If you pick this game up while not having played Bioshock 1 you might not be able to grasp how cool it is to play as a big daddy. For this was the first and almost only reason I picked up this game, but I was suprised on how much more this game has to offer then the obvious ""you are a big daddy so here are bigger guns to shoot stuff with"".Take the Story for instance, the Bioshock series set this ""reference point"" for having a good story line. Always with some unexpencted story twist at the end (even though this game doesn't have that as much as infinite or the first one). Without any spoilers I can only say its good, but nothing like infinite.Gameplay whise I wasn't all to suprised, like I said before its basically the gameplay of Bioshock 1 with bigger guns. But that doesn't mean its bad, infact, the gameplay and movement is super solid and extremely satisfying. You can combine plasmids, guns and genetonics to perfect your ""build"". The enemies have a good variety, not just the typical splicer, all the different enemy types make up for changing gameplay. But later on in the game the variety of splicers become boring, late game you are so powerful that you cut through everyone in seconds, even big daddies and sisters. And the only way the game compensates for that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out a bazillion enemies at you, so late game becomes more or less a grind and the variety stops.All and all, its a good game. Super solid gameplay, storywise lacking a bit for a bioshock game. And the variety in builds you can do, make me come back to this game constantly.P.S first serious review here, you can comment ""omg it zucks ur bad"" or actually give some feedback.P.P.S or just comment whatever about this review			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've yet to start playing/finish Bioshock: Infinite, but this may give me better judgement.I found Bioshock 2 to be even better than Bioshock 1. I do not know why, but I am not downgrading Bioshock 1. They are both equally amazing and cannot be purchased singularly without the other. One must also play Bioshock 1 FIRST in order to experience everything correctly.It's been a while since I last played it, but I am writing this review right now because I feel it deserves one. I played the fatherly daddy side of the story, rescuing each and every little sister. Multiple pathways and endings through the story mean easy replayability, and it does that well. I also appreciate how you have the choice of killing a character in the plot or not, directing the pathway in the way you wish, and giving that wonderous illusion of choice that many of us crave in a mostly linear game.The combat and entire ""get little sister and get moar adam"" can become repetitive, but that is only what I feel. Out of the weapons, each one can have an equal chance at being used as a main weapon, switching every once in a while for lack of ammo or to deal with a specific enemy, if that is your style of fighting--choosing a single weapon to specialize in or just swapping back and forth from time to time. I like the upgrading system; each upgrade is farily visible once you put it into use, and I never felt dissatisfaction at the upgrade I chose to fit my style of combat. The customizability makes this game very flexible for a large audience. I played on easy difficulty, though, as I do not own the most beefy computer.One thing I particularly liked about the game was the Big Sisters. I like how few times they are encountered, which keeps their appearance and deadliness fresh. Though one point became a bit boring, it was probably just my fault. I absolutely love the noises she makes before she appears, too.The music and atmostphere is quite attractive. I may even say slightly better if not noticeably better than the first Bioshock game.In conclusion, it IS worth the money, but don't be stupid. One has to play these games in order... BioShock, BioShock 2, and finally BioShock: Infinite, if one wishes to. Maybe the Burial At Sea DLC after that, if you want. The Life-Electrifying universe is pretty interesting and fun. If you ever plan to play the first two BioShock games, make sure to do so. If you do not, feel free to play Infinite as it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing video games for the first time long after their release is not always a bad thing. Indeed it enables us to see how they endure the test of time. And only true jewels can stand it. What about Bioshock II ? As I had been blown away after playing the first opus, I expected a lot from this sequel. And so did many Bioshock fans. Here's my review :(See rating at the end of the review)____________________________GAMEPLAY: Quite similar to what we experienced in the first game. The gameplay is really focused on immersive and explosive fighting sequences. The difference with the first opus is that there's no real final boss but very often the player is opposing big waves of ennemies. Hopefully it is possible to prepare your defense by setting traps and mines, hacking security cameras and turrets. But if you want to collect all the Adam, these defensive fights become too repetitive. On a more positive note, some new weapons add more fun to the gameplay. I really enjoyed playing with the drill and the spear gun. Moreover, it's really interesting to combine different weapon's and plasmid's attacks. I liked the fact, that as a Big Daddy you really feel the strength and the weight of your character. There are also different levels of difficulty that you may choose depending on your experience in FPS games. So don't worry if you're not used to this type of game. I'm not, but I still truly enjoyed playing it.VISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: That's why so many people love the Bioshock saga : a deep immersion into an equally beautiful and horrific world. Of course, I already knew how Rapture looked like but I was still surprised by the beauty of the scenery. And even if the game engine is getting older, the esthetic of this chaotic city is still mind-blowing. The new developers have even got further with more cutscenes and submarine exploration that offers quiet and contemplative moments between the fighting sequences. I also have to praise the soundtrack, the voice-acting and the sound effects that are even better than in the first Bioshock.STORY: In this sequel, which occurs ten years after the events of the first game, we play in this sequel a reborn Big Daddy who's trying to get back to his little sister. Our quest offers us the possibility to explore many new places and to meet new cheracters. The most interesting ones are the utopist Sofia Lamb and the opportunist Sinclair who take the roles of Ryan and Atlas in the antagonist-protagonist pattern. Because we are more familiar with Rapture and it's doom, we are less surprised by the wickedness of its inhabitants but there are still some strong revelations. Many elements of the story are smartly scattered in the Audio Diaries that the player finds on its way. And as we move towards the end of the game, the story becomes more and more intense. To me, three of the four different endings are a bit overdramatic but they still have a great theatrical effect. LENGTH: It takes around 10 hours to finish the game. More than that if you don't use the quest arrow. There's four different endings that you can experience depending of your choices, but because the game is very scripted I wouldn't do it all over again. ____________________________  Gameplay 4.5/6   Visuals, music and atmosphere 6/6   Story 4/6   Length 2/2   - -   Global Rating 16.5/20 Even if we are familiar with Rapture, it is still a great pleasure to explore this submarine terrifying world. Bioshock II is not disappointing at all in terms of visual design and atmosphere. However, this sequel is bit more focused on action than on the story. As a result, the gameplay is more entertaining but the story lacks originality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sequel worthy of its precedessor.Bioshock 2 makes you jump right into the known an deep setting with familiar set of mechanics that went through slight alterations and refreshement; most noticeable with plasmids that suddenly became a much more interesting and versatile tool that doesn't force you to stop gunning. A change needed for the more action-y nature of the game when compared to the original Bioshock.While the gameplay feels very familiar, the storytelling isn't. The difference comes from the fact that the first game was all about introducing the player to Rapture and telling him the story of it. What was driving us all was the discovery, walking through the city that fell from its glory and plunged into darkness. That, and a very well constructed plot with just the right amount of surprises.You won't find that in the sequel - we know the place, we know the story. The plot got much simpler. What is it about, then? Feelings. Bioshock made you listen to the tale, yet stay a bit to the side. Bioshock 2, on the other hand, sacrifices some of it to make you feel and experience the Rapture as  Big Daddy. It's pulled off very well, and keeps the game on high level even if it is nto married to the same idea as the original. Gathering, protecting, curing, harvesting - it all feels more personal now. Same how it is for all the encounters with the 'main NPCs', which you can kill or spare. They all are relevant to who you play. You are not a 'stranger', but a part of the city. This aspect, and the general attitude of resorting to showing instead of telling gives this one a unique charm.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can just chime in with the praise on all of the above - my only complaint: if there is one thing I abolutely HATE it's when games just start throwing enemies en masse at you in the last chapter, and Bioshock 2 kinda does this... a more streamlined ending would have been better IMHO - would have made me appreciate the storyline much more (which is awesome too).

												I bought the special edition of BioShock 2 when it released, It did not disappoint. BioShock is one of my favorite series of all time. BioShock 2 lives up to the first game, and it has pretty great multiplayer too!Now to the good stuff. The PC port of the game has all the good stuff of the console version, and now with the added bonus of not actually having to use games for windows live!  BioShock 2 is all through Steam now, this is great, especially if you are up for playing the multiplayer! While we are talking about them multiplayer, I should note its not very populated anymore. I can still find games regularly, but some days it just takes to long to matchmake. Overall though, I really would recommend all the BioShock games to anyone who asks. They have great story telling, wonderful art and environments, and most importantly gameplay you can really get behind!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I couldn't believe how hard I was after the ending.For a Video Game Dad Simulator, this is pretty fun. There's a shark, a cartoon scientist villain, and more!Varies up the gameplay immensely from the first by giving you a Big Daddy's arsenal instead of the Genericsville gun roster you had in the first game. Plot is leaps and bounds better than the first game, dropping stuff like The Big Dumb Twist in favor of greater insight into the culture of Rapture and it's characters. Graphics do their part to show you more of the ocean aspect of Rapture, more interesting skyboxes and varied viewpoints than the first game.This game has good DLC, Protector Trials are fun and let you master the various combat options you may not have considered going through the game the first time, and completing them offers you an extra method of difficulty for Minerva's Den. Minerva's Den has decent length and difficulty, has a good story, and is not in any way shape or form like Burial at Sea (please do not buy Burial at Sea it is garbage I feel genuinely bad for the poor suckers who got punked 30 dollars by buying those)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, first game review ever. I also own the first Bioshock, but can't review it because I didn't get it from Steam. But I digress. This game is the perfect followup to the first Bioshock. My first playthrough was on hard, and it makes the struggle through Rapture a constant war and bloodbath that is intense and challenging, even as a powerful Big Daddy. The new weapons really changed things up, while keeping and improving the original plasmids. Combat flows more naturally, since you don't have to switch betweens weapons and plasmids but can use them simultaneously. Now, the setting. Instead of an objectivistic society, now it is collectivist, striving for a disolving of the individual into ""the family."" I can't say too much about the plot without spoilers, but Big Daddies always have a Little Sister, and you are no exception. The story is strong, I think stronger than most give it credit for. It is good in its own right, but everyone (naturally) compares it to the first game, which has an exceptionally good story. Crashing? I play on Mac (yes, it actually runs on Mac). And actually, it crashes only rarely, and no problem with my save files. Mostly, it has crashed in the Protector Trials, but even then, only occasionally. With lots to explore, easter eggs that can almost make ya weep, combat that can feel totally awesome (turning yourself into a flamethrower is a real joy), and deep philosophical and moral questions at its heart, this game is excellent and I highly recommend it, even if you don't have the first game. That being said, get the first game. It's a masterpiece.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While BioShock made me love Rapture, BioShock 2 satisfied my craving for more Rapture. I was so hyped I had to complete all the Protector Trials to earn more achievements. This comes free with the base game and is prefect for those not willing to replay the entire campaign.BS2 brings back the awesome BS gameplay with a few improvements. For starters, the hacking ""game"" was changed to be more pleasant (thank god), and also you have the equipment to hack from a distance. Like in BS, you can rescue Little Sisters from Big Daddies.

												So, you know that BioShock game, right? How it had a really good story, with neat plottwists, neat underwater world inspired heavily by Art Deco, and lackluster gameplay?You can't say anything about BioShock 2 without comparing it to the first one. BioShock 2 was an improvement in gameplay, that's for sure. Plasmid in one hand, gun in the other made a fine combination and killing was finally... well, fun. Gene Tonics added another layer of depth, even though at the end you can easily buy all the slots and fill them with the best tonics. Also, you get to be a Big Daddy, finally. After playing the first one, almost every player had this thought, how nice would be to play as one. So you get a drill and a rivet gun. Didn't change much in gameplay, but is neat.Can't forget about hacking though. First game had this water flowing in pipes minigame, thought it was nice, and a bit of a challenge. In the second game, they possibly decided it was too hard for consoles and replaced it with ""click at the right moment"" minigame. Pathetic. Boring. Click, click, click. Auto-hack darts help with that a bit, but still it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.Enemies. The main issue I had with the first game is in here too - splicers are supposed to have some personality, with small talk in some moments of the game, but they are still mindless and not challenging at all, just bullet sponges. Their quantity doesn't help with it - in my opinion, in such a game killing a person should make you feel bad at least a bit. I guess making them smarter and use elaborate tactics was too hard, so they just blamed splicing for messing with their heads.And the last thing - story. We all know it's weak. Has some problems. Disappearing (Tenenbaum?) and appearing for no reason characters make little sense. Main enemy is a woman that somehow gained followers that holds a teenage girl hostage. Her motivations are unclear, just like her modus operandi. Somehow she knows all and does nothing else, but monitors my movements. Sends me propaganda messages that are sure not to work. There's no plottwist or anything to make it better. Smaller bosses stories were much better. Grace had a solid story, Stanley did some weird stuff (but still better than Lamb), and Alexander had the best level. So, the story was far worse than in the first game. Good thing to note.But you know what? Story was definitely fixed in Minerva's Den. This DLC makes the entire game worth it, even though you have to play through the entire basic game to undersand it all. I know, it has backtracking, and hacking/enemies issues weren't resolved, but it's good even then.Even without the free DLC, I would recommend the game. It's not perfect, has some flaws, but you can't say it's bad or mediocre either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Control your junkies with heavy machine gun fire and plasmids, literally DRILL THROUGH their stoopid lil' brains to make sure you get all dem ADAM.Not a punch-in-the-face welcoming to rapture, a fairly less spooky ride for the easy-spooked audience.Overall - 8.5/10spooki rate - low-medium ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock 2 continue where BioShock left. A few details has been changed (fx. changing the E-key to F), but else its more of the same. In the beginning I though that BioShock was the better game, but after having finished BioShock 2, I think its equally good.So if you liked BioShock, you will also like BioShock 2.It might get a little repetitative to gather ""adam"" and killing monsters, but its still a good game. I experienced a few crashes in the game (especially when the graphic load was large, and many things happend at once). Its nothing seriously (I think it was 4 crashes all in all), but remember to save often.All in all, I give this the same grade as the first BioShock: 7/10NB! If you like BioShok 2, and want more of the same, don't forget to play the ""Minerva's Den""-DLC. The lengh of this DLC is about a third the lengh of BioShock 2.I give Minervas Den-DLC: 7/10 as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Up until just recently since they removed that pos GfWL this game was unplayable once I got to dionyses park *probably butchered that name*. It would freeze constantly, crash any computer i used it on, and would also erase saved games making it impossible to continue playing. Thank whatever intelligence that decided to pull that pos program off of this amazing game. The story line is one of the best in just about any game *driven by in game audio tapes and ""real time character exchanges""* that made me care about the Elenor and made me make some tough moral decisions. My first complete playthrough was based solely on saving every little sister and not killing any of the side characters. I have to admit that I was super excited to find out I could finally finish this game once they removed that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pos Games for windows live login. Never had a single issue once it was completely taken out. Whoever did this has my thanks.I would put this game in the Top spot for FPS ever.As a story driven FPS with just incredible overall atmosphere, soundtrack, story, playability *once it was fixed*, diffuculty, and last but never least FUN. easily gets a 10/10. Before GFWL was removed a 5/10. Yes GFWL ♥♥♥♥ed it up that bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A dying father, a sinking city, and a utopian ideal gone horribly wrong. This is BioShock 2 at its center. After a brief, violent glimpse into Rapture before its fall from capitalist glory, players are sunk into the boots of Subject Delta, a big daddy with a bone to pick with the leader of Rapture's newly-mended society, the Rapture Family. The gameplay still has that zap-and-whack feel that gave the first BioShock's combat so much appeal. The blood on the walls and viewable acts of brutality also remind the player where they are: Rapture.In Delta's hunt for his Little Sister, he'll run into some familiar faces, and new ones. Tenenbaum has returned to this leaky ship, Ryan's posthumous voice is audible via recordings, and even Dr. Suchong and his grisly fate come to light. A whole host of new characters awaits Delta here, each of them interesting and memorable. Seldom are new Plasmids, but old weapons have been repurposed (and in some cases, replaced) for use by the protagonist Big Daddy. Deliberating over a Little Sister's fate is just as agonizing as before (even moreso, considering the player's role as a Protector), and pulling off a perfect plasmid-weapon combo is still a very, very satisfying experience. If you liked BioShock 1, you'll find nothing wrong with BioShock 2.Never before has bashing a Splicer's head in been so fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I prefer Bioshock 2 to the first game.The story is much tighter this time around, and doesn't suffer from all of the third act problems that the first game does. It develops its characters, themes, and setting much more naturally. Sophia Lamb is a great antagonist for the story and her worldview and history inside Rapture not only build her character, but develop Rapture and it's inhabitants--Rapture feels like a place people actually lived in. Motivations are still complex, but I found that they were clearer than the majority of those in the first game. The game also does a better job of weaving the choices you make in the game into the narrative. I found myself a lot more emotionally invested in the story of Bioshock 2.The gameplay is more intuitive and the plasmid/gene tonic/weapons upgrade system has a better balance. For example, the oddly redundant Chemical Thrower is gone, and it's abilities have been integrated into the plasmids. In Bioshock 1, there were a series of weapon upgrade stations scattered across the map offering two upgrades per weapon. In Bioshock 2, each weapon gets a third upgrade that unlocks after unlocking the two previous upgrades. The catch is that there are far less upgrade stations across the game, so you have to think more carefully about what you choose to upgrade. No longer requiring the player to choose between having a plasmid or weapon equipped makes a big difference in developing strategy for new areas.Graphically it holds up better, things are sharper and it looks like the textures have a higher resolution (or are simply optimized better). There are other small details that have been altered slightly from the first game but make a noticeable difference. The little sisters don't tiptoe the line near uncanny valley anymore and actually sound like children. There's more variety in the audio diaries you can find. Hacking is no longer a frustrating minigame. Colors are used in the art direction to greater effect be it the red glow of the Big Sisters or the pinks, blues and greens of sea life encroaching on Rapture. Just small things like this.Additionally, Minerva's Den is a great short story and DLC with its own unique gameplay mechanics. It is also worth picking up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, serious review time.This game brings back nostalgic memories from Bioshock 1, but then amplified by playing as a big daddy.If you pick this game up while not having played Bioshock 1 you might not be able to grasp how cool it is to play as a big daddy. For this was the first and almost only reason I picked up this game, but I was suprised on how much more this game has to offer then the obvious ""you are a big daddy so here are bigger guns to shoot stuff with"".Take the Story for instance, the Bioshock series set this ""reference point"" for having a good story line. Always with some unexpencted story twist at the end (even though this game doesn't have that as much as infinite or the first one). Without any spoilers I can only say its good, but nothing like infinite.Gameplay whise I wasn't all to suprised, like I said before its basically the gameplay of Bioshock 1 with bigger guns. But that doesn't mean its bad, infact, the gameplay and movement is super solid and extremely satisfying. You can combine plasmids, guns and genetonics to perfect your ""build"". The enemies have a good variety, not just the typical splicer, all the different enemy types make up for changing gameplay. But later on in the game the variety of splicers become boring, late game you are so powerful that you cut through everyone in seconds, even big daddies and sisters. And the only way the game compensates for that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out a bazillion enemies at you, so late game becomes more or less a grind and the variety stops.All and all, its a good game. Super solid gameplay, storywise lacking a bit for a bioshock game. And the variety in builds you can do, make me come back to this game constantly.P.S first serious review here, you can comment ""omg it zucks ur bad"" or actually give some feedback.P.P.S or just comment whatever about this review			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought the special edition of BioShock 2 when it released, It did not disappoint. BioShock is one of my favorite series of all time. BioShock 2 lives up to the first game, and it has pretty great multiplayer too!Now to the good stuff. The PC port of the game has all the good stuff of the console version, and now with the added bonus of not actually having to use games for windows live!  BioShock 2 is all through Steam now, this is great, especially if you are up for playing the multiplayer! While we are talking about them multiplayer, I should note its not very populated anymore. I can still find games regularly, but some days it just takes to long to matchmake. Overall though, I really would recommend all the BioShock games to anyone who asks. They have great story telling, wonderful art and environments, and most importantly gameplay you can really get behind!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 retains most of the elements of the first game adding the ability to combine certain plasmids to create traps and the Big Sisters. Gameplay wise, the game is nearly identical to the first one however, the story is more developed this time.The game continues employing a great atmosphere with audio and detailed backgrounds as well a good looking lightning effects. Voice acting is great and makes the story believable. The writing has been with such quality that you will grow interested in the story and in the characters that you meet during your travel.While the game's online functionality is non existant nowadays, Bioshock 2 is a game in which the story mode takes the center stage. If you enjoy games with great storytelling and atmosphere, Bioshock 2 is a game you shouldn't miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite what's often said of this game, it's a great one. Interestingly, in the absence of Ken Levine, it really points out his abilities and flaws.Expect a fairly simple, but quite effective story. There really aren't any plot twists, and evevrything pans out fairly nicely. But that doesn't matter, because the artists here masterfully constructs is so that you'd feel the full emotional impact all the same.What not to expect? Do not be awed. It is not an ""exceptional"" game in the conventional sense. Ken has a way with pivotal ""moments"" which this game lacks. There's nothing amazing in here at all, which is a shame. But Bioshock 2 is more than sum of all its part. Even the very predictable ending pays dividends, due to how well the whole thing has been setup. This isn't a game to make you awed and appalled like the original Bioshock, or pondering and thoughtful like Bioshock Infinite. I feel it's more of a sci-fi melodrama, and you'll find your sympathy swinging along with the main characters. Unlike the other Bioshock's the ending really feels rewarding.Gameplay itself is not special. At least you can use both Plasmids and guns at the same time, and you also get a melee attack as well. Apart from a few new Plasmids to play around with, you'll be here for the same sort of thing as you had with the other games. I can't comment much on the multiplayer. There are no servers, and you'll be playing on listen servers, i.e. other people's PC, so expect lag. I live too far away from the continents to play this very well, so I can't give a good review of that. Anyway, it's a good buy, and I wholly recommend this to anyone who has 10 hours to spare.

												While BioShock made me love Rapture, BioShock 2 satisfied my craving for more Rapture. I was so hyped I had to complete all the Protector Trials to earn more achievements. This comes free with the base game and is prefect for those not willing to replay the entire campaign.BS2 brings back the awesome BS gameplay with a few improvements. For starters, the hacking ""game"" was changed to be more pleasant (thank god), and also you have the equipment to hack from a distance. Like in BS, you can rescue Little Sisters from Big Daddies. However, you now have the option to let her sit on your shoulder and let her harvest ADAM when you come across an appropriate body. During which, inhabitants of Rapture will swarm in to get to your girl and it's your job to keep her safe. This was a welcoming addition and I found it challenging and fun, and The Protector Trials have the same purpose but with limited plasmids and weapons.While the story wasn't as strong as that of BS1 and BSI, it still showcased a number of gameplay elements that I wish was in the original game, which would have made it perfect.

												So, first game review ever. I also own the first Bioshock, but can't review it because I didn't get it from Steam. But I digress. This game is the perfect followup to the first Bioshock. My first playthrough was on hard, and it makes the struggle through Rapture a constant war and bloodbath that is intense and challenging, even as a powerful Big Daddy. The new weapons really changed things up, while keeping and improving the original plasmids. Combat flows more naturally, since you don't have to switch betweens weapons and plasmids but can use them simultaneously. Now, the setting. Instead of an objectivistic society, now it is collectivist, striving for a disolving of the individual into ""the family."" I can't say too much about the plot without spoilers, but Big Daddies always have a Little Sister, and you are no exception. The story is strong, I think stronger than most give it credit for. It is good in its own right, but everyone (naturally) compares it to the first game, which has an exceptionally good story. Crashing? I play on Mac (yes, it actually runs on Mac). And actually, it crashes only rarely, and no problem with my save files. Mostly, it has crashed in the Protector Trials, but even then, only occasionally. With lots to explore, easter eggs that can almost make ya weep, combat that can feel totally awesome (turning yourself into a flamethrower is a real joy), and deep philosophical and moral questions at its heart, this game is excellent and I highly recommend it, even if you don't have the first game. That being said, get the first game. It's a masterpiece.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've yet to start playing/finish Bioshock: Infinite, but this may give me better judgement.I found Bioshock 2 to be even better than Bioshock 1. I do not know why, but I am not downgrading Bioshock 1. They are both equally amazing and cannot be purchased singularly without the other. One must also play Bioshock 1 FIRST in order to experience everything correctly.It's been a while since I last played it, but I am writing this review right now because I feel it deserves one. I played the fatherly daddy side of the story, rescuing each and every little sister. Multiple pathways and endings through the story mean easy replayability, and it does that well. I also appreciate how you have the choice of killing a character in the plot or not, directing the pathway in the way you wish, and giving that wonderous illusion of choice that many of us crave in a mostly linear game.The combat and entire ""get little sister and get moar adam"" can become repetitive, but that is only what I feel. Out of the weapons, each one can have an equal chance at being used as a main weapon, switching every once in a while for lack of ammo or to deal with a specific enemy, if that is your style of fighting--choosing a single weapon to specialize in or just swapping back and forth from time to time. I like the upgrading system; each upgrade is farily visible once you put it into use, and I never felt dissatisfaction at the upgrade I chose to fit my style of combat. The customizability makes this game very flexible for a large audience. I played on easy difficulty, though, as I do not own the most beefy computer.One thing I particularly liked about the game was the Big Sisters. I like how few times they are encountered, which keeps their appearance and deadliness fresh. Though one point became a bit boring, it was probably just my fault. I absolutely love the noises she makes before she appears, too.The music and atmostphere is quite attractive. I may even say slightly better if not noticeably better than the first Bioshock game.In conclusion, it IS worth the money, but don't be stupid. One has to play these games in order... BioShock, BioShock 2, and finally BioShock: Infinite, if one wishes to. Maybe the Burial At Sea DLC after that, if you want. The Life-Electrifying universe is pretty interesting and fun. If you ever plan to play the first two BioShock games, make sure to do so. If you do not, feel free to play Infinite as it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great sequel to the masterpiece. The game itself isn't that different from the first game generally.  Although the story is better in the first game, the gameplay is much better here. Bisohock 1 is indeed better but i still highly recommend this game...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bioshock series is prob the best thing that has happened to gaming in the last years, refreshing gameplay, sick atmosphere, nice soundtrack, STELLAR sound design & voice acting. Can just chime in with the praise on all of the above - my only complaint: if there is one thing I abolutely HATE it's when games just start throwing enemies en masse at you in the last chapter, and Bioshock 2 kinda does this... a more streamlined ending would have been better IMHO - would have made me appreciate the storyline much more (which is awesome too). Sick game overall, makes me want to play the DLC and after that Infinte			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This series has one of the best settings for a game I've ever encountered, unfortunately let down by the gameplay itself.  This is a game so obsessed with feeding you its story that death literally has no consequence.The first Bioshock left a bigger impression on me - play that if you're new to the series.  This one fills in a few details about Rapture story-wise, but falls flat in most other respects.It should be noted that if (like me) you bought a retail copy of the game, it's worth registering on steam to gain free access to the Minerva's Den DLC, as well as enjoying a non-GFWL experience.Also, for your sanity, run the game with the ""-dx9"" flag set (right-click on game in library > set launch options), or you will probably experience constant crashes to desktop, especially so in the DLC.

												This game was great and i really loved it , but after you finished the game, you tend to get bored. The storyline was great and the game was really long so that kind of made up for it, but i would recommend this game after you play Bioshock. I also thought that the multiplayer wasnt that great and it was under my expectations, i would have liked it a lot more if there was a multiplayer campaign. there were a lot of downs for this game and i only recommended it because i really liked the prequel (Bioshock) but Bioshock 2 was kind of disappointing. i was expecting more from the multiplayer mode, butIF YOU LIKED BIOSHOCK 1 THEN I RECOMMEND THIS GAME COMPLETELY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If i`m going to speak the truth here. You can easily skip this game and play infinite without the feeling. 'Huh, I`m missing something.'I start with the good things. The gameplay is way faster than the orginal, you can equip both a plasmid and a gun at the same time. Combine this with the fact that you now can melee strike with the press of a button (instead that you have to select you wrench) and you have a faster bioshock game. New types of enemies are also introduced, including things called big sisters which are form a way bigger danger than a big daddy. And you, now being a big daddy, you can now adopted a little sister with fun defend sections where you can be really creative with combinations of plasmids and weapons.But as I now look at the things I liked about the game I can immediately give it a counter argument that works agains it.For example the new splicer, the brute splicer, showed in the beginning  but at the middle of the game never came back. And the new big sisters are with this exploit super easy, go stand next to a vending machine and keep shooting the b*tch until she dies becase ammo and cash are so insultingly common that I almost all the time get the message that I have the maximum of my money, medkits or eve hippos or ammo types it really frustrated me.Also the gunplay didn`t statisfy me, and same goes to the story of this game. It didn`t shock me like the twist of the original, that stuck to me to this day, same goes to the dread of the original. Bioshock 1 has peoplo who went complete crazy and, for example, stab now there clients in the guts and hang them on the wall because they are ugly. Bioshock 2 on the other hand has not only that dread of the original but also not the personality.And please, for Ken Levin`s sake, don`t play this game on a xbox controller. I did and the fact that I need to lift my tumb of the right stick to heal where my fingers got stuck with each other causes some cheap deads, and I couldn`t rebind the controls.But as I went on and on about how a piece of sh*t this game is. I still recommend this game, weird enough.You got to see how little sisters see the world and why they keep calling corpses ''angels'' and this is still one of the best shooters around and it wasn`t a torture to play. It`s just not as good as bioshock 1...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock 2 skip to Results and read from there.2K Games does it again with a beautiful story, fantastic gameplay, and wonderful internal environment. BioShock 2 has it all and pushes the greatness of the series to new heights.Story:Taking place after the original life has been brought back to the lost, but never forgotten city of Rapture. Professor Lamb has started working to bring young girls back down to the deep city and start cultivating Adam once again. Her idea of a utopia exists unlike Ryan’s which is based on uncontrolled capitalism Lambs is based on true altruism, the idea of the true utopia. You as one of the original Big Daddy’s have been brought back to life to save Eleanor, your Little Sister from a fate worse than death. Will you be able to make it in time?Campaign:There are nine levels: Adonis Luxury Resort, Atlantic Express, Ryan Amusements, Pauper’s Drop, Siren Alley, Dionysus Park, Fontaine Futuristics, Outer Persephone, and Inner Persephone. The levels in this campaign vary in length drastically, some of them being relatively short while others are overly massive. You have varying objectives in each area: find items, fight bosses, activate switches, find little sisters, etc. These keep the campaign interesting and each area has its own spin on how it wants you to play. The campaign is well laid out and each area has its own twists that make it unique. Gameplay:The game plays differently than the original, as you are no longer a mere mortal but rather one of the machines you fought so hard to defeat. You wield all weapons single handedly allowing you to equip plasmids in your other hand. This way you can shoot a gun as well as light a foe on fire, personally I was so used to the first one I forgot half the time I could do this. When I finally realized I still found myself not using it as the menu interface to change between plasmids was not as dynamic. This games combat realistically was drastically improved; no longer did you need to keep pulling out the camera during battle to get the best shot, instead you just clicked and it recorded while you were in combat giving you a score for the battle. The remote hacking tool allows you to actually hack cameras, which you could do in the first one but was very tricky as they would almost always detect you before you started the hack. Plus the wrench was changed to a drill which had multiple attack types making it more dynamic. In BioShock I actually used the Wrench all game, so I decided to only use ranged weapons this time round. There are three key combat elements in this game: Weapons, Plasmids (like spells), and tonics (like buffs). The weapons, plasmids, and tonics really allow you to customize your play style. By choosing specific tonics in combination with weapon choose and plasmid choice you can decide if you want to be a melee master, a total hacker, or gunning madman. Plus each weapon, plasmid, and tonic has upgraded versions which make them even more effective and variable. Minerva’s Den:I wasn't sure about Minerva's Den, usually DLC campaigns are just extra levels and lose the elements that make a game great. Minerva's Den was the complete opposite, in fact this DLC story rivals that of the original. There are three levels: Minerva's Den, Operations, and The Thinker. The first two levels are exceptionally large and have many missions/puzzles invovled and the final level is a boss fight. This DLC adds an exceptional amount of depth including a new weapon (Ion Laser) a new Plamid (Gravity Well), two new tonics, and four new enemies. This is an amazing new campaign which offers a brilliant story and fantastic new elements to the BioShock series. Results:BioShock 2 is an amazing game; although, it doesn’t stand up to the story of the original it still provides an amazing play-through. The story itself is relatively well written, and in comparison to non-BioShock games is actually quite brilliant. The combat is fun and rather in-depth with each weapon having three ammo types including the melee tool gives a huge variety to your combat style. You can even customize your tonics and plasmids to enforce the type of gameplay you desire. BioShock really is the FPS for anyone looking for a great story, invigorating combat, epic boss battles, and cool puzzles. I would recommend this game at full price, but if you’re frugal like me and only buy games on sale then wait as anything below its normal price is a steal. Pros:+Fantastic story+Beautiful game environment+Loads of weapons, with different ammo types+Many plasmids (spells) to choose from with upgraded levels+Loads of tonics (passives) to equip which customize your gameplay experience+Three difficulty settings, for all levels of gamers to enjoy.+New dynamic to the BioShock series revealing the inner sanctum of the Big Daddy.+Offers DLC to extend the experience.Cons:-The game allows you to set the difficulty in the menu. I started the game on “Hard” and somehow it dropped to “Medium” at some point. I didn’t notice until a hint popped up about 1/3 the way through when I thought to myself how easy the game was. I bumped it up again to “Hard” and kept a check on it for the rest of the campaign, but this change resulted in my not being able to get the “Against All Odds” achievement. -The game would crash randomly for no reason, I did a verify integrity check but it said the game was fine. In turn I started saving every five minutes so I wouldn’t lose much if it crashed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is set after the original Bioshock game, the story is fantastic like the original and the mechanics of the game have been improved.In Bioshock 2 you play one of the first version of a big daddy, I feel this is well implemented and the story really works well with the first Bioshock and the actual book. Not as creepy or as scary as the first one which is a shame because I felt it really worked well for the first.The Expansion is good fun as well and so are the challenges which are included, the multilayer is great fun but I feel the internal networking mechanics are quite broken but when it does work it is enjoyable.On a whole i love this game and would recommend it to anyone who has played any of the Bioshocks, even if it is just for the story.

												Look, I love Bioshock, that much is clear.  This franchise awakens me to the dystopian genre, albeit very different universes, to  the Half Life franchise in a certain way.  It is, as you probably know, linear, and the story is clear and interesting.  Bioshock 2, although not visually stunning as Infinite, utilizes gameplay mechanic and storyline in a brilliant manner, and begrudgingly I admit this may be my favorite game of the entire franchise for both story and mechanics.  Quite brilliant game, given how cheaply you can acquire it.  Without reservation I recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sequal to one of the best single-player shooters I have played. Bioshock 2 had some really awesome features but it fell short of one critical item. Story. It's story was not the best. It had its moments but it was not impressive. The graphics were definently improved. Gameplay was great but it had weak spots, Because you play as a Big Daddy, You gain access to a very powerful arsenal. Having that makes it seem to easy at times but also very satisfying. You also are able to still harvest/ rescue little sisters. When rescued you have the option to ""adopt"" them. This was a very neat feature because it allowed for more adam to be collected and a side event where you guarded her while she harvested. It made the player feel more attached or closer to the little sister. Bioshock 2 also added a new boss ""The Big Sister"". She was a very nimble close range character. She was able to collect adam and she could appear at random times. *minor spoiler alert* [/spoiler] The Big Sister was created to keep the little sister away from the big daddys, this was interesting because it gave the player a real reason to really kill her besides ""shes hurting me I'll just hurt her back"" [/spoiler] They also added new big daddys. All in all this was a good title for the gameplay but the story was definently not as good as the first or infinite. It's definently worth the 19.99 price tag it has.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Revisit Rapture and step into the shoes of a Big Daddy!A quite fragile Big Daddy, that is, which is one of my gripes with this game. Although I'm supposed to be a hulking dude in an armored diving suit, I felt quite weak at times compared to the protagonist of the first game. Wasn't that big of a problem, but I thought I'd mention it anyways!The one problem aside, I liked the sequel better than the original. The story wasn't as good, imo, but the gameplay felt better.Also lots of new cool weapons and plasmids! Especially did I like the spear gun, mostly because you can pin enemies to the wall. That NEVER gets old!And if the normal ammunition isn't enough, there's even rocket-propelled one around.Also rejoice on the fact that Games for Windows Live was removed from the game! Because we all know it sucks, which is why it was removed (I guess).You also get the Minerva's Den DLC for free now, which offers a few more hours of gameplay, new weapons, plasmids and some new environments to explore.The game also has multiplayer, apparently. Haven't played it at all and according to the forums it's dead, so don't get the game for that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good Game, but there is no autosave. Make sure you are saving consistently (and rebind F12, otherwise you make constant screenshots). An autosave feature owuld be really good here, I had to redo a WHOLE LEVEL, because the game crashed right at the end, and when I checked back, I was back to the beginning of the level...VERY frustrating. But if you save FREQUENTLY (I really mean it), it's a good game. I didn't enjoy the first bioshock, but this one is really good imo.As far as the gameplay goes, it's really good, with lots of ways to mix and match armours and abilities. If you enjoyed the first, you'd definitely like this one, and if you didn't like the first, this one just seems much smoother and has a different take on things. You can't go wrong with the triple bundle, especially if you got it in a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The ""best""/least mediocre Bioshock game. I actually kinda liked this one.The story and themes try to copy Bioshock 1 but it kind of ends up being a blander copy in that regard. But screw that! It actually manages to be fun throughout the whole game (unlike Bioshock) and the story isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ multi-dimension quantum magic pretentious hipster drivel (unlike Infinite). Basically, you're one of the first Big Daddies, and part of Rapture's Splicers have turned, in the 8 years since the first game, into a ""Family"" led by Female Andrew Ryan with a different philosophy, aka, Sofia Lamb. Your daughter is being controlled by her to be the Ultimate Citizen, and you want to get her back, as a Big Daddy would. There are twice as much endings this time (I didn't check the differences between them because I can't be arsed to), and the difference between these, besides harvesting or rescuing Little SIsters, is that they also depend on certain characters that you save. Or not. Bascially, instead of having 1 choice, you have 4.Gunplay is sort of between Bioshock (mediocre) and Infinite (less mediocre), and though it is slightly more linear than Bioshock at times, it doesn't waste hours of your time with backtracking (hence the shorter gameplay time even though I explored through most nooks and crannies) and the guns are slightly more original than Infinite's: Instead of the WW1 weaponry, you have the Big Daddy's Rivet Gun, a sort of minigun instead of that♥♥♥♥♥♥Tommy Gun from BS1, a harpoon launcher, a one-handed shotgun and Bioshock1's grenade launcher. You can also dual-wield plasmids, and the upgrades for both plasmids and weaponry are also more original than the 2 other Bioshcok games. Compared to both Ken Levine's Bioshocks, the game also has a lot less full of HP-bloated bullet sponges (though it gets more offensive in this regard towards the last 2 or 3 levels).Bioshock's Little SIster gameplay of harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters after fighting disgustingly HP-bloated enemies turns into adopting or harvesting. If you adopt them (You're a Big Daddy in this game, forgot to mention that) You can reenact the worst level of the first game where you go around letting them harvest ADAM (the magical space-slug chemical that allows you to upgrade your magic powers aka Plasmids) while playing tower defense.You only have to do this once though (for tutorial purposes *sigh*) and in later times you can just send them to the nearest vent and rescue or harvest them. The Big Daddies are not bullet sponges anymore because you have more powerful weaponry (now, there are Brute Splicers for whatever reason, which take up the seat of annoying bullet sponge that charges at you.) To keep a certain amount of dificulty in harvesting/rescuing Little Sisters (even though all difficulty in the Bioshock games is fake because you can just respawn with almost zero cost near where you ""died""), at the end of the level, come Big Sisters to get the ADAM you got back. They are sort of a combination of Big Daddies (the charge at you) and Houdini and Spider Splicers (they jump around, and throw fireballs and whatever objects are in the vicinity, at you.) They are not complete bullet sponges, and are fairly fun to fight against.Overall, it's not really a great game, but it sure as hell is better than ♥♥♥♥ing Infinite. And the first game as well.

												TLDR: An enjoyable follow-up to the first game continues the story of Rapture with a new protagonist, a new conflicted (kind of) big boss and more gene splicing action. This time around you have some moral decision making to do, and your actions affect the game’s ending.If you’ve played the first Bioshock game, you’ll remember that in the mid 1900’s the world’s top minds secretly worked together to build the underwater city of Rapture, and created what they thought was the ultimate utopia, free of government and religion. Instead they were ruled by the free market and meritocracy, so everyone makes money based on being good at something. In Bioshock 2, you learn that the pressures of this “perfect world” started to get to the citizens (especially the poor), and a psychiatrist was brought in to help people deal with the stresses of pure competition. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist Sofia Lamb had her own agenda, and saw the opportunity to create a true Utopia in Rapture through the use of Adam. Adam is a genetic material that can be used to create “plasmids” for artificial evolution through gene splicing. It doesn’t just give people super powers though, apparently it can be used to transfer the memories of the users to certain prepared users (Little Sisters). Little Sisters are orphaned girls who have been kidnapped and turned into walking “Adam factories” who can later be harvested for their gooey Adam. The Little Sisters are guarded by Big Daddies, brainwashed people in armored diving gear who are psychically linked to their Little Sisters and guard them from any threat.In Bioshock 2, you play a Big Daddy, though the gameplay is nearly the same as in the first game (where you were a human). It’s still a First Person Shooter and the weapons are mostly the same as well. There’s been a refinement to the plasmid system where you’re basically dual wielding now (plasmid in one hand and gun in the other). In the first game you had to switch between gun and plasmid. A big change is that because you’re a Big Daddy, you do a bunch of mini escort missions where you guard Little Sisters as they gather their Adam. Just like in the first game, you have a huge variety of weapon ammo types and plasmid types to help you survive, though you might notice that the game is more difficult this time around. It seems like you take more damage in Bioshock 2 than in the first game.Pros:+The story is good though it’s a little difficult to figure out what the deal is with Sofia Lamb.

												The ""best""/least mediocre Bioshock game. I actually kinda liked this one.The story and themes try to copy Bioshock 1 but it kind of ends up being a blander copy in that regard. But screw that! It actually manages to be fun throughout the whole game (unlike Bioshock) and the story isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ multi-dimension quantum magic pretentious hipster drivel (unlike Infinite). Basically, you're one of the first Big Daddies, and part of Rapture's Splicers have turned, in the 8 years since the first game, into a ""Family"" led by Female Andrew Ryan with a different philosophy, aka, Sofia Lamb. Your daughter is being controlled by her to be the Ultimate Citizen, and you want to get her back, as a Big Daddy would. There are twice as much endings this time (I didn't check the differences between them because I can't be arsed to), and the difference between these, besides harvesting or rescuing Little SIsters, is that they also depend on certain characters that you save. Or not. Bascially, instead of having 1 choice, you have 4.Gunplay is sort of between Bioshock (mediocre) and Infinite (less mediocre), and though it is slightly more linear than Bioshock at times, it doesn't waste hours of your time with backtracking (hence the shorter gameplay time even though I explored through most nooks and crannies) and the guns are slightly more original than Infinite's: Instead of the WW1 weaponry, you have the Big Daddy's Rivet Gun, a sort of minigun instead of that♥♥♥♥♥♥Tommy Gun from BS1, a harpoon launcher, a one-handed shotgun and Bioshock1's grenade launcher. You can also dual-wield plasmids, and the upgrades for both plasmids and weaponry are also more original than the 2 other Bioshcok games. Compared to both Ken Levine's Bioshocks, the game also has a lot less full of HP-bloated bullet sponges (though it gets more offensive in this regard towards the last 2 or 3 levels).Bioshock's Little SIster gameplay of harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters after fighting disgustingly HP-bloated enemies turns into adopting or harvesting. If you adopt them (You're a Big Daddy in this game, forgot to mention that) You can reenact the worst level of the first game where you go around letting them harvest ADAM (the magical space-slug chemical that allows you to upgrade your magic powers aka Plasmids) while playing tower defense.You only have to do this once though (for tutorial purposes *sigh*) and in later times you can just send them to the nearest vent and rescue or harvest them. The Big Daddies are not bullet sponges anymore because you have more powerful weaponry (now, there are Brute Splicers for whatever reason, which take up the seat of annoying bullet sponge that charges at you.) To keep a certain amount of dificulty in harvesting/rescuing Little Sisters (even though all difficulty in the Bioshock games is fake because you can just respawn with almost zero cost near where you ""died""), at the end of the level, come Big Sisters to get the ADAM you got back. They are sort of a combination of Big Daddies (the charge at you) and Houdini and Spider Splicers (they jump around, and throw fireballs and whatever objects are in the vicinity, at you.) They are not complete bullet sponges, and are fairly fun to fight against.Overall, it's not really a great game, but it sure as hell is better than ♥♥♥♥ing Infinite. And the first game as well.

												TLDR: An enjoyable follow-up to the first game continues the story of Rapture with a new protagonist, a new conflicted (kind of) big boss and more gene splicing action. This time around you have some moral decision making to do, and your actions affect the game’s ending.If you’ve played the first Bioshock game, you’ll remember that in the mid 1900’s the world’s top minds secretly worked together to build the underwater city of Rapture, and created what they thought was the ultimate utopia, free of government and religion. Instead they were ruled by the free market and meritocracy, so everyone makes money based on being good at something. In Bioshock 2, you learn that the pressures of this “perfect world” started to get to the citizens (especially the poor), and a psychiatrist was brought in to help people deal with the stresses of pure competition. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist Sofia Lamb had her own agenda, and saw the opportunity to create a true Utopia in Rapture through the use of Adam. Adam is a genetic material that can be used to create “plasmids” for artificial evolution through gene splicing. It doesn’t just give people super powers though, apparently it can be used to transfer the memories of the users to certain prepared users (Little Sisters). Little Sisters are orphaned girls who have been kidnapped and turned into walking “Adam factories” who can later be harvested for their gooey Adam. The Little Sisters are guarded by Big Daddies, brainwashed people in armored diving gear who are psychically linked to their Little Sisters and guard them from any threat.In Bioshock 2, you play a Big Daddy, though the gameplay is nearly the same as in the first game (where you were a human). It’s still a First Person Shooter and the weapons are mostly the same as well. There’s been a refinement to the plasmid system where you’re basically dual wielding now (plasmid in one hand and gun in the other). In the first game you had to switch between gun and plasmid. A big change is that because you’re a Big Daddy, you do a bunch of mini escort missions where you guard Little Sisters as they gather their Adam. Just like in the first game, you have a huge variety of weapon ammo types and plasmid types to help you survive, though you might notice that the game is more difficult this time around. It seems like you take more damage in Bioshock 2 than in the first game.Pros:+The story is good though it’s a little difficult to figure out what the deal is with Sofia Lamb. How did she turn into such a ♥♥♥♥♥?+The game takes what is good about the first game and adds to it. I kind of liked the hacking mini game in the first game better though. There are more weapon types, more plasmids, and more enemies. The mini bosses in the first game were the Big Daddies, who are back, but now you have the Big Sisters to deal with as well and they’re twice as powerful. +The game has 6 different endings depending on the moral choices you make throughout, but they’re actually very close to each other. I’ve probably only seen 3 of them because I usually play games as a “good person” and had to go out of my way to make evil decisions. Cons:-People have told me that Bioshock 2 is the weakest in the Bioshock series and I can see their point. There really isn’t much more innovation and it’s kind of like a continuation of the first game in terms of technical improvement. Like with Saints Row 4, where people said it was almost a really long DLC for Saints Row 3.-There were some technical issues for me related to graphics.

												Revisit Rapture and step into the shoes of a Big Daddy!A quite fragile Big Daddy, that is, which is one of my gripes with this game. Although I'm supposed to be a hulking dude in an armored diving suit, I felt quite weak at times compared to the protagonist of the first game. Wasn't that big of a problem, but I thought I'd mention it anyways!The one problem aside, I liked the sequel better than the original. The story wasn't as good, imo, but the gameplay felt better.Also lots of new cool weapons and plasmids! Especially did I like the spear gun, mostly because you can pin enemies to the wall. That NEVER gets old!And if the normal ammunition isn't enough, there's even rocket-propelled one around.Also rejoice on the fact that Games for Windows Live was removed from the game! Because we all know it sucks, which is why it was removed (I guess).You also get the Minerva's Den DLC for free now, which offers a few more hours of gameplay, new weapons, plasmids and some new environments to explore.The game also has multiplayer, apparently. Haven't played it at all and according to the forums it's dead, so don't get the game for that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is set after the original Bioshock game, the story is fantastic like the original and the mechanics of the game have been improved.In Bioshock 2 you play one of the first version of a big daddy, I feel this is well implemented and the story really works well with the first Bioshock and the actual book. Not as creepy or as scary as the first one which is a shame because I felt it really worked well for the first.The Expansion is good fun as well and so are the challenges which are included, the multilayer is great fun but I feel the internal networking mechanics are quite broken but when it does work it is enjoyable.On a whole i love this game and would recommend it to anyone who has played any of the Bioshocks, even if it is just for the story.

												The sequal to one of the best single-player shooters I have played. Bioshock 2 had some really awesome features but it fell short of one critical item. Story. It's story was not the best. It had its moments but it was not impressive. The graphics were definently improved. Gameplay was great but it had weak spots, Because you play as a Big Daddy, You gain access to a very powerful arsenal. Having that makes it seem to easy at times but also very satisfying. You also are able to still harvest/ rescue little sisters. When rescued you have the option to ""adopt"" them. This was a very neat feature because it allowed for more adam to be collected and a side event where you guarded her while she harvested. It made the player feel more attached or closer to the little sister. Bioshock 2 also added a new boss ""The Big Sister"". She was a very nimble close range character. She was able to collect adam and she could appear at random times. *minor spoiler alert* [/spoiler] The Big Sister was created to keep the little sister away from the big daddys, this was interesting because it gave the player a real reason to really kill her besides ""shes hurting me I'll just hurt her back"" [/spoiler] They also added new big daddys. All in all this was a good title for the gameplay but the story was definently not as good as the first or infinite. It's definently worth the 19.99 price tag it has.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Look, I love Bioshock, that much is clear.  This franchise awakens me to the dystopian genre, albeit very different universes, to  the Half Life franchise in a certain way.  It is, as you probably know, linear, and the story is clear and interesting.  Bioshock 2, although not visually stunning as Infinite, utilizes gameplay mechanic and storyline in a brilliant manner, and begrudgingly I admit this may be my favorite game of the entire franchise for both story and mechanics.  Quite brilliant game, given how cheaply you can acquire it.  Without reservation I recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's very hard to find a game with such compelling ideals, philisophies and idealogies. This review is not so much a reflection of what how the game function but more about what it provides for the gamer. Bioshock 2, is indoubtly one of a prime classics in our gaming generation of today, if you haven't picked it up yet I highly reccommend doing so. No spoilers here but, the game takes you on a journey and a mystery as you find yourslef constantly asking questions what happened to the rapture? why have the people gone mad? why, when, what, how? I'm writing from a perspective that seeks a game to be more of a game, rather an interactive, immersive narrative. Do graphics still matter to this day an age, some would argue however, none would say this is a shallow experience but rather it is a deep and enriching piece of art. Bioshock 2 will remain to be one of the pinnacles of innovative story telling, but that's just my own opinion, please pick up this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A continuation of the Bioshock series, Bioshock 2 puts you back in Rapture as a Big Daddy. A fun FPS with good dual wielding mechanics gorgeous and a great storyline. The experience was unfortunately tarnished somewhat by my initial playthrough when the game was still using Games for Windows Live (GFWL), and I lost my save approximately half-way through the game. I have since replayed it since it migrated to SteamWorks and the experience was far better, but not perfect, with several crashes during my playthrough.Unforunately the Multiplayer is somewhat dead, with little to no matches being played/hosted. However what I did play of it was enjoyable.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the game (although perhaps not as much as the original) and would highly recommend it to fans of the series, or newcomers if it's on sale.

Defending Little Sisters as they gather ADAM does get old: in general, too many instances of “stand and fight for a set time”.

												Big Sister knows bestBioshock was a wonderful game (5/5) and BIOSHOCK 2 is no less an achievement. 2K have taken all the elements that made the original so great and have tweaked them in all the right ways to make the second game even better than the first. The inventive story behind Rapture is further developed and the weapons, combat, hacking, and upgrade progression have all been improved. The various classes of hysterical splicers still wander around chattering hilariously to themselves and several new enemies have been introduced to add range to the combat. The plasmids and weapons have been improved and you can now wield both at the same time (although you can’t use them simultaneously -- that would make things too easy). The voice acting remains excellent as does the writing, and the story of Rapture is wrapped up nicely in an unusually poignant ending. A true AAA game -- highly recommended. 5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without a doubt,one of the best games I've ever played.The whole storyline made such a great impression to me,as well as the gameplay itself.Minerva's Den Dlc is also a really great addon to the story.The only thing I don't like at all,is themultiplayer.Not only there are no people playing it,but it's just boring.It just feels like there was another company working on the multiplayer part of the game.Conclusion: I really enjoyed playing this game,I recommend it everybody,but first,you better complete the first Bioshock,otherwise,you won't understand a lot.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DRA continuation of a famous sci-fi FPS.+ Fascinating story+ Variety of tools of destruction (Spear Gun FTW!)+ Plasmids+ Atmosphere+ Graphics+ Soundtrack- Gathering ADAM gets old pretty quicklyREVIEWBioshock 2 is the sequel to the innovative sci-fi FPS. It continues the story of the underwater city of Rapture.Several years after the events of the first game, a prototype Big Daddy called Subject Delta is brought back to life in order to find and rescue Eleanor, a Little Sister whom he is bonded with, from the hands of the Rapture's new leader, Sofia Lamb. Sofia is a psychiatrist who believes that only by sacrificing our egos can we make the Earth a good place to live. That is a polar opposite of what Andrew Ryan stood for. Like in the predecessor, there are many voice recordings to be found. Moreover, the gloomy atmosphere of the desolated Rapture combined with the colourful water depths compliments the game perfectly.The gameplay has not changed much – the goal is to complete the given tasks and harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters. There are more enemies and they are a bit more challenging. Feminists have finally been heard and Now there is a female counterpart to the Big Daddies – the Big Mommas Sisters (as if the female leader was not enough...). Moreover, a new mechanic has been added – being a Big Daddy, the player can choose to ""adopt"" a Little Sister and make her gather ADAM from corpses. The procedure is similar to the good ol' King of the Hill mode – the player has to protect the child while she is harvesting the precious substance. However, it can get old pretty fast.Speaking of additions to the game, there are new weapons and plasmids. For instance, there is a spear gun which I have grown to love (probably more than I should...). In terms of new plasmids, Scout comes to mind. This power lets you deploy a ghost projection that can use plasmids or hack devices. Bioshock 2 supports a variety of playstyles which adds to the replay value. There also is a multiplayer mode.To conclude, Bioshock 2 is a worthy sequel to the original. The combination of the fascinating story, great graphics, and a variety of choices makes it a marvellous title. P.S. Now, would you kindly check out my other reviews? http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/recommended/Bioshock review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/recommended/7670/Bioshock Infinite review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/recommended/8870/My curation page: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FVABot/curation ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game on the 360 when it came out back in 2010. I blazed through it in one night, and revisited the multiplayer once or twice. As a result, I didn't remember much about it. I got into PC gaming a few months ago when I built my first rig, and have really enjoyed it. In the spirit of nostalgia, I bought the Bioshock double pack during an Amazon sale, curious how the games would look on my new machine. So, I embarked on a back-to-back Bioshock playthrough, and I wasn't disappointed. Though the first game is spectacular, and one of my favorites, I found that I enjoyed the sequel far more. I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but bear with me. The mechanics are far more refined and enjoyable compared to the original game. Allowing the player to wield weapons and plasmids simultaneously in particular really spices up the gameplay. All of the weapons are fun to use, notably the trap ammunition. I also felt that the story was much more engaging, and had me more invested than that of the first game. Though the 'WYK' twist is certainly one of the best moments in gaming, it is both the high point, and most memorable story element from the first game. In Bioshock 2, the narrative is woven in a much more consistent manner. Everything you do has purpose, driving you towards your end goal. I didn't get this same feeling in the first game - areas seemed strung together, giving it a more level-based feel.I could extoll the virtues of this game for many more paragraphs, but the only way to truly appreciate it is with first-hand experience. Don't be deterred by those who paint this game as the cash-in middle child of the franchise. Sure, it didn't inject the series with a bunch of new mechanics, but that's not what the development team set out to do. They did, however, deliver a solid game that is worthy to sit on the shelf (or desktop) beside its more well-received siblings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Belated review. Building upon the fantastic gameplay and setting introduced in the original game, Bioshock 2 does an admirable job of continuing the story. The main knock against this game is that it isn't as revolutionary as the original. We've already seen most of what it has to offer, so there are no major revelations here. That said, sometimes there isn't anything wrong with ""more of the same"", especially if that ""same"" is as engrossing and polished as this. Rapture is just as cool as ever, and the gameplay is just as fun. If you loved the original, there is no reason not to give Bioshock 2 a few hours of your time as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another masterpiece The most appealing thing about Bioshock games is that they all unique and fresh. Nevertheless the game is developed by not Ken Levin's team, it's still nice and continues the story told in the first Bioshock succesfully without stupid cliches and unlogical plot twists. The game is very good, and this is proved by its replayability. Awesome! 10/10PS. Minerva's Den - not a bad arcade DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really underrated game. Story is OK, its nice to see how Rapture went and fall even more after the events of Bioshock 1. You get to know more about Little Sisters and Big Daddies, which personally think is very interesting. Plasmids are better than 1 but somehow I don't like them as a Big Daddy. I think it should be 100% daddy, more melee, more brutal, heavy weapons, the armor, etc. New weapons work perfectly but the plasmids... Its one of the things they couldn't take away from Bioshock1.Scenarios and maps are nice, again same as the first 1, city looks even more decadent, the places you look this tame are ""darker"" (like pediatry areas or a prison).Which is really interesting for me is how Infinity took a lot of stuff from this one. A LOT. Cultism, religious, the figure of a young girl as new messiah and savior, you (the player, the main character) as a devil who wants to break the community... Some places are the same, some DIALOGUES are even the same. I really don't know how infinity by being a good game took so many credit... and Bioshock, by being a good game is so underrated and forgotten.Play this gem			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Welcome back to Rapture! This was a fun play. For those who have played Bioshock, this is a no brainer. You need to get it. Here are some things to keep in mind. There is not a lot of new groundbreaking material, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. When the first game got so many elements right, this game just transferred those elements to this game. Atmosphere, combat, and finding upgrades and shinies are just as fun and interesting as the first game. Plus, you get to be a Big Daddy. Thats just awesome. The only slight downer is the story. It is not a bad story at all, but it does not contain the massive twist that the first game had. Instead, the reveal in this game just answers questions you may have had during the game. There are a variety of endings depending on how merciful or cold-hearted you are. I enjoyed my trip back to Rapture and I know I will be making a few more trips.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know what to say. This was a really good experience playing through this. The bonding between daughter and dad is really powerful seeing how the dad would do anything to save his daughter. The decisions you make during the playthrough will affect how your ending will be. The ending was kinda sad and happy (for me at least) and i almost teared. I'm hoping for another Bioshock series that features Eleanor after escaping rapture city.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's just start with looking back to first Bioshock which was by the way great gaming experience for me. Splendid idea of underwater city Rapture built with vision of free mind for artist/scientists and other types of creative people that might get limited by their surroundings in world, but not in Rapture.As all previous utopistic societies that went straight into hell - new genetic improvements so called plasmids enhances your physical/psychical abilities in cost of ruining your body and mind (as drugs). But as every addict - you want more... but supplies are limited, so you start thinking about taking some from the others. In Rapture there were two major fractions - people listening to Andrew Ryan (man who built this ""paradise"") and Frank Fontaine(Ryans rival). After civil war, city was in ruins and people who survived this became weak-minded mutants (splicers) demanding ADAM (genetic material for plasmids).In Bioshock 2 not much really changes from that - except city is more ruined and remaining splicers are uglier and desperate more than ever. Story of Bioshock 2 happens many years after first Bioshock. Power vacuum was filled with new visionary - Sophia Lamb.You play as Big Daddy (subject Delta) whom was taken a little sister (Eleanor) years ago. You wake up revived by vita chamber years after death. And because you are genetically bounded with your little sister, you must find it or you'll die.Your journey begins here...I must say I enjoyed discovering new locations, newly refined plasmids, improved combat system (now you can hold plasmid and gun simultanously) and mainly fact being a big daddy, that giant monster in metal diving suit wearing drill, rivet gun and all...Unlike first Bioshock, this one experiments with multiplayer and I must say it ended half-way to success. It have same atmosphere as Bioshock 1, game modes are fun, gameplay is challenging and entertaining same time, you have a lot of singleplayer elements here (hacking turrets, vending machines etc.), but lack of dedicated servers is biggest problem here and no matter how good gameplay you can offer, absention of dedicated erver bound with horribly coded network code ruins everything.And I don't even mention GFWL and so called ""DLCs"" with overpowered third gun upgrades, new maps that you could play only if everyone owned that DLC (almost imposible) - I had to struggle with that until I stopped play it from frustration. Finally after some time GFWL closed (hurray for that) Bioshock was moved to Steam platform with all multiplayer expansions for free to all! So I could finally play some nice multiplayer... until people stopped play it so much, well at least I had some quality games before that.It's a must have for every Bioshock 1 fan, but I would recomment it for people who likes interesting FPS shooters with some STORY (not pointing at any bad-story games (lies... lies..))One of the best games I ever played and that is a truth.

												This is a title that I really feel conflicted about and wish that there was a neutral vote instead of just positive or negative.If you played the first Bioshock, you will like this game.  It improves on the first game with a fresh story in which you play as a Big Daddy.  More weapons, more plasmids, more enemies help with this title.My biggest compliant is that the PC port is bugged and crashes too much.  Save files easily are corrupted and render this game unplayable to finish.  The bugs will even happen during Minerva's Den which is a nice DLC IF it works.Some people have gotten lucky with the fixes explained in the forum while others have not had the same luck.  For the simple reason that 2K games refuses to fix this game properly, I cannot give a thumbs up.If the game works for you and you can get it to run in DX 11, this is a great game that mixes FPS and RPG elements with a twisted story.

Lamb is insanely irritating, but provides for a good villain that's actually hated.Gameplay mechanics have been improved over Bioshock 1, you get more gameplay from Little sisters, and Big sisters are a nice way to test your skills (PS: Either know the trick, or be a frequent Vita Chamber customer).It's simply extraordinary!

												Excellent sequel but prepare for the bugs!The graphics look much better especially the faces, now they are really human (post-human) like and little sisters seem like little sisters, not some sort of ridiculous gnomes. The variability of splicers' appearance is not a deficiency any more. Lots of gameplay potentials have been included e.g.: flooded city, underwater moving, fixing bots, real opportunity of making decisions, brute splicers, controlling an other character, etc.They cut off some unnecessary and annoying things like tonic categories, nitro splicers, boring mini games of hacking however I missed the sound of the vending machines.Developers fixed almost every weakness of BS, except one: the faulty graphic engine. None of BS 1-2 ran correctly in full screen even after the latest patch (1.5.0.019 of BS2). Mouse click always switched them to windowed mode furthermore BS2 changed the aspect ratio to portrait (wtf?!) however I played it on a similar old pc on 4:3 aspect ratio. But the most annoying bug of BS2 is constant crashing. The game randomly crashes to Windows without any error message more than dozen times during a walkthrough. Contrary to unpatched versions it doesn't make walkthrough impossible but you have to save very frequently. I couldn't find any solutions for these bugs.Taken all around I liked to play it.

												Bioshock 2 is an older game now (nearly 4 years!) and has been reviewed many times; I'll repeat one thing that was common to a lot of those: If you liked Bioshock, you'll like Bioshock 2.  It doesn't have _quite_ as much impact as the former, largely due to the change of protagonist.  As Jack, even spliced up, you felt small.  Human.  Vulnerable.  There was a mile of freezing seawater between you and escape, and the lunatics had free run of the asylum... and drowning was something you would have no problem doing.  As Subject Delta (or, in Minerva's Den, Subject Sigma), you feel like a Big Daddy.  A little ponderous, but armoured, tough, and more than capable of beating a few splicers to death.The story isn't quite as brilliant either - in the first game, Rapture was new (to you), and everything was exploration of Andrew Ryan's ruined dream.  Well, in 2, Rapture is just as pretty, just as fascinating... but not quite as new.  There's a certain sense of familiarity for those who've played through the first game and spent quite a few hours in the slowly decaying city.  It's worth noting that as with the first game, the art assets for Bioshock 2 are stunning.  Post-apocalyptic art deco and water effects make for a feast for the eyes.Some of the new Plasmids (plus the ability to use guns and plasmids at the same time) make for some real fun, mechanically, and even if you're feeling like a nice, tough Big Daddy, the Splicers haven't been sitting still either.  There are some real challenges at the higher difficulty levels.Overall, if you don't have it, but have played Bioshock, get this game, and play it.  If you don't have it, and _haven't_ played Bioshock, get Bioshock.  Then get this game and play it. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had written a lengthy, verbose review for this game (before it was inexplicably lost), exploring the narrative genius of Irrational's Bioshock, and the monumental difficulty of crafting a sequel. Such a masterpiece was nearly impossible to follow up, but somehow, in some miraculous, ADAM-infused way, 2K Marin managed it. While the first game explored the downfall of objectivism, and the inner depravity of man, the sequel dives (literally) into the aftermath of the Randian utopia's fall, and the theocratic communism that replaces it. The viewpoints and goals of Bioshock 2's antagonist, Sofia Lamb, is diametrically opposed to those of Andrew Ryan (and Frank Fontaine), which lends this sequel a very different flavour. It remedies Bioshock's failings, however few, and improves upon one of the most versatile and satisfying gameplay systems ever concieved. Bioshock 2 is, truly, worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Bioshock Infinite first (never played a shooter before), and I have to admit that I couldn't get very interested in the story because I just found out how fun it was to shoot everything and how beautiful everything looked. Then I started playing the first, and I wasn't caught by the story either (this is me, im not saying it's a bad game or anything like it). And then I started this one and at first I thought it was kind of boring because being a BD didn't seem as interesting, but as I kept going I really liked the story, and yes, the levels are kind of tedious and repetitive -missions- but the story developes to a point where I didn't know what kind of ending I was going to get and I loved that.Yes, mine also crashed and gave me some simple bugs as, enemies getting stuck or things like that, so I had to keep TWO SAVES and constantly save in case the game failed. this is my favorite bioshock... u guys made me cry			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed this game quite a lotReasons to play: The plasmids and gun duo was a smart and enjoyable idea.Since your playing as a big daddy over time begin to adore the little sisters making you want to protect them more than in Bioshock 1 When i was at the end of the game i still didn't have all of the plasmids and upgraded weapons making it possible to take your time and become op or to truck through the game guns blazingThe story was well written and was enjoyableBack tracking is a thing of the pastAbout a 6-8 hour gameplayNever got a single crashThere is a frank fontain easter eggSo in conclusion Bioshock 2 is a hard game to put down So would you kindly play it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed ""Bioshock,"" it really was one of the best games ever made. So naturally, that meant I was looking forward to playing this game. And I was not disappointed. ""Bioshock 2"" really does manage to keep the fun of it's predecessor, and giving a good story to follow. Though at times, it felt like it was lacking. But I still played through it, and I got a satisfactory enjoyment out of it. I bought this game with ""Bioshock"" and ""Bioshock Infinite"", so after completing the first game, I jumped right in to this one.  The story is very heart wrenching, with an interesting theme, and it expands upon it's setting, while still maintaining the spirit of the first game.We return to Rapture in this game, eight years after the first game ended. And it looks worse for the wear. Having played the first game, I really felt some of the awe was gone from wanting to explore. But I still found it fun to see other places in Rapture that weren't in the first game, and I really enjoyed the aesthetics, how much of a novelty this city is. The game uses the same graphics from the first game, but it still keeps the setting looking very nice, and I liked how it incorporated underwater areas, which are very gorgeous to go through. The gameplay is relatively unchanged from the first game. This helps maintain the learning curve the first game had, making it easy for first-time and returning players to get into the game. I still enjoyed using the Plasmids, they're really nice. But I liked how you no longer had to switch from weapons to plasmids, as Subject Delta (the player character) can use both at the same time, which is a definite improvement. I also liked how you no longer needed to divide tonics into categories, giving you one full selection. Like in the first game, you could make Subject Delta your own character with your choice of Plasmids and Tonics to suit your own gameplay style. I tended to focus on hacking more, since I hacked a lot of stuff in this game.But what I really liked was that you were playing as a Big Daddy, allowing you to get a sense of what it's like being one. Whenever you adopt Little Sisters, you can either harvest them or take them with you to gather more ADAM or take them to an air vent and free them. However, the Little Sister defense got really repetitive for me, and more of an annoyance over time, but I really wanted that extra ADAM for more Plasmids and Tonics.The plot wasn't as predictable as I expected, and the game really turned up the morality to make it more meaningful in the long run. It still keeps it straightforward and never overcomplicates it with too much plot, like the first game. It no longer revolves around saving or harvesting Little Sisters. You encounter certain characters who have a connection to Subject Delta, and you get the choice to either kill them or let them live. This really affects how the final act of the game takes place. I also liked Eleanor Lamb, and her connection to Subject Delta in contrast to her connection to Sofia Lamb, giving a great theme of parents going to extreme lengths for their child's welfare. I really hated Sofia and her stupid ideas, and this game suceeds in the same place of making an extremely unlikable antagonist, it makes you keep going.I liked how they changed the hacking minigame, but it's still annoying, as you have to pay very close attention to the needle when it hits the right spot. The enemy variety is unchanged, but with the addition of the Brutes and Big Sisters. Both of them were extremely annoying, even after I got better weapons, plasmids, and ammo. But the Big Sisters, they add more of a risk to saving/harvesting the Little Sisters, and they make you really duck for cover before you fight them, so they do have a bit of a scare factor. And again, USE THE CAMERA! You'll need the research.I overall liked this game. It delivered what it promised, the setting still holds up, the gameplay is still easy to learn, and the plot is still kept pretty simple, and the morality is expanded upon to make it more meaningful. I was disappointed that the game didn't really have much else to offer, but it's still a good time. I intend to play this game again soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Originally posted on March 16, 2010 Bioshock 2 is the full fledged sequel to Bioshock, although at times it feels more like an expansion pack to the original...Gameplay-The gameplay of Bioshock 2 is largely an improvement over the original, with the player taking on the role of a Big Daddy prototype instead of Jack. Prototype is the operative word here, however, as with the exception of having a drill and clunky sound effects when moving or jumping, you never really feel like a big daddy. Splicers can often cause you large amounts of damage with small arms or melee weapons in only a few hits, which is very similar to the first game. I understand why this choice was made, for balance purposes, and I actually largely agree with it, but the feeling of being a clunking metal behemoth is never really there.However, on an overall level, the sequel makes several key improvements. simultaneous usage of plasmids and weapons make combat much more fluid and satisfying, and the introduction of new enemies (alphas, brutes, big sisters) and the revamping of old ones (spider splicers, rumbler daddies) really contribute to this. Also, the game feels a good deal harder than the original without sacrificing the ability to make gameplay choices, and this is partially accomplished by upping the ante of combat. Where before you would only see 2-3 splicers an engagement, in Bioshock 2 it is not uncommon to engage a brute or two and 3-4 leadhead splicers in the same area.The adopt/save/harvest mechanic with the little sisters works very well, allowing you to kill big daddies as before, and choose whether to a) harvest them right away b) have them gather ADAM for you and then harvest them c) save them right away d) have them gather and then save them. Obviously the best choice either way is to have them harvest ADAM from special corpses in the level first to get more ADAM, but this adds a great deal of moral and gameplay depth to the little sister dynamic. Plus, having the little sister ride on your shoulders and comment on combat as you go along is at times hilarious, or just cute, and a little sad. A very nice touch. Messing with the little sisters angers the big sisters, who often come for you after you've dealt with most of the little sisters in the level. They serve as improvised and random boss-fights, and are most definitely a challenge. They add a new source of tension (and ADAM) to the Bioshock formula.Another gameplay change is the revamped Plasmid and Gene Tonic system. Plasmids at higher levels (2,3) have differentiated visual and gameplay effects, such as being able to charge up for more powerful attacks and shoot streams of elemental damage. They add a great deal of gameplay variety and re-playability. In addition, gene tonics are now all organized into one large slot, a welcome change, and some new ones have appeared that cover multiple effects, such as the elemental gene tonics. Finally, research remains useful but has been streamlined with a few minor tweaks.Finally, the much touted ocean underwater sequences remain a pretty but relatively gimmicky and useless area of gameplay, where you are basically placed in a tunnel from one airlock to another. They are incredibly atmospheric, but they serve very little gameplay purpose other than scrounging.Visuals-Bioshock 2 is the full fledged sequel to Bioshock, although visually speaking it feels more like an expansion pack to the original. The game runs on the same engine as the original from 2007, and while innovations have been made in art design and level design, the same graphics remain largely untouched. The same low-res textures and effects are intact, and with the exception of new plasmid effects and a few minor tweaks, the technical graphics remain the same as they were in 2007. This is very upsetting, but it is an industry wide trend, and consoles are almost entirely responsible. Therefore, Bioshock 2 will not be penalized too harshly.Artistically, the game does not disappoint, and the sound effects that accompany these new designs create a great atmosphere for the city of Rapture that feels fresh the second time around. New posters, new music, new character models, new weapons, and new effects.Story-In addition, the story, which has received some flak from Gamespot and other websites, is surprisingly good, and the audio diaries continue a wonderful trend from the first game that add a great deal of back story to Rapture and the tale of Andrew Ryan that newcomers and especially fans of the first game will love. Phoebe Lamb is the near antithesis of Andrew Ryan, and just as villainous for it, which is a refreshing change of pace. The ability to kill or spare certain key characters and the fact that such choices actually do have an impact on the story really adds to the replay value here. While the plot lacks the ""holy s**t"" factor of the original, it is quite well written and acted, and really draws you in, Bioshock fan or not.Multiplayer/GFWL-The game also includes a full fledged multiplayer mode, which is pretty much all of the standard fps game modes you would expect, but from a Bioshock perspective. Throw in a Modern Warfare style leveling and unlock system and a surprisingly well integrated multiplayer backstory and you've got a very solid multiplayer mode. A very nice touch is the inclusion of specific characters with unlock able audio diaries, backstories and customizable appearances in lieu of traditional custom skins and models. They also have high quality voice acting for these avatars. A particularly nice touch is the in game player apartment, which serves as a front for a standard multiplayer menu, and gives us an incredibly atmospheric glimpse of life on the eve of Rapture's collapse. Various pieces of furniture and appliances serve as server browser, audio diary storage, loadout customization, avatar customization, and story introduction. In addition, there are a variety of maps, many of them revamped and cleaned up versions of locations from the first game which add a great deal to this atmospheric multiplayer.However, I have a bone to pick with Bioshock 2, and that is the forced installation of Games for Windows Live, without which you cannot save or load your game. Essentially you are tied to the service, which you are also forced to make an account with. This imposition is reminiscent of Ubisoft's recent DRM debacle and ties PC gamers to what is essentially Xbox Live for PC. I don't want this. Nobody wants this. I already have steam, why should I be forced to install GFWL? A small upset, maybe, but an important one.Ultimately, Bioshock 2 takes the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" approach as a sequel, with some important and welcome exceptions. It doesn't blow my mind as the first one did, but it does do a great deal right, and with a few exceptions it makes very few unwelcome changes. It's a great game and a must buy for fans of the first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, Bioshock 2. The scrawny, overlooked middle child of the Bioshock franchise. Neither the adrenaline-soaked action of Infinite, nor the dark, atmospheric journey of discovery of the original. Now that I've played it I can see why it was a let down for many. Here is an example of when worlds collide for the worst. The ability to wield the power of the Sith in one hand and the power of the Terminator in the other does not suit the dreary tromp through Rapture's half flooded tunnels. It's an action game in a horror setting, where the action overwhelms any sense of dread, knowing that whatever pops around the corner will find themselves just another red smear on the soggy carpet in the blink of an eye. Writing is far weaker than the original. Sofia Lamb is a little more than Andrew Ryan, except she was found in the clearance aisle of Villains R Us. Like Ryan, she calls out your actions throughout the game, but never succeeds in getting under your skin. Minor villains come and go with no significant buildup nor payoff. The moral choice system is back, too. Just as useless as it was in the first game. Speaking of mechanics, playing as a Big Daddy turns the 'Little Sister Escort' level from the original game into a game mechanic, again with the ability to save or harvest them once their Adam collecting is done. The 'save or harvest' aka 'good or evil' mechanic was already pretty gimmiky in the original game and even more so now. Any player who pays any amount of attention to escorting Little Sisters will be positively swimming in Adam, without a single harvest. All in all, though, Bioshock 2 is still a worthy game, despite feeling more 'DLC' than 'sequel'. It does an admirable job of expanding upon the lore of the original game and fielded some new mechanics that would be refined and put to greater use in Infinite. Had it not need to follow in the footsteps of the original Bioshock it likely would have fared far better than it did. On the note of Bioshock Infinite, the similarities between Bioschocks 2 and Infinite are quite noticeable. Beyond the mechanics there's the father-daughter team, with the daughter as a support character, going up against a deluded tyrant insane with the goal of utopia. There's the insane religious dudes, the frustrated minority, sick of discrimination, and the painting of the protagonist as the harbinger of doom to a close-knit society. Get the feeling that, like Subject Delta, this game is a prototype. At least it's a fun one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The DLC ""Minerva's Den"" adds another small but good story to the game, and is what I would define as a surprisingly good DLC. Like the main game it comes with the occasional CTDs, which seems so very, very unnecessary.Bioshock 2 is nevertheless wholeheartedly recommended.

												I actually preferred the gameplay of Bioshock2 over the first bioshock.  I believe both stories are very strong, but Bioshock2's ending dissolves rather quickly and therefore, I believe the original Bioshock has a stronger story all around.  Both games offer a very seemless alternative steampunk universe which is amazingly creative and fun to think about.  Bioshock 2 has better graphics (if you can get the game to work without using the dx-9 launch option).  The biggest and best difference for me is the defensive segments in Bioshock2 which can be a lot of fun.  You are given as much freedom and time you want to set-up booby traps and ammo selection to give yourself a better shot at surviving a wave of enemies poised to kill you and the little sister you are protecting.

												Absolutely loved Bioshock 2! Following the first Bioshock, it takes an interesting turn putting you into the view of a Big Daddy rather than an outsider come into Rapture.

Beautiful scenery, wonderful controls and gameplay, and challenging enemies. What more could a gamer ask for?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I have to say that Bioshock 2 is a very lackluster sequel to the marvelous, original Bioshock. It's not that Bioshock 2 sucks. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. What it lacks most though, are improvements. Much of the game felt like an addon to the first Bioshock. There are new areas to explore and new weapons, but that's all that's new. You do get to dual wield plasmids and weapons, but as exciting as that sounds, it's not much of a departure from the first game. Fortunately, the strength of the original's story still resonates in its sequel. The plot is still captivating and there are still the twist and turns we've come to love as a fan of Bioshock. As for the multiplayer, all I have to say is that it sucks.Grade: B			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only complaint about BIOShock 2 was lack of support for control/gaming pads outright. Utilizing a licensed third party keyboard mapping software utility I was able to play the game with an XBox 360 controller with great results. After initial setup game play immediately submerses you into an atmosphere similar to other popular titles mixing technology with old world charm. The mission based game play is somewhat loose allowing time to hunt down items and develope player character skills much in the vein of free roam titles.I found the game playable, challenging and quite enjoyable at a general level slightly better than average. The title is somewhat the must have due to its franchise lineage and doesn't require much more than a familiarity with the first in the line to wrap your mind around direction and plot. Game play mechanics, graphics and general mood do well to hold the title together and should easily fill a good weekend bender for more skilled players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just finished my play through this game.

I literally dove right into it after beating the first one so things felt like they picked up instantly.  I wish there was more freedom to explore around or side missions and such.  But I understand that that is not what this game is about.On my scale of (Avoid--TBB (Try before Buy)--Play--Must Play) I give it a...Play!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just when you thought things couldn't get any more awesome, they do.If you loved the first Bioshock, you'll love the second (this) one.For those who want to start the series here, I would suggest going to the beginning of Rapture and then coming back to this one. While the storyline makes sense if you haven't played the first, it will be a complete picture if you play the first.More dystopia, more splicers, new baddies and a few different game mechanics.This game carries on from Bioshock and does a nice job of it. Starting from about the time Fontane was rising in power and Ryan in dismay, a new ""leader"" emerges. Dr. Lamb is quite the accomplished Psychiatrist. Her daughter, Eleanor is to be ""the one"" uniting force in this ""utopia"".You can kind of see where this is going, of course. Ryan had similar visions, albeit without a child as the visionary.You play a Big Daddy. Yes, those ""disgusting and ugly brutes"" as Tenenbaum would say.You are the hero but without spoiling too much more, it gets interesting. 2K did a great job in the latter stages of the story telling process and having Eleanor as a guide worked well.If you played the first one, you will notice some game mechanic changes.Keybinds may be wonky to start with but you will explode a rocket at your feet prematurely and accidentally. Well, at least I did.I found the keybinds didn't translate well from the first to the second game so, a little time mapping your keybinds from the first may fix all of that.The research is still there and is a little easier to manage. No longer do you have to switch your weapon from the camera, but now its a video. The more interesting it is, the more research points. There are 4 research stages. As soon as you get the camera, roll that video on everything you see. It helps later on.Hacking is no longer out of the live game environs so, take cover while hacking.Apart from that, have fun slaying the baddies and stay alive out there. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Did you like Bioshock? Then you'll like Bioshock 2! They're really rather similar. The biggest difference is that since you are playing as one of the first Big Daddies, instead of your options being ""rescue"" or ""harvest"" little sisters, your options are now ""adopt"" or ""harvest"", with adoption requiring you to either drop off the little sister at a port hole for a small amount of ADAM or you set them down near a corpse and defend them from splicers while they gather ADAM for you. I'm a nice guy with a thirst for ADAM so I saved all the little sisters and gathered all the ADAM that I could, so I spent a lot of time fighting off splicers.I played on medium difficulty, and maybe I'm spoiled from recently replaying Bioshock on easy, but Bioshock 2 seems significantly more difficult. You can't carry as many health kits as you could in the first game, and I seem to remember the first one auto-using health kits when your health bottomed out until you ran out of kits. No such luck this time. The tradeoff they made here is that every weapon can be used for a melee attack, rather than having to switch to the melee weapon, which in this game is a massive drill.Now in Bioshock, the melee weapon was traditional Irrational Games wrench. With the electric jolt plasmid (the first plasmid in the game), and the wrench (the first weapon in the game), you could almost beat it without picking up a single other weapon. It was a super effective combo that only got better with support tonics. You have no such luck in Bioshock 2. In fact, as massive drills go, it takes a couple support tonics to make it feel like it's doing some real damage. It's kind of a bummer.The plasmids got a healthy balancing. Winter blast is far more useful than I remember it being in the first game, and even insect swarm is more fun! I didn't really use some of the less hands-on plasmids, like decoy, or scout, or hypnotize. You get the same eight slots for them as in the first game. The tonics are better handled this time too, with no distinction being made between them. You just get a number of slots and you can fill them with whatever tonics you like without regard for their purpose. A lot of them return from the first game, with a handful of new ones suited for the changes in weaponry. Wrench lurker became drill lurker, and what not.There's another for getting all of the weapon upgrades, and towards the end I was beginning to get nervous because I had a lot of upgrades unfulfilled but I found them all regardless. Apparently you won't get every weapon up to full upgrades by the end of the game, so you should be choosy with what weapons you want to use. The game has a nasty habit of giving you a new weapon right after you've come across an upgrade station, and that kind of sucks because you can't un-upgrade a weapon and then use that upgrade station on the new gun.Hacking has changed for the better, unless you've got slow reflexes. Instead of being a game of pipe-dream, it's a simple needle that goes back and forth and you just need to hit the A button when it's over a green section. Sometimes you need to hit a number of green slots to succeed, and if you hit a red slot you set off the security systems, and if you hit a white slot you take damage. It's easier and faster than the first game, and from the start you're given a tool to hack machines from a distance, which replaces the need from the first game to shock them with electric jolt and then run up and hack them.If you've liked Bioshock, this one's a no-brainer. It's more of the first game, but better, with only a little cognitive dissonance from making a sequel to a game that wasn't made to have a sequel. If you didn't like Bioshock, you probably won't like Bioshock 2. It doesn't change enough from the original formula to make it a different game. If you never played the first game, I'd recommend going through it before hopping on Bioshock 2. It's a fantastic game, it's cheap, and Bioshock 2 basically assumes you played the first game and doesn't make an effort to explain the world of Rapture again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Purchased at $5There's no denying that its a stunning game, visually. In fact its probably the most colorful FPS in recent years. Dont sit too close though, or all that saturation will hurt your eyes.The gameplay has definitely been improved. Dual wielding is very nice, the weapon selection is much more pleasing, and your Big Daddy character has some new moves and better melee.Beyond that....everything else falls short. Audio is bugged I think. I know its supposed to sound like you're in a fishbowl helmet, but that doesn't mean that weapon fire and explosions should randomly go completely MUTE. I spent 2 hours searching for a solution and....nothing.The story completely lost me after just 30 minutes. I couldn't bring myself to care at all. You will have a neat ally at the end of the game, however...*Edit*GFWL was removed and this game was reborn on steam with free DLC for all existing owners. I heard Minerva's Den was good but I'm getting a lot of annoying crashes these days, and I don't care to try and diagnose the issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing the first game, the return to rapture was simply amazing, the new rapture, ten years after the events of the first game, looks as beautiful, mysterious and dangerous as ever. The story and the history of the Rapture universe were and are very well writen, there's even background story in the multiplayer characters, how dedicated is that. Even though I missed the characteristic plot twist of Ken Levine's stories, it felt like a bioshock game. Well, awesome single player, as good as the first one, awesome series and awesome multiplayer, all in all, AMAZING game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never loved such a storyline as good as BioShock 2. You know that feeling when you finish an amazingly good game, book, or movie? Yeah, I rarely get that from any game. Not this one though. There's this term called ""post-game depression"", and that's what I got out of it. I'll be okay tomorrow, but in the back of my mind, this series is the first to make me feel this euphoria.7/7*tips fedora*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The scavenging system was awesome, i used to play alot of mmo's so sometimes i found myself just wondering around collecting goodies. There are also tape recordings you can collect all over the city that tell small tales from rapture.The story is about a father trying to get his daughter back from her evil mother (Sofia lamb) who is the ruler of the underwater city you are all trapped on called Rupture. The people of the city see Sofia as some sort of prophet and try to stop you from getting your daughter back. You also have to fight through big daddys and little sisters who are experiments from the scientists of rupture and very difficult compared to the normal enemies, you have to constantly upgrade yourself to defeat them. The weapons are great, each weapon has 3 different ammo types you also have many traps you can set. Besides weapons you can purchase genetic upgrades which give a range of powers most essential to finishing the story. I bought this game as the trilogy and started off with number 2 as i thought number one was really old sometimes i dont like the graphics or mechanics ( i was wrong), as soon as i finished 2 i went back to the original bioshock i just needed to know how this story started and now i am hooked on the whole trilogy cant believe i missed these classics !! Well honestly get this game it has just been remastered i will download and play again cant wait .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""In 1968, the very first Big Daddy created by Andrew Ryan finds himself in a struggle for survival against the city of Rapture and its newest martyr, Sophia Lamb"".This game will make you use your brain cells to figure out all of the details hidden in its story. They once again present us one of the greatest stories in the gaming history.The improved gameplay makes the game much more intuitive. It feels like the game is shorter than the first one. But you have multiplayer to have fun with, too.I recommend you to buy the trilogy.8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I go any futher I have played and beaten this game on the Xbox 360 many times.One of the first games to really grab my attention and focus for such a long time.I got this game on the PC due to the xbox 360 acting up at a time I wanted to play this game.Story and graphics are some of my favorites along with the concept of the game as well. I enjoyed escorting the little sisters and defending them.IMO this game was in some parts better than the first in the series and still holds up well against Bisoshock Infinite.Each had there good parts that I enjoyed and will continute to come back too.Note: I have played all the Bioshock games on console before gettig the few on PC.

												Bioshock 2 stays relatively similar to Bioshock 1 in the playstyle, environment (Rapture), enemies, and plasmids while bringing in quite a few cool new elements. First of all, in Bioshock 2, you play as a Big Daddy. I'm not going to say too much more about the story as it would lead to spoilers, but the story is quite compelling to follow. In terms of pure enjoyment, Bioshock 2 was just slightly less enjoyable than Bioshock 1 because being a Big Daddy was kind of annoying when you hear a grunting noise every few seconds and when you jump and land.My one problem with Bioshock 2 was that it started crashing a lot as I got further and further into the game. I got into the habit of quicksaving every minute or so in order to not lose progress so it was still bearable. But aside from the crashing, Bioshock 2 is a VERY fun game to play and is just and incredible continuation of Bioshock 1 in another area of Rapture. I know this review is pretty disorganized and jumbled, but if you are to take anything out of this, Bioshock 2 is worth playing.Rating: 9.1/10Recommend Price: Any Price because it is that good			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I have to say that Bioshock 2 is a very lackluster sequel to the marvelous, original Bioshock. It's not that Bioshock 2 sucks. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. What it lacks most though, are improvements. Much of the game felt like an addon to the first Bioshock. There are new areas to explore and new weapons, but that's all that's new. You do get to dual wield plasmids and weapons, but as exciting as that sounds, it's not much of a departure from the first game. Fortunately, the strength of the original's story still resonates in its sequel. The plot is still captivating and there are still the twist and turns we've come to love as a fan of Bioshock. As for the multiplayer, all I have to say is that it sucks.Grade: B			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While getting flak for being the worst of the bioshock series, it's still a wonderful game on it's own. I play games mostly for the story, so look at other comments for the action, but the mechanics are still fun and didn't bore me. The story itself was not as good as bioshock 1's, but it was different, and much more touching. Throughout the entire game you feel like you have a purpose, and truely want to do the tasks, unlike bioshock 1, which was more just 'go do this' (albeit for well described reasons). The good ending was very touching, and had one of my favorites quotes from a videogame ""Utopia is a people, not a place"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 stays relatively similar to Bioshock 1 in the playstyle, environment (Rapture), enemies, and plasmids while bringing in quite a few cool new elements. First of all, in Bioshock 2, you play as a Big Daddy. I'm not going to say too much more about the story as it would lead to spoilers, but the story is quite compelling to follow. In terms of pure enjoyment, Bioshock 2 was just slightly less enjoyable than Bioshock 1 because being a Big Daddy was kind of annoying when you hear a grunting noise every few seconds and when you jump and land.My one problem with Bioshock 2 was that it started crashing a lot as I got further and further into the game. I got into the habit of quicksaving every minute or so in order to not lose progress so it was still bearable. But aside from the crashing, Bioshock 2 is a VERY fun game to play and is just and incredible continuation of Bioshock 1 in another area of Rapture. I know this review is pretty disorganized and jumbled, but if you are to take anything out of this, Bioshock 2 is worth playing.Rating: 9.1/10Recommend Price: Any Price because it is that good			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: September 13, 2014
												So after a five day binge play of the BioShock franchise, here are my thoughts about the second installment. And though I'm going to recommend this title, I want to caveat the fact that it is by far, the worst in the franchise. It's well worth picking up on sale due to the fact that its story line reflects on the other two titles, but not worth it's asking price. Lets get into why....I was warned by a friend that this game was sub par to the original BioShock, but at first blush I was confused as to why. It looked like a vast improvement, with brushed up graphics, new weapons, new enemies, and the ability to play as a Big Daddy. All things that should have made this a block buster game, but are handled so poorly that in the end it actually leaves you very disappointed. Where to start..... The brushed up graphics at first seem to be a big improvement over the original. They fix one of my gripes about the first game with plenty of new Splicers, each with different voices and outfits, they even added new types of Big Daddy. The problem with this is that you eventually notice that what they've done is remove the glassy, 40s stylized look from the first game, and made everyone look more ""realistic"". This is a huge disappointment, as it damages the mood the first game set and the surreal look, setting Rapture as far away from ordinary as a city at the bottom of the sea should be. And though they did an alright job making the Splicer's look deformed, it's not the same feeling from the first game where things were bulbous and misshaped or looked out of a 40s pulp comic. The Big Daddy suffers from this problem too as they even out its proportions and turn the Little Sisters into just normal girls with headlamps for eyes.Weapons are improved from the first game, with things like a rivet gun, .50 Cal, drill, things a Bid Daddy would carry. However, these guns seem to pack less than the punch you would expect. Splicers are brutal and manage to eat tons of rounds with only hits to the head seeming to do anything. Rather than hacking like the first game, they give you a wrist mounted tool, that fires remote ""tubes"" that allow you to hack from a distance. This sounds amazing till you discover they nerfed the hacking  from the tube puzzle, to a Pre-Skool metronome color match game. This does nothing to solve my gripe from the first game, where hacking stops being a challenge and becomes a chore that you dread. And to remove ANY challenge from this process is worst of all, patronizing the player and making it more busywork. Ammo is dropped in a frustratingly random way, always seeming to give you rounds for every gun but the one you need, and the first half of the game is so stingy with drops that you will run into the red if not out of almost every round by the time they toss you up against your first boss. Money is also unbalanced, leaving you dry when you most need it, and like BioShock, the limited wallet space is so annoying that it makes you want to punch a kitten in the neck. Also, the game seems to throw a lot of ""junk"" at you in boxes and dead splicers, that seem to do nothing! In the first game, drinks, smoking, and eating would give you bonus and detraction in stats depending. But in this game, you get swamped with odd food items, tons of drinks, and random objects that flash by you so quickly that you really have no idea what they do or what they're for. You find yourself slamming the ""loot all"" button and pray that it's doing something beneficial.Next, is the fact that you're playing as an original design Big Daddy, or Delta series. Naturally, this unique and should be an enjoyable adventure, but sadly it isn't. And why? Because for some reason I can't seem to figure out, you are as weak as wet toilet paper. Yes, the massive Big Daddy from BioShock, that can kill you in one shoulder charge, is reduced to something a Splicer can kill with some errant gun fire. And don't give me the excuse that it's because he's and older model, as the game shows in the open that he can crush Splicers with hardly a thought, but once the game starts, all that power is gone. In fact, it feels like you have LESS health than the protagonist from the first game! This is utterly insane. As a Big Daddy, I should be able to swat Splicers like flies, and of course, the other Big Daddy have no problems doing this, yet even though Delta uses Plasmids as well as eight unique weapons, he's still weaker than just about everything. And this really blows, because they could have pulled a huge contrast to the survival aspect from the first game, by utilizing the massive size and armor of the Big Daddy to wade through huge amounts of smaller enemies and larger, more brutal ""boss"" situations. That's not to say it's all bad, as you can ""adopt"" Little Sister's from fallen Big Daddy and protect them as they collect ADAM from bodies littered around Rapture. This is rather enjoyable, and creepy as the Little Sister's vocalizations are just bizarre. Another glaring problem with this game is the plot.... The story line to this game, in a word, stinks.... except in winter, when it stinks on ice... It makes little sense, and doesn't do a damn thing to try and sell it to you. The concept is beyond weak, where a character magically shows up to take over after Ryan and Fontaine are dead, and SUPRISE, is an integral part of Rapture though no one deemed her important enough to mention in the first game. And believe me, this woman is so utterly annoying that you'll want to drip poison into your own ear, rather than have to listen to a single word Sofia Lamb has to say. If the first game was trying to covertly extol the Communist agenda (which it didn't), Lamb picks no bones about being a tree hugging, collectivist, self serving, commie pinko ♥♥♥♥♥. This woman is the thing that never shuts up, and she verbally assaults you non stop through the ENTIRE GAME. And truly this is a major problem, because again, all the updates in the graphics department can't save a game with faulty plot. Another huge problem is, after making Delta out to be some long lost dare devil that stumbled onto Rapture they simply drop any explanation of his back story, and even worse, kills him at the end for NO APPARENT REASON! Can you say poor plot device?! Somehow I feel if they hadn't wasted time building a crappy PVP Multi-player mode where adolescent boys can cross♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and brag about how many kills they have, we would have had a more rich single player story. With all that said, there are some very good points about this game that in a way save it. Again, despite the realistic graphics, Bioshock 2 still manages to build a fantastic mood, with some of the visuals giving me chills. There is a large glass window that overlooks the ruins of Rapture that simply made my blood cold, as well as a fantastic scene of a ""Rosie"" Big Daddy doing something other escorting a Little Sister. There was also a great section where you got to see out of a Little Sister's eyes, where Rapture appears to still be a heavenly place filled with satin drapes, pillows, and rose petals. Sadly, this is mismanaged as well, seeing as the scene is short and serves no more purpose than to be a gimmick to extend the ending. They also do a great job on making you feel Delta's weight, as the floors creek, jumping is limited, and movement slow and methodical. Plasmids are improved and bugs fixed, but again it seems you use the stun ability of the Electric Plasmid more than any other. Voice acting is again is phenomenal despite Lamb, though the mapping suffered because the game is formatted for console rather than PC. To summarize, the game has many faults and at times feels unworthy of being the successor to the original, but still manages to be a good play at the right price. However, if 2K ever decides to pull a mulligan, this game deserves it far more than the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Take BioShock 1, cut the fat and tone down the preachy themes a bit, and you'd get BioShock 2.If that's not enough of a review for you, then I'll say that I enjoyed 2 much more than 1, despite 1 having a much better narrative and a bigger impact on me, in terms of FPS games. BioShock 2's gunplay feels incredibly liberating as you are no longer required to switch from weapons to plasmids - you have one in each hand at all times. BioShock 2 may feel like more of the same, but it's a great game that deserves to be played. BioShock 1 had a better storyline, but BioShock 2 is just more fun to play.Of course, when you factor in Minerva's Den, BioShock 2 is even more fun to play than BioShock 1. You should really play both to enjoy the story to the fullest in both games, however.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only complaint about BIOShock 2 was lack of support for control/gaming pads outright. Utilizing a licensed third party keyboard mapping software utility I was able to play the game with an XBox 360 controller with great results. After initial setup game play immediately submerses you into an atmosphere similar to other popular titles mixing technology with old world charm. The mission based game play is somewhat loose allowing time to hunt down items and develope player character skills much in the vein of free roam titles.I found the game playable, challenging and quite enjoyable at a general level slightly better than average. The title is somewhat the must have due to its franchise lineage and doesn't require much more than a familiarity with the first in the line to wrap your mind around direction and plot. Game play mechanics, graphics and general mood do well to hold the title together and should easily fill a good weekend bender for more skilled players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The storyline in this game is really interesting, and creepy. I had a blast playing this game all the way through. I tried it on easy mode to start, but I think it's totally replayable on the harder modes now that I have finished. Love the plethora of weapon types you get, and the controls are easy to get used to on the PC. I would recommend reading up on the story of Bioshock 1 before starting this, or playing it 1 first because it definitely ties in. If you are looking for a heavily story based game with lots of action this is a good pick!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fits in well with Ken Levine's over-arcing plots in Bioshock 1 and Infinite also and ties up a few interesting loose ends in Rapture while letting you experience the world from a few different perspectives.

												I know many people hate bioshock2 for some unknown reason saying its the worst of all 3 titles I personaly dont think so. Yes the story is less interesting in this part than in 3rd or 1st, but lore in video games is like storytelling in porn movies its expected to be there and expected to be good but its not what defines the game as good or bad, and gameplay of bioshock 2 surpasses 1st and 3rd games. First of all plasmids and weapons can now be used as traps which makes game much more interesting in my perspective, then u can use your plasmids in different ways like spray enemy with fire or throw a fireball, compared to bioshock infinite which has 8 plasmids with no additional functions here u have 10 with a second function available. Then gene tonics are also much more varied and give u more optionsAnd finaly map desighn is better than in overrated infinite			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A much better game than the first one, despite being less exploration-based.  Also has many fewer issues with WIndows 7.+ Graphics look pretty much the same as the original.  The humans look a lot better, though.+ Much better gunplay.  Same amount of weapons, but this time, you can dual-wield them with plasmids.  The melee weapon is a drill, and it's actually useful to the point where you could play the entire game dashing and smashing ♥♥♥♥ing everything.  The pistol is now a more powerful rivet gun, the tommygun is now a gatling gun, the single-barrel shotgun is now a supershotgun, etc. Switching between plasmids is a bit of a chore.+ Better, faster hacking mechanics that didn't feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥- Levels aren't as expansive as the original.  They're more linear, which I didn't mind, but it might be a deal-breaker for some.- There are still a few issues with the port, especially in Fontaine Futuristics where I had the game crash many times.  This time, thankfully, your keybinds don't get wiped.- The FOV thing still happens.  Not that terrible since you can use a keybind to set your FOV, but it still happens when you zoom in with the speargun.- Game's easier than the original, partly due to the better guns. Again, it's a console shooter.- No final boss this time, just a final wave of enemies.  I wouldn't mind having Big Daddy Sinclair be the final boss, with more attacks and more health.If you liked the first Bioshock, get this one too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had plenty of time to enjoy the Bioshock and Bioshock 2 series in the past week. I did not skip through the content like it was there for no reason, I've listened to audio logs, opened every chest in game and tried to kill everything that needed killing. I had a blast with Bioshock 1. Smooth experience, no crashes and an overall satisfaction. The end of Bioshock was kinda if-y but hey it was a really good game. Now what can I say about Bioshock 2? Well it was a great game, to be honest I liked the mechanics more than the first part and the story was so intense and beautiful that I got sucked into it and finished the game in 2 days. I will strongly suggest if you haven't played bioshock series to play do so.Now the problems with Bioshock 2.... O My F%#@*! GOD ! ! !First of all I had to spend quite some time figuring out a way to start the game since it was not loading at all and after a two days of brainstorming and forums-searching I found nothing. Then I've decided to delete it and re-install + the already unavailable Games for Windows Live and somehow, somewhat it started.The first 15 minutes of the game were awesome and suddenly CRASH ... like what ?!? Ok no problem I re-started the game and ... nope you've guessed it no auto save every 5 minutes or so, had to start from the beggining. This kept happening until I finished the game, every other hour or so I was getting a crash with no error message, no NOTHING. I did read some forums and tried all the turn off DX10 thing and resolution change and logs and well nothing helped. What I'd strongly reccomend is make QUICK SAVE on a keybind that you will be using atleast every 5-10 minutes, otherwise if you get sucked into the game and forget to save it it will return you back at your last auto save (which is either the beggining of the mission or a very important transition) and believe me after a while it gets frustrating (A LOT!!!).The game is intense if played on the right difficulty, the story is incredible and a good ending to the Bioshock series but the CRASHES are terrible and made me thing of leaving this game. Just finish it and I hope you don't have the same issues as I did but hey its the same thing, different pc :) (Windows 8.1 btw and my machine is really strong)Hope you enjoy the game and I wish it is a crash free experience for you :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An old Big Daddy.So he's weak then?On the contrary, he is one of the powerful (later on).Atmosphere, water effect when it drops on your helmet is freaking gorgeus.Weapons are plentiful and a nice change of pace to the first one. Although, shotty isn't as cool as the one on the first game.Graphics are revamped and you can actually play multiplayer and it's actually fun (granted you have some friends to play with).So come on by and visit Rapture once more!

I think the story isn't as good as the first, but the gameplay is certainly a lot better (especially being able to dual wield plasmid and weapon instead of switching back and forth), and now that this version has controller support, I like it even more. Unfortunately the online seems to be dead, but I had fun with it while it lasted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""In 1968, the very first Big Daddy created by Andrew Ryan finds himself in a struggle for survival against the city of Rapture and its newest martyr, Sophia Lamb"".This game will make you use your brain cells to figure out all of the details hidden in its story. They once again present us one of the greatest stories in the gaming history.The improved gameplay makes the game much more intuitive. It feels like the game is shorter than the first one. But you have multiplayer to have fun with, too.I recommend you to buy the trilogy.8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I go any futher I have played and beaten this game on the Xbox 360 many times.One of the first games to really grab my attention and focus for such a long time.I got this game on the PC due to the xbox 360 acting up at a time I wanted to play this game.Story and graphics are some of my favorites along with the concept of the game as well. I enjoyed escorting the little sisters and defending them.IMO this game was in some parts better than the first in the series and still holds up well against Bisoshock Infinite.Each had there good parts that I enjoyed and will continute to come back too.Note: I have played all the Bioshock games on console before gettig the few on PC.

												Boy o boy, where to start with this game.Some adore this fine gem and some does not.I am one of those that do praise the fineness of this game.You play as Herr Delta, who is he? An old Big Daddy.So he's weak then?On the contrary, he is one of the powerful (later on).Atmosphere, water effect when it drops on your helmet is freaking gorgeus.Weapons are plentiful and a nice change of pace to the first one. Although, shotty isn't as cool as the one on the first game.Graphics are revamped and you can actually play multiplayer and it's actually fun (granted you have some friends to play with).So come on by and visit Rapture once more! Big Sis awaits you here.P.S Pssst... I heard you can drill the ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The scavenging system was awesome, i used to play alot of mmo's so sometimes i found myself just wondering around collecting goodies. There are also tape recordings you can collect all over the city that tell small tales from rapture.The story is about a father trying to get his daughter back from her evil mother (Sofia lamb) who is the ruler of the underwater city you are all trapped on called Rupture. The people of the city see Sofia as some sort of prophet and try to stop you from getting your daughter back. You also have to fight through big daddys and little sisters who are experiments from the scientists of rupture and very difficult compared to the normal enemies, you have to constantly upgrade yourself to defeat them. The weapons are great, each weapon has 3 different ammo types you also have many traps you can set. Besides weapons you can purchase genetic upgrades which give a range of powers most essential to finishing the story. I bought this game as the trilogy and started off with number 2 as i thought number one was really old sometimes i dont like the graphics or mechanics ( i was wrong), as soon as i finished 2 i went back to the original bioshock i just needed to know how this story started and now i am hooked on the whole trilogy cant believe i missed these classics !! Well honestly get this game it has just been remastered i will download and play again cant wait .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't actually recommend Bioshock 2 by itself. It's a superb Unreal shooter wrapped in mediocre level design and story. The gunplay is worthy of a sequel to Bioshock, but the story itself fails in one key point: making you care about the characters that occupy the world. Bioshock 1 had great pacing for introducing characters that seemed reasonable and slowly descended into the realm of madness as the game progressed - 2 just throws you into the madhouse and asks that you kindly shoot it up. There are tons of brilliant and unique ideas in Bioshock 2, but they're missing that master touch - it's like a poor imitiation without really understanding the reasoning behind the design decisions of the first game. I have no doubt that with another 8 months and a rewrite the game could've been stellar. If you really like the shooting, then by all means play the main campaign, but that's about all you're going to get from it.The multiplayer is dead nowadays, but it was one of the better Unreal experiences online when it launched since it relied on the excellent gunplay and plasmid mechanics of the campaign.The reason I am recommending this game (on sale) is because of the DLC. Minerva's Den is an excellent piece of design, in both level and story. It's a phenomenal experience and is convincingly alive in the world of Bioshock. Buy the game and DLC (again on sale) and play Minerva's Den. The pacing, writing, dialogue, and thought that went into it is worth of some real Bioshock material.

												After playing the first two games in the BioShock series and starting the third, I can honestly say I like 2 more. Gameplay and Customization: BioShock 2 managed to fix the clunkiness of its predecessor when it comes to shooting. It allows iron sights, which is awesome, and quick plasmid usage. The way this works it you have a weapon on your main hand and plasmid on your off hand at the same time. The variety of plasmids is also cool. The customization of BioShock games never cease to amaze me. Whether you want to be big badass Delta with a drill and offensive plasmids, or take a more subtle approach with the spear gun and stealthy plasmids, Bioshock 2 can provide such an experience. Hacking and Research: This game decided to simplify hacking. Instead of having to play a puzzle minigame like in BioShock, you now need to land the hack needle on green or blue zones, green successfuly completeing hack while blue doing the same plus giving a free item. The Research system was overhauled. Instead of taking pictures of the target to gain research, now you have to video tape them. To get the best possible research, one must kill the target using a mixture of weapons, plasmids, npcs or security bots. Story and Atmosphere:	 I don't understand why people don't like the story of BioShock 2. Though it doesnt follow Jacks life, which was clearly ended at the end of BioShock, its still pretty interesting.  The adventure of Delta and Sinclair on their way to save Eleanor was a great idea. They made sure to make you sad when you had to put down Sinclair. Also the endings are either sad of bad, there is no real happy one.  BioShock 2 does a great job in keeping the experience atmospheric, just like in the first game. Overall:	 This game is better than the first one. If you like any of the above features, its a must have. 10/10 would take fall damage to see Delta make a mini earthquake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had plenty of time to enjoy the Bioshock and Bioshock 2 series in the past week. I did not skip through the content like it was there for no reason, I've listened to audio logs, opened every chest in game and tried to kill everything that needed killing. I had a blast with Bioshock 1. Smooth experience, no crashes and an overall satisfaction. The end of Bioshock was kinda if-y but hey it was a really good game. Now what can I say about Bioshock 2? Well it was a great game, to be honest I liked the mechanics more than the first part and the story was so intense and beautiful that I got sucked into it and finished the game in 2 days. I will strongly suggest if you haven't played bioshock series to play do so.Now the problems with Bioshock 2.... O My F%#@*! GOD ! ! !First of all I had to spend quite some time figuring out a way to start the game since it was not loading at all and after a two days of brainstorming and forums-searching I found nothing. Then I've decided to delete it and re-install + the already unavailable Games for Windows Live and somehow, somewhat it started.The first 15 minutes of the game were awesome and suddenly CRASH ... like what ?!? Ok no problem I re-started the game and ... nope you've guessed it no auto save every 5 minutes or so, had to start from the beggining. This kept happening until I finished the game, every other hour or so I was getting a crash with no error message, no NOTHING. I did read some forums and tried all the turn off DX10 thing and resolution change and logs and well nothing helped. What I'd strongly reccomend is make QUICK SAVE on a keybind that you will be using atleast every 5-10 minutes, otherwise if you get sucked into the game and forget to save it it will return you back at your last auto save (which is either the beggining of the mission or a very important transition) and believe me after a while it gets frustrating (A LOT!!!).The game is intense if played on the right difficulty, the story is incredible and a good ending to the Bioshock series but the CRASHES are terrible and made me thing of leaving this game. Just finish it and I hope you don't have the same issues as I did but hey its the same thing, different pc :) (Windows 8.1 btw and my machine is really strong)Hope you enjoy the game and I wish it is a crash free experience for you :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrific gameplay, and the story isn't too bad either, but this one seems to have lost some of the thought-provoking qualities and originality that the original had (I know this seems obvious on its face, but it's worth noting that the originality of the first Bioshock was part of why it was such a great game). Overall, not as good as the first Bioshock, but still significantly above average in overall quality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not usually play FPS, but the Bioshock series greatly captivated me. It has unique design, greatm creative storytelling and addictive, RPG-like gameplay.Of the three parts, Bioshock is in my opinion the best. It has much better graphics, that really bring out the beauty and terror of the destroyed 40ies Art Deco underwater city rapture. It has the most charming characters IMO and the gameplay was streamlined, but everything that counts was still in there.If you enjoy exploration and good story and atmosphere, this game is a must.

												Took me 3 tries to get into Bioshock 1.  Turned out to be a very good game.  Bioshock 2, to me, was a lot easier to get into.  I held out  on playing this one because it didn't have controller support, but it was recently patched in when GFWL was removed.  Graphics are slghtly better than the first.  They can be improved by using the NVIDIA Control Panel for better AA and AF.  You can also improve the slow control responsiveness by altering the .ini file.  The game also has well-know sound issues.  This doesn't take away the fact that it's a lot of fun to play through.  You're a big daddy, and you will need to make the same choice of rescuing or ""adopting"" the little sisters.  I rescue them all to get the ""good"" ending :)  Plasmids and tonics still a lot of fun to play with, and finding all the recordings is essential to follow the story.  Rapture looks great!  All in all, recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game first up I didn't like it. quit 15 minutes in. However I sat down one day and decided to play it. I just finished it today. took me 3 days. the story was pretty awesome I had loads of fun. However it was more action pushed rather than its predecessor which was more close combat and horror.Over all i was impressed. The ending and the lead up to the end was great. HOWEVER... the multiplayer is completely dead. this was extremely dissapointing. No matter what you do. you will be sitting in a empty server for 30+ minutes and no one will ever join. And lets say they did ""Which they didn't"" you will need at least 10 people each game type at least. for most of the gametypes.basically I was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing disapointed. the multiplayer was simply looking really sweet. and its kinda dishearting that a AAA game like this could not have mutiplayer servers. basically its set up like PVP so you cannot serach or find in a list you just click a button and hope someone joins.

												While I do recommend this game, do not think that there are not some things that are less than acceptable =Story- The story is a bit more dumbed down then the first one. The gist of it is you’re a prototype Big Daddy who got resurrected and you need to find your little sister (now grown up). On your journey, you go through misadventure to misadventure. Overall, not the strongest out of the Bioshock seriesGameplay- Gameplay is more polished and improved from the first game. While there are very few new plasmids, the old ones are improved and have more development than the first game (For example, Electro Bolt at Level 3 can shoot a stream of electricity and chain lightning) Gunplay is also very fun, but some weapons are better left untouched at a Power to the People station than others. Overall, solid and entertainingGraphics- The models are a step up from the first game, now more polished and scary looking. Environments are similar to the first game, but with improved textures and a more abandoned feel. In sum, an upgrade from the first game.Control- The controls were fine. You can now duel wield a plasmid and a weapon. Switching weapons and plasmids in a fight could become tricky, but isn't a major fault that affects the game.Difficulty- Identical to the first game, with the added challenge of being limited to 5 medkits and 5 EVE hypos. Most of the time it’s a fair incline, but be prepared to gluttonously consume medkit after medkit during some fights.Polishes- Hacking is improved (Replacing long boring tube puzzles with quick button pressing) Plasmids are fun to use and they defiantly spice up the gameplay. Research is also more innovative, making the player contribute. Low Points- Games for Windows Live (GFWL) sucks. There, I said it. I recommend finding a way to disable it and adding -dx9 to launch options (Oh and stay away from multiplayer if you don't want a sour taste to be left in your mouth). Also, you can't go back to previous areas, so better scavenge the area well. Final Verdict: 7.5/10Bioshock 2 improves upon the first game (gameplay wise), making it more enjoyable to play. However, the games basic plot and lack of social/political commentary may leave some fans disappointed. If you want a game that improves upon the first gameplay wise, but lacks any real voice, I recommend this. Otherwise, it's best to save up $10.00 more to buy Infinite ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though it is the weakest of the series in my opinion it is still a great game and would recommend to anyone who's interested in the Bioshock series.That said this game has a nasty tendency to crash ALOT on PC and has some other weird quirks such as V-sync turns itself on automatically everytime you enter the game and DX9 mode which is seemingly stable causes an issue where certain particle effects cause the game to lag and it makes the game look noticeably worse (this is running an R9 290 on high settings).10/10 didn't have the wall safe glitch from Bioshock 1.

												I take my sweet time beating games. I savor every detail, and completely emerse myself in the environment that games have to offer. Bioshock is a series that rewards this more than almost any other videogame series on the market. On average, games can take me several months up to even a year to complete. From start to finish, this game took me two days to complete. Not because it was a short game, and not because I didn't savor it like normal. I became obsessed and found myself unable to focus on anything up until I beat it. Love is an understatement for expressing my feelings for this game, and the Bioshock franchise as a whole. To top it off, the support after the shutdown of GFWL was fenominal! I rushed out to buy Minerva's Den as soon as I had heard the news, only to find out that I had been given it for free. I cannot thank 2K enough for their amazing work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic, well put together game from start to finish. Your enjoyment will hinge on how much you liked the first BioShock, and how long it has been since you played it. I tried playing this game a while back right after I beat BioShock 1, and I just couldn't get into it. Fast forward a couple of years, and I really enjoyed it. For sure it suffers from ""more of the same"" syndrome, which is why my enjoyment increased exponentially returning to Rapture so long after playing the first game.I don't think the story is quite as compelling as the first game, but it's still excellent compared to most other games currently on the market. The graphics and sound are still amazing, and the level design is top notch.I did run into one ""stuck"" bug where a door closed behind me during a boss fight, and the boss was trapped in the room on the opposite side with no way for us to fight. Luckily, I had a save file I created just before the fight, so I just had to reload. Other than that, no other noticable technical issues plagued my experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of people say this is the worst in the series, but that just goes to show how amazing the series is because Bioshock 2 is a must-play game. I think the story isn't as good as the first, but the gameplay is certainly a lot better (especially being able to dual wield plasmid and weapon instead of switching back and forth), and now that this version has controller support, I like it even more. Unfortunately the online seems to be dead, but I had fun with it while it lasted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thought I'd post a review with the new ""coat of paint"" edition coming out soon (free if you already have the base game).First of all, the elephant in the room: technical issues. This game really suffers in this department. It's testament to how much I loved this game that I put in hours of diagnosis and ini tweaks to progress past the common crashes. I just hope the new edition will be addressing these, as opposed to just making it all look prettier. The game (and Bio 1) already looks pretty good in my opinion.Gameplay: The first few hours are very familiar and I can fully understand people bailing here thinking it's inferior to the first game. However, stick with it and you'll be rewarded in spades. The last three quarters of the game are just excellent. The ending I was given (and there are several) just killed me emotionally. I should probably state that I'm a father!Position in the series: I didn't really rate Infinite very highly. As polished as it looks, it's a hollow shell for me. Bioshock 1 will always be famous for *that* bit, but the ending was fluffed (subjective, obviously). I loved Bioshock 2 and can't wait to play it again soon, it's easily my favourite. The quality of Minerva's Den is the icing on the cake.Oh, and Big Sisters are freaky as hell!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If youre looking for the in depth story and complexity of bioshock infinite and bioshock 1, look elsewhere. However, if youre looking for an amazing shooter, this one is the best Bioshock by far.Infinite dissapointed me greatly because honestly, I dont really care about the story. The combat was ok but the fact that you could only have 2 guns at a time really killed it for me. Bioshock 1 is good, but compared to 2 its nothing. In 2, you really feel the power of being a Big Daddy. Using plasmids while firing a massive .50 cal machine gun and drilling holes in hordes of splicers is endless fun. Youre a massive walking tank, and you can destroy anything in your way.I will admit the storyline isnt as good as Bioshock 1 or infinite, but its decent. Nothing to complain about.Overall, if you liked the basic combat of 1 or infinite and want to take it a step further, or youre looking for a dark sci fi shooter, this is the game for you.

												Not as good as the first one, but still better than most other FPS in the market story and atmosphere wise. Pretty cheap out there and worth it for the main campaign. Didn't even bother with multiplayer, because really, Does every game really need multiplayer? There are hundreds of MP only FPS games out there, a lot of them FreeToPlay, why shoehorn elements into games that are really not needed?  Forget mass appeal, developers.  Concentrate on what your game does great and excel at it. The money will pour in on a single player game if you do it right. Not every title needs to compete with COD, or WOW, or any of the  major titles out there and what their hooks are. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Getting a lot of bash for being a cash grab after the success of Bioshock, this game adds it's spice to Rapture visit letting you play as a big daddy to drill people. Gunplay has been terrifingly improved, and hacking is now on real time. The story is also more personal, so you won't just feel like playing the giant epilogue that was the story of Bioshock 1. Also, Minerva's Den is great and included.Just don't expect to be wowed by the setting: that's Bioshock 1 specialty and duty.I recommend this game if you tought Bioshock could have better gunplay to be a better game.

												This entry in the BioShock series is, to me, a polarizing experience.Standing on its own, this game is incredible. The art design is absolutely mesmerizing, complemented with a sensual soundtrack and astounding voice work. The gameplay is quite intuitive as well; guns feel distinct and your entire arsenal is an equillibrium of diverse offense. Plasmids feel unique and the inclusion of traps allows for a meticulous, strategic approach when protecting Little Sisters' and their harvesting. BioShock 2 succeeds in these aspects, though it falters in others.Comparing this game with BioShock 1, however, proves much dissonance. While BioShock 1 provided enough backstory to support necessary explanation for things in the universe, BioShock 2 unloaded an excess- it feels forced, uninspired, and ultimately like fan fiction. The new information given in BioShock 2 doesn't mesh very well with what BioShock 1 established- the tone of the subject matter feels radically different between the two. The story of this game feels as though it lacks true progression of any sort, and ultimately hinders in pacing and character development. To make this game feel more as if it didn't belong in the main canon, it was entirely neglected in both episodes of Burial at Sea for BioShock Infinite- no mention of any characters, foreshadowing of any sort, and even entirely negates some of things established in BioShock 2.BioShock 2 is a love/hate game- on its own, it stands quite fine. When compared to BioShock 1, it feels entirely unnecesary and unfitting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, if you wanna check my thoughts on the first Bioshock check my ""review"". People always told me that Bioshock 2 was lame compared to the first one, they were wrong, atleast as far as I can tell. Of course the game takes a different aproach storywise since you play as a Big Daddy (YOU PLAY AS A FREAKING BIG DADDY!). And the story it's basicly the reunion of ""you"" and your ""daughter"", the story also gives some of what followed the fall of Fountaine and Andrew Ryan. I really liked the story and there's some parts in which the background is so beautifull! The soundtrack reamains particularly good and it just makes the game world come to life. Once more I have to complain about the combat, it just feels clunky to me but I guess that's just me. I have not played the multiplayer but overall I would say this is a pretty good game and I think it's kinda underrated. Still, I prefer the first one over this one, also considering it took me around 10 hours to finish the first one and about 6 hours to finish this one (according to Steam).

												Just when you thought things couldn't get any more awesome, they do.If you loved the first Bioshock, you'll love the second (this) one.For those who want to start the series here, I would suggest going to the beginning of Rapture and then coming back to this one. While the storyline makes sense if you haven't played the first, it will be a complete picture if you play the first.More dystopia, more splicers, new baddies and a few different game mechanics.This game carries on from Bioshock and does a nice job of it. Starting from about the time Fontane was rising in power and Ryan in dismay, a new ""leader"" emerges. Dr. Lamb is quite the accomplished Psychiatrist. Her daughter, Eleanor is to be ""the one"" uniting force in this ""utopia"".You can kind of see where this is going, of course. Ryan had similar visions, albeit without a child as the visionary.You play a Big Daddy. Yes, those ""disgusting and ugly brutes"" as Tenenbaum would say.You are the hero but without spoiling too much more, it gets interesting. 2K did a great job in the latter stages of the story telling process and having Eleanor as a guide worked well.If you played the first one, you will notice some game mechanic changes.Keybinds may be wonky to start with but you will explode a rocket at your feet prematurely and accidentally. Well, at least I did.I found the keybinds didn't translate well from the first to the second game so, a little time mapping your keybinds from the first may fix all of that.The research is still there and is a little easier to manage. No longer do you have to switch your weapon from the camera, but now its a video. The more interesting it is, the more research points. There are 4 research stages. As soon as you get the camera, roll that video on everything you see. It helps later on.Hacking is no longer out of the live game environs so, take cover while hacking.Apart from that, have fun slaying the baddies and stay alive out there. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I have to say that Bioshock 2 is a very lackluster sequel to the marvelous, original Bioshock. It's not that Bioshock 2 sucks. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. What it lacks most though, are improvements. Much of the game felt like an addon to the first Bioshock. There are new areas to explore and new weapons, but that's all that's new. You do get to dual wield plasmids and weapons, but as exciting as that sounds, it's not much of a departure from the first game. Fortunately, the strength of the original's story still resonates in its sequel. The plot is still captivating and there are still the twist and turns we've come to love as a fan of Bioshock. As for the multiplayer, all I have to say is that it sucks.Grade: B			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only complaint about BIOShock 2 was lack of support for control/gaming pads outright. Utilizing a licensed third party keyboard mapping software utility I was able to play the game with an XBox 360 controller with great results. After initial setup game play immediately submerses you into an atmosphere similar to other popular titles mixing technology with old world charm. The mission based game play is somewhat loose allowing time to hunt down items and develope player character skills much in the vein of free roam titles.I found the game playable, challenging and quite enjoyable at a general level slightly better than average. The title is somewhat the must have due to its franchise lineage and doesn't require much more than a familiarity with the first in the line to wrap your mind around direction and plot. Game play mechanics, graphics and general mood do well to hold the title together and should easily fill a good weekend bender for more skilled players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A decent length, and at the current prices, really worth it if you have a few extra bucks and are looking for a shooter with an actual story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just when you thought things couldn't get any more awesome, they do.If you loved the first Bioshock, you'll love the second (this) one.For those who want to start the series here, I would suggest going to the beginning of Rapture and then coming back to this one. While the storyline makes sense if you haven't played the first, it will be a complete picture if you play the first.More dystopia, more splicers, new baddies and a few different game mechanics.This game carries on from Bioshock and does a nice job of it. Starting from about the time Fontane was rising in power and Ryan in dismay, a new ""leader"" emerges. Dr. Lamb is quite the accomplished Psychiatrist. Her daughter, Eleanor is to be ""the one"" uniting force in this ""utopia"".You can kind of see where this is going, of course. Ryan had similar visions, albeit without a child as the visionary.You play a Big Daddy. Yes, those ""disgusting and ugly brutes"" as Tenenbaum would say.You are the hero but without spoiling too much more, it gets interesting. 2K did a great job in the latter stages of the story telling process and having Eleanor as a guide worked well.If you played the first one, you will notice some game mechanic changes.Keybinds may be wonky to start with but you will explode a rocket at your feet prematurely and accidentally. Well, at least I did.I found the keybinds didn't translate well from the first to the second game so, a little time mapping your keybinds from the first may fix all of that.The research is still there and is a little easier to manage. No longer do you have to switch your weapon from the camera, but now its a video. The more interesting it is, the more research points. There are 4 research stages. As soon as you get the camera, roll that video on everything you see. It helps later on.Hacking is no longer out of the live game environs so, take cover while hacking.Apart from that, have fun slaying the baddies and stay alive out there. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A bit under-rated in my opinion. Fits in well with Ken Levine's over-arcing plots in Bioshock 1 and Infinite also and ties up a few interesting loose ends in Rapture while letting you experience the world from a few different perspectives. I feel like the ""good"" ending was a lot more affecting as well with a stronger message.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Getting a lot of bash for being a cash grab after the success of Bioshock, this game adds it's spice to Rapture visit letting you play as a big daddy to drill people. Gunplay has been terrifingly improved, and hacking is now on real time. The story is also more personal, so you won't just feel like playing the giant epilogue that was the story of Bioshock 1. Also, Minerva's Den is great and included.Just don't expect to be wowed by the setting: that's Bioshock 1 specialty and duty.I recommend this game if you tought Bioshock could have better gunplay to be a better game.

												First of all if you are in any way shape or form in need to dive back into rapture this game is just that! Alhough many will say the origial is better, this sequal improves upon everything in the first game. Pros- Great story - Plasmids are even more fun- amazing art design - enemy variety - guns are all fun to use - exploration is a ton of fun - multiple endings depending on if you choose to save the little sisters just like the original im pretty sure but idk - graphcis while not improved heavly compared to the last game,  the ambient lighting and atmospthere really brings the game to look and feel like it was once a living and breathing city - interesting plot twists that i dindt really expect Cons- Feels offly similar to the first game i would not recommend jumping straight into this game after beathing the first one give yourself a little bit of a break and go back into it later because you will get board since you have already played in rapture previously - You feel really weak at the begging dont really feel like you a big dady like when your are first greeted with one in the original bio shock- enemys say the exact same lines over and over and over and over again - same for the litter sisters either saying "" I have the best daddy"" and a few others kind of annoying how they could have easly added more but got lazy in that deparment - areas for some reason even after you have just clreared it enemys will always respawn in the same area - AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME IS CRASHES!!!!!! READ!!! I highly reccomend saving during certain sections when you feel like you have done alot because my game has crashed atleast 4 times during my entire play though and i had to redo alot of stuff because of it since i didnt save my game. but over all exlent game I highly reccomend!

												Bioshock 2 is a sequel to the original game and was developed by 2K Marin. The game, taking place roughly seven years after Bioshock, follows the story of Subject Delta, an early prototype Big Daddy, as he tries to reunites himself with his original Little Sister while trying to survive the danger of a derelict Rapture, now under the command of a psychiatrist, Sophia Lamb, with total opposite philosophical views from Andrew Ryan.As far as gameplay goes, Bioshock 2 doesn't introduce anything exactly breathtaking over the first game's formula, only tweaking some elements and adding some novelities along the line. The biggest difference between the first and the second game is that now you can fire plasmids and weapons at the same time, hack security machines and other mechanism remotely thanks to a dedicated tool, several enemies from the original game are now more dangerous one way or the other and you'll have to face far more kinds of elite enemies (and not all of them are Big Daddies). As far as general difficulty goes Bioshock 2 manages to be a mixed bag: while the opposition you will encounter is far more deadly than the one in the first game, you are given plenty of new plasmids, tonics and weapons to compensate, and, much like the other games in the series, Bioshock 2 actually becomes easier as you progress into it.The story of Bioshock 2 was recived in a variety of ways. The main plot is, at its core, a self-insert fic which tries to expand the characters and the story of the first game while introducing some new elements that however do tend to make little sense at times (the biggest problem here being that we are introduced to new characters and events that were supposedly of major importance in Rapture's history, and therefore should had been mentioned in the original Bioshock too). There is also some consent that the plot of the original game didn't need an expansion whatsoever. Still, Bioshock 2 manages to tell a fairly good story on its own thanks to a cast of (mostly) interesting and emotional characters. The game also features a rudimentary moral system: depending of few decisions you are called to make regarding the Little Sisters and some major NPCs, you can get a different ending.Bioshock 2 also features a multiplayer mode, dubbed ""The Fall of Rapture"". However, as I'm writing this review, this mode has been pretty much abbandoned and it's downright impossible to meet other players, let alone start any match. It's worth mentioning that Bioshock 2 multiplayer wasn't exactly that well recived though.As it stands, Bioshock 2 feels pretty much like an expansion pack for the original Bioshock instead of a deep, epic and completely overhauled sequel. If you can get over this fact, however, you will find that the game is genuinely enjoyable on many levels			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome to Rapture, but not the Rapture you know...THis is a GOOD GAME, and gets BETTER if you already played Bioshock (1)This game gets you into the skin of the first fully-funcional Big Daddy, and you start dying. Yeah. Welcome to a Over-destroyed rapture, where splicers have evolver to HUNT big daddies, wich doesn't makes your travel easy. New big daddies are kicked in the back directly to the streets of Rapture, and you only have one interest: Get yourself to your Little Sister, wich is AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY. You will use Rapture's fastest transport possible, meeting friends, enemies, and how now, spicers rocketed right in your visor, and some Little Sisters.GAMEPLAY: Perfected from Bioshock 1, its easier to control battle, holding bigger weapons and Plasmids at the same times, no Tonic Types diferentiations, and the always-hilarous Drill.AMBIENTATION: A decayed Rapture, half-destroyed, and keeping that ambientation of: ""Underwater Utopia"" wich wasn't as much Utopic as planed, guided by your old Little Sister, wich now is not soo little.Total: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game will probaly suck you in with story of 1 Big Daddy with Delta sing.As sequel for original first story you´ll meet new (old) friends+seeking trough Rapture you´ll find several recordtapes with additional informations what happend after A.Rayan died, his war against new enemy Dr.Sofia Lamb .This game again focus on smashing trough waves of splicers addicted on ADAM,but there is also new feature - as you play for very old big daddy with some new toys  and tricks in pocket you have now ability to carry and protect little sisters while they´re  gathering ADAM for you for get new plasmids and Tonics (passive effect) but be honest You wanna tell me you won´t end up with using only Electro Bolt.Not very possitive but expected as Big Daddy you can now use both hands 1 for plasmids and second for bunch of new toys to test and play.Mechanics didn´t change a lot still same rules.Thank you.

												So, if you wanna check my thoughts on the first Bioshock check my ""review"". People always told me that Bioshock 2 was lame compared to the first one, they were wrong, atleast as far as I can tell. Of course the game takes a different aproach storywise since you play as a Big Daddy (YOU PLAY AS A FREAKING BIG DADDY!). And the story it's basicly the reunion of ""you"" and your ""daughter"", the story also gives some of what followed the fall of Fountaine and Andrew Ryan. I really liked the story and there's some parts in which the background is so beautifull! The soundtrack reamains particularly good and it just makes the game world come to life. Once more I have to complain about the combat, it just feels clunky to me but I guess that's just me. I have not played the multiplayer but overall I would say this is a pretty good game and I think it's kinda underrated. Still, I prefer the first one over this one, also considering it took me around 10 hours to finish the first one and about 6 hours to finish this one (according to Steam). NOTE: IT USES GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bioshock game series was the one that definitely brought me, an unconditional fan of Real Time Strategy games, to the First Person Shooter world.Scenery detail, ambient and music takes us to a state of complete game ""submersion"" (pun intented). Surely it is a must-play game to all fans of well-designed and fully immersive games. Bioshock 2 is a great example on why not all sequels are bad.Allowing the same writers to imagine the story for all 3 Bioshock games really pays off, giving us a story to which we really want to contribute and discover all its mind-blowing twisted aspects.Be sure ot play all Bioshock games.

												BioShock 2 improves on the original's gameplay in a lot of ways, making an overall more enjoyable shooter experience with several valid playstyles. Although I've seen it criticized for being too similar in setting and plot to the first one, that's a plus for me. Although I don't find the characters in 2 as engaging as those in the first one, Rapture still has enough of a hold over me as a setting for me to enjoy it. However, what I really want to recommend here is the Minerva's Den DLC. Minerva's Den is one of the finest examples of emotional storytelling I have ever seen in a video game, and probably one of my favorite video game experiences ever. It's a must play.

The game, taking place roughly seven years after Bioshock, follows the story of Subject Delta, an early prototype Big Daddy, as he tries to reunites himself with his original Little Sister while trying to survive the danger of a derelict Rapture, now under the command of a psychiatrist, Sophia Lamb, with total opposite philosophical views from Andrew Ryan.As far as gameplay goes, Bioshock 2 doesn't introduce anything exactly breathtaking over the first game's formula, only tweaking some elements and adding some novelities along the line. The biggest difference between the first and the second game is that now you can fire plasmids and weapons at the same time, hack security machines and other mechanism remotely thanks to a dedicated tool, several enemies from the original game are now more dangerous one way or the other and you'll have to face far more kinds of elite enemies (and not all of them are Big Daddies). As far as general difficulty goes Bioshock 2 manages to be a mixed bag: while the opposition you will encounter is far more deadly than the one in the first game, you are given plenty of new plasmids, tonics and weapons to compensate, and, much like the other games in the series, Bioshock 2 actually becomes easier as you progress into it.The story of Bioshock 2 was recived in a variety of ways. The main plot is, at its core, a self-insert fic which tries to expand the characters and the story of the first game while introducing some new elements that however do tend to make little sense at times (the biggest problem here being that we are introduced to new characters and events that were supposedly of major importance in Rapture's history, and therefore should had been mentioned in the original Bioshock too). There is also some consent that the plot of the original game didn't need an expansion whatsoever. Still, Bioshock 2 manages to tell a fairly good story on its own thanks to a cast of (mostly) interesting and emotional characters. The game also features a rudimentary moral system: depending of few decisions you are called to make regarding the Little Sisters and some major NPCs, you can get a different ending.Bioshock 2 also features a multiplayer mode, dubbed ""The Fall of Rapture"". However, as I'm writing this review, this mode has been pretty much abbandoned and it's downright impossible to meet other players, let alone start any match. It's worth mentioning that Bioshock 2 multiplayer wasn't exactly that well recived though.As it stands, Bioshock 2 feels pretty much like an expansion pack for the original Bioshock instead of a deep, epic and completely overhauled sequel. If you can get over this fact, however, you will find that the game is genuinely enjoyable on many levels			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is better than in most RPG and MMORPG out there, it's a sequel, it has continuity, it has difficulty (you can die alot...) and the art is out of this world. I have nothing but praise for this game.You should play it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 provides an interesting second look at the world of Rapture, expanding on the story set by the first game. The gameplay is arguably improved a bit from the first game, with a broader weapon set and extra polish, as well as some tweaked plasmids (Security Command is a fun one- lets you summon flying security bots wherever you are). However, the storyline feels a bit grindy and aimless, with the main character's goals feeling relatively unmotivated compared to those in the first game Yeah, he's dying, but for some reason it just doesn't feel compelling. You never actually meet two of the big characters in the game- Sinclair and Sofia Lamb- in any major role physically, so they just feel like voices in your head for most of the game. Also, this game is as glitchy as the first, if not more, and will probably crash you out to the desktop more than a couple times. Quicksave will be your best friend. Reservations aside, I highly recommend this game, because the slight complaints I have are well worth sticking through for the experience of the game as a whole.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thought I'd post a review with the new ""coat of paint"" edition coming out soon (free if you already have the base game).First of all, the elephant in the room: technical issues. This game really suffers in this department. It's testament to how much I loved this game that I put in hours of diagnosis and ini tweaks to progress past the common crashes. I just hope the new edition will be addressing these, as opposed to just making it all look prettier. The game (and Bio 1) already looks pretty good in my opinion.Gameplay: The first few hours are very familiar and I can fully understand people bailing here thinking it's inferior to the first game. However, stick with it and you'll be rewarded in spades. The last three quarters of the game are just excellent. The ending I was given (and there are several) just killed me emotionally. I should probably state that I'm a father!Position in the series: I didn't really rate Infinite very highly. As polished as it looks, it's a hollow shell for me. Bioshock 1 will always be famous for *that* bit, but the ending was fluffed (subjective, obviously). I loved Bioshock 2 and can't wait to play it again soon, it's easily my favourite. The quality of Minerva's Den is the icing on the cake.Oh, and Big Sisters are freaky as hell!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Getting a lot of bash for being a cash grab after the success of Bioshock, this game adds it's spice to Rapture visit letting you play as a big daddy to drill people. Gunplay has been terrifingly improved, and hacking is now on real time. The story is also more personal, so you won't just feel like playing the giant epilogue that was the story of Bioshock 1. Also, Minerva's Den is great and included.Just don't expect to be wowed by the setting: that's Bioshock 1 specialty and duty.I recommend this game if you tought Bioshock could have better gunplay to be a better game.

												It was a little bit refreshing after BioShock 1 that the city we're roaming remained the same, although now we discover other parts of it. The Tonic System became simpler but now we have more of them. The only downside for me was the fact, that the vanilla game is too short. I don't know how many extra hours the DLC gives us but I hope it'll be good. All in all, everybody should play with it at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In Bioshock 2 you revisit rapture 10 years after the events of Bioshock 1, you start off as a ''Prototype'' Big Daddy on a quest to save your little sister.Bioshock 2's gameplay is a huge improvement from its predecessor giving you the ability to use your weapon and plasmids at the same time and a completely new hacking system, Bioshock 2 also gives you the old feel of constantly being prepared for anything and long winded fights with Big Daddies and Big Sisters leaves you at the end of your seat 90% of the time.Bioshock 2's plot line is very straight forward with a lot fewer plot-twists and creativeness to the characters as Bioshock 1, yet it is unique in its own way. When I played the campaign I felt totally immersed into the plot making relate to the main characters and feel his emotions, pains and troubles. I felt like the story had meaning to the game and what I would do would affect the outcome of the game's ending (which it did).The only gripe I had with the game was the Splicers, the lower-tier Splicers were complete Bullet Sponges at times and could deal TONNES of damage if you weren't careful.Expect some tears, laughing, suspense and the sheer craziness of what Bioshock is praised for!9/10 - Would you kindly play again...

												I can't actually recommend Bioshock 2 by itself. It's a superb Unreal shooter wrapped in mediocre level design and story. The gunplay is worthy of a sequel to Bioshock, but the story itself fails in one key point: making you care about the characters that occupy the world. Bioshock 1 had great pacing for introducing characters that seemed reasonable and slowly descended into the realm of madness as the game progressed - 2 just throws you into the madhouse and asks that you kindly shoot it up. There are tons of brilliant and unique ideas in Bioshock 2, but they're missing that master touch - it's like a poor imitiation without really understanding the reasoning behind the design decisions of the first game. I have no doubt that with another 8 months and a rewrite the game could've been stellar. If you really like the shooting, then by all means play the main campaign, but that's about all you're going to get from it.The multiplayer is dead nowadays, but it was one of the better Unreal experiences online when it launched since it relied on the excellent gunplay and plasmid mechanics of the campaign.The reason I am recommending this game (on sale) is because of the DLC. Minerva's Den is an excellent piece of design, in both level and story. It's a phenomenal experience and is convincingly alive in the world of Bioshock. Buy the game and DLC (again on sale) and play Minerva's Den. The pacing, writing, dialogue, and thought that went into it is worth of some real Bioshock material. Game: 5/10, DLC: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had plenty of time to enjoy the Bioshock and Bioshock 2 series in the past week. I did not skip through the content like it was there for no reason, I've listened to audio logs, opened every chest in game and tried to kill everything that needed killing. I had a blast with Bioshock 1. Smooth experience, no crashes and an overall satisfaction. The end of Bioshock was kinda if-y but hey it was a really good game. Now what can I say about Bioshock 2? Well it was a great game, to be honest I liked the mechanics more than the first part and the story was so intense and beautiful that I got sucked into it and finished the game in 2 days. I will strongly suggest if you haven't played bioshock series to play do so.Now the problems with Bioshock 2.... O My F%#@*! GOD ! ! !First of all I had to spend quite some time figuring out a way to start the game since it was not loading at all and after a two days of brainstorming and forums-searching I found nothing. Then I've decided to delete it and re-install + the already unavailable Games for Windows Live and somehow, somewhat it started.The first 15 minutes of the game were awesome and suddenly CRASH ... like what ?!? Ok no problem I re-started the game and ... nope you've guessed it no auto save every 5 minutes or so, had to start from the beggining. This kept happening until I finished the game, every other hour or so I was getting a crash with no error message, no NOTHING. I did read some forums and tried all the turn off DX10 thing and resolution change and logs and well nothing helped. What I'd strongly reccomend is make QUICK SAVE on a keybind that you will be using atleast every 5-10 minutes, otherwise if you get sucked into the game and forget to save it it will return you back at your last auto save (which is either the beggining of the mission or a very important transition) and believe me after a while it gets frustrating (A LOT!!!).The game is intense if played on the right difficulty, the story is incredible and a good ending to the Bioshock series but the CRASHES are terrible and made me thing of leaving this game. Just finish it and I hope you don't have the same issues as I did but hey its the same thing, different pc :) (Windows 8.1 btw and my machine is really strong)Hope you enjoy the game and I wish it is a crash free experience for you :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Took me 3 tries to get into Bioshock 1.  Turned out to be a very good game.  Bioshock 2, to me, was a lot easier to get into.  I held out  on playing this one because it didn't have controller support, but it was recently patched in when GFWL was removed.  Graphics are slghtly better than the first.  They can be improved by using the NVIDIA Control Panel for better AA and AF.  You can also improve the slow control responsiveness by altering the .ini file.  The game also has well-know sound issues.  This doesn't take away the fact that it's a lot of fun to play through.  You're a big daddy, and you will need to make the same choice of rescuing or ""adopting"" the little sisters.  I rescue them all to get the ""good"" ending :)  Plasmids and tonics still a lot of fun to play with, and finding all the recordings is essential to follow the story.  Rapture looks great!  All in all, recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I do recommend this game, do not think that there are not some things that are less than acceptable =Story- The story is a bit more dumbed down then the first one. The gist of it is you’re a prototype Big Daddy who got resurrected and you need to find your little sister (now grown up). On your journey, you go through misadventure to misadventure. Overall, not the strongest out of the Bioshock seriesGameplay- Gameplay is more polished and improved from the first game. While there are very few new plasmids, the old ones are improved and have more development than the first game (For example, Electro Bolt at Level 3 can shoot a stream of electricity and chain lightning) Gunplay is also very fun, but some weapons are better left untouched at a Power to the People station than others. Overall, solid and entertainingGraphics- The models are a step up from the first game, now more polished and scary looking. Environments are similar to the first game, but with improved textures and a more abandoned feel. In sum, an upgrade from the first game.Control- The controls were fine. You can now duel wield a plasmid and a weapon. Switching weapons and plasmids in a fight could become tricky, but isn't a major fault that affects the game.Difficulty- Identical to the first game, with the added challenge of being limited to 5 medkits and 5 EVE hypos. Most of the time it’s a fair incline, but be prepared to gluttonously consume medkit after medkit during some fights.Polishes- Hacking is improved (Replacing long boring tube puzzles with quick button pressing) Plasmids are fun to use and they defiantly spice up the gameplay. Research is also more innovative, making the player contribute. Low Points- Games for Windows Live (GFWL) sucks. There, I said it. I recommend finding a way to disable it and adding -dx9 to launch options (Oh and stay away from multiplayer if you don't want a sour taste to be left in your mouth). Also, you can't go back to previous areas, so better scavenge the area well. Final Verdict: 7.5/10Bioshock 2 improves upon the first game (gameplay wise), making it more enjoyable to play. However, the games basic plot and lack of social/political commentary may leave some fans disappointed. If you want a game that improves upon the first gameplay wise, but lacks any real voice, I recommend this. Otherwise, it's best to save up $10.00 more to buy Infinite ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though it is the weakest of the series in my opinion it is still a great game and would recommend to anyone who's interested in the Bioshock series.That said this game has a nasty tendency to crash ALOT on PC and has some other weird quirks such as V-sync turns itself on automatically everytime you enter the game and DX9 mode which is seemingly stable causes an issue where certain particle effects cause the game to lag and it makes the game look noticeably worse (this is running an R9 290 on high settings).10/10 didn't have the wall safe glitch from Bioshock 1.

												The definitive Rapture experience, BioShock 2 combines excellent gameplay with a heart tugging storyline that will inform your understanding of the other BioShock games. Achievement fanatics beware, multiplayer is largely dead. Getting the multiplayer achievements will be next to impossible. However, the single player campaign is definitely worth the buy. You almost cannot call yourself a gamer and not have played BioShock 2. A must have in your Steam catalog.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Game as I said in the Original Bioshock. I love the new hacking system & the ranged hacking mechanics. This game was as interesting as the first. Must Buy/Play. Although I kept crashing at some places, all I had to do was change the settings to lowest :P. Still got creeped out. 11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Though I was tired as crap from work; I still managed to get a bit of emotion from the story. It's an AWE feeling. :) Brought some semi- tears down my cheek :) Good game! Ps.

												I heard a lot of bad things about Bioshock 2 when it came out so never bothered to pick it up. Years later when I grabbed the aging title in the steam sales, I got a lot of ""omg you're playing that?"" remarks.  These comments were taken with a grain of salt, particularly given that some of the naysayers had never played the game. Nevertheless they weren't exactly wrong.As it turned out, it's not actually a bad game. It's just not as good as Bioshock1, and if I had bought it full price I'd have been far less pleased.There's no real innovation and frankly being a big slow clumpy metal man is a bit of a drag after having played the original mostly with stealth and traps. Yes, there are clyclone traps, but these were not all that useable in the end.Throughout the game II found myself constantly having to pop health packs, switch weapons who’s ammo capacity was abysmal, and avoiding enemy fire with line of sight. This rendered the ""gimmik"" of Project Delta, the main protagonist, rather unusable. What's the point of having a nifty giant drill attack if using it will put you in close quarters out in the open losing a good chunk of your health, and the ""ammo"" runs out quicker than you can say “this all looks the same.”There are a shockingly low number of enemy unit types. Sure,  there are a few minor variations on the models, but the actual types? Very few. There's little in the way of environment either, with many assets seemingly plucked straight from the original and no real care having gone into differentiating the new parts of rapture you’re visiting from those you entered in BS1. All in all, the story is decent, and the voice overs very good. What lets the game down is the game design Not nearly enough thought was put into ""is this actually FUN.""By the end, I was simply glad the whole thing was over (it's quite long if you explore) and I could move on to biosock infinite, so I made no moves towards the DLC, or multiplayer.If you can get the game for less than 5 euro, it’s worth it if you liked bioshock 1. Turn the difficulty down to easy, and just mindlessly blast your way through while following the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With BioShock 2, there was not a step back in quality. There is still that unnerving atmosphere, the story that unfolds is top notch, the gameplay is as tense and rewarding as ever. There are a few new tweaks, most notably dual wielding a weapon and a plasmid. If you liked BioShock, there is no reason for you to not like BioShock 2 as much or more. Highly recommended.

												Bioshock 2 is a wonderfully beautiful, yet haunting game, taking you further into the depths of the underwater city of Rapture.  The game improves the combat system of its pedecessor and adds a handful of new additions to keep the gameplay feeling fresh.  Though Bioshock 2 does not stray far from the same overarching path that Bioshock 1 had laid out, it is still an immersive, unique game that you won't want to put down.  Bioshock 2 has easily won a place in my heart, and it is my favorite in the series.  From fighting off Big Daddies and Big Sisters, gathering Adam, dicovering the world, and unraveling the new mysteries laid before you, Bioshock 2 delivers a gameplay experience that you'll be more than glad to have played.

												Visually much improved over the first installment, as well as an improvement of the main game mechanics (not yet far enough in to comment on storyline). It was a pleasant surprise to find GFWL was gone when I reinstalled it which caused issues last time I attempted the game. The control scheme makes it clear that this is an xbox port but is still functional with a keyboard and mouse, though I suppose if you use a controller this doesn't matter in the slightest.I find it to be significantly less creepy than the first BioShock, despite the frequent encounters with Big Sisters, and seems to show a transition between the intentional horror of the first game and BioShock Infinite which sought mainly to disturb rather than scare.

												It does not have the same impact as the first, and the wonder and immersion of exploring Rapture becomes more routine, but it is still a great, well crafted singleplayer campaign.  Very neat level design and combat choices, so it's an entertaining playthrough, although the removal of the ability to backtrack for no good reason that was in the first makes it very apparently linear. Stupid good fun shooting and exploring, but the impacting themes, drama, and storytelling from the first are missed. Multiplayer is best summed up as ""I never asked for this.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A worthy sequel.  Visually and mechanically a step up from the original Bioshock, though the story is a bit too convoluted for it's own good.  The combat is notably improved, and sticking splicers to a wall with a speargun is immensely satisfying.  The city of Rapture is more colorful and feels larger thanks to the giant windows and the walks on the bottom of the ocean.  It does feel a bit ""gamey""; there are abundant set pieces and it's quite clear where one level ends and the next begins.  The addition of guarding a Little Sister as she harvests Adam from a dead body is novel at first, but wears thin after the third or fourth time.  Then you have to do it about a dozen more...  That's this game in a nutshell; if you liked the first game it's a safe bet you'll like this, but the ""been there, done that"" feeling does set in after a time.  The DLC (Minerva's Den) is not a bad crash course into Rapture either.  It crashed on a me a couple times and I had to disable DirectX 10 effects to get through it, so the noticeable visual downgrade didn't do it any favors.  Still enjoyable, however, even if it feels like a disconnected story set in the Bioshock universe.  The ion cannon and singularity plasmid are highlights.  My main complaint (besides the crashing) is the muddy objectives which lead to feeling like you're a rat in a maze at times.  If you can get it rather cheap and aren't burned out on the series it's certainly worth checking out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: June 22, 2015
												Most things from BioShock apply to BioShock 2, so I'll do the rundown on changes.2 Quick discalimers:1-It crashes, a lot, and seemingly for no reason. It doesn't autosave as much as I wanted it to, so save often!2-The scarier moments from BioShock are pretty much gone (make of that what you will), so if you're not a horror fan, you'll probably enjoy this a bit more than BioShock, but it's still pretty bloody.So you're a Big Daddy by the name of 'Subject Delta', but you can still use Plasmids and such, because your a prototype. Your little sister, now a grown-up sister, needs your help after you get ressurected. The story is above average, but overall weaker than BioShock. Similar progression to BioShock as well, semi-linear missions but plenty of exploring for cakes and ammo. We've also got some new characters to go with our new areas too. Another change I like is the visual style. Set 8 years after BioShock, Rapture's leak problem has got a little...bigger...to say the least. The art deco style has been preserved, but there's odd glowing underwater plants and stuff, and the sequences where you get to wander around on the ocean floor are really beautiful. I spent the first 10-ish minutes going 'Whoa, everything's so pretty!'.Gameplay is largely the same, except now we can dual wield Plasmids and Weapons, a much needed improvement, and a full new host of weapons as well. Plasmids are largely the same, but some changes and additions, usual sequel things. I also found I was using a greater variety of weapons and Plasmids than BioShock, where I was often just using Electro-Bolt and the Machine Gun, Gene tonics are more streamlined, so you only have 1 HUGE set of Gene Tonics, which is rather nice as in BioShock, I was often thinking 'gawd, I need more combat tonic slots!'. Hacking isn't total♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore, just a kinda Quicktime event, but you can still screw up, and you can also hack from a distance, hooray! Enemies are largely the same, two new types of Big Daddy and one new Splicer is all I've seen so far. So pretty solid all round, nothing too different from the original, but some much needed changes.However, BioShock 2 does have a fair swathe of problems. The story isn't as good as before, which is a real weakness. The main antagonist has the most annoying voice ever, and she's always around, but the other characters are fine. As a Big Daddy, when you get to a Little Sister, you have two options: 1-'Adopt' her, take her to a corpse, gather some ADAM as you munch through half your health and Ammo after fighting a butt-ton of Splicers, then do it again, and finally send her to a vent, and I don't think you even get rewards unlike BioShock. Or, 2-Kill her on the spot, 120 ADAM, bam, no fuss, lots of mess, but no uneccesary usage of Health kits.On the note of Health and EVE Hypos: You can only carry 5 of each, but First Aid Kits fully heal you. I found I was often low of health. And it annoys me how you can eat, drink and smoke through your steel diving helmet, unless Subject Delta can absorb nutrients through Osmosis or something.When you are dealing with Little Sisters, there's a chance it can summon a Big Sister, a kind of Mini-Boss. They're kind of annoying, but not a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥to deal, and you are given proper warning. But please, ONLY spawn one if we're being evil and harvesting them, NOT protecting them with our lives and finally freeing them from their torment.The other two problems are more technical. I found the Audio was very quiet, everything was quite distant most of the time, which is really annoying, especially when sound is so important. The other problem is buttons. Although being able to dual wield is nice, there's a lot of extra keys, and it can get a bit cluttered. Due to too many keys, there's no manual way to reload EVE, which is a real pain in the middle of a fight, so you have to zap yourself to 0, then reload, which is about as fast as the original.But overall, BioShock 2 is still solid. It's kind of like Portal and Portal 2. They're both good games, but BioShock is superior to BioShock 2. The story is less tight than before, and there's some dangling threads here and there. BioShock 2 also has the morality element present, but it's handled a lot better, a bit more grey. And I genuinelly felt sad with the ending I got.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely fabulous game, just like bioshock originall.If you want more of the same, just a little bit updated and such, then buy it!Pro's:1. Looks better then the original, and looks good even when playing in 2015.2. Gameplay is nothing special, but it is good, plus fun ways to kill with weird weapons and plasmids (just like in the original). 3. Story didn't really grab my full attention, but that could've been because I literally completed my first run of bioshock original the day before I played and completed this one, but it's still a good story I think.4. Game will guild trip you depending on moral choices.5. multiplayer I think? I have no idea I haven't touched it, and honestly forgot to look at it. Still better then not having one at all though! right guys?Cons:1. While better looking then the original, it still doesn't look like infinite. (captain obvious).2. Ragdoll animations still look like they are running on a lower framerate then the rest of the game just like in the original.3. story not as gripping as the original.4. The game copied many plasmids (for example) from bioshock 1.5. The game froze 2 times for me during my playthrough, I had to edit some launch thing into -dx9 or something like that (it's on all forums) and then I never had a problem again.6.!!!!!!!!SORT OF SPOILER!!!!!!IN THIS LINE OF TEXT ONLY: The end battle felt, just like bioshock 1 way too easy and dissapointing to me even when playing on the highest diffeculty.Conclusion:If you played bioshock 1 and loved it like me, then buy this and play some more!I think the bioshock series is awesome, this part is awesome as well, but more of the same awesome as part 1.It took me 13 hours to complete this, it didn't get boring for me and I completed it in 1 day.

												Storywise, this game is far from the quality of the orginal Bioshock. But, the gameplay is fantastic, all the little problems have been fixed and mechanically Bioshock 2 is better.Perhaps, now that Infinite has shown the multiverse element of the Bioshockverse maybe the canonical errors between Bioshock 1 and 2 actually make more sense  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												not perfect, as it lacks some of the shock and creativity value of the original. HOWEVER!The game is still silly fun, a very good storyline that is often overlooked and a 'defend the little sister' single-player mechanic that is fun for anyone who enjoys wave defense games. New powers are fun and the ability to dual-weild your plasmids and guns make for smoother gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It does not have the same impact as the first, and the wonder and immersion of exploring Rapture becomes more routine, but it is still a great, well crafted singleplayer campaign.  Very neat level design and combat choices, so it's an entertaining playthrough, although the removal of the ability to backtrack for no good reason that was in the first makes it very apparently linear. Stupid good fun shooting and exploring, but the impacting themes, drama, and storytelling from the first are missed. Multiplayer is best summed up as ""I never asked for this.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is one of the most amazing games. After playing the first one i had to play this one as i heard you play as a big daddy which is way more fun. the game also includes multiplayer which is fun as well as you can get the big daddy suit in that which can be a bi**h to find. still playing the game but from what i have played to storyline is amazing i think they should make another bioshock that is set in rapture and columbia again because both bioshock 1&2 and Infinite are amazing! i recommend to anyone who hasn't played these games.

												Absolutely fabulous game, just like bioshock originall.If you want more of the same, just a little bit updated and such, then buy it!Pro's:1. Looks better then the original, and looks good even when playing in 2015.2. Gameplay is nothing special, but it is good, plus fun ways to kill with weird weapons and plasmids (just like in the original). 3. Story didn't really grab my full attention, but that could've been because I literally completed my first run of bioshock original the day before I played and completed this one, but it's still a good story I think.4. Game will guild trip you depending on moral choices.5. multiplayer I think? I have no idea I haven't touched it, and honestly forgot to look at it. Still better then not having one at all though! right guys?Cons:1. While better looking then the original, it still doesn't look like infinite. (captain obvious).2. Ragdoll animations still look like they are running on a lower framerate then the rest of the game just like in the original.3. story not as gripping as the original.4. The game copied many plasmids (for example) from bioshock 1.5. The game froze 2 times for me during my playthrough, I had to edit some launch thing into -dx9 or something like that (it's on all forums) and then I never had a problem again.6.!!!!!!!!SORT OF SPOILER!!!!!!IN THIS LINE OF TEXT ONLY: The end battle felt, just like bioshock 1 way too easy and dissapointing to me even when playing on the highest diffeculty.Conclusion:If you played bioshock 1 and loved it like me, then buy this and play some more!I think the bioshock series is awesome, this part is awesome as well, but more of the same awesome as part 1.It took me 13 hours to complete this, it didn't get boring for me and I completed it in 1 day.

												Most things from BioShock apply to BioShock 2, so I'll do the rundown on changes.2 Quick discalimers:1-It crashes, a lot, and seemingly for no reason. It doesn't autosave as much as I wanted it to, so save often!2-The scarier moments from BioShock are pretty much gone (make of that what you will), so if you're not a horror fan, you'll probably enjoy this a bit more than BioShock, but it's still pretty bloody.So you're a Big Daddy by the name of 'Subject Delta', but you can still use Plasmids and such, because your a prototype. Your little sister, now a grown-up sister, needs your help after you get ressurected. The story is above average, but overall weaker than BioShock. Similar progression to BioShock as well, semi-linear missions but plenty of exploring for cakes and ammo. We've also got some new characters to go with our new areas too. Another change I like is the visual style. Set 8 years after BioShock, Rapture's leak problem has got a little...bigger...to say the least. The art deco style has been preserved, but there's odd glowing underwater plants and stuff, and the sequences where you get to wander around on the ocean floor are really beautiful. I spent the first 10-ish minutes going 'Whoa, everything's so pretty!'.Gameplay is largely the same, except now we can dual wield Plasmids and Weapons, a much needed improvement, and a full new host of weapons as well. Plasmids are largely the same, but some changes and additions, usual sequel things. I also found I was using a greater variety of weapons and Plasmids than BioShock, where I was often just using Electro-Bolt and the Machine Gun, Gene tonics are more streamlined, so you only have 1 HUGE set of Gene Tonics, which is rather nice as in BioShock, I was often thinking 'gawd, I need more combat tonic slots!'. Hacking isn't total♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore, just a kinda Quicktime event, but you can still screw up, and you can also hack from a distance, hooray! Enemies are largely the same, two new types of Big Daddy and one new Splicer is all I've seen so far. So pretty solid all round, nothing too different from the original, but some much needed changes.However, BioShock 2 does have a fair swathe of problems. The story isn't as good as before, which is a real weakness. The main antagonist has the most annoying voice ever, and she's always around, but the other characters are fine. As a Big Daddy, when you get to a Little Sister, you have two options: 1-'Adopt' her, take her to a corpse, gather some ADAM as you munch through half your health and Ammo after fighting a butt-ton of Splicers, then do it again, and finally send her to a vent, and I don't think you even get rewards unlike BioShock. Or, 2-Kill her on the spot, 120 ADAM, bam, no fuss, lots of mess, but no uneccesary usage of Health kits.On the note of Health and EVE Hypos: You can only carry 5 of each, but First Aid Kits fully heal you. I found I was often low of health. And it annoys me how you can eat, drink and smoke through your steel diving helmet, unless Subject Delta can absorb nutrients through Osmosis or something.When you are dealing with Little Sisters, there's a chance it can summon a Big Sister, a kind of Mini-Boss. They're kind of annoying, but not a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥to deal, and you are given proper warning. But please, ONLY spawn one if we're being evil and harvesting them, NOT protecting them with our lives and finally freeing them from their torment.The other two problems are more technical. I found the Audio was very quiet, everything was quite distant most of the time, which is really annoying, especially when sound is so important. The other problem is buttons. Although being able to dual wield is nice, there's a lot of extra keys, and it can get a bit cluttered. Due to too many keys, there's no manual way to reload EVE, which is a real pain in the middle of a fight, so you have to zap yourself to 0, then reload, which is about as fast as the original.But overall, BioShock 2 is still solid. It's kind of like Portal and Portal 2. They're both good games, but BioShock is superior to BioShock 2. The story is less tight than before, and there's some dangling threads here and there. BioShock 2 also has the morality element present, but it's handled a lot better, a bit more grey. And I genuinelly felt sad with the ending I got.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I heard a lot of bad things about Bioshock 2 when it came out so never bothered to pick it up. Years later when I grabbed the aging title in the steam sales, I got a lot of ""omg you're playing that?"" remarks.  These comments were taken with a grain of salt, particularly given that some of the naysayers had never played the game. Nevertheless they weren't exactly wrong.As it turned out, it's not actually a bad game. It's just not as good as Bioshock1, and if I had bought it full price I'd have been far less pleased.There's no real innovation and frankly being a big slow clumpy metal man is a bit of a drag after having played the original mostly with stealth and traps. Yes, there are clyclone traps, but these were not all that useable in the end.Throughout the game II found myself constantly having to pop health packs, switch weapons who’s ammo capacity was abysmal, and avoiding enemy fire with line of sight. This rendered the ""gimmik"" of Project Delta, the main protagonist, rather unusable. What's the point of having a nifty giant drill attack if using it will put you in close quarters out in the open losing a good chunk of your health, and the ""ammo"" runs out quicker than you can say “this all looks the same.”There are a shockingly low number of enemy unit types. Sure,  there are a few minor variations on the models, but the actual types? Very few. There's little in the way of environment either, with many assets seemingly plucked straight from the original and no real care having gone into differentiating the new parts of rapture you’re visiting from those you entered in BS1. All in all, the story is decent, and the voice overs very good. What lets the game down is the game design Not nearly enough thought was put into ""is this actually FUN.""By the end, I was simply glad the whole thing was over (it's quite long if you explore) and I could move on to biosock infinite, so I made no moves towards the DLC, or multiplayer.If you can get the game for less than 5 euro, it’s worth it if you liked bioshock 1. Turn the difficulty down to easy, and just mindlessly blast your way through while following the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is a wonderfully beautiful, yet haunting game, taking you further into the depths of the underwater city of Rapture.  The game improves the combat system of its pedecessor and adds a handful of new additions to keep the gameplay feeling fresh.  Though Bioshock 2 does not stray far from the same overarching path that Bioshock 1 had laid out, it is still an immersive, unique game that you won't want to put down.  Bioshock 2 has easily won a place in my heart, and it is my favorite in the series.  From fighting off Big Daddies and Big Sisters, gathering Adam, dicovering the world, and unraveling the new mysteries laid before you, Bioshock 2 delivers a gameplay experience that you'll be more than glad to have played.

												I bought this in a bundle so I could play all Bioshocks in order.  After finishing the first one about half-way through, I got a new computer and it decided that it didn't want to work properly after that.  (Sound issues, CTD randomly, not saving games, etc. and that was if I actually got it to run without black screening during the load.)Decided to watch some summary videos so I didn't miss out on the storyline.  Started playing this, and comparing the few hours I've put into 2 to the hours I put into 1, I love this one better?  I think storyline wise, I like 1, but I'm not finished with 2 so that's a premature judgement.  I think I love 2 more because you interact with the little sisters a lot more than you did in the first one.  My opinion might change once the game is over and I might love the story better in this, but I'm just basing it off what I've played so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i love the bioshock series. theyre great. they are really, really great. but there is one problem that i had with bioshock 2; on windows 8 it will randomly crash. Now i say randomly, but it only crashed in the very beginning and the end for me. however, i have seen it crash for other people. there are 2 solutions for this; 1 is to save very, very often. this is obvious, but if you save often the odds of you losing a lot of progress are minimized. 2 is to follow Denis's guide;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210917941if you dont want to leave steam, this is what i did; right click bioshock 2 and click on properties, go to ""set launch options"", add ""-dx9"", and the game should work. the only downside is that the graphics get a serious downgrade. if you do route 2, i suggest doing it BEFORE you start the game so you wont notice the difference. i did it at the second to last area and it was really obvious the graphics became worse. i dont even know how to undo the ""-dx9"" stuff, so it might be permanent. (of course you could try uninstalling and re-installing.) Still, despite the crashes, Bioshock 2 is a gret game and i recommend it. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Overall, this game doesn't get the credit it deserves simply because of how good Bioshock 1 was and then Bioshock Infinite was.

There are a few new weapons and plasmids, plus further exploration of Rapture's history. It feels more like an expansion of the first game, rather than a stand-alone title in its own right. There is also a multiplayer element added which I've never played.BioShock 2 is definitely enjoyable, but not quite as much as the first since the novelty has worn off. Even such, it's still worth experiencing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every time I kill a little girls father I become the new one... should I try that on other occasions?Seriously I did not expect that. Bioshock 1 was a good game, but this one tops it easily. The story is far more deep and finally not everyone is your enemy, finally you can meet people here.There are game changing decisions and multiple endings waiting to be tried out, packed in quite challenging action with always too little ammunition. On the downside I had multiple crashes. The game just stopped and autosaves are only done once a level, which means you might have to play about 40 minutes again. The Quicksave button is misplaced on F12, since this does Screenshots in Steam.Another, minor, downer was the strange behavior of the plasmid order. The newest, and therefore mostly strongest one, always moves to the last slot, so you have to manually swap every single other slot at a gene bank.But asides from that, great story, great action und a really good atmosphere, which let me finish the game in two sittings.Total playtime in ""normal"": about 7 hours.

												A remarkable sequel to the first chapter, where combat mechanics are improved at the cost of a less resounding story. The sense of tension characterizing Bioshock is a bit lost, the gameplay beign a little easier than his predecessor. However, the new combat system is well refined and rewarding, making BioShock II a game worth playing for sure.90/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

   Underwater Fun and Fighting   After completing BioShock 2 and the Minervas Den DLC I think I can now give an unbiased review of both.BioShock 2 was a delightful journey through Rapture, following the events of the 1st in the series. and taking a new twist on the main protaganist and their motivations.There was a steady learning curve, allowing you to build a unique set of skills that include weapons, Plasmids (powers) and perks.  The weapons were varied and the upgrades made a serious change to the basic weapon - the shotgun being suprisingly meaty as it became upgraded.The Plasmids provide enough for whatever playstyle you prefer; ranging from telekenisis to freezing the baddies in their tracks.The addition of the other perks, meant that hacking and use of the drill in more 'intimate' fights, became as important as each other.As always the story develops over several characters, providing a few twists and turns I didn't expect, and it's the 'life' in each charater that serioulsy influences some of the choices that come on offer.  You can be mad, bad and a nasty piece of work, or make alternative choices and be rewarded for your human nature side.I took about 23 hours but did choose to explore and go looking in every nook and cranny (very recommended), but the dying was never so frustrating you wanted to stop.  Some fights lead to several deaths, but a quick swap of tactics and you're out there in the fray again.Minerva's Den is a decent sized DLC (8 hours?) that tells a completly new story, with no mention of the main game.  This allows the writers to put in different characters and make it a ""BioSHock 2 Light"", with none of the research side of the main game (it's assumed that you know what Houdini Splicer is etc. but the rules are to just kill whatever is shooting at you, so little knowledge of the baddies is really needed).  You will get many hours of fun and get into some real scrapes along the way.Graphics are pretty good on a decent system that can throw the polygons around, the water effects (as you'd expect) are superb, as are the particle and smoke effects.The sound is amazing and really embeds the player into a post-war environment.All in all a sound 9/10.

												7.8/10The story was detailed enough to peak your interest, but the overall linearity of going from trainstop to trainstop do the task and move on was relatively dull. However the tasks did prove fruitful and the satisfaction of getting stronger; finding new tonics/ plasmids was worth the exploration. Players who are new to Bioshock or fps in general, could find the game somewhat challenging due to the lack of knowledge in when to use your heals/eves. Or perhaps that they are fairly scare. The conservation of ammuntiton is important, which correlates to your accuracy, as the more you use the less you would have for other possibly difficult opponents-obviously. In essence the gameplay is enjoyable and allows you to follow the character with some empathy, the change in perspective during the game does ease the normal steampunk environment which can be refreshing. What was lacking was the depth in the story and environment as it wasn't impactful enough and with no clarity in freedom leaves the players to just move forward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every time I kill a little girls father I become the new one... should I try that on other occasions?Seriously I did not expect that. Bioshock 1 was a good game, but this one tops it easily. The story is far more deep and finally not everyone is your enemy, finally you can meet people here.There are game changing decisions and multiple endings waiting to be tried out, packed in quite challenging action with always too little ammunition. On the downside I had multiple crashes. The game just stopped and autosaves are only done once a level, which means you might have to play about 40 minutes again. The Quicksave button is misplaced on F12, since this does Screenshots in Steam.Another, minor, downer was the strange behavior of the plasmid order. The newest, and therefore mostly strongest one, always moves to the last slot, so you have to manually swap every single other slot at a gene bank.But asides from that, great story, great action und a really good atmosphere, which let me finish the game in two sittings.Total playtime in ""normal"": about 7 hours.

												Bioshock 2 is usually considered the weakest of the Bioshock games, but I disagree. Granted, there's not a lot of difference between this game and the first one, but I liked the first game enough that more of the same is a good idea to me. On the down side, it is a little buggy and about 80% of the way through, the adam gathering got bugged (no splicers would show up) and any save after that was bugged, so I had to play the remaining 20% without saving. The DLC also crashed more than I would have liked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

   Underwater Fun and Fighting   After completing BioShock 2 and the Minervas Den DLC I think I can now give an unbiased review of both.BioShock 2 was a delightful journey through Rapture, following the events of the 1st in the series. and taking a new twist on the main protaganist and their motivations.There was a steady learning curve, allowing you to build a unique set of skills that include weapons, Plasmids (powers) and perks.  The weapons were varied and the upgrades made a serious change to the basic weapon - the shotgun being suprisingly meaty as it became upgraded.The Plasmids provide enough for whatever playstyle you prefer; ranging from telekenisis to freezing the baddies in their tracks.The addition of the other perks, meant that hacking and use of the drill in more 'intimate' fights, became as important as each other.As always the story develops over several characters, providing a few twists and turns I didn't expect, and it's the 'life' in each charater that serioulsy influences some of the choices that come on offer.  You can be mad, bad and a nasty piece of work, or make alternative choices and be rewarded for your human nature side.I took about 23 hours but did choose to explore and go looking in every nook and cranny (very recommended), but the dying was never so frustrating you wanted to stop.  Some fights lead to several deaths, but a quick swap of tactics and you're out there in the fray again.Minerva's Den is a decent sized DLC (8 hours?) that tells a completly new story, with no mention of the main game.  This allows the writers to put in different characters and make it a ""BioSHock 2 Light"", with none of the research side of the main game (it's assumed that you know what Houdini Splicer is etc. but the rules are to just kill whatever is shooting at you, so little knowledge of the baddies is really needed).  You will get many hours of fun and get into some real scrapes along the way.Graphics are pretty good on a decent system that can throw the polygons around, the water effects (as you'd expect) are superb, as are the particle and smoke effects.The sound is amazing and really embeds the player into a post-war environment.All in all a sound 9/10.

												After finishing this game, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the story delivery and the game play.  Expanding on the foundation given in Bioshock 1, this game adds in an element of moral choice and emotional outcome that I find engaging.  Pick this up if you enjoy shooters that give variety in how to overcome obstacles and enemies while building a deep story throughout the process.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is totally bonkers. Kooky, wacky, and super fun. I went into this one not knowing anything about the Bioshock universe and what a great surprise this turned out to be. Bioshock 2 is unlike anything I was expecting. I dig it.A Howard Huges type industrialist decides it would be a great idea to build New York City deep in the ocean, post World War II. The seafloor city he creates is called Rapture. Over the years everyone who moves in ends up going nuts. The citizens find out a sea slug can be turned into underwater super-meth so they end up addicted as 1950s era zombie drug fiends wearing tuxedos and cocktail dresses. And they join a cult. It's kinda rad. Nobody is keeping up with any building repairs so the whole city is falling apart- and flooding. Rapture's underwater city scape is a nice mix of run down collapsing atomic age buildings and colorful exterior seafloor areas. It's got a nice atmosphere complete with a big band soundtrack and lots of corny fifties kitch that works really well in-game. It reminded me somewhat of Fallout 3 with regard to the black humor and goofy vintage advertisements all over the place. On a side note I'd recommend playing both Bioshock 2 and Fallout 3 back to back. They compliment each other well.In Bioshock 2 you are a weirdo deep sea construction worker with bad breath roaming around in a metal diving suit called 'Big Daddy'. You've got a decade old headache... the underwater bad guys punked you and ripped off your kid. So it's understandable why you are a hater and extra pi$$ed off. You also happen to have some serious telekinetic powers plus a gnarley drill you can gut people with. That's just for starters. Later on you'll pick up a rivet gun, an antique shotgun, a spear gun, and some other odd weapon doo-dads that will put the hurt on hipster brainwashed junkies. Your job is to wreck these jerks and reunite with your little sister. Easy beans, right?The game has a setup whereby you can choose what weapons you want to upgrade incrementally, but there are a limited amount of upgrades available on each level. So choose wisely. Another interesting dynamic is you can literally make the game more difficult on the fly by triggering more boss fights. Attack other Big Daddies as you encounter them to adopt their kid (little sister), or not. If you do whack 'em and snag their little sister you have another choice available to either rescue them or pimp 'em out and harvest the loot. Rescue them enough times and you trigger yet another boss fight. That's pretty cool because you can make the game more painful with more boss fights and get rewarded accordingly or make it easier and not have to brawl as much. It's entirely up to you how you want to play it. The benefit to taking the long hard road and making it tough is you get loot to upgrade your telekinetic powers. One of my favorites turned out to be Hypnotize. Roll into a room with a handful of junkies wandering around loose and Hypnotize them to start an entertaining prison brawl. You can kick back and snag the loot when it's all over.Due to a fair amount of complaints about the Bioshock 2 Remastered version not working well or at all because of a ton of bugs and glitches I decided to play the regular version on my system. The regular version of Bioshock 2 was super stable with no issues to report.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7.8/10The story was detailed enough to peak your interest, but the overall linearity of going from trainstop to trainstop do the task and move on was relatively dull. However the tasks did prove fruitful and the satisfaction of getting stronger; finding new tonics/ plasmids was worth the exploration. Players who are new to Bioshock or fps in general, could find the game somewhat challenging due to the lack of knowledge in when to use your heals/eves. Or perhaps that they are fairly scare. The conservation of ammuntiton is important, which correlates to your accuracy, as the more you use the less you would have for other possibly difficult opponents-obviously. In essence the gameplay is enjoyable and allows you to follow the character with some empathy, the change in perspective during the game does ease the normal steampunk environment which can be refreshing. What was lacking was the depth in the story and environment as it wasn't impactful enough and with no clarity in freedom leaves the players to just move forward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it was similar to its predecessor Bioshock 2 still came through with a new and interesting experience. While gameplay was more or less the same, the story that they came up with was as interesting as it was engaging. I felt very satisfied with the amount of gameplay (about 8-10 hours), where I was content with the story ending when it did but also at a point where I was not sick of the game and just wanted it to end. I actually feel like playing through the game (taking different actions this time too). Now while the graphics where more like the first Bioshock that didnt bug me. I liked the look of rapture and this gave me more of the same. I didnt feel like I was playing a different game, I in fact liked the idea of being able to play Bioshock then start playing Bioshock 2 right away and feel like Im still in the same decaying city of Rapture. I dont see why a game series always has to up the graphics in each game to the point where there is a significant difference. Now I see it as a good thing if theres a significant difference between games but we see games from other companies (IE valve) where continiuing with the same graphics really give you sense of the environment. Now I also see it as a good idea to update when you change that environment such as with Bioshock Infinite. There was a few story elements that I didnt like but not to the point that it bothered me. But I really liked how you learn more about Rapture and they even tied in the main character from Bioshock. I went in expecting a game similar yet different from Bioshock, and I got that and more.

												This is one of the greatest unsung video-games. Everyone talks about how it's a sequel, and you're a giant metal man and it's cashing in on Bioshock's success and so on, but in fact it does what sequels are supposed to do. It takes all that was great about Bioshock and tweaks it, improves it and adds to the formula. It's a great game in and of itself. And frankly, Sophia Lamb is way creepier than either Fontaine or Ryan ever were.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They improved a lot in this game, my favorite part is the combat, it's far more entertaining and the good ending even released a tear. It's worth the money, totally, no dissappointment.Yet!

												I played both Bioshock & Bioshock 2 back-to-back and in my opinion, this game is far superior to the original. Sure, the first one set the standard, introduced the city and setting but it's really this game that presents a strong narrative, polished gameplay and a great pacing. While I had a really hard time managing weapons & plasmids in the original game, resulting in numerous unnecessary deaths that left me frustrated and blaming the game rather than me, I found Bioshock 2's gameplay system to be much better and user-friendly.Still had a great time battling Splicers and fending for my life, but only died once from a strategic mistake rather than because I couldn't select a weapon that still had bullets in it or find the right plasmid to deal that last inch of damage to the enemy.A must play if you love First Person Shooters!

												The storyline for this game could have been much better as a prequel versus a sequel. Playing as a big daddy is awesome, but the whole plot of someone jumping on the already sunken-ship that is rapture and attempting to do exactly the SAME thing that ruined it the first time is ridiculous. So, dont't expect the story to impress you at all.The gameplay, however, is amazing! Dual wielding, more passive upgrades, and being able to customize your playstyle more than ever before makes this game soooo much fun! It breaks my heart a little that this game's combat isn't in the first game, because the awesome storyline of the first combined with the asesome gameplay of he second would create an uber game that would cause my head to explode!Anyway, it's definitely worth a buy.

												(Recommended despite 'boss battle' overload and incongruous vulnerability)Bioshock 2 is not as innovative, cohesive and thematically sophisticated as the original. That being said, it plays just as well, if not better, due to some much needed design modifications. And the game looks markedly better as well. Its problems lie in the storyline and how it progresses. While the communism v.s. objectivism theme sounds fantastic on paper, it is not as convincing as Bioshock's treatment of objectivism and capitalism. Perhaps it reveals that Ken Levine knew what he was writing about, whereas Bioshock 2 better resembles a summary of Wikipedia pages on the subject. But, if you're there for the gameplay and experience itself, you'll be happy. Combat is smoother; the environment is more detailed and traversing it is more challenging. However, the means to obtain Adam soon grows very tedious.Remember that section in the first game when you protected a little sister against waves of enemies? In the second game, you don't have a little sister until you defeat another big daddy and take his. Naturally, the combat here is very challenging. However, if you harvest the little sister right then and there, you'll get very little return. Instead, you must let her extract Adam from three designated corpses in the area; each time, you are beset at all sides by enemies who only become stronger the further you advance through the game. Of course, after doing this three times, you are met with the same binary choice as in the first game: harvest or set-free. But don't forget, each area has three big daddies and three little sisters. Once all little sisters are harvested or freed in an area, you'll be forced into an immediate fight to the death with a big sister.This is what I mean by 'boss battle overload', and it's all the more confusing that the character you're playing should, by all means, BE a boss! It certainly doesn't feel so, as you die just as easily as any human. So, unless you LOVE this gameplay mechanic, you might come to hate hearing the words, ""look daddy, it's an angel!"" That being said, certainly persevere with the game. You just might like to save the expansion, Minerva's Den for a while later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is simply epic.You should buy it along with the first BioShock title.It has its flaws but its greatness is good enough, the music is real cool, the weapons are well made but then again, the iron sights are bad, the combat is average, nothing great nor good but nothing bad either, can be harsh on hard and no revive, some times. Sometimes, it feels like this game has been made for the consoles and not for the PC, I mean, it feels more like a console game than a PC game because of some bad mechanics.But anyway, in the end, it's a great game that you should be playing if you're in love with steampunk stuff.And it can be pretty challenging against some types of enemies some times if you play on hard, no revive (disable it in the options) which is great.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2: Taken Edition.The original Bioshock needs little explanation for its initial success. A curveball in the field of story-based first person shooters, the strong direction and risks it took to shake up the standard makes it an oft-remembered title. Between the success of the original and the ever-so-popular Bioshock: Infinite, it seems odd how much Bioshock 2 comes off as the black sheep of the family. While well-lauded with some minor critiques back in the day, it comes off as an afterthought compared to the rest of its namesake. ""Oh, right, Bioshock 2 exists,"" was my initial reaction when I bought the Bioshock package deal during a sale. As I began playing, I found myself rather surprised just how much more I enjoyed this over its predescessor.The story starts off with a bang and the plot goes as follows: You are a Big Daddy (and so will be for the entire course of the game) that's on the hunt for his Little Sister. The Objectivist, libertarian ""paradise"" of the former game has crumbled and given way to a despotic autocracy under the guise of a theocratic Utopia. While the game starts off slowly to ease you in, it doesn't take long for it to find its stride. The first thing I noticed was how much more lively this rendition of Rapture felt. Unlike in the first game where every unique NPC was either behind a glass window or part of a cutscene, you are given the choice of dealing with them as you so wish. Audio diaries abound, the enemies themselves have an incredible amount of lines, everything in general is more talkative. Well, save for the vending machines, they did away with the whole ""WELCOME TO THE CIIIIRCUS OF VALUUUES!"" schtick for better or worse. It can be a little overwhelming at times, since there were a few times where the intercom would interrupt an audio diary I was listening to or something else of the sort will take over. I won't touch on the ending in detail, but I will say that it's certainly better than the 30 second one from the first.However, the biggest improvement from the first game lies in the gameplay itself. Long gone are the loose gun controls and odd hit detection for snug shooting and bashing, and with those improvements comes better plasmids, more weapons, and a (thankfully) fun research system. No longer will you have to bust your camera out and take pictures of the enemy - now you get style points for throwing everything at them. My favorite change is the fact that you can have both a plasmid and a weapon out at the same time - you no longer have to switch between the two. The levels themselves are more complex and massive than the first one, which was fairly linear in comparison. One thing I want to nitpick is the fact that you cannot feasibly get every plasmid in the game or upgrade all your weapons, as there are simply not enough stations or ADAM to go around. Outside of that, everything is an improvement.Graphically, there are some reused assets as to be expected, but the models are sharp and less cartoonish than in the first Bioshock. The setpieces and underwater sections are gorgeous, and as a plus, the textures aren't as muddied. And while the frequency of the old-fashioned tunes have taken a nosedive, the ambience and fight music have been tweaked to be more noticeable and rousing. Too often, video game scores are generic and cookie-cutter to be anything more than a part of an ""EPIC GAME MUSIC COMPILATION - THE BEST"" Youtube video. On that front, I found myself looking up certain tracks because they were that damn good.Even so, there are some elements that I did not enjoy. More specifically, the way of gathering ADAM is a chore. You plop a Little Sister down and kill wave after wave of splicers before picking the little♥♥♥♥♥♥back up and going on your way to another corpse. Some of the symbolism thrown at you in the course of the game is about as subtle as a deer looking into the headlights of an incoming semi, and the main villain doesn't even feel particularly rancorous. While you got taunted and jeered at in the first game, the antagonist in this one might as well just say, ""Oh dear, you survived again. Oh well, let me repeat my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t diatribe again, since I am totally in the right again."" The last time around, you had every reason to gut the villain. This time, you just go, ""Well, okay, good for you."" Plus, there are some twists and turns that might catch some people off-guard and be too reaching, but again, that's up to personal preference.Bioshock 2, even with its share of quirks, is what a sequel should be like. It hits all of the high notes while adjusting a lot of the lower ones. Go get it in the bundle deal, it's dirt cheap.(Also, multiplayer is deader than a doorknob. If you like your achievements, I hope you either enjoy wrangling up a bunch of friends to play it or altering around some files for those 'cheevos!)8.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To me, the story in this one was even better than the first. I thought I would hate being a big daddy and having to escort little sisters but it was mostly a non-issue. You carry them when they're not gathering and when they are, they're invulnerable except that they get interrupted. There's something cathartic about being a child of a broken home and playing as a daddy figure protecting and rescuing little sisters XD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A forsaken bad sequel by name, but is actually a mediocre experience that shadows the masterpiece. Served as a distraction until another masterpiece came. Different developers for Bioshock 2 served only as a purpose of providing the same gameplay from its predecessor with a mildly engaging plot. When I try to look in retrospect how much I enjoyed it, I can barely remember much. When you compare it to the standard of bioshock, it sounds really bad. When you compare it to a typical shooter with RPG elements, it still sounds good. So I'll just leave a thumbs up here and it's up to you to decide if you want to tread on dangerous grounds or not.

												In this game you play as Submarine Man called Δ, the lost brother of ∇. Δ wakes up in a giant underwater fortress full of very ugly people. The goal of the game is to rescue a girl that is your daughter (but not really (but a daughter(but not really (but a daughter)))) (very complicated and my head hurts). As you go you pick cool powers like electricity or throwing items (but not people) but to get powers you need to either kill or touch little girls (eww girls). Δ is very slow. He walks like an old man. Maybe he is an old man? He has a daughter (but not really(but a daughter)) and only old people have daughter? I don't know. You can't see because Δ has a mask. Maybe Δ walks so slow because the game is very short. I didn't even need cheat codes because the game has a cheat built in where you respawn and the enemies doesn't. I beat the game in 6 hours. This game used to cost 60 dollars.Sometimes I needed to check if I'm not playing Bioshock the 1st. Everything look like Bioshock the 1st and the enemy is the same. The only new enemy is Big Sister but she's very easy when you get the power of ice and you ice her real good and she dead.Overall I give this game 10/17 not bad but too much like Bioshock the 1st.

												In Bioshock 2 you play as one of the first Big Daddys, bounded to one little sister. Sofia Lamb the antagonist sends her army of splicers and new monsters called BIG SISTERS. You want to find your little sister and escape out of Rapture.It feels fantastic being back in the city and it's even better than the first Bioshock!!! Improved graphics, better designed (ugly) splicers and again a story that invites to play. Plot twists and many achievements to collect, are so addictive and you continue to play...To play...TO PLAAAAAAY @_@A new hacking system exist, too. It's faster and more easier.(LITTLE) Negative point: The controlls are different.But FANTASTIC GAME and I loved playing through the story, collecting ALL the achievements. If you like the first Bioshock you won't be disappointed ;))			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Story is weaker than the other games, but I liked the amount of moral choices you were able to make.  The ending (which there are like 8 of) was a little confusing, and not very satisfying, at least to me.  I've heard the Minerva's Den DLC is excellent, but I have yet to try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												a truly critic for bioshock 2´s campaign.i love the bioshock world, i really do, ive played the first and the last and ive tried  to play this filthy piece of garbage several times, but i cant, its just disgusting, the game tries so,so hard to be the first bioshock... but its not even close, the enviroments are generic, the textures feel old, the movement is much slower and concecuently the peace of the game itself.   Youre supposed to be an awesome ""big daddy"" but youre more like a ""naked guy"" because  everything gets you by a few hits and you have to spend hundreds of bullets in other big daddies, its just illogical, the little sister scavaging ""ADAM"" secuences are just the same boring/frustrating as ""protecting ashley""   are in RE4, its just not fun to start over while you lose every bullet in a try, that is for more rewarding games such as Darksouls, and this game is not Darksouls evidently. In the first game you have a sense of discovery in this one the path is extreamely lineal and the world feels so bland, its not even close to the first rapture adventure, one thing good with this game is that is still bioshock-related for fans of the original, plus, you use a drill (shame it sucks after the middle-game) the big sisters are ok but sadly they dont give you the same feeling as the big daddies in the fisrt. Levine´s absence hitted this game hard, i dont recommend it  to a ""try-out"" gamer, because it will give you the opposite idea of what bioshock is, for the ones that have played the first one, try if your´e a few bucks spare , write a real critic, and afterwards play bioshock infinite to remove the taste.  for the ones who like it; its ok,  i know its bioshock, but if your´e  gamers, you know im right, i was hard on this one just because i love the franchise, its just for love. i give this game a 6.5 ot of 10 JUST FOR THE STORY MODE, NOT MULTI			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I\'m mostly going to be focusing Multiplayer part of the game. The singleplayer was great and I\'d definitely give it a shot if you haven\'t played it yet. It\'s pretty much like the first game, but with improved gameplay. The Multiplayer is gay though. Here\'s why.First of all, it is one of the most unbalanced multiplayer games of all time. New players aren\'t going to stand a chance because they don\'t know how the game works and all the cheap tatics the experienced players use, and they don\'t have good equipment. It\'s completely unfair. The best weapons I would recommend from my experience are the grenade launcher with any upgrade, except homing grenades, the elephant gun with the quad barrel upgrade for headshots, the crossbow with the rate of fire upgrade, or you could use any other upgrade for headshots. I\'d recommend the pistol with any upgrade if you have good aim. You also can\'t go wrong with the shotty. My favorite plasmids are electrobolt to stun opponents(works great with headshots), Aero Dash to get around faster and to confuse your opponents. Dash can also get you out of electro-stuns, fire,bees and away from turrets. Telekinesis is probably the best plasmid. It can catch grenades and arrows, freeze players for a second and make insta-kills with it. Winter Blast is good too because it can slow players so you can get some good shots on them. Incinerate also works great with the grenade launcher. The gene tonics I always use are eve saver, fast feet and head hunter. I wouldn\'t use head hunter if you\'re not planning to make headshots with the grenade launcher or crossbow. Practice and experimenting with new loadouts and seeing which ones you like best will make you a good player. If you have the patience to play until you unlock all these things then my hat\'s off to you. But really, the unlocking system this game uses makes it hard for new players to enjoy and keep playing this game.The other huge problem with this game is all the bugs, glitches and the overall way it is set up. The game suffers from neglect by its developers. The game often lags and crashes due to the player-to-player hosting it uses. There\'s nothing you can do about a bad host or a rage quitter other than ask them to rejoin or wait for them to leave or just start a new lobby if you can get enough players. The game also doesn\'t have any type of protection against cheaters, spammers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Unfortunately, there are lots of those players, so all you can really do to avoid playing with them is wait for them to leave or start a private game and hope they won\'t find a way in. It doesn\'t even have a mute option. By the way, if you\'re using a microphone and it\'s making noise in the game, please turn it it down. You can do this by going to Steam Settings, voice, and turn the slider all the way to the left. Please, nobody wants to have to listen to your♥♥♥♥♥♥while they\'re playing.It\'s an old game. The devs didn\'t put a lot of work into it.  It\'s small and needs more guns and new things, but most of all, it needs A LOT of work. Hopefully one day 2K or someone will remember this game and fix it, but that\'s probably never going to happen. I\'d try this game if you want something different. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I honestly really like Bioshock 2, and I think it is a great contribution to the bioshock series. The reason I probably like this game so much is because of the idea of coming back to rapture 10 years after the first bioshock. In these 10 years it seems like a lot has changed with the splicers, the environment, and the people of rapture. I also really like the story in this one, it's truly compelling with you now being the big daddy. Overall a really great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 places the player back in the undersea world of Rapture.  The game takes place several years after the events of the first game.  In this game you play as Subject Delta, a Big Daddy that is trying to find his Little Sister.  There is more to it, but I'd rather avoid any major spoilers.Rapture looks better than ever in the second entry of the series.  The graphics have been improved in every way.  There isn't any undersea combat, but walking around at the bottom of the sea was a beautiful experience.  The combat and controls have been vastly improved in every way.  Although it was sad to see that the old hacking system was removed, the new one keeps you in battle and has a far more fluid feeling.  The story isn't as interesting as it was in the previous game, but it is far from bad.  They probably should have fleshed out the story from the Minvera's Den DLC and used it for the base game instead.Despite all of the positive aspects of this game, I cannot recommend it.  I don't know if this game is a sloppy console port, but it sure feels like one.  I played this with a GTX 960 (a much better video card than the suggested 8800 GT) and I thought my computer was going to have a meltdown.  The game runs so poorly that the developers should be ashamed.  I spent some time reading other reviews and it doesn't seem like I'm the only person that has had this issue.  I rushed through the game because I was concerned about the strain it was placing on my computer even after drastically reducing the settings. Sad, it might have been fun to play through a second time.If it weren't for the performance issues I would recommend this one. Alas, here we are.  Purchase and play this game at your own risk.

												This is an amazing game for just feeling badass.There are soo many different combinations of tonics and abilities to give you your own playstyle. The weapons are new  and fun to use and with their strange and uique upgrades they become your signiture throughout the game. In my case I used electricity and the drill to rip my enemies apart and had too much fun doing it.The story is incredibly well thought out being easy to follow and immerse yourself in. The story is a good length to with plot twist taking you to new places making the story long enough to enjoy beating up enemies with the loadout you have settled with but not too long as to get boring. The story also has references to the 1st Bio Shock for those that have played it  but is not completely revolved around it to not be confusing to those who haven't.All in all I really think this game is great and a must buy. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, credit to Steam for picking up the responsibility of keeping this game running after 2K and Securom seemingly abandoned it. Not content with awful 64 bit support, the disc version of the game stopped activating when Securom was driven back to hell. Activate the game code in Steam though and everything works fine. Bioshocks 1 and Infinite (""BS"" and ""Limited"" would be better names) may both start with a fanfare and progress with  mighty crescendos, but they soon forget the tune, bore with repetition and end with a spluttering fart. Rarely have games promised so much high concept and delivered so little gameplay. Bioshock 2 is different. You're just dropped straight in and told to get on with it. It's a little underwhelming to start, but the game progresses well. You gather a varied arsenal of plasmids and weapons, upgrade them, explore the non-linear levels at your leisure, and have the opportunity to plan every takedown of the bigger guys and girls. It's all rather satisfying, which was quite a surprise. Even that damn pipemania hacking thing has gone. And your droids have names like Phyllis and Nathaniel (who said I wasn't easily pleased?). In summary, it's hard to see why this gets lower reviews than the other two, but that's the consequence of putting gameplay above glitz. 6/10. Minerva's Den is more of the same with some new stuff, but an odd tendency to crash occasionally. 6/10.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much better than Bioshock 1, I would say. The storyline is clearer and the difficulty is more managable. In Bioshock 1, what frustrated me the most was that I had to keep dying and respawning just to kill a mob, and I was almost always out of ammo every time. This was not the case in Bioshock 2. It also isn't as dull as Bioshock 1, having a larger variety of enemies, environments and weapons. It is also now more convenient to use Plasmids and Weapons as you can equip both at the same time on different hands.Hacking machines also feels less time-consuming.The bug where your customized controls and settings wouldn't save is also fixed from Bioshock 1.The DLC, Minerva's Den, is also very worth the money. It gives a few chapters and hours of extra gameplay with a slightly different arsenal of weapons. I especially love the Ion Laser, which is more effective than the Machine Gun.Rating: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very enticing game. My favorite map to play on was Rust. The intervention is still my favorite weapon thought because of it's high damage rate and it's extremely precise accuracy. The only thing that can compare to the intervention is the barret 50 calibur. That is a very hefty gun with high damgage as well. Also I like how you can invite people into your xbox party so that everyone can talk together, so it's almost as if I have real friends to talk to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sadly, no key is binded for when you are bored to death. Constantly respawning splicers? Check. Lots of troubles finding that for finding that and then protecting Little One from constantly respawning splicers? Check. Constant need for money for health and supplies? Check, as you should be reminded about your everyday burdens. Save your time and money, this game worth very little which can be seen on some streamer's channel anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to Bioshock 1 I found that BS2 is a fantastic sequel which fixes all the bad gameplay ideas from the first game and adds it's own flavor to things. The story is deep and twisted and you should play the first game before this to enjoy it to the fullest. Gameplay: Moving/shooting is solid and weapons really do damage unlike in BS1. You have a lot of choices with weapon upgrades and plasmids (sort of magic in BS-world) and you can make your own ""character build"" to some extent. You can use different approaches when it comes to encountering enemies i.e. hacking security cams to make the enemies trigger the alerts instead of you, shooting through the corridors or confusing your enemies to fight each other with plasmids. Story: Story is dark and gritty and mostly presented with audio recordings. This isn't necessarily the best way to tackle the storytelling but you will be rewarded with a lush backstory if you have the patience to listen. SummaryPros:-Graphix still pretty-Improved gun-/plasmidplay-Story-Atmosphere -All the different options and upgrades Cons: -Story told mostly by audio recordings-No one plays the multiplayer anymore-I encountered some serious crashing during two last levels and lost 3 hours worth of progress. Because of this I encourage everyone to quicksave/save constantly to avoid such thing. Too bad they won't probably be fixing this major problem anymore...Overral a brilliant game that suffers some serious bugs (later in the game for me).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2 is many things; enough to fill the large shoes of Bioshock 1 i would say no, but it is a great amount of fun anyway. You play as Delta one of the first big daddies who must get back to his little sister Elenore or die, but Sofia Lamb is the ""queen"" of Rapture now and you must fight her to get to your goal. Now Lamb isn't as a powerful character as Ryan was but she still is very instresting none the less. She has always fought Ryan even before the 1959 New Year's Eve riots but since Ryan is dead she has taken supreme control of the city with the family or the still very insane Splicers that follower her. Story wise is is pretty straght forward with the same well down vocie acting and diolog, but the story's giant plot twist that the Shock seires has become known for isnt that great. Plus the story was a little contrived, but does this make it a bad game.....no of course not. 2K Marin did a fine job and with the help of Ken Levine they made the game feel like a Shock rather then just run like a Shock game, yet the best thing of Bioshock 2 has to be the combat. Probably the best in any of the three Bioshocks massive improvements made fighting feel very smooth and more importently, fun. Just like Bioshock 1 improved the combat and gameplay machanics of System Shock 2 Marin has done the same to Bioshock 1. From the new trap ammo that allows you to lay traps for the fun ADAM gathering sequences in which you protect your little sister to get some sweet ADAM to the new weapons which look very cool 2k Marin has down a great job at making Bioshock 2 very VERY fun. None the less there are still some issues like the weaker story and some other things like the segments were yourun around with a flash light so it makes the game very spoopy, this really cheeses out the horror bit of Bioshcok 2 and seems to take the easy way out. Sure the game has its low bits but it has its high, Bioshock 2 may not be a bigger and better game os Bioshock 1 but it see,s to fall right next to it. Bioshock 2 isnt a bad game it's just different and different is good like this game is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Her saat başı crash. Crashes every hour give or take. I liked the first one and couldn't wait to play this but then what happened? This game is crashing so many times, I play it like a paranoid, saving every second like it's a save simulator. I don't know if this only happens to me but the weird thing is that I changed my pc and tried again but same thing happened. So I guess god doesn't want me to play this game. Instead, wants me to study for my finals. Anyways..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game, and for all I know it's fantastic. However, the game crashes more than anything else I've ever played, and there are more crash fixes for this game than any other one on the market. There's no telling which one will fix your problem. When I finally found a fix to make the game launch into the ♥♥♥♥ing menu I was able to play for a good two hours, and from what I played it was a ton of fun, but it soon corrupted its own save forcing it to crash on startup again. After an hour of troubleshooting I finally fixed that issue, moved onto the next level and it crashes again constantly at one point in particular with no fix online. Overall the gameplay seemed fun, but none of that matters if the game crashes harder than the New York Stock Exchange in 2008.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Didn't like it.Bioshock 2 is a hollow return to rapture, it just feels like a cash grab from 2k games. I understand that people enjoy the absolute F**k out of the second game, but for me the WHOLE journey just felt so hollow. The writing just isn't up to Bioshock standard also what returns from the first game is awful shooting mechanics.What I Liked about the games:- You get to play as a big daddy (it's kinda coolbeanz)- Beautiful part in the game where you play as a little sister. - More of Rapture-Hacking is 100000000+ times better in the second gameWhat I Didn't like:- Feels like an other-priced expansion pack or a 2k games cash-grab, i cant decided which is which. -The game is INCREDIBLY short, finished in like 8 hours (okay it's kinda long but throughout the story it really drags at times)-The visuals are the same (this isn't bad but the game LOOKS worse for me then the first game, weird, also plays with 30 fps while the first played with solid 60-100)-Writing is bland, doesn't have that memorable Bioshock vibe to it-bad gameplay, shooting mechanics.Not worth your money if your a DIE hard BioShock fan in my opinion			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am full of disappoint!This game is literally just a call back to Bioshock one but you have a new enemy and new weapons. Worth it? I would say no. This rubbish heap belongs back at the bottom of the Atlantic where it might become some nice addition to a coral reef rather than blighting our computers and wasting our time.

												Until just before the first half of this game ends you'll notice that it's ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.  Not bad on the eyes, but the gameplay is garbage due to lacking anything fun.Then something clicks into place as you have enough powerful skills to combo down waves of enemies.  And within a few levels YOU BECOME A ♥♥♥♥ING GOD!!!For rough estimate:First 45% = TrashLatter 55% = COME GET SOME, ♥♥♥♥♥ES, I NEED YOUR CORPSES TO WIPE THE BLOOD OF YOUR FALLEN FROM MY BOOTS!!!Word is the Minerva's Den DLC is even better and without the awful first areas.

												Bioshock 2 places the player back in the undersea world of Rapture.  The game takes place several years after the events of the first game.  In this game you play as Subject Delta, a Big Daddy that is trying to find his Little Sister.  There is more to it, but I'd rather avoid any major spoilers.Rapture looks better than ever in the second entry of the series.  The graphics have been improved in every way.  There isn't any undersea combat, but walking around at the bottom of the sea was a beautiful experience.  The combat and controls have been vastly improved in every way.  Although it was sad to see that the old hacking system was removed, the new one keeps you in battle and has a far more fluid feeling.  The story isn't as interesting as it was in the previous game, but it is far from bad.  They probably should have fleshed out the story from the Minvera's Den DLC and used it for the base game instead.Despite all of the positive aspects of this game, I cannot recommend it.  I don't know if this game is a sloppy console port, but it sure feels like one.  I played this with a GTX 960 (a much better video card than the suggested 8800 GT) and I thought my computer was going to have a meltdown.  The game runs so poorly that the developers should be ashamed.  I spent some time reading other reviews and it doesn't seem like I'm the only person that has had this issue.  I rushed through the game because I was concerned about the strain it was placing on my computer even after drastically reducing the settings. Sad, it might have been fun to play through a second time.If it weren't for the performance issues I would recommend this one. Alas, here we are.  Purchase and play this game at your own risk.

												Much better than Bioshock 1, I would say. The storyline is clearer and the difficulty is more managable. In Bioshock 1, what frustrated me the most was that I had to keep dying and respawning just to kill a mob, and I was almost always out of ammo every time. This was not the case in Bioshock 2. It also isn't as dull as Bioshock 1, having a larger variety of enemies, environments and weapons. It is also now more convenient to use Plasmids and Weapons as you can equip both at the same time on different hands.Hacking machines also feels less time-consuming.The bug where your customized controls and settings wouldn't save is also fixed from Bioshock 1.The DLC, Minerva's Den, is also very worth the money. It gives a few chapters and hours of extra gameplay with a slightly different arsenal of weapons. I especially love the Ion Laser, which is more effective than the Machine Gun.Rating: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game for just feeling badass.There are soo many different combinations of tonics and abilities to give you your own playstyle. The weapons are new  and fun to use and with their strange and uique upgrades they become your signiture throughout the game. In my case I used electricity and the drill to rip my enemies apart and had too much fun doing it.The story is incredibly well thought out being easy to follow and immerse yourself in. The story is a good length to with plot twist taking you to new places making the story long enough to enjoy beating up enemies with the loadout you have settled with but not too long as to get boring. The story also has references to the 1st Bio Shock for those that have played it  but is not completely revolved around it to not be confusing to those who haven't.All in all I really think this game is great and a must buy. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, credit to Steam for picking up the responsibility of keeping this game running after 2K and Securom seemingly abandoned it. Not content with awful 64 bit support, the disc version of the game stopped activating when Securom was driven back to hell. Activate the game code in Steam though and everything works fine. Bioshocks 1 and Infinite (""BS"" and ""Limited"" would be better names) may both start with a fanfare and progress with  mighty crescendos, but they soon forget the tune, bore with repetition and end with a spluttering fart. Rarely have games promised so much high concept and delivered so little gameplay. Bioshock 2 is different. You're just dropped straight in and told to get on with it. It's a little underwhelming to start, but the game progresses well. You gather a varied arsenal of plasmids and weapons, upgrade them, explore the non-linear levels at your leisure, and have the opportunity to plan every takedown of the bigger guys and girls. It's all rather satisfying, which was quite a surprise. Even that damn pipemania hacking thing has gone. And your droids have names like Phyllis and Nathaniel (who said I wasn't easily pleased?). In summary, it's hard to see why this gets lower reviews than the other two, but that's the consequence of putting gameplay above glitz. 6/10. Minerva's Den is more of the same with some new stuff, but an odd tendency to crash occasionally. 6/10.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is this game better than the original?That's hard to say. It's certainly an excellent game. The graphics remain beautiful, the shooting is great, and the melee combat is an improvement. Is the plot better? For this, I would say no. I'm not saying that the plot is bad, far from it, but as good as it is it simply cannot match up to the plot of the first game.Also, the villain (Dr Sophia Lamb) is less compelling or menacing than Andrew Ryan. She is still a compelling character, but less so. Dr Lamb represents the polar opposite of Ryan, espousing the view that all should work together and sacrifice for the common good, to the degree where they lose all autonomy and become little more than drones in a hive.Overall, i would say that this game isn't quite as good as the original, but still manages to be a brilliant game and a sure classic in a trilogy of classics.

The game is a little under 6 years, I think, so it wouldn't be outdated yet.Now the problem. The game constantly crashes.

												Bioshock 2 is many things; enough to fill the large shoes of Bioshock 1 i would say no, but it is a great amount of fun anyway. You play as Delta one of the first big daddies who must get back to his little sister Elenore or die, but Sofia Lamb is the ""queen"" of Rapture now and you must fight her to get to your goal. Now Lamb isn't as a powerful character as Ryan was but she still is very instresting none the less. She has always fought Ryan even before the 1959 New Year's Eve riots but since Ryan is dead she has taken supreme control of the city with the family or the still very insane Splicers that follower her. Story wise is is pretty straght forward with the same well down vocie acting and diolog, but the story's giant plot twist that the Shock seires has become known for isnt that great. Plus the story was a little contrived, but does this make it a bad game.....no of course not. 2K Marin did a fine job and with the help of Ken Levine they made the game feel like a Shock rather then just run like a Shock game, yet the best thing of Bioshock 2 has to be the combat. Probably the best in any of the three Bioshocks massive improvements made fighting feel very smooth and more importently, fun. Just like Bioshock 1 improved the combat and gameplay machanics of System Shock 2 Marin has done the same to Bioshock 1. From the new trap ammo that allows you to lay traps for the fun ADAM gathering sequences in which you protect your little sister to get some sweet ADAM to the new weapons which look very cool 2k Marin has down a great job at making Bioshock 2 very VERY fun. None the less there are still some issues like the weaker story and some other things like the segments were yourun around with a flash light so it makes the game very spoopy, this really cheeses out the horror bit of Bioshcok 2 and seems to take the easy way out. Sure the game has its low bits but it has its high, Bioshock 2 may not be a bigger and better game os Bioshock 1 but it see,s to fall right next to it. Bioshock 2 isnt a bad game it's just different and different is good like this game is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am full of disappoint!This game is literally just a call back to Bioshock one but you have a new enemy and new weapons. Worth it? I would say no. This rubbish heap belongs back at the bottom of the Atlantic where it might become some nice addition to a coral reef rather than blighting our computers and wasting our time. Save your money for something better (like Bioshock Infinite) or just play Bioshock 1 with a scuba helmet on.2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not the first BioShock, hell, it's not even Infinite, but it's still a really good game worth your time. Also, no more Games For Windows Live, and the game finally has gamepad support.

												It's OK. It's a solid game and all the mechanics and gameplay elements are definitely there. There's just something about it that didn't fully jive with me. The story didn't grab like some other games and the environment, though very much quality and full of detail, just constantly reminded me of its superior predecessor. A good game in its own right trapped in the shadow of the game it's supposed to improve upon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just another amazing game in the Bioshock series made by 2K. It's packed with thrills and spills that will keep you on your toes as your surroundings become something to fear. You will find yourself battling the demons that will turn to be your worst nightmare. The game is set in Rapture. Rapture is a massive underwater city forged by the personal dreams of Andrew Ryan to escape from the political, social and religious anxieties of a post-World War II world. It was established on November 5, 1946 and finished in late 1951. You will find yourself at the edge of your seat as you make your way through the undead city while taking in the sights and learning new information.Gore - 8/10action - 9/10Graphics - 8/10story - 10/10multiplayer - 7/10experience - 10/10For some gameplay on the game and just a short viewing of what you can look forward to here's a video for just that.

												I don't think enough people give this game credit. All I heard was that this Bioshock was weak, lame, etc. However, it's pretty clear that it is NOT a true sequel to Bioshock, simply another story that takes place within the same location at a different time. There are small details connecting the two within the game but neither story has anything to really do with the other.Gameplay was familiar so there was no learning curve but fighting Big Daddies and Big Sisters became a challenge. Still too many Plasmids to choose from and use, plus everytime you equip one, it seems to change which is binded to which key, which made utilizing them effectively a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Playing the perspective of a Big Daddy was very cool and certainly a different atmosphere from playing Bioshock. Controls are smooth, game looks nice, it feels different and familiar all at the same time. My only real gripe with the game is that it crashed as I was trying to finish collecting the ADAM samples to draw out Alexander and had to use the '-dx9' command to jury-rig the game so I could finish.I don't think I have the heart to attempt playing the games again to get the other endings, since the Little Sisters are much too sweet to kill. Being called 'best daddy' even though I'm a chick was just too cute and heart warming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you loved the first BioShock, you're gonna love this. The game takes place 10 years after the last, still in the city of Rapture. You'll notice though, it's changed. I really enjoyed this game when I played it, I always looked forward to playing it :) The gameplay mechanics are similar to the first game with something new, you can now duel wield plasmids and weapons! Let me tell you, it certainly does make a difference. Plasmids are like magic, there are different types (Electricity, fire, freeze, ect). There are a fair amount of weapons, from machine guns to shotguns. In the game, you get to play as a Big Daddy (Known as Delta). This game explores the bond between a little sister and a big daddy and makes it seem much more touching. The characters are great and memorable, the story will get you hooked, and the ending is very emotional (Depending on which of the multiple endings you get). Something very cool that they added is that you can go outside Rapture sometimes! It's pretty neat walking around in the water :) Overall, I really enjoyed this game and I highly recommend this game. I give it a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love it! The story is amazing, graphics are good ('specially compared to the first Bioshock!), controls and combat are pristine.Multiplayer is still somewhat alive! There seems to be quite a few people who play every day, and there are times of day when you'll get to try it out; around 6pm or later. It was always my favorite FPS multiplayer, but the xbox Bioshock 2 community died out a long time ago so it's nice to see people still play it on the PC. What's cool about the pvp is that you can type to people while you kill 'em, so there's a good, nice, hopeful community playing the game, we hope the community grows but it's definitely an older game. I've been playing multiplayer every day for the past week or so, and I rarely have to sit and wait for a game.The PvP is awesome. Out of all the shooters I've played, it's my favorite. Everyone has a pretty good amount of health so it's not just 1shot vs 1shot hiding around a corner camping; it's different. I mean, there's still 1shot combos and stuff but not everyone has perfected that so it's pretty fair. Wielding plasmids and shooting lightning bolts and crossbows, and turning invisible are the coolest things ever.It was difficult to set the controls for an Xbox controller, if anyone has any questions (how to edit the sensitivity of an xbox controller for multiplayer) just message me.Edit: the PvP community isn't as good as I thought lmao, I keep trying to play; I try once every few weeks, but everyone's adopted the Grenade Launcher strategy; it's a 1shot kill basically, it's overpowered and everyone kind of hates it. I haven't been able to progress much in PvP. I really miss the old xbox days when there were a lot of people playing every day. Now all I see are the same people using the same 1shot strategies over and over. Stun + crossbow = instant 1shot. grenade launcher = stun/disorient/1shot/range, and if you suicide yourself with the grenade launcher, the other team doesn't get a kill, and there's no penalty. You can stand outside a room and fling grenades into the room and get multiple kills without even aiming or trying. That's what PvP is right now basically, I wish there was a game mode that doubled the health of players, just so it isn't 1shots, but requires slightly more strategy than Electro Bolt / Crossbow, which barely requires aiming skill			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sequel to the critically acclaimed Bioshock.Bioshock 2 is very similar to its predecessor in many regards. As for location, It is set in the same city with the same aesthetics. It takes place a few years after the events of the first game. If you liked the atmosphere of the first game, then you will like this as well.There are a few new added tweaks or abilities to the enemies. New splicers and different renditions of Big Daddies. The gameplay is generally the same. Receive a goal and go through different rooms to achieve that goal and proceed to the next level. However, this game can seem to drag on for a while, and is often repetitive in nature-- doing the same tasks, traveling to some place on the map...etc. It is as if the goal is a carrot dangling right in front of you, but then leads you for hours. However, the rather repetitive gameplay is made more fun by more ""modern"" mechanics, like using plasmids along with a weapon, as opposed to toggling between them in the first one. However, as you are playing as a Big Daddy in this game, moving around feels more clunkly than controlling a human character.The plot is pretty straight forward, without a major twist like the other two games in the series. Similar to the other Bioshock games, you learn alot about the plot and the setting through audio recordings found throughout the levels.Overall, if you enjoyed Bioshock 1, then this game is a good buy, especially with the deep discounts during steam sales.

												First of all ... you play Big Daddy. A BD is tough guy in scuba gear, which can beat out the♥♥♥♥♥♥of bunch of splicers without sweat. BUT you are a special one. So now one splicer can beat out the♥♥♥♥♥♥from YOU. Literally. When I played first Bioshock I always hated BD's because of their skill to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so quickly. Bioshock 2 beaten the score. The game itself is like reunion beteween Doom 3 (boring train sequences) and Bioshock. You start almost same as in the first game, you even walk through game like in ♥♥♥♥ing Dejavu. This is not so important to me but it made my bitter smile so early, that I needed to write it. What is even worse than this copy pasting is the necessity of scavenging and using every ♥♥♥♥ing object to hide. Even the weakest enemies can kill you, when they jump at you and you shoot them in the air to the groin, no damage will appear. Than another big mistake is limitation of your resources. You spend ammo so quickly, but you can have just few mags. Worse case is with health packs and Eve's. And I cannot describe how madly I started laughing, when my wallet was filled with 600 dollars. So you are here, in Rapture, eating and drinking everything in your way to survive another attack of mad splicers. You cannot save your resources for later use and when you really need them, nothing is in reach. Last thing for mention is the Questing. You spend most of the time running in circles to achieve a step in goals like > Well we cannot reach it from here so you need to search for another option. And now you need to run all the way back to the start, because suddenly some door opened. So I sighed and quit.(the best part is when you have level almost done and suddenly game crushes, without save) In my oppinion this game is WORTH one play to the end, just to see the whole story. Because story is strongest part of every Bioshock. And Bioshock 2 has such great story it made me almost feel guilty about what I wrote here. But this unbalanced game will take you through hell and the half path to the surface will be bloody painful. The second one will be boring, because you will become OP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Similar to how I felt about Dead Space 2- if Bioshock just did not have enough Rapture for you, Bioshock 2 is your best bet for more. The drill isn't as game-bustingly OP with gene tonics as the wrench, sadly (what kind of melee weapon not only runs on fuel, but runs out after 5 seconds!?) but at least the Rivet Gun isn't a miserable pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥like the Revolver was.Gameplay changes are minor, the only really notable one being that, as a Big Daddy, you'll spend a lot of time suffering so that your Little Sister doesn't. Defense missions can be tough- but really, offer the game's only substantial challenges.Basically, this should tide you over until Infinite. Worth the $5 I paid easy. Haven't tried the multiplayer- I doubt many have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe not as revelatory and iconic as Bioshock 1 but it fufills the sandbox gameplay and dynamic ecology that the first game could only hint at through it's scripted moments.This is due to really open and sprawling playgrounds and more frequent, prettier but less iconic splicers and the masterstroke of design that is are the big sisters.These new enviroments may lack the punch of the first games but they more than make up for it with a mature depth and flavor. Theres some really sombre and beautiful sentiments, themes and music throughout this, I find it a lot more touching/soulful.A couple of things I dont like are the new hacking and it can also be quite jarring to come straight over to this from the first game and have to learn al these new key placements.

The game itself is good, improvements over were made over the original Bioshock sutch as:-Now its possible to have a gun in one hand and plasmids in the other hand-New hacking system-Intresting story -Slightly improved graphics over the original Bioshock-The game have 6 endings, and the original Bioshock had 2.-The game shows XBOX keys in the menus (this kinda bothered me) put it shows PC keys as well I DO recomend the game, put i DON'T RECOMEND THE STEAM VERSION, this game seens to be designed for consoles and feels like a rushed port for the PC, get it on a XBOX 360 instead (i don't have a XBOX, so i suppose its better than the PC version), if you want to see my PC specs i wrote then all in my profile. Resuming, technicaly is a disaster i have 116 minutes put 80 of those where trying to fix all that is broken in this version, put if you succeed im getting thig game to work its a realy amazing experience with a great story and improved gameplay. Im realy disappointed becouse i love Bioshock franchise and couldn't play this game due to its technical mistakes. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game at launch, and it was pretty bad. GFWL was a nightmare, there was constant crashing, multiplayer was a buggy mess, and the actual campaign was severely lacking. I probably would have given it an overall rating of 4.8/10. A slightly below average game.When it was updated recently, I gave it another try. I do applaud 2K for releasing the massive patch so long after the game was released. For current owners, they got the Minerva's Den DLC for free, GFWL was removed, Steam achievements were added, several bugs were fixed, and multiplayer was much better. Still not perfect though. Lots of lag and no proper anti-cheat in multiplayer, and lots of crashing in single player. Anyway, on to the main game. The biggest problem I had with the story was that it felt the exact same as the first one. The villain, Sofia Lamb supposedly had entirely different point of view than Andrew Ryan of the original game, but it didn't feel like that because the way she carried out her actions and the way she talked/presented herself was the exact same as Ryan. Some of the endings were a little cliche, the writing for Eleanor had some really cheesy and mediocre moments, and the overall story just didn't feel right. Like, it was all based around this relationship between Eleanor and you, a big daddy. And you're not even her actual father or anything haha. It was just strange. Cool idea, but I think it could have been written better. I do think a few of the added moral choices were a great touch, how a few main characters fates were all dependent on you. Soundtrack was also fantastic. And while the multiplayer is completely unnecessary, when it worked, sometimes it was pretty fun. The whole background was kinda cool, how it all takes place when Rapture goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥ But of course, there's a stupid levelling system tacked onto it which can kill interest quick. Had to grind for so long to get the last few achievements. Gameplay wise, there was definitely an improvement. Instead of having all the different types of tonics, they were just grouped under one general selection. Dual wielding was great, and many of the weapons were a lot of fun to use. However, just like the first one, the movement is clunky, the FOV is awful and the guns still felt sluggish. Graphics are ugly for a 2010 game, and environments were practically identical to the original. Enemy variety was essentially the same, and the constant Big Sister fights were just annoyingly tedious and stupid. I guess I'd give BioShock 2 a flat 6.0/10. It's a decent game. There are definitely improvements from the original, and a few great ideas. However, throughout the campaign, it just really felt like 2K was beating a dead horse. Get it on a sale. As far as the Minerva's Den DLC goes, it gets universal praise everywhere I see it. I really didn't think it was that special to be honest. The story was decent and the pacing was good, but the gameplay just felt like more of the same. I'd give it 5.5/10, it's an above average add-on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I found the gunplay largely unsatisfying and the storyline lackluster, it is ultimately the poor quality of the port that leads me to ultimately recommend against Bioshock 2. Expect to crash if you use DX10 and continue to randomly crash anyways with DX10 disabled. Adjustments to mouse sensitivity need to be reset every time you relaunch the game and sometimes during the game when reloading a save. Though improved over Bioshock 1 in some areas, the UI is still quite clunky and obviously controller-oriented.As much as I would like to explore more of the Bioshock universe, the combined effects of the above led me to finally drop the game without completing it. It simply isn't worth the hassle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A follow up to the original Bioshock, this game lacks the charm and character of the original game. Gone is the commentary on anything interesting or meaningful, or characters you have any reason to care about.The gameplay is not any better than it was in Bioshock, either - there are some minor improvements, but the problem lies in the fact that ultimately, the gameplay was never all that great, and the changes were barely noticable. The enemies are no more interesting now than they were then, and the environments feel less interesting due to the lack of character and reason to care about them. The rehash of the world doesn't help this one bit.No, the game doesn't really present any good reason to play it, and it will eat up 20+ hours of your time to play. I'd advise skipping it.

												A bad console-to-PC port. No wonder this studio was later shut down.The controls are terrible. If you want to play, be sure to get an XBox Controler for PC.The game crashes during saves about 10% of the time, occasionally leading to file corroption which will require you to go out and find your save files and manually figure out which files are bad before you can delete them.Game play itself is pretty good, though there are a number of problems; the drill is worthless until about half way through the game when you can get the drill rush skill.The story of Bioshock 2 is entertaining, but it is also flawed. I won't bother going into it.Read elsewhere about the controversy regarding DLC, unmet release promises, and other bumbling stupidity by 2K.For my critisim above, I have one exception: Minerva's Den. If you do decide to play Bioshock 2, be sure to play this. The rest of Bioshock 2 may be disappointing, but aside from being fairly short, Minerva's Den won't be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a great game. The story is not as good as the first one's but it is enough to keep you playing just to know how it will end. As the first game, this game send you messages of all kinds and more directly since the main antagonist is a clinical psychiatrist. made me think a lot. I wish there was more people playing multiplayer, since it's awesome!!! (really, using plasmids and shooting around is very entertaining. Just one thing, if you are VERY trypophobic like me, AVOID AT ALL COSTS THE SINGLE PLAYER'S SWARM PLASMID (I just can't help it, I don't like seeing my hand full of bee-hive-like holes).

												A masterpiece of game design and atmosphere, Bioshock 2 is the best game in the series. All of the combat and balance issues are fixed, making this substantially more enjoyable to play, and while it makes some obvious retcons, the story is a jewel - eschewing Bioshock's anti-capitalist theme in favor of a meditation on the meaning of family. Truly one of the greatest games ever made, I can not recommend Bioshock 2 highly enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock 2.I've heard that some really don't like it.Maybe they're just like the guys selling bootleg tech at the night markets where I used to go; loud as hell and they make a decent amount of sense, but boy are they annoying.Maybe it's the story; I told my friends about the halfway mark that the story didn't make a lot of sense and can go suck a big fat one, but that becomes much less true towards the end,Maybe it's the gameplay; largely unchanged, only now, as you're playing a prototype Big Daddy, you becomes way more powerful and the horror element just kind of shows itself tokenly, but it is a hell of a lot of fun.You know what I think?It felt underwhelming to the naysayers because Bioshock 1 was just too good.It feels like the Portal problem again.The first one was so good with its story that Bioshock 2 was held to the same standard, but B2's story wasn't as strong as B1's because B1 just set the bar too damn high.Take off your rose-tinted glasses and you'll find a damn fun shooter; slow, maybe, but fun.Refuse to do so and you'll find yourself quite underwhelmed, and I doubt anyone can blame you for that.This game still comes recommended, and anyone who thinks otherwise might perhaps be looking for a story, in which case, go get Bioshock 1.

												Bioshock 2-An odd game indeedThe first bioshock was a milestone in game progression with story, setting, and enviorment. Bioshock was so unique because it was a different type of shooter with RPG elements. The story itself was movie quality writing and for that, it earned it's reputation, Bioshock 2 is like if you took Bioshock 1 and drop it in the dirt, it's the same game, but if you wipe it off, it's pretty fun. The story while not as astounding as the first, was still pretty good. The new characters are not as memorable as Andrew Ryan, but there are some nice editions. Missions and plasmids have been greatly updated. The game is without-a-doubt not as good as Bioshock, but it isn't bad. Infact, it's pretty good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's no Shyamalanian twist in the middle like the first game, and there are no dramatic differences in gameplay, so I can see why people didn't like this game.Of course, rather than being completely different, Bioshock 2 is just better than the first game in just about every way.  -  The weapons and plasmids are cooler, more varied and just more fun to use.  -  The enemies are more varied (much more exciting than just people who shoot at you).  -  The levels are more varied and less filler-y.-  The characters are better explored.-  The plot is intimate and character driven.-  The player character has a much greater stake in the plot than the first game's protagonist.-  You will be made to feel for the villain and her family.

												Poorly ported to PC. Audio cuts out for everyone constantly. Random crashes galore. GFWL used to be a problem, but they finally ported this piece of garbage to Steamworks, that's one less problem with it. The enemies are very cookiecutter, the gameplay is dull, to the point of nothing can kill you because you're just Dr. Manhattan stomping through Rapture. You trip over ammo/medkits/money every 5 inches. No challenge at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I came into  bioshock 2 with no info on the bioshock universe or anything about the series besides that there are big dadies and it is in the ocean . Personally i love this game and think it is much better than bioshock infinite merely because of better gunplay by far, there are also MANY other reasons why it is better. also i belive this is a great example of how you can make a really good somewhat linear Campaign,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10 - Like BioShock, but better in probably every single wayGameplay is more or less the same, with different weapons (like the really satisfying drill) but with the same variety. The new enemies are really neat to fight against (the plasmid-wearing Big Sisters for instance are a joy to kill despite their strength and♥♥♥♥♥kicking potential) and Rapture is still charming as ever.The plot follows the BioShock school of a degenerate leader turning into what he despite, but this time with a communist doctor instead of a cut-throat master of economics. The exquisite audio diaries are back for the player's pleasure and the Little Sisters are even cuter than before (really, the first time I heard one say ""the angel remembers... 'mommy', who is that?"" was one of my high-points of the game).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's get this out of the way: the story isn't as good as the first one; I still enjoyed it a lot but it can't compare to meeting Andrew Ryan in his office.The gameplay is quite better than in the previous game: the drill is a hundred times more fun than the wrench and changing the photography camera for a videocamera was a great  decision. For those that hated the hacking minigame, you can be happy to know that it was removed and replaced by a really fast system.If you get this game you should get the dlcs as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THe least favorite bioshock. Still worh the buy and playthrough, if you're really into the franchise. But if you just played bioshock one, you'll be much happier to skip right to bioshock infinite. The story is just not that compelling. It's more content in the same vein as the first bioshock, but it just feels a bit drug out and I really only recomend it to die-hard fans of the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much the same game as the original. It's alright but I can only play it so far then it just crashes,  won't let me go any further. I believe the name of the area it crashes is called Pauper's Drop. Luckily I bought this during a STEAM sale. I'd say I got my $3-$5 worth or whatever I paid, because that's all I got to play $3-$5 worth. (o)_(O).. :)  I give it a thumbs down because it crashes, otherwise I would give it a thumbs up.

												Bioshock 2.I've heard that some really don't like it.Maybe they're just like the guys selling bootleg tech at the night markets where I used to go; loud as hell and they make a decent amount of sense, but boy are they annoying.Maybe it's the story; I told my friends about the halfway mark that the story didn't make a lot of sense and can go suck a big fat one, but that becomes much less true towards the end,Maybe it's the gameplay; largely unchanged, only now, as you're playing a prototype Big Daddy, you becomes way more powerful and the horror element just kind of shows itself tokenly, but it is a hell of a lot of fun.You know what I think?It felt underwhelming to the naysayers because Bioshock 1 was just too good.It feels like the Portal problem again.The first one was so good with its story that Bioshock 2 was held to the same standard, but B2's story wasn't as strong as B1's because B1 just set the bar too damn high.Take off your rose-tinted glasses and you'll find a damn fun shooter; slow, maybe, but fun.Refuse to do so and you'll find yourself quite underwhelmed, and I doubt anyone can blame you for that.This game still comes recommended, and anyone who thinks otherwise might perhaps be looking for a story, in which case, go get Bioshock 1.

												        I am a huge fan of the bioshock series I have played # 1, half of 2, and infinite and I recommend you at least try all the games give them a chance. It can be scary, creepy, and awsome all rolled into one. The story line is complexed and awsome and pretty long but it keeps you sucked into it. One bummer is that it has high mouse sensitivity if you dont have a logitech controller.                                                                                                                             8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every time I play for around a half hour it crashes and before anything big happens in the game, I have to save it incase it crashes (which it does) so if you don't have a better computer than me DON'T BUY THE GAME I will save you about $20.00 USD if you listen to me.

												Overlook by most Bioshock fans, this game is a gem that is extremely well made.  People probably didn't like it because it was made with a different developer and it didn't really have much horror as the first one but with other features, this game still is solid and possibly better.  The story is great and fairly long.  It follows you as a Big daddy who is trying to rescue his little sister and you make moral choices along the way in which affects the ending and what happens during the game.  The gameplay is amazing.  There is alot to do and it added alot from the first game.  I really like all the powers and guns which expanded from the last game.  There is also better side quests and better objects to collect.  It has a nice system for everything and its highly worth.  This game doesn't end there though.  There is a pretty decent multiplayer and its fairly fun but it is not for everyone.  It is still a nice addition.  Its a must have game to play for anyone who likes a different kind of rpg.

												Bioshock 2.I've heard that some really don't like it.Maybe they're just like the guys selling bootleg tech at the night markets where I used to go; loud as hell and they make a decent amount of sense, but boy are they annoying.Maybe it's the story; I told my friends about the halfway mark that the story didn't make a lot of sense and can go suck a big fat one, but that becomes much less true towards the end,Maybe it's the gameplay; largely unchanged, only now, as you're playing a prototype Big Daddy, you becomes way more powerful and the horror element just kind of shows itself tokenly, but it is a hell of a lot of fun.You know what I think?It felt underwhelming to the naysayers because Bioshock 1 was just too good.It feels like the Portal problem again.The first one was so good with its story that Bioshock 2 was held to the same standard, but B2's story wasn't as strong as B1's because B1 just set the bar too damn high.Take off your rose-tinted glasses and you'll find a damn fun shooter; slow, maybe, but fun.Refuse to do so and you'll find yourself quite underwhelmed, and I doubt anyone can blame you for that.This game still comes recommended, and anyone who thinks otherwise might perhaps be looking for a story, in which case, go get Bioshock 1.

Product received for free
												This game is exetrememly fun, where the story is lacking, the gameplay makes up for it, it's very satisfying to roam around as the the big daddy, and it also brings you back to that classic rapture that we all know and love from the first game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
