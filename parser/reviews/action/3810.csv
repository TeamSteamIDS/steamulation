FOR WINDOWS 7/8 TIPS ON HOW TO RUN THE GAME SMOOTHLY AND WITHOUT ISSUES, SEE BELOW!BloodRayne is truely a nostalgic classic for me and I have to say, I still enjoy this title even after 12 years of my initial first playthrough. It has many flaws, but above all these, it has a swift and amusing gameplay, great heroine constantly throwing out black humor quotes and the ""cutting system"" (you can literally cut any imaginable little piece of body, like a quarter of face or piece of fingers. Or you can slice and dice the bad guys like a bread into a thousand of segments - what a highly sophisticated technology for such an old game! :-D ) of enemies can be really strangely satisfying.Sadly, as this is an old game, it has issues when you try to run it on newer versions of Windows, such as low resolution, crashes and also sound clipping during cutscenes. I did my research and manage to find an ultimate solution for every problem:To solve crashes, go to your Steam directory Steam/steamapps/common/BloodRayne and in the folder, right click on rayne.exe and set it's compatibility mode to Windows 98/ME. Also, be sure to check you have disabled the DPI scaling (it is in the same tab as the compatibility setting). This solved all the crashes for me and I haven't got a single crash in 4 hour playthrough.For low resolution solution, launch the Bloodrayne first and after entering the menu, starting a new game, go through the first cutscenes and then quit the game. After that, go to your Steam directory Steam/steamapps/common/BloodRayne/system and in the folder, open rayne.ini - In the .ini file, search for these two gamePIXY= gamePIXX= and after the ""="", type your desired resolution (for example gamePIXY=1440 gamePIXX=2560). I run the game in 2560x1440 without any problem.And finally, to solve the sound clipping issue, install MSI Afterburner. The clipping is caused by the fact that the game is designed to run on 30 FPS max and newer computers run it on higher FPS - that is causing the problem. So you have to lock/cap your FPS to 30. To do that, install MSI Afterburner and load it. Wait until a RivaTuner icon shows in your system tray and after that, right click on it, select Show and set your FPS limit in the interface to 30 FPS. Remember to always turn Afterburner on if you want to play BloodRayne.Hope this will help to enjoy this great classic! Cheers!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""There are far worse things a man has to stand than death.""Dracula (1931)BloodRayne or Blood-Rain?!It was one of my first games since i play video games. Yeah, it's a classic for me, so i love it. The whole game is really funny and has a very sexy and cool main character. The Combat-System: here blood, there blood, everywhere blood blood?! Of course, Bloodrayne isn't soft. You can choose between your bladed weapons or a large number of different firearms. Who needs a medic when you can drink blood to recover, a harpoon can help you to catch your victim. Special skills help in the fight against different types of opponents. In the first part of the Bloodrayne-saga, you only run from level to level and fight against lots of enemies. The degree of difficulty grows with each level. The level-design seems confuse at first, but later it makes sense. The checkpoint-system is sometimes really annoying. If you die in one of the levels, you have to repeat the whole level again, because there aren't special-checkpoints. Last Point - Graphics: What do you expect? The game is old and this isn't a remake!To bring it to the point: It is a cool oldschool Hack & Slay, no more, no less. 7,5/10In summary:  Pro Contra   + sexy main character - annoying checkpoint-system   + funny - some dialogues are cut off   + bloody PS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point. I hope it will help you in your decision. ",373,155,8,48,39,5,63

												This game is definitely fun for a couple of days.The controls are tight,many reviewers had no idea what they were talking about,or their computer was no good. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous for such an old game,blur effects are done perfectly.It utilizes 4 completely different vision modes,which all are very useful, and sometimes required to beat a level, the vision modes are not just eye candy.The only down side is the voice acting was mediocre at best,and the storyline was non-existant.I beat the game on hard in 5-6 hours,so you can imagine there isn't much replay value in this one.However this game is filled with eye candy. So if you're just looking to cut nazis and ghouls to ribbons this is your game,but if you're looking for something full of story look elsewhere.			",321,98,7,49,25,6,44

												A very messy and bloody vampire games that looks on the outside very cheap and fake. Lucky for us it's a game with a super hot vampire chick that sucks blood from enemy all the time and make sexy sound when she does it.You have guns.. harpoon.. twin shoulder blade.. and your teeth. The beginning training maps are fighting against spider monster but when you reach main game you fight nazi in world war two.You have a list of nazi ladies and gentleman that you have to kill and when you done that list.. there is a second list...During the game.. you get to fight though about 10,000 enemies and even have fun riding a mech warrior to assasinate an amory officer..There are some small joke here and there Rayne makes which is quite fun to hear the first time.Also.. science research is required for the female chest in this game.. those bonuce are just not possible..I played and completed this game many years ago on console and it's still great fun replaying it on steam. The porting optimization wasn't perfect and there are some issues. Mainly noticable one are cinamatic looping problem that i ran into a couple times and sometime it takes abnomally long to load to next scene...Overall it's still great fun.. 8/10 for hot vamp chick!

												The game is absolutely stunning and gives immersing experience. Graphics and physics are still looking good despite the fact Bloodrayne has been out there for over a decade. Apparently, the plot seems a bit naive nowadays, but at that time it looked astonishing. Combat system is quite nice and brings a lot of fun, one just has to get use to it. The checkpoint system is quite annoying though, as the game on hard difficulty is very challenging. Incredibly great soundtrack and atmospheric ambient sound. I personally find the first BR better than the BR2, and for all these years Bloodrayne remains one of the best games I've ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First things first, BloodRayne isn't a bad game and its far from that. I don't recommend it to anyone if you're playing on a newer operative system. The game will crash, the game will glitch, the game will run ""too fast"", the voice will get cut. I got tired of messing with the game files and ended buying the GOG version and problem solved. I don't know why the game hasn't been optimised on Steam too. Such a shame.In the current state of this game (on Steam) I can't recommend it.			",210,31,7,31,8,3,20

												Bloodrayne is a third-person, action, hack and slash game that originally came out on October 15, 2002. It's been 11 years since i last played it on the original XBOX. Exploring the levels and meeting all the antagonist and monsters again is really nostalgic. Rayne is the main protagonist in the game. She is a dhampir who is in search of her father; Kaegan. She is later recruited into the Brimstone Society and that is where the game begins. Story:The story in Bloodrayne is not complex at all. You and your mentor Mynce from the Brimstone Society are sent to Mortton, Lousiana to investigate a disease that is turning humans into mutates. The unique enemy in this act are called Maraisreqs. Not much happens in this act apart from your first boss fight the Queen of the Underworld and your first meet with Jurgen Wulf (The main antagonist) who is the founder of the G.G.G and is trying to become immortal by acquiring powerful relics scattered across the world. The next act takes place 5 years later in Argentina, Rayne is assigned to eliminate several high ranking G.G.G.(Gegengeist Gruppe) officers before they can get ahold of one of the powerful relics. These officers serve as the mini-boss and bosses of the game. Midway through the act a new enemy type is introduced called Daemites. Act III takes place in Germany. Rayne is assinged a new list of G.G.G targets to eliminate. This act also introduces another enemy type called Feral Vampires. I can't put the rest of this act in words without spoiling major parts of the story.Gameplay:The combat system is plain and repetitive but enjoyable; Rayne's primary weapons are her blades which can do up to a 5 meele combo as long as she makes contact with an enemy. Her secondary weapons are guns. There are about 33 different weapons including Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Dynamite and Grenade Launchers) in the game. She has 8 slots for weapons, 3 for light weapons, 3 for heavy weapons, 1 for grenades and 1 for special weapons. Rayne has 3 unique abilities that she can use, one from the start of the game and two you unlock in Argentina. Aura Sense: Targets and destinations will shine bright blue, Dilated Perception: Slow motion, and Extruded View: Allows you to zoom. The game will take you anywhere from 6-8 hours to complete.Pros:+ Basic but enjoyable combat.+ Decent amount of variety.+ Great level progression.+ Immersing experience.+ Rayne's dialogue.Cons:- Checkpoint system can be an annoyance at times.- Graphics are outdated.- The last few words of all dialogue in cutscenes cuts out. (Fixed by turning V-Sync ON = 30 FPS)Notes:""Another man falling to pieces over me."" ― Rayne			",3606,1432,138,428,519,48,580

												Now, now, where to begin with?To put it simply, this game is like a big budget cult B-movie, if that makes any sense! I had played it back in the day in the first Xbox and I was unsure if I would still like it, however replaying it was quite a satisfying experience, so sit back and let me explain:--- What is good about this game:- It contains and blends many many elements from other successful games and does that quite well, namely it has elements from: Max Payne: graphics and eternal night atmosphere are similar, there is a slow motion mode here as well, named Dilated Perception and even the game's name has the same pun (max payne/max pain, bloodrayne/blood rain). To top it all, there's also a level where you have to escape from fires & explosions, much like in a Max Payne level!Return to Castle Wolfenstein (and the Raiders of the Lost Ark Indiana Jones movie): the game is filled with classic power hungry Nazis who seek supernatural relics, as well as zombies, vampires and other monsters, you couldn't ask for more! You can feel the rottenness in the air everywhere! (the spiders of the initial levels even reminded me of Dead Space's necromorphs at times)Devil May Cry: similar gameplay, where you wield both a close range sword-like weapon (dual blades in this case) and a long range type weapon, namely pistols, rifles and rocket launchers!You also get to jump quite high, which is great, since you avoid much platforming and feel like a true vampire. In fact, Rayne's single jump is of the same length, if not a bit greater, as Dante's double jump!- The atmosphere and music are quite good, despite their age, you have your classic zombie/vampire/third reich horror setting, where the dawn of the day is almost nonexistent. However, since it's an action game and Rayne is quite unstoppable, it's not as scary as, say, the Resident Evil or Dead Space games, where your movements are more confined (though there is a level where a horde of worm-like zombies chase you and you are weaponless and can only run, that was quite a tense and scary moment).- The heroine of the game, Rayne, is a really hot and kickass redhead, pretty much the female half-vampire equivalent of Blade and she kills/dismembers every enemy with quite some style and as a matter of fact she also swears a lot! You'll hear the F-word and B-words (both male and female one) quite some times and towards the end she even shows the middle finger! Not even the God of War games, despite their gore and violence, have so much swearing! She also, like Max Payne, speaks many witty and cheesy lines!Sucking Blood from various enemies is quite cool as well and as is the Blood Rage mode, which is your typical limited time Berserker/God mode, where you are almost invincible for a short period of time... and dismember every poor enemy in your way!In a particular level you even get to drive a Mech suit, felt really cool too!- The old fashioned cheats system the game enables you to input, where among them existed a cheat that enlarged the female characters' breasts (!) and another that showed how the main character would look like if all the weapons she carried were on her body! There's even a hidden thank you message cheat!- Violence, decapitations, dismemberments, swearing, buckets of blood sprayed everywhere... oh, did I mention violence?--- What is bad about this game:- It feels too much like a true B-movie (or B-game, if you want) at times and the graphics are quite dated for our day.- The gameplay is a bit restricted and you pretty much end up doing the same and the same after a certain point, but I cannot totally blame it, since even Max Payne (or other great 3rd person games) had quite a bit of repetitiveness, but I never saw anyone complain!The slowmotion ability is not as good as Max Payne's however, as it's infinite and it doesn't really add superspeed to your movements, alas just the ability to see everything slower and move accordingly at your pace, but it gets too slow and boring to use most of the time.The game's blades are also limited in their attacks (unlike the long range weapons which have some variety at least) and end up quite boring too to use (except from a stealth fatality attack which dismembers unaware enemies from behind and is quite cool, but rare).- While Rayne is almost unstoppable (a lot thanks to being able to blood-suck dry almost any enemy, except bosses of course), in the limited occasions where you lose you have to start the whole level from the beginning, as there are no checkpoints or a free save system. That made the game quite frustrating.- The initial swamp levels are a bit misleading about the game's entertainment factor, as I've heard of people dropping the game because of them. Just have some patience, when the Nazis enter the scene, the fun begins!All in all, that said, I wholeheartedly recommend the game for cult B-movie lovers: it's dated, cheesy and filled with swearing and gratouitous violence, what's not to like??!

												The action adventure market is crowded with titles these days, with developers and publishers trying to create the next Mrs. Croft, but as many publishers are finding out, making a decent action adventure game is no small task. Majesco was obviously feeling confident when they enlisted Terminal Reality to create BloodRayne, though. The folks at Terminal Reality are no strangers to the genre, with one pretty damn scary action adventure called Nocturne under their belts.Their  project known as BloodRayne is a fast-paced action oriented blood-fest. The game is brimming with violence and animated boobs - yes, animated bouncing boobs. It's got plenty of eye-candy and some really good action. So is it good enough to warrant your attention?As the half-vampire BloodRayne, you have sworn your life to protect humanity from the supernatural. (Bad monsters, as opposed to good monsters like you) Your latest assignment: Seek and destroy the nefarious vampire Jurgen Wolf before he can use powerful occult relics to unleash untold horror upon the world. Jurgen is a Nazi of course, and our heroine BloodRayne is employed by the secretive anti-Nazi society (Brimstone) to thwart his evil plans.BloodRayne is a product of her human mother's♥♥♥♥♥♥by her vampire father. Born with powers of a vampire without all the weaknesses, and just like Blade, BloodRayne is on the edge and very hard to contain. She puts the hurt on Nazis like you wouldn't believe - chopping off limbs, snapping spines and sucking their blood to feed. Her only weakness is water. BloodRayne doesn't like water - in fact, if she stays in it for too long, she dies. By making her vulnerable to water, the designers have in fact found a clever way to limit BloodRayne's movement, and make the game appear less linear than it really is.But even with this clever trick the designers couldn't really disguise the game's obvious linearity. Gameplay wise this is not a downside as BloodRayne doesn't really try to be anything but a straight-up linear action game. There is a lot of fighting, shooting and gallons of blood being splattered across the walls. Luckily, the action is as smooth and interesting as in any action adventure out there. In fact, it is even comparable to the feel of Max Payne. There are just so many things that Terminal Reality's new Infernal Engine can do.Visually, it does a wonderful job of creating different types of environments. Scary settings, outdoor areas, cool looking Victorian style houses - there are just loads of tricks that this piece of code can pull off. The bump mapping effects on the models look awesome, the camera work is fluid and it doesn't take away from the action. The models look detailed and very well animated, and the real-time shadow effects are eye-catching but not too intrusive. In a word, the engine boasts some very solid visuals for an action adventure game. The water surfaces look beautiful and the reflection of the moon in the water adds a special flair to the outdoor areas. Because of the excellent animation, bump-mapping and the engine's proprietary bullet-time effect the action looks smooth and very appealing. As far as the controls are concerned it all works very fluently and intuitively. BloodRayne can use both of her hands to fight. You'll be controlling the left hand with one mouse button and the other one with your right mouse button. What this does is give more freedom during fights to choose between melee type of attacks, and ranged weaponry, which includes all manners of fire arms like bazookas and chainguns. I should also mention that the physics engine works very well and that almost every object in the game is destructible. The levels themselves are decently designed. As I said, the game is linear but the designers have provided a nice enough combination of indoor and outdoor environments and some very interesting boss creatures to keep the player interested at all times. The level design and puzzles are not nearly as versatile as in say, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but they're tough enough to provide a decent challenge for the player. The same goes for the AI routines. Nazis are fairly smart and I couldn't notice any serious flaws in their behavior while playing the game. The AI code never took my attention away from the action, which is good enough for me.The only thing that this game truly lacks is a half-decent story and professional voice acting. Action adventure games are as much about the story and character development, as they are about cool action and dazzling 3D effects. Unfortunately, BloodRayne is completely lacking in this department. The story is mundane, uninspiring, and above all, is not conveyed well. It never really grabs your attention as the game never bothers to truly explain any of the character's motives, much less explaining the story's chapter jumps. The plot has done virtually nothing to further my interest in this game. Tolkien once said that people are usually attracted to the history behind a story, and the realization that there is a huge wealth of information and proceedings that led up to the events in it. BloodRayne has virtually none of this. You don't feel a part of the game world, and you don't know why you are there. The history behind it all isn't properly explained and the narrators have failed to create a living and breathing fantasy world.In summary, great action, smooth controls and a very good 3D engine can only do so much for a game. Ultimately, you have to have a decent story in there and some good voice acting to make the entire thing believable and immersing. Without these crucial components an action adventure game can never truly become great. BloodRayne is a decent action-adventure that should provide players with some fun moments, albeit without any background or meaning to it. I had fun with it, but not as much fun as I could've had if the story and voice acting were even half-decent.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

Slaughter Nazi's with a multitude of weapons and vampiric powers such as Slo mo, heat vision, panzerschreck's and MG42's.  Additionally Rayne's is hot as hell so no complaints there and besides she was also in Playboy magazine. Don't judge me.....Final Score: 79/100			",227,11,6,18,16,2,32

												Bloodrayne takes us back to the action hack & slash games of old,providing a simple yet enjoyable experience.Pros:-good combat/movement controls keep the fights fun-lots of gore and dismemberment-Rayne as a character is truly enjoable,albeit very one-dimensional-interesting special powers (especially bullet time)-decent level variety-story is cliche but keeps the game going-decent overall length-killing nazis never gets oldNeutral:-save system is pretty brutal,if you die you restart the level potentially losing up to 10/15 minutes of playCons:-being an old game,you might have to work on it a bit to make it start/support more resolutions/etc,a Google search is enough to fix everything for most people-navigating some levels can get annoying due to lack of a proper map-a few irksome jumps-some difficulty spikes here and there-melee combat feels a bit underpowered at times-feeding can often be used to make most fights trivialOverall Bloodrayne is a good game for its genre due to its nice combat system,liberal use of violence and interesting setting.It surely'd be called a one-trick pony,you're basically doing the same things over and over,but what it does it does well and it provides enough mindless fun to be a recommended purchase (on sale,due to its age).

												Vampirella slices and dices her way thru Nazi Bases, Castles, Mines etc and Demon Hordes! Blood! Guts! More Blood! Wearing someone like Lederhosen!This got abit of flak in the press iirc but was and is still one of my favorites. Basically you run around and murder a whole lot of everything over and over with optional infinite bullet time. Could easily be very repetetive and boring but miraculously not (for me at least) - I think because it hits a combination of level design, length, enemy variation and challenge spot on. Also its sooo cheesy in a good way.Combined with the fluid controls (despite having no lock on, or maybe thats exactly the reason) and just how fun it is to mince everything and splatter pulp all over the place it just never gets old to replay.Downside is it still (despite having a steam version now) requires alot of farting around to get a controller working right (no native xbox controller support like basically everything else nowadays since the game predates the console) and it gets increasingly glitchy the faster your system is apparently  (game folder system/render.ini syncRetrace=1 for a speed bump).

												Game is very good in my opinion. Although there are some issues launching it when you finally in the game you will be happy you went through the troubles. I would appreciate developers fixing the compatibility issues. Bloodrayne is kick♥♥♥♥♥chararacher and is very hot. Graphics are very good for the time. Controls are a bit quirky but it didn't affect the enjoyment from the game. The bosses are great challenge and compliting the game felt very satisfying. There were even some puzzles.So yeah, the game is good. Looking forward to playing part 2.			",135,9,0,6,0,0,2

												I've grown up with this game on my PS2, and it sucks that this game, and BloodyRayne 2 constantly freeze up on my computer. I love the games and comics and I'd recomend the series to anyone becuase it's just so interesting, but it just sucks that I can't play them. Please fix it soon. :/			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved this game back in the day. The Steam version is unplayable. It doesn't lock the mouse, so every time you try to attack you actually click outside the game, making the game minimize. Very annoying. Playing with a controller might help. Or I could install additional software to force lock the cursor. But why would I go out of my way when this should be a non-issue for a newly purchased game?			",63,39,0,18,7,0,9

 You've downloaded MSI Afterburners and RivaTuner to address the game running so fast it cuts off dialogue (finding out the hard way that .ini rewriting and nvidia setting options won't work in your case). You've opened up task manager, went to the details of the executable and set affinity to run only on one core so it doesn't freeze randomly. You've downloaded the patch that allows you to use a gamepad with this, because it's a console port after all. You've installed the anti-censorship patch so you're taking down Nazis and not the Third-Rate Reich. You've messed with resolutions and texture options and such to try and get it running well because you had to run it on one core to get it working at all and the 733 Mhz minimum requirement is a lie.Your reward? An ugly pile of mediocrity and palpable budget cuts.Bloodrayne starts off strong. And then, after an extended period of boredom, it even ends off strong. But for every smart piece of dialogue, genuinely well done setpiece or interesting idea there's fundamental design flaws, lack of polish and jank that just prevents this from being worth playing.""Quiet, baby, what would the neighbours think?""- Bloodrayne after hacking nazis into little screaming gibletsMost games are frontloaded, starting with their best content and gradually petering out. Bloodrayne reverses this trend, starting you in a reasonably alright level, then flatlining into 4 hours of spamming melee attacks in long concrete corridors, with 3 enemy types and more reused generic assets than a Greenlight game, before packing all the best content in the end.Throughout this, the plot is great. As in stupid. Your thrice-dead mentor leads you on a wild goose chase after a villian in search of a demon's lost body bits. You get KKK-decked occult priests preaching and flirtatious colonel twins toting one arm and ninja stars. When Bloodrayne indulges the absurdity, it's at its best.There's something inherently funny about genderbending Dr. Mengele and giving him a massive rack.But this is kept back from one fatal flaw in its incredible b-movie glory: it's not fun. ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA""- your mentor, dying for realsies after pretend-dying twice and just seconds beforehand turning coatThe camera spazzes out so much it's nauseating. It can't cope with the interior areas and will jerk back and forth as it struggles to navigate the environment, which is always. Melee ""combos"" are nonexistent, there's just a series of attacks that mostly trigger in whatever order they feel like while you fish for a decapitation.Hit detection is a shot in the dark. It quickly devolves into pseudo-QWOP, throwing your limp fish of a half-vampire into the fray and dancing about while hoping that decapitation RNGesus favours you. Ranged isn't much of an option due to the absurd ammo limits.Bosses are so damage spongey and ridiculously offensive that they quickly just turn into puzzles into how to cheese them. Perhaps this time you'll spam Rage mode, or abuse their terrible tracking to chip away at them from the back. Perhaps you'll just one-shot them with a rocket launcher. They range from disappointing to infuriating with no inbetween.You can try gamepad or keyboard, it's not fun on either.""So my uncle used to own a farm...""- the side-conversations in this game really are almost worth playing it forDespite this core inability to be a fun game, I was almost warming up to Bloodrayne. After hours of aggressively boring me into a hole, it suddenly opened up. A litany of airstrike avoiding, mech combat, open-arena platforming that gets vertical and takes advantage of Rayne's ludicrous jump height, I was ready to like it as a flawed gem.But then the final boss happened and annoyed me so much that I never want to see the game again. Bloodrayne is a crippled game that reaches for the stars and fails to even get off the floor. If the idea of a ridiculous grindhouse title appeals to you regardless of the gameplay, feel free to give it a look. But to people who see a pile of rusty razorblades and don't think to stick their hand in because there's some chocolate underneath:I'd advise moving on, and leaving Rayne in 2002.

												Overall I've played the game a while ago and made it till the end.Technical stuff.The game engine is a little heavy if You run the game in DX mode on an IntelHD card.I'm not able to run the game on the dedicated GTX860M card in DX/OpenGL on Win8.1The game itself was made for consoles (as I remember PS2) but it plays quite nice with kb/mouse.If You use additional software like Pinnacle Profiler, then it's also playable with X360 and XOne controller.Unfortunatelly, setting the gamepad without a profiler is a mess, but it can be done if You are using a DirectInput device.Xinput devices may have axis recognision problems.So, with a little tinkering, it's playable (FHD resolution) on an intel i5-4210H with intelHD graphics, Windows 8.1, without compatibility settings (tested with 16GB RAM but it shouldn't make any difference).The engine graphics are PS2 level with the option to set it to a high resolution. You can edit the ini file if You want a custom resolution.GameVery playable, TPP, specially if You like shooting Nazi's + Vampire motives.You can bite foes and suck the blood out of them to replenish Your health.Melee is a little bit anoying (targeting system) but looks fun when You activate Blood Rage mode.Story is also acceptable. After finishing the game, You will probably want to know what happened later - Me too.So when I'm thru with part one once again (it's more than 10 years that I've played it) I'll gladly head for part 2 because I didn't had the opportunity to play it back then.It's an ""old fashion"" game so don't expect to unlock anything after ending the game, except some Steam cards maybe.I recommend the game if You like slashing, gore, vampires and a lot of blood.

												First off, I didnt think I would be able to handle the graphics. But I did. Story wise, your a half breed vampire killing demons and nazis. What else can be better than that. Gameplay can be abit edgy at first but you will get use to them. I wish there was more combos for the blades, but you got to use what you got to use. Can't wait to play the second game.

												Theres a few minor issues with the game bt overall still a good game. Love the series back in the day and still love it now.The only minor problems I found were:Screen Resolution: I had to go into the .ini Files to edit it - This one isn't a big deal since its a commong thing to check those for extra video settings anywayController: The controls are a bit weird when playing with a controller But you can get use to them.Mouse+Keyboard: I have extra monitors and the game doesn't lock my mouse in so if im fighting and my mouse goes to my other monitor(s) and I click to attack, I get thrown to my desktop.LiekI said issues that are tolerable.

												Loved it on consoles back in the day, love it on pc today :) Story for me is okay, have a open mind and you'll enjoy this like the matrix :P The gameplay is very amazing, hack n slash, gun and dodge, assassinate targets and fight pre post war. I'd have to say bloodrayne is one of my favourite vampire games. As for it being an older game, newer graphic cards are so fast, it causes a few small issues such as rendering, resolution's, fast load times (cutting off text) Even with the slight prooblems, the game is still play-able (i'm on a GTX 960 4gb amp windows 10) on todays machines.Graphics: 7.0SFX: 6.5Gameplay: 8.0Fun factor: 6.5Overall Rating: 7.5			",386,57,4,46,38,5,51

												Amazing game with interesting storyline :) I played BloodRayne on PS2 long time ago, and this game really stole my heart! Unfortunately the steam version has many bugs (game freezes and the voices are cut) The GOG rayne.exe version solved all of this problems. You can change the game to widescreen resolution in your game directory by editing rayne file in [Graphics] row (gamePIXY=768 gamePIXX=1366) and full enjoy the game. Anyway, I still recommend this game. :)			",18,9,0,1,0,0,0

												While the game has terrible keyboard and mouse controls and feels jaggy and awkward, the game has some strong supports. Those supports being on the foundation of a fantastic story and lore. The supports themselves being Rayne as a character with a great cast and variety of other characters, including other strong, female characters. There are tons of fun weapons, good graphics for the time of release, the gratuitious violence we -- as fans of vampire lore -- come to expect in a video game where you play as a sexy, half-vampire, clad in leather, that kicks *ss with blades on her arms and stilettos. Voiced by Laura Bailey -- someone completely different from the character's personality -- and does an absolutely fantastic job, with a small cast of other VOs that are done quite well. It's not amazing in any particular way, but as vampire games that aren't VTM Bloodlines, it is a really strong game. A villain you grow to hate rather quickly, some small antagonists that are easy to conjure up the rage to kill violently, a group of Nazis not Nazis to kill and feed on. Everything just works.It's a rather nice touch when your vampire doesn't heal passively, but actually has to feed, and when some enemies need to be weakened it's particularly interesting. Rayne has multiple visions, including one that allows her to spot weak prey to feed upon, or if they need to be damaged for her to hold her grasp, or she will be kicked off. Another thing this game has is some interesting technology that's surprising for its time: You can cut or shoot holes into the various Nazi not Nazi flags you find around, and the blood decals stay until you finish the level. Weapons carry over, and you get upgrades as necessary. There are water physics as well, not that you'd notice considering one of Rayne's vampire traits is that water burns her, stemming from old lore that vampires could not physically cross bodies of water on their own, and instead needed to be caried or some such lore as that.Anyways, onto the PROS and CONS:+ Nazis are always fun to kill, even if they're technically not Nazis+ Vampire lore+ Fantastic protagonist, anti-hero+ Great cast of antagonists, particularly the sexy butcher+ Water and cloth physics, plus tearing the flags, and and jiggle physics too. YEA+ Has a very serious story but a number of dark joke from Rayne+ Laura Bailey+ Soundtrack+ Gratuitous violence that suits the game's lore+ Arsenal of weapons to choose from+ Tons of fun to kill+ BIG LEVELS+ Rayne's different visions+ Feeding to recover health+ Vampires AND demons+ That final boss, yo- Takes too much time to build up to Kagan, that by the time I encounter him, I barely care- Story is mostly just ""Kill Kagan and kill whoever gets in your way.""- Other VOs aren't as strong as Laura Bailey's performance- Keyboard and mouse controls are janky- Game that shows its age- The very first level requires you to go in water and burn for a long period- Fair share of annoying glitches			",422,26,5,57,7,2,20

												This was a game I played origonally on the xbox I think many years ago. It's a lot of fun and one of those games not too many people played and unfortunatly, Uwe Boll made the movie for the game franchise.Despite this. Bloodrayne remains a hell of a lot of fun, though there will be some tweeking involved with fixing issues here and there with it being such a old title.You play as a half-vampire named Rayne who is hunting for her father, but is invited into the Brimstone society who investigate strange and unexplained occurences. The first mission is to investigate Lousianna where a strange infection has been going around and killing people, but also mutating them.The game controls aren't too hard to get used to on the keyboard and Mouse setup, however i did have difficulty trying to use my controller to set it up as it appeared to refuse to want to use it. You're able to drink the blood of humanoids you run into in the game and your blades are what makes you a deadly opponent to anyone who dare get in your way.All in all, a very fun game, but certainly not the best out there. I always wanted to find out more about Rayne after this game and after completeing it I'll give the sequal a go and see if it's an improvement or a dissappointment.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

A small town has reported attacks from some kind of mosters and your first mission is to clean the place.

												Be prepared to spend about an hour trying to get it to work.When I was able to play it, however, I was really surprised at just how good it looks. Comparable to modern-day MMO graphics, BloodRayne is a brutal hack and slasher that is surprisingly more like a dungeon crawler than you would expect. The gameplay is very repetative, but that doesnt stop it being fun, and I was very impressed with the real-time removal of limbs. The writing and voice acting so far is supurb, really nailing the genre without cheesing it up, and I'm eager to play more.This game is difficult, however, so you'll need to take certain situations very seriously, namely water. That's right, the only major source of my death so far has been environmental hazards - there are point where you're forced to make your way through flooded areas, which steadily drains your health, and if you're indoors then jumping doesn't help much. This game also features old-school style saving - no quicksaves, only saving at area transitions, which can be quite a chunk of gameplay, especially if you die after a boss. Enemies are generally inconsiquential, unless you're forced to fight an extended number than you can't drain life from, or you encounter a bug that makes them invunerable.All in all, this is a surprisingly good game. Don't let its age or ""sexiness"" fool you, Rayne is a take-control badass that I'd like to see more of in the games industry.			",406,133,1,54,29,4,58

												Let's get this straight,this is one of my favorite PC games and also one of my favorite virtual characters. It has very interesting story,funny dialogues,Gremans,demons,vampires... All together makes a nice game,especially if you are fans of occult stuff. So why I do not recommend this game? Well I do,but try playing it somewhere else,since Steam didn't move a finger to try to optimise this game. It's full of bugs,dialogues stop at half of a sentence,game runs too fast. I barely mustered enough nerves to finish the game,it was more of running through the levels just to finish the game,than actual enjoyable gameplay. I already own this game on CD and it ran too fast on my new PC and that was the main reason I have bought it here. I was thinking Steam is reliable gaming platform and they DO optimise games,well what can I say... I was wrong,and it wasn't first time,a lot of older games are so poorly or not at all optimised for newer computers. So take my advice,don't buy this game here,it's waste of money.

I can only recommend this game to those who played and loved it back when it was first released. Even then I caution that your nastolgia glasses may fail you. Pros. The Perma bullet-time ability, without it I don't know if I could have finished this game.Cons. Boring Level design. A game that drags on for far to long, having you do the same tired stratagy over and over. Boss fights that are unintiutive (Thinking that they require some nifty stratagy or something to win, when nope it's the same stratagy used on regular, common enemies. Except, bosses take way longer to die).Verdict: Again, it has not aged well. Be careful with your nostalgia glasses as this game has gone past its experation date.			",106,10,0,6,3,0,4

												The animations are orrible, the graphic is ok for this year but the gameplay is very very funny and Rayne is really cool, some leves and boss are really funny to play, I played it a lot before buy it on Steam.Maybe 10€/$ are too much, wait when it's on sale for 1€/$, the second one is boring, so buy only this and if you really love this try the second one.

												First and foremost, I want to start by saying that it's okay to dislike things about classic games, it's okay to not like them and it's okay to pull them up on things that just plain suck. I'm going to be writing a completely honest review from my point of view and honestly, BloodRayne isn't at all a bad game, but that doesn't mean it's directly good or flawless.Now, onto the review!Basic Overview: Developed by Terminal Reality and published by Majesco, BloodRayne was originally released on the  PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube in 2002, only being ported over to PC a year later. BloodRayne is an action hack and slash video game and the first game in the series that goes to follow the storyline that inspired a series of films and self-contained comic books. Story Breakdown: The game begins in 1933, in a place where people seem to believe in vampires, in Mortton, Louisiana, as Rayne's first mission with the Brimstone Society, along with Mynce, her mentor. They are sent there to investigate an outbreak of an unidentified disease in the area.Brimstone Society-a top secret fraternity that hunts down and destroys supernatural threats; are here to recruit Rayne. However, the other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless of the fact that she is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave her a necklace with their symbol on it (Hence the BloodRayne game symbol).Rayne must face off against Juergen Wulf, the leader of Gegengheist Gruppe (Counter-Ghost Group, abbreviated G.G.G.), which aims to bring Hitler into power through the use of occult artifacts, including reassembling the remains of Beliar.Menu: Honestly, it's utterly rubbish, and to get to this initially if you're running an operating system higher than windows 98, you will need to play around with game files. Which in of itself is annoying and finicky enough. Control menus, option menus? Nah, you don't need an easy way to find these, not only that, but it's really clunky all around - even for the time, it's rather crappy.Graphics: Pretty decent for the time, also a bit blocky compared to others released the same year but still quite enjoyable.Gameplay: I'll start with the things that I really enjoyed, what stands out the most to me are the enemies. Like Doom, it has unique designs and ideas for its enemies, something that wasn't common at the time and it's wonderful. Along with them being quite a challenge, the fact that weapons and ammo are so scarce really make the importance of not wasting it prominent. Topped with the unusual mechanics of BloodRyane it allows it to pull some pretty decent stunts like having a survivor behind mountains of stuff in hiding - Making Rayne have to dive through a cracked wall and bust them out to safety. Now, considering that you spend most of your time going from one place to another, killing one thing after another and going to another place to kill another thing.. You need to make killing, story and levels engaging enough for this to keep the player entertained, and while I do enjoy it a lot of the time, both level design and killing fall flat in doing so. Levels felt recycled, empty and too spaced out even later on in the game. Animations and killing as well. The first few kills are incredibly satisfying but after about half an hour, it already looses its appeal with its un-changing nature and don't even get me started on voice acting/sound effects such as draining blood.Actually, now that I mention it, we might as well touch on voices and sounds. Now while the sassy one-liners spat from our heroine are actually quite entertaining, it's generally voiced in such a monotone way and it's fairly disappointing to say the least because it could be so much more.Basic biological creatures have literally one sound when draining them, and so does Rayne, which to be frank it sounds like they hired a porn star just for that part of the voice acting - Not that it is entirely a bad thing, but some variations would have been nice. Final Conclusion: Crunch time. It's either a love or a hate. Now, I love me a good hack and slash, but this is so poorly done. Between reused animations, voice clips and the utterly uninspired surroundings, it's really a let down for what the game has to fully offer. It kind of shrouds over how good it -could- be.Shinobi released in 2002 was an example of a much better made Hack and slash.Considering it's a PC port and has been added to steam, one would think and hope that it would be optimised to run semi-efficiently on a modern computer, but not only has it not being integrated with steam, it cannot cope on newer operating systems and even as a hoarder/collector of trading cards, the fact they were added before making it playable for steam users and windows 7(and up) users is completely ridiculous. So, in it's present condition, I can't recommend it, not on steam anyway - Honestly it's best to just go buy it off GOG(Good Old Games, for those that aren't aware of this wonderful place) as they have at least optimised it to run better on modern machines.

												My old gal, my old favorite game of all time.I was a teenager and into vampires (before twilight thank god for that) and i got my hands on this game for the xbox back then! I looked at the cover to see a busty redheaded sexy♥♥♥♥♥vampire on the front here, and i said to my self ""Must... own"" and i'd love to start rating this from Jiggly rating... the jigglyness in this game is beyond normal ""japanese xrated movies"" and ends up looking silly :') but i still loved her as i slashed through endless hordes of nazies and zombies! I will not play this game again for a long time, because i think i will end up being dissapointed due to the graphics today. I know i sound like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but i am atleast honest!So If youre looking for a game, that is challenging, has (awesome) vampires in it this is your game!

												I would like to give this game a good review, but there is a blaring problem that stops me from giving it a positive review.This game crashes 9/10 times when I launch it. It says I have 0 mb of RAM left and 0 mb of hard disk space left. Even the 1/10 times that it worked, I could only go around 10 minutes before the game crashed. The game just simply is not enjoyable when it crashes so often. I looked online and all over the place for a fix and I tried all sorts of different launch options. None of them provided a reliable fix.Aside from that, I was able to play a bit of the game due to me getting 10 minutes of gameplay every 10 tries. The game doesn't seem to have aged as well as some other games such as half life, but I can say that the feel of the game isn't too bad. The graphics are outdated for sure, but the movement feels pretty smooth, at least after you change your settings.Until the crashing problem gets fixed, I cannot give this game a recommend because it is simply too much of a hassle to play the game.Rating: 6.2/10Recommend Price: Under $1			",1008,366,26,101,102,10,123

												Bloodrayne was never liked by many during its time of release as much as the Bloodrayne 2 was but I picked it up during sale for the cards and the damn thing wont even run 3 mins on Windows 8.1 without crashing. Not to mention the 6 dialogue boxes that tell me how I have 0.00 mb ram and 0.00 mb swap file space. Game freezes on 3 mins and cutscenes cut out with jaggy audio and game is running at 900+ fps....Starting the game and then task manager and changing the affinity of the process to only ONE cpu core that is cpu core 0 and deselecting the rest fixes the freeze and crash but the game has some major issues.Bloodrayne 1 The PC Game should be defunct since 2007 as it does not function any multicore processors, memory above DDR1 and DirectX 9 but for some reason its on Steam and they gladly want to charge money for it when they wont even give you a patch to fix the game to atleast run it outright for even 10 minutes.0/10 - Outrageous.

												Bloodrayne was prolly one of my most favorite series to play back in the day. I always loved vampires and of course it helps that Rayne is a sexy Vampire chick, but what I didn't remember about this game is how bad the controls were. Though I guess that it to be expected since it's an early 2000's game. Though despite that I am still finding myself enjoying playing through it again. But if you are the type of person that can't get past bad controls then I would just watcho someone on youtube to play through it cause you prolly won't care for it, but if you can get passed it then I think you will find an enjoyable gem here.

												Terrible game. The game freezes in the options menu, without possability to shut down the game. ALT+F4 does nothing. Task manager places itself behind the game so cannot force the task to shut down either. Do not buy this game!repeat:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!			",166,44,2,27,27,4,22

												This is one of those nostalgia inducers from the early 00's, a playstation 2 title that was tippy top technology at the time. In my own opinion, the original Bloodrayne is a few notches better than it's sequel, with straight-forward bloodsucking, hilarious hack-and-slash gore, nazi killing and scattered ♥♥♥♥♥♥ imagery (for whatever reason).If the graphics aren't a problem, I recommend this for fans of vampires and linear slice em and shoot em up games. Because, afterall, there are very few decent vampire games. Hell, there aren't that many to begin with.			",235,35,3,61,24,0,26

												I couldn't even play it with a controller. I could play with a keyboard, sure, but this game wasn't optimized for that kind of play style. I tried using a dual shock 4 and that didn't work. I tried using a logitech gamepad, and that didn't even work. So no matter what I did, this game would not support any controllers. Lucky I only paid like $2, but still, I wish I would have known about this problem beforehand. Do not buy if you intend to use a controller to play.			",65,2,0,12,1,0,0

												First of all, the game requires a 3rd-party patch to get the controller support into a somewhat usable state and fix the cutscene audio getting cut off at the end. Voice acting is still terrible on all characters, though.The game gets tedious quickly. There are a few main sections, each of which is a seemingly endless sequence of levels that are pretty much all the same. Even the objectives never really change; usually it's ""kill the officers"". Sure, tha Nazis have an evil plan and all that, but... that doesn't add anything. It never felt like a story.Occasionally, the path to progress is hidden; I frequently checked a walkthrough on how to proceed which is a main source of negative score on a game. The game is not encouraging trial-and-error or exploration in areas that have bottomless pits or a lot of environmental damage, since a death requires a restart of the level from the beginning.For that reason, and because the bossfights are tedious to no end, I also preferred to check the walkthrough for them so I could do it correctly. Regardless, I was unable to kill the final boss (Beliar) despite checking walkthroughs -- they just keep shooting at him, but there aren't enough weapons around and he grows quickly in my playthrough, so that never worked. Blades don't seem to do anything, and there is no way to recharge blood rage -- so all attempts ended with me being unable to do anything.			",519,154,17,67,43,8,78

												Rating 5/10Overview: Third Person hack and slashThis game just isn't good. Most of the positive reviews seem to be based on nostalgia factor alone because just about everything this game has to offer is bad to mediocre.   The Bad:- Story and voice acting is atrociously bad-the combat is mashing the mouse button and hope that you connect with the enemy. Melee attacks have no weight or feel to them and combat requires no strategy whatsoever. You can also feed on enemies, restoring your health.  By hitting enemies you increase your blood rage meter allowing you  to slow down time and deal out more damage.   Range weapons also feel very lackluster -enemies are bullet sponges,- Levels feel repetitive and poorly designed. Your objectives throughout most of the game remains unchanged. - Boss battles in general are a joke. You activate your blood rage and then proceed to kill bosses very quickly. -frustrating last boss fight - Getting it to work on modern systems may be a pain.     If you never played this game before you are not missing out on anything.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												No no. No no no no. No. No no. No no no no no. No no no no no no no no no, no no no. No no no no. No no. No. This game isn't good any way you try to spin it. Even the ol' ""for its time"" argument simply doesn't hold water. Even at a $1.99 price point, it's just not worth taking the risk of seeing if it'll even run on your system (which from what I've gathered from the forums is a crap-shoot.) BloodRayne simply offers no gameplay worth engaging with. At all. Everything about this game boils down to, ""Flail around and hope things happen."" Your melee attacks have no sense of impact and you're never quite sure you're actually hitting things or not.  There's no way to actually stick to a target either, so you're quite literally flailing at enemies and seeing if things worked or not. It's about as effective as MMO combat. You have very little, if any control over ranged combat. Rayne just kinda runs around holding guns, aiming them every which way and shooting, and from my experience in the game's Normal mode, even if shots do connect, it can take as many as 4-5 shotgun blasts (and even more rounds from smaller arms) to actually drop an enemy...that is if she's actually aiming properly.  The platforming is also smooshy and unresponsive. Rayne is supposed to lock herself onto small catwalks or power lines and ""tightrope"" across them, but more often than not, you'll miss those jumps or she'll ""animation"" through them for some reason and fall through. Even as a curiosity, just don't! This isn't a ""so bad it's good,"" like a lot of games can be. This is just bad, broken, not funn, boring bad.			",280,60,2,29,8,1,17

												I had a very odd childhood that was full of games like Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne 2, Devil May Cry, Darkwatch, etc. Essentially I had a ton of violent games growing up. This game is probably one of my favorites below the sequel of course. The sequel expanded on this game a lot, but right now lets talk about this game. This game hasn't aged that well. Honestly I bought it through my rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. The game is great in my opinion with somewhat simple combat. The story is pretty good for a game where you play a hot half-vampire chick in bdsm clothing. Seems like all vampires dress like this, because one of the first vampires you meet is in fish nets and a nun outfit. Anyways, that might have been one of the appeals for the game. TBH the combat is fun and does a good job of making you feel like a fast mobile vampire. You can slice people up with your blades, shoot with a handful of guns, and even suck blood from your enemies to regain health. The platforming is quite poor as the controls for slight movement isn't that precise. Jumping is a bit hard to get used to and this game wants you to platform quite a bit.Honestly, I recommend the game and think that even if you weren't a fan of the series that oyu could still enjoy this. Just don't buy that crappy 2D hack n' slash or whatever they made as an attempt to revive the series as some arcadey game.			",312,42,8,57,27,1,35

(Oh an a rather sexy female protagonist [or so everyone keeps saying])Blood Rayne is a third person hack and slash with panache! Featuring large open maps and a (rather annoying) checkpoint save system. Work for the Brimstone Society; with your shopping list of Nazi officers go off and fill your larders!Using blades, guns, explosives to hunt your prey with vampiric abilities; aura vision, slow motion and fang.The dialogue is very humourous with Rayne's sarcastic quips, though there is an issue with the last few words often getting cut off.

												Combat is fun, mostly with the blades, using guns is optional except with some bosses, But if that is not your thing, then have some nazis for lunch and get some health back.There is even a level where you pilot a mech and have to kill other mechs.Aside from the first chapter which is more character buildup, you will have plenty amount of time to slaughter nazis in standard facility levels or levels that are hard to navigate and full of platforming.And best of all, there are no harpoon mini-games like in its sequel.

It was decent game at it's time and i think the story is still great and the voice acting is great for such old game.The graphics are bad ofcourse in the eyes of modern gamer but it doesn't matter to me if the gameplay is fun and in this game it is, the main focus is wrist blades and they are fun to slice nazis and other monster with, you can use any weapons you find in the enviroment too.360 controller doesn't work well with this it doesn't register the analog triggers so kbam is better option for this game.Rayne is my favorite videogame character she kicks♥♥♥♥♥and shes dhampire. I don't have anything else to say.			",100,3,3,10,7,0,1

												This game was played (for hours) before being brought in Steam, this game was excellent (once the control configuration was set right).  Game was fast-paced & had many kinds of enemies (especially the supernatural kind).  The somewhat bad part (especially when she's in battles with certain foes) was the directional ones were the mouse had to be used.  The game was easy (& at the same time hard) to follow through; especially when the game does states the objective (sometimes objectives).  There was one round that I like where Bloodrayne had to keep up the pace or the game would be over, but unfortunately couldn't kill all the enemies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's list some buzz words to get your attention: Blood, violence, vampires, Nazis, mechs and monsters! What more could you ask for? (Oh an a rather sexy female protagonist [or so everyone keeps saying])Blood Rayne is a third person hack and slash with panache! Featuring large open maps and a (rather annoying) checkpoint save system. Work for the Brimstone Society; with your shopping list of Nazi officers go off and fill your larders!Using blades, guns, explosives to hunt your prey with vampiric abilities; aura vision, slow motion and fang.The dialogue is very humourous with Rayne's sarcastic quips, though there is an issue with the last few words often getting cut off. This is a personal favourite of mine I enjoyed playing years back, I'm glad to be able to experience it all over again. ",101,8,0,20,14,0,25

Been an issue for years, still no fix.If someone knows how to fix this, please respond!UPDATE:1. When you start the game you open taskmanager then go to details tab.2.

												Nostalgia trip, and remembering why this game was fun.A) Dismemberment and gibbing things.B) Feeling like an immortal beastie grabbing the nearest Capri Sun of blood.C) Physics of an appreciable kind.And the things that sucked.A) Saving only occurs at the start of a level. Even if you save during the level, it notifies you that it will start the level again at that save.B) Inconsistent attacks on enemies. I.e. melee attacking one guy, kill him in one hit. Melee attack another, and it takes the entire string. And they're both basic grunts.C) Inconsistent healing on enemies. I theorize their remaining health affects this, but if it does it makes elite enemies completely stupid since they're immune to it all the way up until they're a step away from death.D) Ammo is surprisingly lacking despite every enemy with a gun dropping said gun on death. I.e. fully automatic weapons but you only get one clip max.E) Cutscene issues. (This could be something I did that I didn't need to do, but gonna leave it since it's something mentioned by others)And the things that are eh.A) Aiming is automated. This is both okay and not okay. Okay is when there are enemies in opposite directions, and this allows you to shoot in both. Not okay is when you're trying to aim for a specific enemy, and Rayne's ability to aim at unseen enemies.B) The aura sight. Allows you to see the objective and enemy health bars. But essentially makes you have the vision of someone who forgot their prescription glasses.C) From the few levels I've played, human enemies are in the minority. And it's weird to hear lewd bloodsucking noises when the thing you're bloodsucking from is a mutilated walking corpse/puppet.D) Bloodrage turns you into a harbinger of Death. Good. You can turn it off and conserve it. Good. You have to be at maximum charge to even use it. Bad.tl;dr - Game is flawed but it scratches that itch to be a monster in human form. Recommended to those who enjoy the novelty of living the violent dhampire life.			",96,22,0,5,8,0,28

												Combat is fun, mostly with the blades, using guns is optional except with some bosses, But if that is not your thing, then have some nazis for lunch and get some health back.There is even a level where you pilot a mech and have to kill other mechs.Aside from the first chapter which is more character buildup, you will have plenty amount of time to slaughter nazis in standard facility levels or levels that are hard to navigate and full of platforming.And best of all, there are no harpoon mini-games like in its sequel.

												It's a solid port, for the time period. Being that it's so old now it makes perfect sense that you'll run into issues here and there but it's a simple game and a fun game so it's rather easy to ignore the occasional glitch. The only tweaking I had to make was for resolution through the ini file. Wireless 360 controller worked right away but the deadzones are iffy and the second analog stick's x axis isn't detected by the game but it's all workable. This is also no different than the GoG version. Same technical flaws exist in both.Plus, it has Laura Bailey voicing Rayne. Can't go wrong there.Though, the last few levels go very, very wrong in this game...			",746,134,23,93,104,10,118

												AH BloodRayne how I love / hate thee. This game is straight up old X-Box. If you had one of them and had this game you will know what i'm talking about. Still have that machine. Wish it still worked. So,, my review.. Cut scene dialog does not play properly so read fast. It seems to cut off the last bit. This may get annoying if you have never played this before. The graphics are as I said Old X-Box style so don't buy it expecting much. Plays pretty much like it did before, some controls are going to be a bit harder to get used to due to Keyboard and Mouse combo but nothing a true gamer can't handle. There is a chase scene fairly early in the game that is a pain in your rump. You cannot get to far away from the creature or you fail. That means no running ahead too. Fall in the water and you will probably fail. ANYWAYS,, I liked playing this game in the past and look forward to playing it thru again. I recomend picking it up on sale if you can. Of course I hate paying full price for most things anyways. Ah and for those people who may be interested there are ways to ""Enhance"" the main character. Does make for some substantial laughs.   Just sayin.Bottom line... If you miss this game get it for sure. Fan of the character, you should get this for your collection. Not sure if you would like it, make sure you wait for a sale. Still undecided, I would look for game play on U-tube.			",214,78,0,50,12,2,34

												A classic that still has a great gameplay value even 12 years after its release. The story is a bit shallow but they kind of tried to make it coherent through cutscenes while graphics aged almost as well as Prince of Persia or Max Payne. Compared to those games however the vampire thing makes for some funny and interesting gameplay tweaks, like the desperate soldiers/zombies' faces as you suck their blood. And of course who could forget the first act's cutscenes where Mynce's breasts just keep jiggling.Took various tweaks to get it working on Windows 10, was not meant to be played on anything newer than Windows XP.

I DID have some issues with getting the game to actually play on my computer, but the Steam forums really helped out with this aspect and within no time I was able to load and play this game with no problems at all. It's a short game compared ot modern day story arcs, and yes is possibly lacking a bit in terms of plot line, but overall the game is still fun to play and feels like a blast fro mthe past. For vintage gaming fans, I couldn't recommend more!			",8,0,0,3,1,0,0

Although the graphics are more than dated, and the controls are awkward, there's something about this game that just screams 'fun'.  And that something is the sheer buckets of gore.  Gore, gore, and more gore, with some extra blood, then more gore.  This game is the MOST fun on cheats, preferably the Gratuitous Dismemberment cheat.  There are SO many places to slice nazi's in this game, lol.			",193,38,0,34,2,2,9

												The game just crashed again when I played it a few minutes ago so I decided to write this review to warn everyone about the problems.I want to start by saying what is nice about the game. The one thing they got right is that it is fun to play as a vampire and chop people up with blades.Unfortunately the game crashes all the time and is full of game breaking bugs. The game will sometimes get into a loop that seems to happen when it shows certain cutscenes. At this point it is impossible to even quit out of the game or attempt to close the game from Task Manager. The only way I was able to get out of it was to restart my PC.The game was obviously not tested when it was added to steam and there is also no hope that the company that put it on steam will ever fix the problem so I have to warn everyone to avoid this game even when it is on sale. I only managed to get about 2 hours in and then couldn't go any further because of this problem.I also just want to say that the controls and gameplay are very poor by modern standards.

												FIrst time playing the game, missed it in the ps2 days but always wanted to try it. The game for me didnt work right after installing, had some problems with windows 7 but was easy to fix. WIll try to help other interested in playing the game,First change your rayne.exe compatibility mode to windows98/me in (Steam\steamapps\common\BloodRayne), then copy steam.dll into the folder. Now to fix the framerate and video skipping you need a program to lock the games framerate to 30 in game, i used Dxtory but if you already have a program that can do the same thing it will be fine. All thats left now is to fix the resolution. Steam\steamapps\common\BloodRayne\system folder go to rayne.ini edit with notepad and find gamePIXY, gamePIXX edit to your needs and have fun.Now the game itself is very fun and fast paced, the combat is very much hack and slash with some shooting. The voice acting is B movie goodness which you will like or hate. The downside to the game is the story is just there, but not very well told. It seems like the story almost skips around, but for the most part the gameplay will keep you interested. ",159,2,0,17,5,1,16

A lot of the game is spent killing floating parasites, running through uninteresting levels where you have to locate and kill dozens of nazi generals and generic soldiers along with some terrible platforming sections...There is barely any storyline, the gameplay get's repetitive quickly, most of the boss fights are too easy except the last one which can be frustratingly hard...I played this game on Windows 7 and I got quite a few error messages every time I started the game along with not being able to view the very first and last cutscene.
