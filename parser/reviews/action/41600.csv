												I do not understand how this game can be made for kids!! The games audio is close to broken (it actually started playing music from Frogger 2 during the game because it was in my disk drive.) The pace is really slow and tedious. I'm not even past the first level and now im stuck at the FIRST BOSS because the game controls are also broken and weird. Not to mention, apart from it crashing, Sometimes the game promts me to ""reinsert the CD-Rom"" which is unbelievable. I get it's an older game but that s**t is too much. Only thing I liked was that it was only $3 so I dont completely hate myself for actually spending money on this garbage.			",87,15,0,10,8,0,0

												Earthworm Jim, a game from my childhood that i never thought i would see, let alone play again. The PC version has several flaws, The camera controls are awful, the music doesn't exist (In all honesty, You wont notice after awhile as there is still ambient noises), and a game breaking bug.The game breaking bug, is that you need 74 Golden udders to win, But sometimes even if you collect them all, it still states you only have 73. This is fixable however, If you head back to Fear - poultrygeist - Try to recollect the udders you already have. One will activate again and you will have 6/5. If that doesn't work, Do the same in Boogie Nights.This and starshot are the two main games i remember that i struggled with as a kid, Coming back was an interesting experience. I'm not sure if it's the nostalgia talking, however i did find the overall game enjoyable, Even though the boss battles are like beating yourself in the face with a brick.  Overall: You are not missing out on a lot if you don't buy it, But it certainly is a blast from the past.  8/10			",270,51,2,55,30,3,42

												The classic franchise got what every franchise got in the 90's, a 3D game! While it isn't as great as Mario 64, it certainly made a better 3D game than OTHER franchises. (cough) Bubsy (cough) Some people don't like this game, I really don't see the reasons behind the hate except that it has a terrible camera. But change some of the controls and download a Google Drive file that someone posted in the Steam community for this game and install it by following thier instructions, and you have a winner that finished an epic trilogy on a good, solid note!

												This is a great game, one of my best childhood game-related memories. It's challenging, but rewarding. Good creative setting and characters, awesome music and entertaining gameplay(though the controls are tricky at times). The steam version is missing all music files, so be sure to look the fix for this up before you start playing. It can be found in the community page for the game. A 64-bit era classic.

I have to patch it.Seriously, I have to patch an STEAM game?? Poor !!!So even the offer from 10 bucks makes it not better.

												I'm still new to the EWJ fandom, and heard some stuff about this one, but I believe in giving a game in a series I like the benefit of the doubt. Now, I've cheated a little with a let's play and a review on YouTube, but here's my oppinion after playing a little bit of this: True, the game shares the structure of many games of the N64 era, the camera's a bit of a chore to work with, the music's not there (Possibly due to copyright issues) and the story's a little...Blah...But, for its time, the graphics are dece, gameplay is okay, and the layout/concept is innovative...With a little work. Let's recap.Pros: Decent graphics for it's time, inventive concept, good controls.Cons: Piggy-back structure, Camera, No music, Somewhat weak story....Oh, and you need to reconfigure the controls every time you get ready to play.Fact: Not EVERY video game legend has had a graceful transition to 3D (How a certain BOBCAT who shall not be named managed to survive up to when the 3D era began is beyond me!), but with some work, Jim might have stayed in the big leagues to this day, instead of (Until recently) going dormant after a guest role in Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut...But, what can you do?Final thoughts: It's not the best, it's not the worst, if you want it, click those buttons!

												Is it possible for a mediocre game to become better, more enjoyable with time?  I find myself asking this question, having completed Earthworm Jim 3D.  Forget about comparing this game to the 2D entries of the series.  This game is nothing like its 16-bit predecessors.  Judging this game simply on the merits of platformers from the N64 era of platformers reveals a competent game filled with silly humor and dated pop culture references.  Controls and gameplay are reminiscent of Nintendo's own platform-centric franchises of the era.  The aesthetic closely resembles the Earthworm Jim TV show and holds up nicely, even by today's HD standards.  The voice work and sound effects give the game a unique personality and a real throwback quality.  The game is retro without being retro, if that makes any sense.I rented this game on the N64 when it was first released.  I remember not enjoying it.  Part of the reason must have been nostalgia-induced and longing for a continuation of the 2D games.  Fast forward to today.  I feel like I was finally able to accept Earthworm Jim 3D for what it is and appreciate the efforts that went into attempting to keep the franchise relevant.  Maybe it has been so long since I played a platformer like this my standards have reset.  I cannot pinpoint exactly why this game is so enticing now.  All I know is I like it--and that's what counts!Now, there are three issues I would like to point out for those considering purchasing this game.  One issue is inherent with the gameplay and that issue is the camera.  Early 3D, third-person perspective games usually suffered from awkward camera implementation.  The way in which the camera follows Jim will result in a constant need to adjust it.  There are adequate camera controls that allow the player to manipulate the position of the camera, but far too much time will be spent adjusting its placement.  Be prepared to play with the camera often.The next two issues are more technical drawbacks.  First, the music for this game is not included in the Steam download.  While this enhances attention to the voice work and sound effects, this will undoubtedly be a sorely missed feature of the game.  In addition to the complete absence of the soundtrack, there are numerous locations in the game where the audio will cut out.  Luckily, there is a fix for these audio woes; there are threads in the Community Hub that will direct you where you need to go and what to do.  I would encourage anyone who purchases this game to take the additional steps and download the music.  The game's identity is incomplete without it.  Returning the soundtrack to the game also fixes the areas where audio would previously cut out.The second issue may or may not be encountered.  In my first playthrough, I collected all the Golden Udders only to find the game miscalculated my totals from each level.  This prevented me from reaching the end of the game. :(Still, what the game offers is a satisfying platforming experience.  It does not win any awards for level design or control, but everything about the game is functional.  The story is inconsequential at best.  Whether Jim is knocked out by an N64 logo or a refrigerator, the premise that facilitates the gameplay is lame.  :DMaybe that's a fitting conclusion.  Earthworm Jim 3D features a lame super hero tasked with saving himself for lame reasons from lame villains in what could be perceived as a lame game.  The beauty of it all is it works!  The universe of Earthworm Jim is self-aware, lending Earthworm Jim 3D a pass to be the game you want it to be.  It may have taken 15 years, but I chose to embrace the ridiculousness of this game and give it another try.  I am glad I did.			",31,3,2,2,0,0,2

												Bland, uninspired 3D platformer similar to Banjo-Kazooie, and by that I mean it's more or less a complete and utter ripoff. The platforming stages are decent enough but the boss fights are ATROCIOUS: you and your opponent duke it out in an exciting contest of... collecting orbs scattered about in the arena. With really awkward controls, the boss constantly shooting you causing you to drop your orbs, and the fact that you still have your health to worry about (whilst the boss can take as many shots they want without even caring) all combine to create a really unpleasant experience.So, if you have a desperate need for a 3D collect-a-thon platformer and have already played the likes of Banjo-Kazooie, Jak & Daxter, and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, then I might cautiously recommend you play this title, but I wouldn't recommend it to a fan of Earthworm Jim, unless you REALLY like Dan Castellaneta as the voice of Jim or something.Oh yeah, and the keyboard and mouse controls are trash. Use a directinput controller for this one, since I don't think it appreciates the Xbox 360's analogue shoulder button things.But hey, I think it's at least better than Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 The Galaxy.

												Now, I know this game isn't the best as a lot of people said. You can see at the bottom, but I think it was a good game, sure it was something completely different from the Sega/pc and this was all in 3D!!!! But it was a good game, (my opinion). It was enjoyable, fun, entertaining, and so on. Sure it has some problems that's the whole point of ""Forums"" was to get information such as ""HOW THE F**K DO YOU FIX BUGS AND STUFF"" But aren't a lot of old games on steam kinda screwed up. Yeah they are, but people make mods and stuff to help people out who has purchase such product. Now the website ""GOG"" I love them so freaking much, they are super cheap and fix these old games to run perfect, but they aren't as popular as steam so you can't blame them. Gog is a good company, but so is steam with various things. So buy this game it is worth it in my opinion, just if you know how to mod or something fix this game! ;D			",382,41,7,39,23,5,15

												DEVELOPERS: Game Randomly freezes and says Please Insert CD-ROM which requires force-close with task manager and does not save the game.  It seems most vulernable to this in the hub world or paused.  Also, the game will not save video / control settings.If you don't have a Nintendo system, you have a limited selection of animated 3D platformers.  This game scratches the itch quite nicely with it's qwerky sense of humor and Free-Range Exploration.  And although it's easier than it's 16 bit counterparts and utilizes auto and manual saving, like most games from the 90s, it will challenge you with unforgiving collecting requirements and limited lives.  It ran smoothly on my Windows XP 1.8ghz system.  Bring your own music because it's been removed, evidentally, for copyright reasons.  Also, although I could save the game, it didn't seem to save my control and video settings.  I managed some permanent custom controls including turbo whip and camera by keyboard mapping to my controller using xpadder.  A very underrated title.  Put down your realistic war or bloody zombie game for a while and walk or crawl into this free-roaming, challenging, and light hearted genre.			",452,179,24,75,44,5,81

												I paid 4 tf2 keys for the whole collection and found that even this was an overpay. Earthworm jim 1 has 3 levels cut out, Earthworm Jim 2 has one level cut out, and earthworm jim 3d has the whole entire soundtrack removed. Configuration's rather wonky too, and Jim feels more stiff in this than the genesis version of ewj1.  You are basically paying for 3 half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ports. One funny thing is that the pictures you see for ewj1 in steam are from the genesis version and even show pictures of levels that were cut out from the game they are actually selling. I at least learned a lesson that if you're going to buy a port of a game, you should do more research on it first before paying. Stay away from these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports. This is nothing but a cash grab out of nostalgia.			",385,53,1,48,13,3,29

I played this 3 times at intervals of 10 minutes and it frustrated me how much of my nostalgia I was losing, since I remember playing this on the Nintendo 64. This is bundled with the first 2 Earthworm Jim games and only the first one is worth playing while the second isn't. 5 minutes of Earthworm Jim 2 and I couldn't get past the first level because it didn't explain properly how to play it. I bought this because I loved the N64 game and wanted to play it again but after this....this....If you can put up with the above issues, go nuts otherwise this is a waste of money. It's broken and incomplete. I would sooner recommend Revelations 2012 than this and the sad thing is I'm not joking.			",117,53,0,15,7,4,6

												Had to download a patch from elsewhere just to get the music working. Horribly ported but otherwise a pretty good game. If you liked mario64 or banjo kazooie this could be right up your ally, it's not as good as those games but its not far behind either. Downvote for the horrible port, as it is a pretty good game.

												This game, I swear to god THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. This is literally the worst game I've ever played. I hope you like boring gameplay, no music, and the worst boss fights in the history of the ♥♥♥♥ing world because this is it. Did I mention if you leave a level you lose all your collectables? So if you don't save, you have to start the level ALL OVER AGAIN! Do yourself a favor, and just stick to the original 2.			",93,13,0,6,5,2,1

												This game would honestly be a decent 3D platformer if it wasn't for the horror that is the camera and the controls. Sometimes the enemies can't even be seen because of the horrible camera angle, and sometime platforming is a complete chore - especially with wonky keyboard controls.The graphics, combat, and sound are decent, but that's it. Nothing crazy or incredibly creative like its predecessors.Earthworm Jim 3D just seems to exist to make someone want to play its predecessors. Maybe if the controls were improved and there was just a little more creativity, that wouldn't be the case. However, now I have to feel bad for the Earthworm Jim franchise.			",155,33,7,8,7,0,9

												This game is something else, I tell ya. It's a poorly done port of the PC original, I do believe, but they literally forgot to put the music files in the game. I kid ye not. You can patch this with mods, of course (and by mods, I mean literally downloading the soundtrack and slapping it in), but it's strange how it's gone. This isn't even the only problem. There are many little issues like the game forgetting control settings every time you load up as well. And the topper of this entire port:It still has piracy protection active. Asking you to put the game CD in, or just simply saying ""Jump for joy if you like Earthworm Jim!"" as an anti-piracy measure.Getting past all this garbage, the game is still the game. It plays pretty well in my opinion, and I can have some fun while the game is friendly. Just pray you don't get the anti-piracy measure slapped on ya when you have 99/100 marbles in a stage or I'm afraid rage-quitting is the only option.EDIT: NEARLY FORGOT! Do NOT be fooled by the store page lies! The screenshots showing these fancy areas you may not be familiar with are ancient Beta snapshots and thus DO NOT EXIST. Which, honestly, shouldn't this be pulled for false advertising?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
