												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a first person shooter horror game, developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Brothers. The game was released on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360 in February 2009. This is the second game in the F.E.A.R series. The gameplay in F.E.A.R. 2 remains almost identical to the first game. The slow motion bullet time makes a welcome return, and the ever brilliant gun play. The AI has also been improved too, and will now be even cleverer when it comes to taking cover. A nice feature which is new though, is that you can knock over certain objects in the world to create extra cover, such as file cabinets, desks and tables. I also realised whilst playing F.E.A.R. 2, that the original didn't include down the sights aiming, since this is also a new feature here. Probably the best and most prominent feature is the addition of being able to control robot mechs. The moments in F.E.A.R. 2 where you are in control of a huge mean mech blasting through enemies and destroying buildings, is really something special, and is a memory I will carry with me for a while from this game. One of the biggest problems I had with the original F.E.A.R game is that I didn't find it very scary. Thankfully F.E.A.R. 2 mends all those wrongs. This is a really scary game and had me jumping out of my seat at times. The game doesn't rely on jump scares to keep you creeped out though, there is genuinely some really scary moments, the eerie atmosphere in some of the levels creeped me out to the max! Graphically, F.E.A.R. 2 is only slightly better than the original which I found to be a little disappointing given that there is about a five year gap in release dates, but one redeeming factor here is, that the game can be played on various resolutions, going up to at least 4K so you can still churn out some decent looking moments.  I also cannot fault F.E.A.R. 2 in the audio department though, all of the characters are voice acted, sound effects are well made too - I enjoyed the moments of listening to the enemy radio chatter as well.F.E.A.R. 2 is by no means difficult, I played on medium and the only times I died was when I did something stupid, like jumping off the edge of a building by accident. FPS veterans should really be playing the game on hard mode right from the get go to avoid the game play becoming stale and repetitive. Throughout the game's seven chapters, each level has plenty of collectable items to find which will flesh out the plot and back story even more, it is well worth heading down a corridor which is off the main path just to get these little snippets of information as some of the information you get is really quite interesting if you are a fan of the F.E.A.R series thus far. On the topic of level design, F.E.A.R. 2 uses the same sort of concept as the original in that you can be roaming around a building for a good amount of time before you finally realize the way you are supposed to be going. The addition of some sort of map would have made this type of problem become minimal but it does add to the suspense as you don’t know what is around every corner! I finished F.E.A.R. 2 on medium difficulty in just under five hours. I felt rather disappointed to be fair; I was expecting a play through to last at least as much as the first. I may try playing through again on the harder difficulty but that is the only replay ability the game has with its completely linear level design and story. Much like the first game too, I also had a small technical problem with the game's auto save function. This seems to happen at key moments in the game, but you will also notice a sudden frame drop, meaning you lose the immersion slightly and it just feels really janky. I am not sure whether it is an issue with the engine but like I said, I had the same problem with the first game so it may be a common issue with the series thus far. Apart from that, I only encountered one more problem, in that on one of the latter levels, the ground suddenly became see through, this was easily resolved by a quick relaunch, but I did end up losing a bit of progress on the stage since I must of not reached the next checkpoint which was rather annoying. F.E.A.R. 2 is really just an OK game. I would still class the first game to be a better game though, even though the horror aspects of 2 are a whole lot better. The shortness of the story is a real draw back and the lack of any proper replay ability means you should really be looking to get F.E.A.R. 2 when on sale for less than £5.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Rating: 7.5/10Overview: FPS with the ability to go into slow-mo The Good:+Game looks good both artisically and technically. Game also makes good use of lighting+ Game has a variety of weapons and grenades. Certain weapons are very creative while others are what you would expect in a FPS+ The game has really solid level design. In addition, the game takes place over a series of different environments and locations. One of my biggest complaints in the first FEAR was that the environments were too similar and felt repetitive so it's nice to see this was fixed in the sequel. +The shooting mechanics feel good, going into slow-mo and shooting enemies is always fun.  The game also introduces sections where you ride a mech to change up the gameplay.The Average:The AI feels average compared to the first FEAR. The first game was renowned for its amazing AI and to this day I still think it sets the standard for AI in a FPS game. This game though doesn't seem to have that.  The AI is not bad by any means, however compared to the first game it doesn't feel close.The horror elements are not as a good as the first game. Between finding a balance between action and horror the developers chose action.  There are certainly plenty of times the game tries to invoke scares but sometimes it just comes across as flat. One of the most satisfying weapons in any FPS game was the shotgun from the first game. In this game, the shotgun doesn't even feel close to satisfying. I found the game to be very easy even on the normal setting, play on hard if you want a challenge. The Bad:- The dialogue in this game is terrible. It makes the story feel like a straight to home video release. It becomes difficult to take the story seriously or be afraid of what's around the corner when the characters are saying things that just make you shake your head.  -The game has a certain flow to it but the entire ending gameplay segment feels frustrating and out of place. -Multiplayer is deadConclusionOn the one hand this game does things a lot better than the first, on the other hand it also doesn't seem to improve any of the flaws and in some cases makes it worse. What could have been a really great horror FPS game turns into you standard run of the mill FPS game.  For a FPS game it is very solid and should provide you with a 5-6 hours of fun.

												This is basically a watered down version of the first game. Still a pretty kickass game and I never get sick of shooting the propane tanks on the backs of the bad guys and watching them get blown apart. DLC is about 30 minutes long so avoid that like the plague.Full video review:

												Having never played F.E.A.R. 1 I had no idea what to expect from this game. I was pleasantly surprised and had a blast playing F.E.A.R. 2.  The game looks good and plays well and has a decent storyline to keep you more than interested. This is the first game in a long while that I've wanted to play and finish because it was just that good. It also didn't matter that I hadn't played the first in the series and I wasn't left confused by parts of the story because you had to have played the first one to understand. I would highly recommend this game if you like horror genre FPS. This game delivers and you won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project Origin is a direct follow up to the original game released in 2005. It took Monolith 4 years to cook up a sequel and they decided not to change much on the formula that has worked once. But 4 years is a long time and sometimes innovation is better than playing it safe. That's exactly why Project Origin falls short of its predecessor. The formula remained the same, but the audience has changed.The game picks up right the time when the first games is about to end. To be precise, it starts a couple of minutes before the end of F.E.A.R. You are a part of Delta Squad and you're sent to place the head of Armacham Technology Corporation into protective custody. It's when sh*t starts to get serious and a nuclear blast bakes most of the city as a result of the original F.E.A.R. team's endgame. In the rest of the game you move in and out of underground facilities trying to achieve your ultimate goal. Even though the campaign lasts only around 7 hours the story is detailed and interesting. On the other side, you have to pay attention to every detail that happens around you or told to you on the comm because if not you'll find yourself lost in the web organisations and projects thrown at you in every couple of hours. At least if you do get lost eventually right before the end of the game everything will be cleared up in 5 short minutes.The gameplay is very similar to the first game. Little has changed; slow-mo shooting is still great but the novelty has faded in the past four years. You will meet various enemies during your gameplay starting from soldiers, genetically modified monsters, mechs to ghosts even. The game will always try to throw something new at you which is nice, but eventually you'll immediately recognize the spacey room where a firefight is going to take place in 3...2...1. AI was a strong part of the first game and it returns in the second one too. However, it doesn't always work like it meant to be. Sometimes the enemies will be clever enough to kick over tables and take covers, but in other cases they will try to rush you through the same door where you'll stand and shoot them one by one. The Delta Squad, your mates aren't the most brightest either. Most of the times you'll see them splitting up and getting killed (because of the story) and the writers could've written better lines for the voice actors too. Being a psychological game you'll never feel surprised of your team members being killed off. What is worse you'll never feel pity for them because they're unlikable, two-dimensional dolls.Visually F.E.A.R. 2 is a real mystery. On one hand it presents a great world with some stunning lighting effects and great destructibility, on the other hand it's ugly. Everything looks sharp when you move, but stop for a moment a take closer look at minor objects, like consoles or books on desks. They look downresd, blurry and pixelated. The devil is in the details as they say. In the year when hardware pushing games like Modern Warfare 2, Resident Evil 5 or Killzone 2 were put on the shelves of retailers this kind of laziness is disappointing. One can look aside when it comes to these problems, but then there is the audio. The sounds of guns are just atrocious; every one of them sounds like they were taken out from an 80s Atari 7800 game. Every shot you have to take with the shotgun or machine gun irritates your ears. It's like firing with toy guns from the crappiest Chinese manufacturer.F.E.A.R. is a decent shooter with its flaws and assets. The formula that made the first game great has aged greatly and the horror factor is M.I.A. in most of the game. Great number of ""tricks"" has already been used up in the previous title or other games. When the horror is present the game feels like a real successor of the prequel, but those moments sadly end quickly. It definitely has its moments when it comes to shooting (the mech scenes are great), but drawbacks won't allow to have an experience like with the original F.E.A.R. game.Rating: 68/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 7 hours; Played on: normal.

												Primary from a cinematic standpoint in 2005, F.E.A.R. was an essentially innovative and distinctly competent modern shooter which elevated the genre and was reasonably enough considered the spiritual follow-up of pioneering Half-Life. Despite overall skills and significance in presentation and gameplay, the indisputable lack of variation in environments and fairly dull level design left a significant mark of an overrated first-person-shooter ovation. In response to certain issues, developer Monolith diligently implements a couple of noticeable changes in the inevitable sequel, however, not only are former flaws repaired, other flaws take shape while some are accelerated. All things considered, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is still a skilful and spectacular first-person-sequel, operating within competent mechanics without the elevating relevance of the predecessor.The first-rate atmosphere associated with the intense original unfortunately appears weaken as the objective of a Delta Force member (that would be you) united with squad mates is about to capture the unapproachable president of the suspicious Armacham Corporation that is currently being observed. However, as the objective backfires due to the nuclear incident previously witnessed by the original protagonist, mysterious events involving iconic Alma and Project Origin (hence the title) require some serious unravelling.Although original F.E.A.R. was hectic and spectacular enough in action, this beautifully keen and further expensive sequel boosts up the pace of dynamic visuals and sound more efficiently. While combat certainly is improved, the original game’s innovated bullet time appears further enhanced; as explosions of gunfire and grenades create additionally impressive visual and audio distortions, the masterly conveyed reflex time adds gruesome levels of bloody violence and enjoyable death animations. The superb audio direction continues the frame of reference mode and the excellent soundtrack provide the proper mood of excitement. The strength of the sly artificial intelligence seems preserved as well, offering plenty of unpredictability and enough challenges to evoke your alertness. As before, apart from the occasional change for the worse, enemies more consistently than not continue to response to your presence by flanking, covering and communicating with one another. Your weapons to encounter these opponents remain efficient and versatile, though with the exception of adding a couple of useful new models, the previous arsenal is fairly enough unaltered. A couple of armoured-suit sequences in which you enter a giant metal robot armed with machine-gun and rockets, similar to ED-209 in Robocop, have been added to bring some needful variety in chaos and destruction.Unfortunately unlike F.E.A.R., the story and atmosphere in the sequel is not as intriguing and dense as the up to date components of action, graphics and sound. Apart from an overall decent tension and a certain memorable elementary level, engaging narrative and dramatic devices is hardly founded, despite solid voice-over and half decent dialogue. A great number of readable items attached to the events taking place can be picked up and TV news reports can be seen, but there is rarely a penetrating moment that touches commitment and the unfolding of the story is distractingly abstruse. The occurrence of predictable jump-scares and basic clichéd creepiness has accelerated and become a bit tiring, but some of the attempts are at least decent enough to startle.Regardless of changes made to address certain issues of the acclaimed yet overrated predecessor, the final outcome of the sequel ironically still suffers from issues. As overall aspects of F.E.A.R. are reasonably kept intact, some elements are obviously improved while others unfortunately are impaired. The criticism of repetitive environments receive attention in variation and that mediocre level design is put to an end, however, exterior surroundings turn out to be quite illusory, reaching the silly corridor formula rather than opening things up. Furthermore, the strikingly tight atmosphere from the original is compromised since the pace of the action is picked up even further and the horror perspective is considerably downgraded into sporadic eerie pieces. Nevertheless, Monolith ambitiously creates a skilfully competent, partly enhanced follow-up that in most parts deliver a solid shooter without the essentials.7, 5 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favourite from the FEAR franchise. Monolith kept all the core elements of the original game (slow-motion ability) and they added some extra features, as well: occasionally you can jump into a huge mech and literally destroy everything in your path. These are great scenes - they are uplifting and bring some extra action the original game lacked. I know it is a psychological horror in essence, but there's nothing wrong with upping the action if you already have the slo-mo making combat fun. The player can now push objects, e.g. you can now turn over tables and hide behind them. I think fast reflexes serve you better so I did not really care about the cover-based approach, at all. Overall, the game looks and runs better than the original and it uses more vivid colours - the psychological aspect they could still keep without having to apply too many dark colours and shadows. There are more enemy types, more supernatural encounters and - in my opinion - a more interesting story. Instead of Point Man you now take control over a member from a delta squad which is tasked to protect the president of Armacham. The first level takes place just before the ending of FEAR so you can see the explosion from a distance and then go through the city only to see the devastation caused by Alma. There are some interesting findings and many collectibles that further explain the background of the Origin project so I'm not spoiling anything further here.The game wasn't exactly praised much upon its release. A lot of people from media considered it just an average shooter, a shooter that can easily be forgotten. I disagree with this - I believe FEAR 2 is a very good sequel and great care and attention was put into the making of it. I suggest you buy it and skip its awfully short DLC content.

Posted: September 24, 2014
												I find it'll be easier and less messy if I just put this as a Pro's and Con's list rather than an essay type review. At least for the most part.The Pro's:  -The graphics are quite good (player models, environments, etc), even by today's standards.  -Similarly, lighting and shadows are similarly fantastic.  -The voice acting is quite good as well. Notable actors such as Jen Taylor (Halo Series), Phil LaMarr (Halo, Metal Gear Solid Series) and John Patrick Lowrie (Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2) make an appearance in this game.  -While I see that some disagree, I quite liked the story, and thought it elaborated more on Alma and the Armacham Corporation's backstories and helped make me more sympathetic towards Alma.   -I also thought the environments were a bit more varied than the first, although there are still a couple cut and paste corridors now and then.  -The physics and game engine are quite good, and you don't need top of the line specs to run a good looking game like this.   -Several improvements were added (IMO) such as ADS, Sprinting, moveable cover, destructable environments (kind of), and more.  -Sound effects (except for a couple weapons) and overall audio are top notch, easily some of the best I've heard in a game.  -The sense of tension from the first game is still there, albeit toned down a little bit.  -The Elementary School level 'nuff said.  -Also unlike some, I enjoyed the ending, even if it was a bit WTF? at first.   -There's also an awesome  mech suit portion , even if it is a little out of place in a ""Horror"" game.   -There's a lot more, but those are the major things.The Con's:  -The game isn't as scary as the first, while I wouldn't call any of the F.E.A.R.'s genuinely horrifying (I'm pretty hard to scare however, not true for some people) the game often made noises, or flickered my HUD and either did nothing with it, or focused the scare somewhere where the player's attention wasn't designed to be focused.   -Some of the gun's lacked the ""Oomph"" they had in the first game, particulary the Shotgun and the Sniper Rifle (The latter wasn't in the first game). I quite enjoyed the feel of the shotgun in the first F.E.A.R, the one in F.E.A.R. 2 though feels and sounds particularly lackluster. Grenades also lack that ""Bam, Pow!"" sound when they explode, even if the explosion looks cool.   -The game is easier than the first one, which is caused by several things. On Moderate difficulty (a.k.a Normal) I often found myself just walking out and shooting enemies using Slow-Mo without even touching any sort of cover, something that you couldn't get away with nearly as much in the first game. Slow-Mo also lasts longer than the first game, at some points later in the game (after collecting reflex boosters) I could finish entire firefights in one use of Slow-Mo. I also didn't die very much, something I can't say from the last game either. Also, enemies aren't quite the bullet sponges they were in the first game (not a bad thing IMO), but this makes for firefights being a LOT easier, even with lots of enemies.   -The game is also shorter than the last one, the last one took me around 8-9 hours to beat, this one only about 7.  -The Enemy A.I. has definitely been tuned down from the first game, it's not awful, but many enemies will run out of cover, or rush you for no reason, which is a big change from how they acted in the first game. I've also watched A.I. blow themselves up with grenades and just not run away from them in general (Although this was rare.)Personal Cons (less important stuff and silly nitpicking, but maybe these things bug you as well):  -  Paxton Fettel  isn't in the MAIN game aside from being mentioned in documents. (I know he is in the DLC. But I liked him quite a bit in F.E.A.R  1)  -They took out the option to lean in and out of cover.  -The game has a more CoD/ modern shooter feel, rather than it's more unique first game feel.  -Speaking of which, this game added QTE's, there's not a crazy amount and their done with a decent amount of taste, but I still think they were unnecessary.   -The default controls are really odd, Shift to aim, right mouse to melee, V for thermal vision (which you use only once or twice in the whole game AND it's not necessary) the first game had similarly wonky controls, but it's still an odd thing to not change with a sequel. However, the controls are easily rebindable.   -The film grain visual option is on by default, it adds a nice atmosphere to the look of the game, but after a while began to give me a headache when combined with the motion blur, so I turned the film grain off.   -There's a turret section, two of them to be exact.   -All  Armacham and Replica Soldiers  look pretty much the same, aside from the visual differences based on the ""type"" of enemy. They also don't sound as badass as they did in the first game. Hearing a Replica soldier yell ""Flashlight!"" in a gruff voice was kinda awesome.   -The game also uses the horror game trope of somehow magically seperating you from your squadmates, and the FPS trope of having the environment become destroyed to become a perfect pathway to get somewhere.    -For such a good looking game, most of the skyboxes in this game look pretty bad and you can even see that the skyboxes go under the level in some places.-You are also a stereotypical mute protagonist, which makes for a couple of odd ""conversations"" with your squadmates.      Now, I don't usually give a number score with my reviews, (be it Steam or elsewhere), but I feel it's necessary with this one. Why? Because despite me having seemingly more gripes than likes about this game, I don't want you to feel that impression.      I like this game quite a bit, almost as much as the first game, and would highly recommend you buy it. $14.99 is pretty good price to pay, or about 9.18 Quid/British Pounds. It's a good shooter overall, and a pretty decent horror game besides that, which makes for an pretty good game all around. Finally, for the magic number, I'd give it an 8.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What everyone says about this game is dead on. It's a good game, it's just not a good F.E.A.R game. Almost everything in F.E.A.R 2 is a step backwards from the original title and its expansion packs. The AI is dumbed down, the graphics are weaker and blurry, the physics are worse, and the horror is almost absent. I would almost recommend playing F.E.A.R 2 before the original F.E.A.R, but I feel that would just take away from the greatness of the original title. F.E.A.R 2 is still worth a play through though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Better than F.E.A.R 3, but not better than F.E.A.R 1. F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin follows a whole new cast of characters as they navigate through the ruined city of Auburn to stop Alma. You play as Sergeant Becket, a regular old military man who was sent in to rescue Genevieve Aristide, but unwillingly gets mixed up in a plan that involves cleaning up what remains of Armacham and Alma herself. F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin takes the great gameplay from F.E.A.R 1 and improves on it. There are more guns to use, more grenades to throw, you can now flip objects to make cover, and they fixed the melee system so you can't speedrun by kicking everyone in the knee. My biggest complaint is that the Intel you collect is no longer in audio form, but written out. It's not really a big deal but I don't want to have to stop the game and read what is going on.F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is only as scary as you make it, literally. The game relies a lot on events that are triggered by the player rather than being scripted. While this sounds great in theory, you can miss a whole bunch of stuff if you don't take the time to explore. The biggest fault with the horror is that sometimes Alma jumps out at you and you fight her off... with a quicktime event. The game itself runs some tropes with a hospital and a subway setting, but surprisingly avoids the little ghost girl trope by making Alma older.It's not quite as good as F.E.A.R 1, but F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is definitely worth playing and is worthy to be called a sequel to F.E.A.R			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FEAR 2 was the first game in the series to be designed for consoles first instead of developed for the PC and later ported to consoles, and it shows in some ways. You can't lean or quicksave anymore, and the AI is notably worse (though still better than your typical FPS grunt), which isn't helped by the fact that the more confined level design generally doesn't give the enemies as much of an opportunity to show off their intelligence. It makes up for the losses by having generally smoother gameplay, better variety, and an increase of the weapon limit from 3 to 4, though, and remains at least about as much fun as the original game, if not maybe more fun. While FEAR 1 had two relatively lengthy expansions that added new enemies and weapons in their campaigns, FEAR 2 just has one DLC, Reborn, and while the main game is definitely worth getting, the DLC, which now costs nearly as much as the base game itself, is not. It basically just condenses a lot of the enemies and gameplay mechanics of FEAR 2 into a roughly 40 minute campaign, so if you just really liked FEAR 2 and want a quick encore of it then it might be worth picking up in a sale for a dollar or two, but it doesn't really continue the story or follow up on the base game's pretty bizarre ending in any relevant way except for explaining why a character shows up in FEAR 3 so if you don't plan on playing that you're probably better off just skipping it entirely.

												Before I started F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin out I was a bit worried that they might’ve changed too many things in it. The first F.E.A.R. was so amazingly well-balanced and fun that I wasn’t sure if I was gonna like the sequel. Turned out I worried about nothing because the game was even better than the first one. They kept the stuff that made it fun and improved everything! The graphics looked super good, the atmosphere was fantastic, the weapons were fun, minibosses awesome, the mech parts glorious, and the shooting as addictive as ever. I loved the fact that they switched the levels around a little bit to make it more interesting. Like I mentioned, at one part you’re in a mech, another you’re traveling in an underground cargo platform 100 miles per hour shooting enemies jumping on from all sides. It’s really fun. Even though the atmosphere is a lot better than in the last game it still feels a bit cheesy and it’s hard to get drilled into the narrative. Also, you feel really detached to the main character which doesn’t help when you’re trying to get invested in the game. Still, it’s a damn good shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's fine. Like incredibly fine. No it's not the scariest thing, nor the best shooter I've ever played. But playing through FEAR 2 is enjoyable. You're going to have a good time toiling about killing things and experiencing one of the most genuinely ""video gamey"" stories out there. It feels so authentically 2009 in it's presentation and design, that it's almost a nostalgia driven delight to play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

About The Games:The F.E.A.R franchise has always been & always will be a game about ""The Paranormal"" expect a lot of Ghosts in each of the games more so in F.E.A.R 1 & 2. That generally has a solid story line and to be expected in a game about the paranormal plenty of gore & jump scares. THESE ARE NOT BAD THINGS!F.E.A.R had you playing in the shoes of an unknown solider for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon Team"" or F.E.A.R for short, you went in and you were tasked to capture a test subject who was designed to control these ""Super Soldiers"" for a war. The project was a success except things went wrong & the leader went nutso & so you're here to clean up the mess.The ReviewF.E.A.R 2 has you playing the role of a new solider named ""Micheal Becket for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" who is in another squad & is deployed just before Harlan Wade released Alma in the first game, you were tasked to find & capture a doctor who was working on the test subject & then you are to eliminate the test subject & attempt to shut down project Origin by eliminate the main ""Ghost"" who was causing all the mayhem around the city, unfortunatly things don't pan out so well & then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan & of course once more you're trying to battle your way out of the storm.F.E.A.R 2 starts off right before you're deployed into the field, the first conversation from your squad fills you in on the parts you may have missed or if you didn't play the first installment fills you in on what has been happening for the first team. From here you're given a good understanding of your team & then you're plopped into the game and off to start your adventure.F.E.A.R 2 focuses on it's story more than F.E.A.R 1 did & it adds even more into it's ""creepy atmosphere"" by giving you a lot more of the Ghosts you knew and loved in the first game, it also adds more fluent combat in the game by making combat seem more stable and flow well, unlike in F.E.A.R 1 where combat felt kind of chunky.F.E.A.R 2 also saw a huge improvement in the Graphics department with a better engine, more impressive textures & even better shadows than F.E.A.R 1. (That game had some very impressive Textures & Shadows & even games today (2014) have trouble matching.)The Gameplay in F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin is based more on exploring & reading the many stewn about conversations & lab notes dotted throughout each map filling you in on the story & what has been happening with the Origin Project with a hint of action and a lot of Ghosts to spice things up from time to time. Expect nothing much different here as there was in F.E.A.R 1 where you were fighting Mercinaries, Super Soldiers & the occasional Mech, except this time you won't always be fighting on your own 2 feet, sometimes you get some help from your own Mechs.The Verdict:While F.E.A.R 2 is very impressive & most certainly improves on every aspect of the first F.E.A.R it's not what i could call better if anything F.E.A.R 1 & F.E.A.R 2 are very much at the exact same level as each other and it's hard to recommend either of them over the other, you really need to get both of them.F.E.A.R 2 brings you better graphics, more fluent combat & more creepy ghostly moments than F.E.A.R 1 but it doesn't beat the initial feeling that F.E.A.R 1 brought to the gaming world, where it added the ability to carry a gun during moments of intense action & still managed to make you be♥♥♥♥♥♥scared of an unknown presence waiting to tear your face off.F.E.A.R 2 also brought you an expanded version of the first F.E.A.R's story & made it's self well preserved in the sequal.The Rating:My final rating for F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin is a 7/10F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin brings you everything i said above, improved graphics, more scares & better gun play but it also feels somewhat lacking of what F.E.A.R 1 brought us. It could just be me feeling nastalgic about F.E.A.R because it was nothing short of another DOOM 3 experience when i was younger.And now i ask myself the question.Do I Recommend This Game?:My recommendation is most certainly a YES, this game deserves a playthrough at least once just because it's a good game & it expands on F.E.A.R 1's design flawlessly.Buy this & F.E.A.R 1 if you're able to and you'll most certainly have an enjoyable experience.Further Reading:Check out my Review on F.E.A.R 3: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/21100/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monolith had a wonderful reputation when it comes to sequels – for example: No Lives Forever I and II, Aliens Vs Predator I and II and to those who remembers Blood I and II. Unsurprisingly these are not the complete list of games produced by Monolith however I'm highlighting the fact that their sequels are normally better than the first. FEAR was a huge blockbuster that captivated many players to the world of the unknown; things that goes 'bump in the night' for which a famous icon of 'who's afraid of a little girl' was born. Given the proven past performance, it will be a daunting task to see if FEAR 2 supersedes FEAR in action, storyline and able to stand on its own two feet.So the choice here is that whether you prefer all-out combat and uncanny AI (a.k.a. FEAR) or a decent story (a.k.a. FEAR 2) yet the irony is that to truly respect FEAR 2 is to play FEAR first (like seeing Star Wars before The Empire Strikes Back). As a standalone FEAR 2 certainly brought dashes of horror and tries to break the 'story' barrier of introducing a new squad but it's not at all a replacement. Play it for what its worth however bare in mind that FEAR 2 is part two of the story hence really couldn't stand on its own two feet if viewed independently.(full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/f-e-a-r-2-project-origin/user-reviews/2200-466600/)7.9 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Teal DeerDevelopers: MonolithPublishers: Warner Bros Interactive Initial release: Feb 2009Genre: FPS, Horror #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationF.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin is the sequel to the “classic” F.E.A.R. and I don't have much to say in the way of a traditional review. Its a shooter, its kind of cookie cutter but a kind of weird shaped one that is sort of intriguing so you play with it a bit. This game continues the story from one but it doesn't really add much to me. Its sort of blasé. I didn't find myself engaged with it really at all. The horror elements are also lackluster. I don't recall a single moment where I felt much tension. In fact there was an area clearly designed to be scary in which the lights flashed on and off while apparitions bombarded the room only occasionally doing damage. In this cacophony of confusion I was not frightened, nor did I feel tension. The enemies had become a nuisance and I was unable to easily distinguish a path let alone the correct one. As far as hallway shooters go.. its fine. The guns feel good. People die. Slow motion will always be awesome. There are more modern touches for this game than the first with iron sights. However older elements like leaning have been removed. THE GISTAs a game on its face. Its still very fun. Shooting people in slow motion will be a staple of action games forever. But as a whole I feel very “meh” regarding the whole game. Especially in comparison to one.This section isn't really part of the review per se, It's more of a rantI feel like this game has suffered the proverbial “consolization” process. I feel as though it has lost its soul. As in the developers had their original vision in F.E.A.R. 1 made the game they wanted and are now forced to take that vision and pull on and stretch it to create more content. I feel very strongly about Crysis 1 compared to Crysis 2 and the reason I bring this up is that I feel the same thing has happened here. Both sequels took away what made the original games so unique in exchange for a standard cookie cutter hallway shooter. And I get it. From a business standpoint no one is ever going to say throw away what makes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money for something more creative and unique. Unless the formula really has gotten stale and a new IP actually is the better risk assessment for staying in business. I understand that businesses need to make a profit in order to take risks. At the end of the day I still recommend this game because it is fun. Its mindless and I hate to repeat myself but shooting people in the face in slow motion is really fun. There are also some mech and turret sequences with some really ironic music playing in the background that are sort of qwerky in an endearing way. It just feels a little soulless.Follow my curation for more ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A little short compared to the content the first F.E.A.R game provides (completed F.E.A.R 2 in a little over 8 hours), but with the Reborn DLC things look OK. Compared to the first game this one looks A LOT better, combat is flashy and feels really responsive. Most of the original weapons are present, but most of them are nerfed - the shotgun is noticeably weaker, which is fine considering that in my 3 difficulty runs in the first game I would use only the shotgun and the Penetrator occasionally. In F.E.A.R 2 the combat is also a lot more open spaced and the level design is a move forward in general, as the different office buildings from the first game do get quite tiring. The story is gripping enough and the horror elements do have their disturbing highlights, especially toward the end.I do also want to make it clear that the game is pretty flawed in some regards. First, it's the supernatural enemies - the different ghosts and fast moving zombies, which appear about halfway through the game. The supernatural enemies, like in the first game, are just tedious to fight. They feel cheap, as the sound effects that give them out are really subtle and it's really easy for them to flank you and hit you a couple of times for free before you can fill their heads with bullets. In the short intervals when I had to fight them I was incredibly bored and was just hoping that some more gunfights with Replica soldiers would come soon. Secondly, it's the AI. Compared to the first game it's actually a lot worse. Replica soldiers will rarely use grenades to get you out of cover. They will instead empty their clips in the wall or table you're behind and proceed to die to you while reloading. On the other hand, it's near impossible to sneak up on them anymore. A lot of times I would actually switch off my flashlight and try to sneak behind their squad for an elaborate flank only for them to immediately know I'm in the viscinity, saying nothing on the radio and just opening fire at me. Pretty disappointing, because the first game is still a cornerstone in believable AI, a decade later.Overall I do recommend the game, it's a fun, kinda arcade-y shooter that looks great even 8 years later and counting. A bit on the short side, and with a few flaws, but coupled with the first F.E.A.R installment it's a quintessential game to play for fans of the action game genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I've just started playing F.E.A.R 2 after completing the first F.E.A.R and I've gotta say F.E.A.R 2 is a lot scarier. However it has a few improvements and shortcomings over the original F.E.A.R but most of it makes up for it. F.E.A.R 2 takes place directly in the aftermath of F.E.A.R 1, just minutes before, actually. Because of this there is a lot of cross-referencing and it makes it much more enjoyable, as well as new and plentiful intel files and such that offer lots of insight into your character and also characters from F.E.A.R 1. That's all there is to it, really, I'll point out some pros and cons which will be updated as I play.Pros:-Four weapon capacity instead of three-Much, much scarier.-Sprinting system, and it's not forced upon you like in COD because you can only do it for a few seconds.-Graphics are better and more enjoyable. Has the same movement system with that strangely satisfying gun movement as you walk.-Much more grenade types and such-Tons of different enemy variations. You're not fighting Replica's and ATC security throughout the entire game like in the first F.E.A.R-Some objects can be moved to be used as cover, and there's a satisfying animation for it-Sleek, immersive HUD that has an explanation to it.-Lots of in-depth intel on weapons, characters, and other things.-Can aim down the sights now-Did I mention it's a lot more scary?Cons:-Removal of leaning system-Can only carry 3 medkits instead of 10-The difficulty is marred by the fact that Normal is laughably easy and Hard is mind-numbingly difficult with enemies able to take your armor AND health down in less than four shots. Monsters take 3/4ths of your health away in one bite on Hard.-Supposedly quite short. I'll judge that when I beat the game.-Cannot dual-wield anymore, however personally I did not enjoy dual-wielding in F.E.A.R 1 as it was forced upon you in some ways.-Small one, but the shotgun does not knock people on their♥♥♥♥♥anymore, and it's quite underwhelming in damage. Especially on hard. Having beat F.E.A.R 1 on hard, this urks me more than it should.~will add more~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By now, you’ve probably noticed that F.E.A.R. 2 is not a game that is renowned for its subtext or avant-garde design philosophy: it’s a standard, console shooter. There’s not a whole lot else to say really, but I’ll try and keep preaching as much as possible.You play as Mr. Generic, yet another ♥♥♥♥ing prodigal test subject that just can’t seem to catch a break. Cursed with stunted legs and an eternity of walking slow as♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're tasked with doing something or rather, with Monolith clearly caring enough to fill you in during the occasional loading screen for the super, special task of blah, blah, blah.Simply put, you’re going through some rough times as a psychic nudist stalks you, and things don't improve once the tentacles start showing up and Prince “Snake Fist” Charming gets involved. (Just another day at the office, I guess.)Visually, F2 looks quite good for its age and there's a nice burst of colour when compared to the grey palette of its predecessors. Combat isn't particularly enjoyable, but I honestly don't care enough to bother hating it. Enemies chatter over coms and demonstrate some decent AI, but you can literally just walk forward for the entire game, firing aimlessly and hit the slow-motion when needed. That's it. As for how ""scary"" it is, I can't say. Just like playing the original games, I've coincidentally ended up playing them while tired and bored, so I sat there stone-faced and yawning the entire time. If blood and guts is your thing, you might enjoy the atmosphere b— what’s that? Damn. The power went out. Here comes the spooky sound design and light show.Still, the gore and dismemberment is great and the satisfying crunch and splatter really helps immerse the player in the joys of corporate espionage and crimes against humanity. Mmhmm.All jokes aside, I'd like to dedicate this review to the GameSpy client and the potential replay value that could've been had outside of the incredibly forgettable campaign. The ending is quite the surprise though, leaving you reeling at how short the game was. ""Wait, is that it?"" I hear you ask. Why, yes, my inquisitive friend! Yes, it was.Dialogue is pretty hilarious and the writing isn't much better, featuring such gems as ""Have you ever seen a hippopotamus fight?"" and ""You must be hurting for some hurting."" Characters are clichéd, through and through, with Lt. ""Zoey-not-Zoey"" Stokes as the titillation/badass material.  F2 also wins the award for the funniest boss fight in history, allowing you to gaze at a snivelling moustache during an infinitely looping series of QTEs.I did enjoy hearing one of the NPCs from Half-Life 2 though, but the influences don’t stop there either with a bit of throwback to the Resistance series. (Let’s not forget the “prototype energy weapon” as well.)F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin doesn't do anything particularly wrong, but it doesn't do a whole lot right either; an exceedingly average experience even with the flashy engine and technical tricks. Thumbs down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unlike the original FEAR, the sequel is no longer a novelty, and worst of all, neither the gameplay improved, nor the story advanced. You are again trying to find a little ""scary"" girl. FEAR 2 doesn't seem to have the atmosphere of the original game either, so it basically becomes another average shooter. Not even unsettling a little bit. Hence I couldn't enjoy it at all, although I liked the first game. I do not recommend it even to those who liked the original FEAR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The really weird FEAR of the three. I was overjoyed of finally having varied environments, but apparently the change in the level's layout borderline killed the AI. It's so incredibly dumb after the first game, enemies tipping over tables for blockade then hiding at the side of it (being a clear shot) or just running towards you. So this is a letdown.The biggest plus of the second game that single-handedly made it my favourite: they learned how to tell a story. Having meaningful cutscenes, finding data logs, puzzling together so much more about the story than we knew made the game  really enjoyable for me, despite I could not take the shooting really seriously because of the AI. Though about shootings: weapons are quite nice to handle, granades are powerful and you're able to cook them so you can modify where they'll blow up, and their throw is *really* consistant - it's a fantasticly well working feature.If you can get past that the first FEAR is the ""most FEAR"" game, and treat the second as a less horror, more action and more story game in the first one's world, then you're in for a treat. I had low expectations but got utterly surprised how much I enjoyed it. (Huge thanks for the granades, really, if you play the game, don't forget about them! :D )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It starts minutes before the ending of the original F.E.A.R., and puts you under the role of Michael Becket, a Delta Force sergeant, whose squad's objective was to capture Armacham Technology Corporation's president Genevieve Aristide and bring her to custody. The plan was crushed due to catastrophic events happening, and turning the city into ruins. The game maintains the core gameplay elements from the original game, and incorporates a couple of new features into it. The stunning graphics which have improved, the breathtaking soundtrack, and most eerie scares remain present. What we have is the essence of F.E.A.R. with a couple of touches and a different storyline. A sequel that grasped to me and did not disappoint for the most part.

												Played F.E.A.R. several years ago with a buddy of mine, great game even though my memories are now almost gone..F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin is quite a beautiful sequel: it's an ""old school"" First Person Shooter, you know about that: get the ammo, medpacks and fight replicas (enemy soldiers) while following Alma's trails (main story).The most peculiar feature of this game series is time reflex enhancement which lets you slow down time, giving you a tactical advantage over a crowded enemy line. Game is plain simple, advance to next level taking down enemies and that's pretty much about it but you have nice weapons, different type of bad people along the way - not only soldiers but visions and monsters/creepy creatures. The setting is dark and there's plenty of blood, gore; visual effects are very well done too, vivid colors and spark lights contrast the black surroundings.Gameplay gets entertaining from the beginning to the end because there are many cutscenes, the story is well told and developed: you could say this is a ""complete"" FPS which doesn't go down in any aspect - it may not be a masterpiece but I think it's worth playing, especially ""if you already had F.E.A.R."" :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Expect to creep around corners and use tactics to stay alive. The AI will flank you, work as a squad and react intelliegntly to their surroundings.

												Overall whilst F.E.A.R 2 may not have been as good as the first game and its expansions, it did a great job of continuing the F.E.A.R storyline along. Now let's take a look at the pros and cons!Pros1. Excellent combat and gore added to this game, i think the gore even tops the first game!2. The campaign length was fairly decent and even managed to overtake the original game in length! (6-8 hours.) Whereas the first one could be clocked in 4-5 hours.3. Included a nice change of scenery in comparrison to the old game, going from indoor factories, to an abandoned school and walking through deserted towns.4. The game pieces together the characters only mentioned from the original game very well, well enough for you to have a clear understanding of where they slot in the story!Cons1. Combat wasn't as fun. The hand to hand combat was a bit brought down in my opinion and the enemies had better rag doll and physics, seeing as the orginal included a ""John Woo fighting style.""2. The DLC or expansion F.E.A.R 2 Reborn was a bit disappointing. Whilst the story was pretty good it was no where near the same length as the original games expansions, or as fun for that matter. 3. The story wasnt as interesting as the original for obvious reasons... (No Pointman mentioned or Fettel) 4. In a lot of instances the textures from the original still seem superior to this game as the replicas look better and the textures are more smooth! Overall whilst i may prefer the original, this game has still given me just as much fun as the original and makes a great addition to the series. For $15 you really can't go wrong with the purchase and it wont let you down!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a long time, as a movie fan, I wasn't quite sure of the difference between a horror and thriller.  Later I was able to piece it together:  Both are about adrenaline flow, but only one actively tries to scare you.I bring this up because it's exactly what acts as a parallel between the original FEAR entries (all three of them) and FEAR 2 Project Origin (and the Reborn DLC).  The original FEAR entries were intense games of cat-and-mouse, skulking about in the shadows hoping enemies with flashlights or automated turrets don't spot you, occasionally broken up by moments of first-person perspective horror more akin to Silent Hill than anything.  FEAR 2 drops this almost entirely - it has only a little bit of the surreal horror, and even that is played more as climactic narrative elements rather than memorable filler.  Each one of these scenes tells you something about the story, and as such they're less throw-away, but because of this, they don't scare you as much as they did before.  It's no longer a horror - it's now a thriller.But having said that, FEAR 2 is a pretty outstanding thriller.  There are moments of genuine tension (like when some troops are resurrected around you in small groups), but by and large, it's an action game with a greater emphasis on intensity.  The atmosphere is solid, the gunplay is less ""fun"" than in most FPS titles, and the horror thematic elements allow the missions to take an almost random turn at any point, sometimes outright breaking reality, and this keeps you on your toes.  The campaign is also rather lengthy, with an absolutely AMAZING ending sequence, so all in all I most certainly recommend this game.On a side note, the Reborn DLC is an excellent 90-minute or so secondary campaign that actually expands the story considerably in interesting ways.  Yes - it's DLC that ACTUALLY MATTERS to the future of the story.  For that alone, as well as the fact that it's just as fun as the rest of the game, I recommend getting the Reborn DLC if you can as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played the first game, be prepared for a dumbed down, but flashier and more story based, experience.Though the story is expanded upon, unquestionably, the game is now a linear corridor shooter with jumpscares and quick time events (that don't work well with keyboard, in a game that doesn't have gamepad compatability).While you may enjoy the game, it ends on a cliffhanger that FEAR 3 fails to deliver on, so invest in this at your own risk, keeping in mind that the multiplayer itself is dead.Edit: According to {EliteNoobSquad}Puškin the multiplayer is not dead.I wouldn't know personally, I wrote this review ages ago and there werent any servers then, so enjoy at your own risk.

												A step backward for the franchise, shuffling the games studios didn't help, but the story maintains its excellence.  The biggest problem is the generic nature of the engine.  Without the F.E.A.R. name, this would just be another forgettable shooter trying to emulate the genre's best games.  If you're a fan of the series, it's worth playing but if not, then don't worry.

												If you like horror games and first-person shooters then the F.E.A.R. series is for you.  The first F.E.A.R. game was good but it's a product of its time so I didn't enjoy it as much as this one.  F.E.A.R. 2 is way better than the first one!  The AI enemies are smarter and more natural compared to the first game.  The controls and weapons are better too.  As for the horror part, wow!  The jump scares and special effects are so much better and less expected.  There also seems to be more scares compared to the first one.  Since the graphics are better it makes the horror more chilling!  Since I play lots of horror games the scares have to be good to get me.  In F.E.A.R. 2 I have to admit, it got me in a few places.  This game is a good pick for the horror genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""They get what they want and they never want it again"" Courtney LoveI think this is a sad case of super human developers ""who listen"" to us mere mortals. We didn't appreciate the original's stripped down, function corridors designed as a showcase for ALL the sparks and particles (as well as the cutting edge A.I. and gun play). So they gave us these beautiful and ""bioshock detailed"" locations (special mention to the school).We complained it was too grey...now we have neon blue sparks, strawberry jam blood. and a wide variety of locations and pallette.We said it was a bit repetitive, so now we have these mech levels...At this point of community♥♥♥♥♥♥ we got our own way and basicly this franchise , which at one point was like the second coming of the fps genre along with HL2 was basicly left VERY pretty and crying in the shower. Just another  Z list shooter.I realy like it, but i realy miss that pornographic emphasis on particles.As it is , its a shining example of the genre and a realy cool development of the origninals story			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was an amazing follow up to F.E.A.R. The game looks great even though it came out six years ago. The controls are so smooth and there is improved aiming as well as being able to use the environment for cover. Better graphics mean that gore looks...really gory! Also, freaky stuff looks really really freaky. Alma is baaack! This game takes place right after the events of the first game. Throughout the game you are able to find files (shinies!!) to flesh out the story. The game also has achievements. I wish Steam would simply transfer the in-game achievements to their own list of achievements. Oh well. The story and horror elements are stronger felt in this game as you fight different types of soldiers and monsters and uncover more about Project Origin. Also, don't forget Alma. She is quite the force in this game, always waiting for you...F.E.A.R. 2 took what was great about the first game and simply enhanced it. All who loved the first game should definitely play this game. A good blend of action and psychological horror.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I find F.E.A.R 2 one of the best horror fps game ive ever played along with the first F.E.A.R and for example Doom 3,This game was in my opinion how the previous games should have been however there are some features better in the previous game than in  this one: + The weapons look really cool                                                            + better cover system                                                       +for me  i found F.E.A.R 2 more frightening than the first one ( from time to time u cant                                                         use ur flashlight and everything is dark                                                      + the story gets more interesting and has become more complex than previous                                                      + u can ride a power armor (mech) wich is really cool :)                                                       - u cant use dual pistols anymore wich i found a bit dissapointing                                                      - if u are a regular fps player u should at least play on hard to get a challengeI recommend this game to any fps fan, its a challenging game with a story rich campaign, or to ppl who love hentai although u cant see alma's nipples ( just kidding). The multiplayer however i haven't played yet but i think it will be pretty fun once i have escent internet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FEAR 2 isn't perfect, but it's certainly something special.  I simply can't see a reason why you wouldn't want to give it a chance-- unless you haven't played FEAR 1, of course, in which case you need to throw all your credit cards at the screen immediately and get that game.  Think Half-Life with crazy effects, slow-motion, a crazy conspiratorial plot, and Alma getting up in your grill to give you the spooks.  It has a few shortcomings compared to its predecessor, but also has the same great design and mechanics of the first game while subtly building on the established setup.Just like the first game, FEAR is a horror game told from the perspective of a mute John Wu.  It's terrifying, it's dark, it's atmospheric... but you're John Wu.  It's a fantastic game with Half-Life style storytelling and great writing, not to mention fantastic combat.  But...That Ending.  Just... that ending.10/10 would explode brain and get spooked again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was fun but went downhill the longer it went on.  You could really predict when the combat was about to start because the pacing was pretty much the same throughout the whole game.  The best part was that I finally understood that most of F.E.A.R. 2 could have been cut and...well the rest of that thought would be a spoiler.Oh, and I had to change the difficulty from Hard to Normal at the very end because it was over-the-top difficult. I hate when I have to do that.  I'm all for a challenge, that's why I set it to Hard in the first place.  But when you go overboard and bump the difficulty of the last levels from Hard to Yeah-You-Aren't-Finishing-The-Game-At-This-Difficulty you ruin an otherwise engaging experience.Like in the first F.E.A.R. I had fun again but I don't know why.  The story wasn't too compelling, the gameplay was predictable (or I'm getting good at seeing arenas when they are shown to me) and the entire premise is just...forced.  But it's a fun game.

												Playing F.E.A.R., its extensions and then F.E.A.R. 2 is a great lesson in FPS history and in the way triple A ♥♥♥♥ed up everything the way they did around 2008 ; when trying to improve on their licenses while having absolutely no grasp on what made their franchise good in the first place.The game does have some improvements when compared to the earlier title though.+ It's prettier and had aged relatively better than the first one.+ There is some NPC action seen onscreen.+ There is an attempt at having a story.+ The gunfight feels less one-sided and you can actually play it without constant slo-mo.+ Functional ladders, maybe even the best ladders in FPS hystory.+ Balsy finale... That still feel a bit off on the direction but was a bold move.Some changes are neither good nor bad.= One more weapon slot (you didn't need more than 2 in the first game anyway).= You only get slo-mo power ups rather than health and slo-mo, having played through F.E.A.R. 1 expansions I found that only those upgrades really mattered.= More linear than the previous game. While F.E.A.R. was nothing exceptionnal in that regard you often had 2 routes to your enemies encounter, allowing you to flank the ennemy.= You don't really get to have stealth kills in this one, but it always felt like an underused gimmick in the first one.= Call of Duty submachinegun Ironsight will most likely be the main thing you remember from this game.= Mecha sequences. Someone was apparently really upset that SHOGO 2 got cancelled... They are alright.And some are for the worse...- ♥♥♥♥ing ugly pistol.- Dumb QTE.- One terrible QTE boss.- No quicksaves.- Random checkpoints.- Shotgun nerf :(- Only 3 medkits. And the healing system makes little sense overall.- Bullet-sponge enemies that can one-shot you on hard when you have 100% life and some armor left.- Too easy on Normal, frustrating on hard because of the checkpoints.- I have played through really bad written games (I'm looking at you Crysis) but I think this is the worst game I ever played in that regard.- ♥♥♥♥s up its own ambience pretty bad, F.E.A.R. had some scarce jumpscare and cold sweat moments, this one only managed to make me jump in the opening sequence, the rest is just really badly paced and out of place when it's not downright boring.- Ennemy AI feels ""dumber"" than in previous game.I'm still happy I purchased the bundle on sale, because F.E.A.R. 1 and Extraction point are really pleasant to play (Perseus Mandate was forgettable though) but I would not recommand the purchase of F.E.A.R. 2, even (especially?) if you liked the first one.Overall, 4.5/10.

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin manages to continue on with the achievement that its predecessor began; it manages to nearly perfectly combine horror and action into a single game.  Though they keep the two genres seperated by making each segment devoted to one, it is done extraordinarily well and I can't think of a better game than this one to scratch both itches simultaneously.The story is enjoyable and the combat mechanics are well done as well.  The variety of weaponry was an entertaining aspect of the game as well, each player might end up with a different arsenal at the end of the game based on their tastes.  The horror scenes were enjoyable, and some parts were downright scary (I'm looking at you elementary school). My only real complaint with F.E.A.R. 2 was that the story seemed to get a little slow right around the middle.  Once I returned to the game after a short break and powered through another level, it got very exciting, though, and I'm very glad that I kept moving forward.I recommend this game to all fans of FPS and horror.  The game was enjoyable on both sides of that.  If you are a fan of the original, definitely pick this one up as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is hands down the most enjoyable FPS I've played since HL2.This game came out in 2009 yet it still looks amazing.It plays so well that when you see more enemies sprinting your way you don't think ""Oh for god's sake, this again?"", but instead ""Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes, bring it on!"".This game was £2 in the Halloween sale, but I totally would have paid full price for it, no question.Also aesthetically, this game is grey, dark and dreary, but it somehow makes that...interesting! It keeps the action strong by changing the location every ""chapter"", creating new environments, which are all detailed as hell, and full of character.I was aware of this game before, but labelled it as a game that just wasn't for me. But just like Bioshock, I got it in the sale and played it and enjoyed it and looked back at it and can say with nothing holding me back; This is a new favourite game.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FEAR made its mark as one of the best first person shooters of all time, and a monumental achievement in video game horror and storytelling. FEAR 2 barely seemed like it tried to do better, but neither did it try to only be more of the same.The gameplay took a bit of a turn for the generic, falling into the recent crowd of iron-sight shooters that encourage you to be a lightning-fast bulletstorming hero. The first game had realistically inaccurate weapons, but allowed you to lean from cover, both allowing and forcing you to be more delicate about how you handled each firefight. FEAR 2 has no lean ability, so cover is substantially less useful, as you have to expose half your hitbox to get the crosshairs on your enemy.Melee and slowmo are still there, hardly changed, except that melee attacks are no longer one-hit kills to common soldiers. Action-heavy sequences such as the giant mech suits essentially act as glorified turret segments, desperately trying to out-bullet your foes.As far as horror goes, the original FEAR was a little in-your-face with a lot of the scare scenes, but handled the atmosphere with excellent subtlety and sensitivity. The atmosphere in FEAR 2 is far less satisfying, as it is, in turn, much more outrageous. Outdoor segments are often punctuated by blood red skies and outrageous ambience, failing to immerse the player the way the original did. Sections of the game relying on simple, tried and true atmospheric tricks such as low lighting and eerie silence are much more effective.Some of the enemies tend to be legitimately terrifying as well, often in conjunction with the superior atmospheres of the levels they appear in. Watching the Remnants idly try to act out their lives as they did before they died is deeply unsettling, and sneaking past open cell doors knowing Abominations stalk between the darkest corners slowed me to a stop even on my second and third playthroughs.Unfortunately, in keeping up with modern action titles, FEAR 2 undermines a lot of its horror by forcing you to escape scripted insta-death events with furious button mashing. Naturally, the biggest draw to a sequel to FEAR would be the pseudo-'antagonist,' Alma. After FEAR, I was left in eager anticipation to see what she might wreak upon the world. Everything that goes wrong in FEAR 2 is because of Alma. Her character is handled reasonably well in the sequel, even as she is far more apparent and active in trying to get in your way. Her comparatively bi-polar nature is unnerving, as you're never quite sure what she's trying to do to you, though this might instead be confusing to players who struggle to follow this considerably more disjointed plot. A lot of imagination went into furthering Alma's story, but its difficult to decide if that imagination came from the passion of the writers, or their desperation to be more unexpected and outrageous than last time.Bottom line is, FEAR 2 is not the sequel I hoped it would be, and certainly not a landmark achievement in any of its genres, but it came closer than it could have. Many parts of the game toe the line in terror and storytelling drawn by its predecessor, but it never exceeds it, and fails to maintain that level of quality throughout. It's worth picking up on a sale for anyone who wanted more Alma, more FEAR, and more slow-mo scissor kicks, and if you're like me, largely unsatisfied by the so-called ""Vivendi timeline"" of Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate.

												Just great as F.E.A.R. 1, but this is a sequel with updated visuals. I recommend playing this at night, it creates a horriffic atmosphere, there are thankfully no cheap jumpscares and the horror scenes are done very well, but most of the time the ""flickering"" is being used too much and from point it stops being spooky.As for combat it feels like a call of duty game (Unrealistic weapon Recoil), headshots do more damage but dont instantly kill the enemy, and yes as you expeted from the previous game, the AI is actually tactical and well made.

												This sets off after the first game, where you play as a man named Beckett, rather than Pointman (the character from the first F.E.A.R game). His story will likely put you in some interests even though he's not Pointman.There are some changes in this game.You can now carry 4 weapons now instead of 3.You no longer carry 10 medkits, but only 3.The Slo-mo meter is near the crosshair.The health upgrade is no longer present, but the reflex upgrade is still there.Thats as far as I noticed, cant remember grenades. The story is pretty good, and lots of action and some good horror. I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin  The second part of FEAR in my opinion the best game of this series. In the game you control a member of the anti-terrorist unit named Michael Becket. The plot is extremely addictive and the climate will keep you held the seat from the beginning to the end of the game. The main antagonist is the leader of a terrorist group but also a little girl (to be precise mature woman) named Alma. I have to admit, and even now the graphics in this game looks very nice as well as lighting. Opponents are mostly terrorists, Replica Soldier and sometimes, depending on the stage will fight with paranormal beings and mutants or something like that. As for the weapons, there are even a lot but it's more about the feeling when we use them. The biggest flavor is ""Bullet Time"" so that we are able to slow down time. The game I would recommend to anyone, the game has a cool story, atmosphere and soundtrack. Certainly you will experience dose of action but also and fear. As for the multiplayer I am played with a few minutes and I have to admit that it is cool.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. 2 improves on many things that were bothersome in the first game, but also changed things that didn't necessarily need to be changed from the first game. The combat is vastly improved and more fun than ever, but the horror element are not as effective as it was originally. The graphics have been buffed up significantly since the series debut, with better lighting effects, a deeper color palette, and some cool ghostly visual effects. However, the new engine the game uses seems to strongly favor a console design which is apparant through the enlarged UI, unnecessary quick-time events, and other additions to the gameplay design. So let's get right into it, what makes FEAR 2's gameplay so different? For one, level design has been changed dramatically. In the original FEAR, levels were sporadic hallways that twisted around in an endless maze of confusing warehouse and office building design. Thankfully, FEAR 2 has more believable environments with larger outdoor areas that feature plenty of cover to play with the weapons you want. The game allows you to carry an additional weapon, now maxing out at 4 but reduces the amount of healthkits you are allowed to carry from 10 down to a measly 3. This never really bothered me though, I played straight through the game and probably died only once on the normal difficulty setting. Enemies are very easy to overcome thanks to the ability to slow down time whenever the situation gets out of hand. Unlike the original, enemies take a lot less damage to kill and all of the weapons feel effective including the SMG. The melee in this game is still terrible. I used it in a few situations, but never did it down an enemy in one hit, so I felt as though i had wasted time meleeing when I could have just been reloading one of my guns. The game offers quite a few large weapons like a rocket launcher, sniper rifle, laser gun, and even some experimental blue shock gun. But I never felt as though any of them were really necessary. The game offers these huge weapons but never really presents an enemy that they felt effective against other than the one or two big mechs you have to take down. There's also a few levels that give you access to your very own mech which is fun to use. You can mow down countless enemies with powerful miniguns and launch a load of rockets at heavily armered mechs whilst using a cool thermal vision. The horror element that the game's title would imply just doesn't seem to be there anymore. ALMA no longer appears as a little girl in creepy places, and instead the big jump scares in the game are just the teenage naked ALMA running at you and forcing you into another repetitive quicktime event. I kept waiting for a big scare but it just never happened. The story picks up close to the end of the first game, right when the nuke goes off. You take the roll of a new silent protagonist who also happens to have the ability to slow down time and shoot people, which makes absolutely no sense because now you're not even remotely related to ALMA in any way. The game has some more interesting characters than the first game, but not interesting enough for me to even remember their names. They feel more like disposable puppets used to shock you whenever ALMA shows up and decides to kill them, and never did I feel emotional towards any of their inevitable deaths, despite the music and other character reactions implying that I should. Unfortunetly, FEAR 2 removes the cool answering machine background storylines that helped give more life to the world and instead replaces them with boring PDA text files that you are told to find in every level. I liked the answering machines more because they didn't interupt the gameplay itself and allowed me to listen while I was looking for the next exit. So overall the story, just like the game itself, does some things better but then does some things worse. The graphics have taken an inevitable leap forward, with an engine that really gives me that ""Unreal 3"" vibe. Especially when you shoot enemies and they turn into ridiculous bloody red mists and yell out similarly to the ""Boomers"" in the ""Gears of War"" franchise. While the game as a whole has more interesting colors, especially in the Elementary School level, the game as a whole felt like a blur of red, gray, and a slightly darker gray. The UI is enlarged to rediculous proportions (most likely to make it more readable for console users) and large prompts appear on screen whenever you approach an object to interact with like a door. Everything about the game itself implied that it was a console port, but thankfully the game has aged well and performance is without any faults throughout the entire game. So to summarize, the gameplay is more action oriented and more fun than ever, but the horror element behind the game suffers deeply because of this. The storyline is pretty uneventful, save for the ending that cliffhangs into the sequel, but it's easier to follow and more interesting than it was in the first game. The graphics are better, but there are many indications that this game is simply a console port and considering it came out in 2009, it could have looked a lot better had it not been held back. Definitely recommend giving the game a try as it was a fun simple shooter, but it certainly isn't the masterpiece that I've been told it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SPOILERS AHEAD : In this game you play as special ed student Lee Warner who has the ability to slow down time by clenching his sphincter muscles. On his way to school one day, Lee's happy and care-free life is turned upside-down when a tragic short-bus accident kills all of his friends and his mom and his dog. Hell bent on vengeance, Lee injects roids, which combined with his natural retard strength makes him an unstoppable murdering machine. He later learns that the mysterious and sharp Pointy Man and his hoot of a partner Owlma flipped the bus over using magical powers and that they're gonna blow up the whole world if Lee doesn't stop them before snack time. Lee soon discovers that his friends are alive thanks to the bus driver being a closet necromancer, and sets out with his best friend, Woody Harrelson, to stop Pointy Man and Owlma's evil plan. In a strange twist of events, in a sweaty fit of roid-rage Lee, while screaming at the top of his lungs and charging into battle, crushes his own balls between his legs by accident and collapses at Owlma's feet. She then proceeds to violently♥♥♥♥♥♥him and impregnate herself with all three of his remaining sperm cells. The final scene of the game shows Lee re-murdering his ressurected bus friends and joining Owlma, Pointy Man, and Drew Barrymore atop the world to watch it all burn. Great fun for the whole family. 2/10 would recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never did play F.E.A.R 1 just because it dint look very good. it just looked like a first person shooter with some jumpscares thrown into it. But then a long time ago i played the demo for F.E.A.R 2 in ps3 (witch i have to ask what happened to that area you play in the demo? was it removed?) and i decided to buy it recently. Im glad i did and here is why:pros -interesting story-fun gameplay (for the half of the game atleast)-good jumpscares and creepy atmosphere-visuals are amazing-Slow-mo mechanic that is fun to usecons- cliffhanger ending ( what hapened to the main character? did he die?)-gameplay gets repetitive eventualy-jumpscares get repetitive and aren't as scary later onWhilst this game is pretty fun for most of it , it does get a bit repetitive towards the end and i found miself rushing the game.  And finaly my opinion on Should you buy this game?If you like horror games and fps shooter games then yes , you shouldthis game has very fun fps sections and scary horror sections.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Granted, I finished this game in basically 2 sittings; yesterday and today; May 1-2, it was a fantastic experience. There were answers and tidbits of information throughout, there was atmosphere, some occasional scares, sci-fi mystery, the action is far better than the first FEAR thanks to things like iron sights and select fire as well as the different grenades/explosives you have at your disposal. The story was, for me, quite engaging. I was very interested in finding out how things progressed, and the end had me looking forward to FEAR 3. Well, you can check my review on that if you like, but here's the several paragraphs of hatred summed up in 2 words: It Sucked.I find FEAR 2 to be by far the best in the series, FEAR 1 is 2nd best with monotonous but acceptable combat as well as great atmosphere, and FEAR 3 is... well, let's not ruin the moment by bringing that up again. I wholeheartedly suggest getting this game, and while I think it'd be good to play FEAR 1 first, I definitely think this game can be enjoyed without doing things chronologically. Just... make sure you STOP at FEAR 2, unless you don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about story or firearm realism, just wanting to blow stuff up with the occasional little needless spook from Alma or other unexplained monsters. Maybe FEAR 4 won't suck... but if it still focuses on that ridiculous 'brother' nonsense, screw that...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely better than the first and in my opinion even than the third  F.E.A.R. 2 is a very good game that suffer of the same problem ruining a bit all this trilogy, the insane difficulty of the game not allowing people to have much fun when played at max difficulty.Also, i found the plot, altough amusing and interesting, a bit confusing so that you just aim to kill enemies more than enjoying a strong story. So, considering these ""little"" flaws this game get from me a solid and positive valutation.My Final Score is 88 /100  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IMHO this game is much better than the original FEAR. I enjoyed it so much, even though it's still a warFPS (only human bots) for about 85% of the game. The first game seemed to me two games in one, a horror story adventure and a warFPS, and these two were not much in context. But FEAR2 is really ONE contextual game. Sadly it's a console port but still far better than some other i saw. Good work Monolith!Pros:- Very hyped graphics. Millions of details and if you are carefull enough you can find many small references of Alma's past.- Weapon system is perfect. Four weapons can be held, and the weapons itself are very enjoyable (except the Napalm Cannon).- Weapon sounds are good, ambient sounds are perfect, music is better than perfect.- Alma is cooler than ever. No ugly Fettel, except for the built in expansion (Reborn).- The machine cannon and moreoverly the power armor parts are awesome, especially the thermal view of the armor.Cons:- Still a warFPS for most of the time with boring human bots uses way too good aimbot hitscans. Nothing better than one-hit instakills by snipers!- Only ingame achievements, no Steam.- Some part of the game is needlessly hard. The fight on the moving freighter against countless Replica elites and the Reborn campaign 2nd level is unfair and frustrating.- Console port, though a better one, still cannot use more than 3 mouse buttons.8/10 Very good horror warFPS.

												Because Alma is Alma. Whoever never played FEAR can't understand why.Anyway, FEAR 2 is putting you in the shoes of Michael Becket, a sergeant in a special unit, used to answer to any kind of special missions involving paranormal (F.E.A.R.). Unfortunately, he's sent to retrieve Aristide, the mighty CEO of Armacham Technologies, that has something to do with the current problem in Auburn district. After a powerful detonation (the ending of the original F.E.A.R. game), he wakes up in an hospital, with people trying to kill you and with Alma Wade, the powerful spirit, taking an interest in him.The plot serves to erase Perseus Mandate (a weak link) and Extraction Point (one of the best add-ons I've ever played) and to make a continuity in F.E.A.R's universe by the original developers. While I find it interesting as it's focusing also on Alma Wade's personality and her conflicted feelings. It's true that in itself, Armacham is a company with many secret projects (Origin is one of them, hence the title of the game) but I'm more attracted to Alma's struggling and story than Becket's.Anyway, FEAR 2 is a FPS, like the previous game. While in FEAR, your HUD was pretty simple, in FEAR 2, it's more elaborated, like you have connected glasses or helmet on the head. However, Becket, during the story, will acquire a power that the Pointman in FEAR has: bullet time. True, Becket isn't Alma's son contrary to the previous hero and the previous antagonist. But trust Armacham to play with your character.Anyway, that bullet time is very useful when you have to battle strange creatures or Replikas, clones and soldiers that are controlled by telepathy. You're not alone to fight: the rest of your team is helping, though they're nearly all affected by Alma apart for your lieutenant. Anyway, you fight, you shoot and you take advantage of your environement. You choose which weapons to use, you improve your power thanks to syringues and you collect information in the form of folders. That's how the story is also revealing itself.FEAR 2 has some hard passages, mainly in the high difficulty (hospital, research center, the last fight). While it's well-balanced, you have to be resourceful. Even when piloting an EVE (big robots), you need to take into account everything.However, FEAR 2 is perhaps more tragic than FEAR in the sense that Armacham never hesitated to cross lines for experimentation. It was already creepy to learn Alma's story in FEAR, here, you're learning that she wasn't the only one to be exploited like a piece of meat. While it makes sense to explore an hidden hospital as you were operated, to try to find a way out of Auburn destroyed or to put an end in another hidden compound, it's shocking to find the truth in a school and mainly what's under it.While the previous game was mainly set during the night, this one, when outside, is a daylight game. However, as you're in a battlefield, the graphics are showing this world in chaos, whether you are. And they're pretty good for this game. You're not let down during your hallucinating periods (Alma's doing) or when you're in the real world. Alma herself is less creepy in her adult form but only because she wants to appear normal in Becket's mind - else, she's still the creepy young adult that seeks revenge on the world for what happened to her and her sons.The soundtrack is also very good, fitting to the fights or to the important moments. The voice actings are also good. If anything, I've two favorite tracks that I've listened a lot when I used YouTube as my playlist.Anyway, I loved this game. I'm just sad that there is no Steam Cloud - the technology back then wasn't spread or existing for other games - though it's been a long time since playing but I remember when I changed desktops, that's how I discovered that I've to unlock everything again, as the game has ingame achievements.Like any FEAR, even FEAR 3 that I still need to play, the best is still the plot and Alma. FEAR 2 is an excellent sequel, though I wish Extraction Point to be still cannon - forget about Perseus Mandate. That game is a must-have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was certainly an improvement upon the original F.E.A.R. but it still has it's faults. But first let's talk about the pros:- improved gameplay- better graphics and lightning - decent amount of content- interesting storyNow the bad things about this game:- The shadows look worse than the original F.E.A.R. even on max settings- Some things were cut from the orignal F.E.A.R. that I would of loved to kept (i.e. slide kicks)- gets kind of boring after playing for a couple of hours- not scary but more funny (probably just me)If you played the original F.E.A.R. you will also be disapointed at the fact that there is no point man but you just start off as some random guy with a parallel storyline to extraction point, if you can call it that as this game doesn't relate to extraction point in any way.This game is still worth a try and should be played, even if you haven't played the original F.E.A.R.

												Gone is the intrigue. Gone is the intelligent gunfights. Gone is the sense of 'FEAR'.FEAR 2 is unfortunately a game that virtually feels lost during its development. Monolith is the studio who made the popular Shogan game previous to FEAR, and FEAR 2 is some kind of bizarre cross-over. The franchise at this point has become lost in translation. It no longer has the slow pace, building tension, between amazing gunfights. The whole game has become a B-movie sci-fi chiller. Enemies now consist of dumb sparsely populated goons in crappy generic-looking masks.But as initially fun as it may seem to jump into a mechanical military exo-suit, and start blowing everything up - you soon realise Monolith have succumbed to the Call Of Duty cliché. The fun wears off very quick and you remember you wanted to play FEAR, not Mechwarrior.It's a damn shame. FEAR with its smart enemies should have been the template for future FPS games but instead we're stuck with dumb AI and scripted events thanks to the obsession of console-oriented games (COD). I can only reommend this on the strength of a half decent FPS, it nearly has nothing in common with the first game. Big disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Right now I am in the process of playing every F.E.A.R. game so it was at most a few days ago since I played through the first one. This means the memory about F.E.A.R. 1 is still fresh in my mind. First of all, the one main problem with the first game were the boring, grey, office building type levels. On the plus side the AI was fairly competent, the guns felt good enough and the story while scarcely told was enough to motivate at least somewhat to continue. All in all it was a mechanicaly excellent game.Going instantly to the second game after playing the first one (with expansions) was a bit jarring. The game certainly looks nicer and while in its core it is with no doubt F.E.A.R. the differences in the mechanics can throw you off a bit. First thing I had to realize was that there is no leaning anymore. At all. This was an often used feature in the first game which saved my sorry♥♥♥♥♥♥more than a few times. Secondly the guns don't just feel as good as before. Thirdly the AI might be a lot more competent than it is in other games but it just does not compare to the first game where the enemies constantly flanked me, and I went down in a few shots even in normal mode. Generally you seem to take a lot more hits in this one making it a hell of a lot easier. And lastly, one of the most fun aspects of the first F.E.A.R. the ""kung-fu-moves"" are reduced. Normal punching and air-kicking is still there but my beloved ""sliding"" seems sadly gone.The story is told much better and the ""scares"" while still not really scary at least to me, do a fine job at setting the mood especially with all the fancy new effects. I don't know how you could comprehend what is happening if you haven't played the first one though.The levels were much more diverse but had still that certain problem of ""I just know when the enemies must be coming because I am suddenly just standing in this big empty room"". Also there is the unnecessary addition of notes to find everywhere which feels rather forced.To sum it up comparing to F.E.A.R. 1: Levels more diverse, story better told, mechanics went downhill towards an average shooter level.So all in all a slighty above average shooter.

												Project Origin tells the haunting, fearful tale of EA's drunken decision to create Origin in the alcohol-induced delerium that they can compete with Steam, oh wait that's not what Project Origin is, my bad.I've heard people say that the FEAR sequels aren't worth the time to play, that they've decreased in quality over the years. However, since I loved the first FEAR and it's expansions and since FEAR 2 was relatively cheap I decided to give it a whirl, and I'm glad I did.One of the things I loved most about the first game was the dynamic gore system, FEAR 2 amps the gore up, almost making the gore on par with Left 4 Dead 2 despite it's engine age. Enemy dismemberment is still brutal and satisfying, especially with the tight-as-a-toigar shooting mechanics. The combat is fast-paced and sends your heart rate soaring, with level design and first-person animations that are immersive and with an inventory that can easily be depleted if you're not cautious. Just like FEAR 1, the combat is the top-selling point making the entire gameplay experience delicious. The developers also improved on the combat, granting the player an extra two weapon slots, more powerful firearms including sniper rifles and flamethrowers and even the ability to further interact with the world in the form of creating improvised cover against enemy fire, you can slide out couches, push over cabinets, and yes, even flip tables  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻While FEAR 2 improves on all of FEAR's strong points, all the weak points remain untouched. The story is yet again lacking, failing to grab my interest and any exposition to it results in my impatient finger-tapping, the characters all feel two-dimensional and seemingly only exist to die at a later point in the game. The worst part of FEAR 2 is quite easily the creepy little girl jump scares. Jump scares are cheap shots, with no build-up and having no need for atmosphere, they are a blemish upon this game. One thing I was dissapointed about was the removal of Q+E leaning, which left me more exposed to incoming fire that I felt was needed, as well as the removal of quick-saves, leaving me 100% dependant on the foul teet of autosaves. Ignoring my quips, FEAR 2 is a really fun game, with it's combat, music, level design and explosive action, I'd definately recommend any players of the first FEAR to give this one a go.ALSO YOU CAN DRIVE A MASSIVE OVER-FREAKING-POWERED BATTLE TANK ARMOR SUIT OF SEXYNESS HOLY GUACAMOLE THAT PART WAS FUN.

												A decent sequel to F.E.A.R. The best visual design in the whole series – something more than just gray walls of underground complexes. Not much of horror in it and AI behaviour is simplistic making the enemies easy targets. However, the story is pretty good and it answers many questions I was previously confused about.What I didn't like was that it wasn't always clear where to go and that the quick save feature is removed.Nevertheless, it's a good game and I recommend it to all fans of the franchise.My overall rating: 7.5/10.Many say that F.E.A.R.3 was the worst game in the series, but I think that Project Origin is the one that deserves the third place.F.E.A.R.2: REBORN DLC: you play as one of the replica soldiers guided by Paxton Fettel, who is dead at the time  (shot by Pointman in F.E.A.R.). In terms of gameplay, Reborn is like Extraction Point, but much more sloppy. It offers only short 5 episodes (an hour of gameplay). There's not much of a story and enemy spawning and positioning isn't thought through well. It would be acceptable for an euro or two, but for 8 €, it's a steal. NOT RECOMMENDED.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R 2 is a divisive game amongst series fans, and the majority of the hate it gets doesn't make sense. There's only one real complaint I have with F.E.A.R 2, which is the game just doesn't seem to have the same level of care as the original. By level of care, I mean:-The FOV needs to be set through a .cfg -You can't lean-There's a weird delay to sprinting-The hud is terrible-The game feels slimmed down. They're all minor quips, but they're noticable. If you're willing to give it a chance, F.E.A.R 2 is a worthy successor that I feel surpasses the original in some respects. It's not as good as Extraction Point, but it's a game that's definitely worth a play. It does suffer from Wolfenstein: The New Order syndrome, so know that the game gets much better after the first three chapters.Play on hard and make sure to get the fixed hud mod through me or google because the standard hud is straight fugly.

												ATTENTION: REVIEW WAS WRITTED BEFORE PLAYING FEAR3While writting this (by this I mean before playing F.E.A.R. 3) I think this part of trilogy is the best. I was very impressed at start - mostly because of graphics (I find it most beautiful game I've ever played) and this combat. Comparing to first FEAR and the addons, combat is waaay more exciting and fluent - I've really enjoyed the fact you can move things like tables to make covers.The bad thing about this game is the lack of scary moments - I think I jumped twice or three times (prologue is the scariest part). This may be caused by forcing mostly on shooting. I'm also a bit disguisted by the lenght of the game - I finished it in 7 hours, could be a little longer.Some words about difficulty - it is harder than the first FEAR and PM/EP. Enemies look like more clever and more intelligent than before.Anyway, I think this game is the best FEAR game.I can't say anything about Multiplayer, however.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was always told that F.E.A.R. was the best of the series and after playing F.E.A.R. 2 I agree, I still have to play the third one though. As I expected, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was a huge improvement both graphically and gameplay wise. I'd say it's still a great looking game and I could clearly notice how the gun handling was improved. I felt like on the first game the recoil was somewhat too much and needed more recoil compensation on the player end but on F.E.A.R. 2 I think they've ""perfected"" the shooting to better suit ""casual players"", while I think this is a good thing I understand if others think that the first game had more ""realism"", if you can call it that, to the weapons. One thing I still find to be rather ""lazy"" about F.E.A.R. 2  is that most of the guns are basicly just new skins of the older ones, you've got the assault rifle, the submachinegun, the ""penetrator"" but I gotta admit these new skins look pretty damn nice so I forgive them, one other thing, or maybe it was just me, I'm pretty sure they re-used the enemy voices and player and enemy animations from the previous game, I'm not complaining they did just the right job but I still find it lazy on the developers end. At the end of the day they did a pretty good job in keeping the shooting just as great as in the first game with improved visuals and gun handling, not to mention you can pilot Mechs on this one which I found out to present a nice variety of gameplay but, they did also put some turret segments in the game (I believe two), which I feel they didn't overdone it like some games. Still I think despite of having a great shooting experience, F.E.A.R. 2 wasn't that tense or scary as the first one, I think that's because of the improved graphics everything looks more ""colourful"" while in the first game everything looked kinda dark and sinister. In the end I think F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a fine piece of work and definitely a great shooter with a nice continuation to the F.E.A.R. plot and the ending clearly gives you the clue that's more to come, I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, either if you're looking for a great first person shooter single player experience or a first person shooter with a paranormal twist to it, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is clearly the game for you.

												I’ve heard some people say FEAR 2 is inferior to the original game, but I actually prefer it over FEAR 1. Most notably, the graphics of FEAR 2 are greatly improved, now comparable to other Xbox 360 games/ports. There’s still an issue with default key bindings being weird compared to other modern FPS games, but you can change those easily.FEAR 2 picks up a little before the end of FEAR 1, ignoring the FEAR 1 expansion DLCs. This time your character has a name and you actually feel like part of a team, instead of just having a lot of people talk to you on the radio. However, similar to the first game you’re on your own most of the time when the bullets start flying. Your team is tasked with rescuing the CEO of Armacham Corporation, the private military contractor with more firepower than most first world nations. The Armacham leadership is trying to cover its♥♥♥♥♥by blaming the disaster from FEAR 1 on the CEO and sending in black ops teams to wipe out everyone and everything that could tie them to illegal activities. Not to mention *SPOILER* at the end of Fear 1, Alma was released, so she seems to have awakened all the replica forces around the city. You have a lot of visions of her wandering the halls and tearing people apart like Phoenix in the worst Xmen movie (you know which one). Like its predecessor, FEAR 2 is a first person shooter with a time slowing power that you can use to achieve tactical supremacy. The game seems a lot easier than FEAR 1 for some reason, possibly because the enemies don’t seem to have perfect aim anymore. There’re at least half a dozen new weapons, some of which are pretty cool (Lasers and electro grenades) and a pretty badass mechanized power armor that you can use to lay down the pain. Of course there are a lot of new enemies as well to soak up your bullets. This time around there are non-human enemies that have either been created by Armacham or were summoned by Alma’s psychic presence. You also need to fight some enemies with their own power armor (at least you have a missile launcher). A minor gripe of mine is that not all the weapons seem to have designated “roles.” For example the assault rifle and the submachine gun are basically the same thing. One is weaker but fires faster, that’s about the only difference. There’s also an energy weapon that is basically the same thing as the missile launcher. I won’t complain too much about it though since more variety is nice in a game with modern graphics. I wish there was better documentation of how enemy armor works. Most of the enemies seem to be wearing heavy armor. Does it randomly deflect bullets like in Rage, or just lower the received damage like in the Fallout games? The Hammerhead rifle is supposed to be great against armored enemies, but in a fast paced game like this, it’s really hard to see the difference. This is really kind of nitpicky though and it’s just something that stuck out in my mind, not a real problem.EDIT: I was wrong about the energy weapon being the same as the missile launcher. It seems to be more like a BFG 10k (from Doom) with lightning bolts shooting out of the main blast to fry people around it.Pros:+Great visuals and some unique looking monsters. The ghost summoner is pretty cool+A lot of “intel” items can be found in the game, which give you a flavor for the game world. It’s disgusting the kind of things that Armacham has been up to.+Slow-mo + sniper rifle = fun+Good story and a lot of replay potentialCons:-There’s this weird issue where each time a level loads, it seems to pause around 50% and not move until I alt+tab out of the game and go back in. I don’t know if this is specific to my computer but it also happened with my old non-steam version a few years ago.-The game has no Steam achievements despite having game achievements built right in (like 10 headshots or 10 melee kills). -FEAR 2 is kind of short. I went through it in about 6 hours on normal mode. It may take longer for someone who hasn’t played it before.Overall if you liked FEAR 1 you should like FEAR 2. I find it superior in pretty much every way. As much as I liked the first FEAR, I doubt I’ll replay it again because the outdated graphics really take away from the experience. With FEAR 2 I’ll keep it around to replay in a few months (smaller download size too). If you have this game in your inventory from the Humble Bundle, give it a try. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For whatever odd reason, there's an awful lot of fans of the original F.E.A.R. who consider this game to be inferior.  Personally I find both games to be about equally brilliant, but let's try to analyse the possible reasons for this, shall we, and see what conclusions we come to...    Firstly, F.E.A.R. 2 is absolutely, unapologetically a more blatant ""horror"" game.  A large part of the charm and uniqueness of the original was the way in which it spent the vast majority of its time being a reasonably straightforward (if thoroughly excellent) first-person shooter, with only sporadic - but thereby highly effective - bits of supernatural horror creeping in; with this sequel the devs decided to turn that balance of action versus horror into a more balanced fifty-fifty split, with all manner of beasties and what-not galore now terrorising the player as well as the expected super-soldiers and giant robots.  Perhaps some naysayers felt this made the series less unique, or made the horror less ""psychological"" and more, well, downright physical I suppose.  I can see that point of view, honestly I can.  But...I also can't really see how they could have maintained the same super-subtle unpinning of horror without simply REMAKING the original, and this is of course where all manner of ""art"" / ""entertainment"" industry follow-ups encounter controversy; not just games, but movies, books, bands, you name it.    How many people bemoan the fact that their favourite band didn't ""keep the same sound"", and essentially just keep making the EXACT SAME RECORD, over and over again?  How many people believe that Aliens took the stripped-back purity of Alien and ♥♥♥♥ed it right up the pooper-shooter by turning it into a slam-bang, high adrenaline ACTION MOVIE?  Here's the thing: You can't please everybody.  EVER.  Some people want to recapture what they experienced the first time, more or less verbatim, while others want something which is sufficiently different to distinguish itself from the original product, though perhaps with just enough in common that there's some continuity maintained.  I personally belong to the latter category.  I would much rather play F.E.A.R. 2 than F.E.A.R. 1, MARK 2.  There is a difference between these two concepts, after all.    So what one needs to ask themselves, then, is what kind of person they are, or to put it another way...if you enjoyed F.E.A.R. 1 and are wondering if you will also enjoy this one, then perhaps THESE are the questions you need to ask yourself:  Are you the kind of person who enjoyed the first game, in spite of ""not normally"" being a fan of horror games?  If the answer is yes, then perhaps this one may go too far in the ""horror"" direction for your liking.  Or are you, like me, someone who actually HUMOURED the original F.E.A.R. on account of it appearing to be something of a horror game, in spite of the fact that most of the screenshots seemed to indicate otherwise?  If so, then you're probably gonna ADORE this one.  And if you're somewhere in-between the two types of people I just described, well...wait for a sale and take a punt anyway.  Why not?  You only live once.    There are other differences between the two games, of course.  This one is arguably a bit ""harder"", not least of all in the earliest bits where you don't even have the benefit of your slo-mo ability to make up for your♥♥♥♥♥♥poor marksmanship (I felt THAT one, believe me).  Your ""health"" isn't nearly as generous in this one, either; expect to get more-or-less ""insta-killed""...a LOT.  The soldiers also don't tend to be quite as ""vocal"" as the earlier game...but given that the soldiers in the first game had virtual diarrhea of the mouth and a tendency to give away their location at every possible opportunity, this is arguably an improvement.  You also don't get to shoot two pistols at a time or perform those oh-so-impossible first-person jumps which suggest your character has springs instead of legs (in this one, you actually see your character's hand realistically propel him over obstacles, etc), so overall, a slightly ""grittier"" level of realism is definitely the order of the day here; and again, it's up to the individual whether they consider this to be a boon or an abomination.    If you ask me, this series didn't really start to go (and even then, only slightly) ""downhill"" until the third F.E.A.R. game; which I personally also loved to bits, though I would be inclined to agree with anyone who thinks it's the weakest of the three.  But hey, it gets harder and harder to stay ""fresh"" as a game series progresses, so what do people expect?  If you're happy to live your life in stasis, you have my blessing.  Me, I'll take a pinch of spice in my bowl, thanks.  Then again, I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to stay in the same boring old job for fifty solid years, either.  Each to their own, it takes all kinds to make the world, etc etc... Verdict: 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK sadly there is NO NEUTRAL BUTTON! this game isnt as good as FEAR 1 but it is also not that bad but suffers from many issues...... is it worth to play? yes!BUT dont forget the issues:- the story is lacking, there is nothing really extended from the first title, it's very flat sadly.... i wished much more insights- the combat in my opinion is lacking a lot! without slomo you got this time only 20% chances to win as the enemies shoot ASAP when they see you and on hard you are dead in 1-2 shots which is plain UNFAIR!!!- combat again, sadly the game is much more action oriented which wouldnt be a prob if the scheme wouldnt be always the same, enter room, slomo, shoot 3-9 enemies, a few horror scares next room and another action room- the game feels movement wise downgraded, you feel they had prioritized consoles with controllers- the level design wasnt the best in fear 1, they extended it a bit more here but sadly not made it much better...... you walk straightforward find a blocked door, walk right or left and again forward until there is something blocked, right or left and so on and on..... - the environments are boring..... the school is the highlight sadly.... - the jump scares are to 95% unscary as you always expect something next- no manual saving/quicksaving, you always know when enemies appear or the next jumpscare cause the game saves at all points before something happens.... this is taking the scariness out and the surprises. how bad devs have to be....and some more points i forgot.... it's  a good game for what it is but after 1 playthrough there is nothing left and i had to pause every hour as the game bored me fast somehow.

												It's an average first person shooter but also a very disappointing sequel to my favourite first person shooter of all time although it would be crazy to expect something better than the original fear, i expected the game to be at least good when it released and it failed to do that too. The shooting, the weapons and the slow motion is nowhere near as satisfying or good as the original and it overall just feels like the average console shooter. The enemy ai is also nowhere near as good as the original, they feel very scripted and don't react very well to your movements. I feel like the game also struggles with the difficulty settings. Normal is way too easy and hard is just ridiculous they give the enemy amazing accuracy, they never miss a shot and you only die in a few hits. I switched to normal around halfway through the game because it just became so stupid and unfair which is a shame because the rest of the game became a breeze because there is no challenge in normal. A game should never have such drastic difference in difficulty between two side by side settings. I love challenge in games but there is a difference between challenge and unfair it's why i love the dark souls games even though they are very difficult they never feel unfair. That’s my little rant aside about difficulty settings i felt like that needed to be addressed.Some of the scares work great and some feel cheap it's very mixed. Nothing much happens throughout the story of the game which is a shame because i think that the series always had potential to tell a great story and the first game started it off really well and the concept for fear 2 is pretty good its just the storytelling isn't handled well.It sounds like i sh*t all over this game in this review but that's because it's the sequel to my favourite fps of all time so of course im going to compare it to the original and as it's own standalone game it's nothing better then the average shooter. It's only a 5 hour long game and i got sick of the gameplay just 2 hours into it. There are much better single player fps games out there, don’t bother.5/10 (Average)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin?--F.E.A.R. 2 is the successor of F.E.A.R., an immersive psycho-horror FPS with a fantastic bullet time mechanic.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R. 2?--If you loved the first F.E.A.R. game, you'll most likely love this title as well. That being said, if you felt the first game was too visually dated for your tastes, or too mechanically clunky, the game has improved leaps and bounds in that department. The game also favors action packed gun-battles a little bit more heavily than the first. The tension is very slightly lighter than the first game, but it holds enough strengths to more than compensate for this.----Over-all: 80.0%As a whole, F.E.A.R. 2 is a more solid title than the first game, and will appeal to a wider audience. That being said, some of the elements that make F.E.A.R. 2 a better game as a whole, slightly subtract from the immersive experience that was  the terrifying glory of the first F.E.A.R. game.--Mechanics: 4/5The mechanics are a definiteive improvement here, over the first game. Movement in much more fluid, bullet time is possibly even more smoothly integrated, there's more interaction with the world and terrain, the AI is very well done this  time around, and as a whole, the game feels very appropriately smooth and fluid.--Experience: 4/5In the five years between the release of F.E.A.R. 1 and F.E.A.R. 2, the developers have come along way in improving the audio and visuals of the game. The game went from passibly average looking (just enough so's to not distract from the experience) to downright gorgeous. The textures are fairly average, but  the artistic embellishments in conjunction with the fantastic visual effects definitely help this game shine. The audio has also taken a massive leap, helping tie the experience together. With all that being said, the psycho-horror elements of the game have been toned down just a touch, and that in combination with a few crowd pleaser moments, and the addition of collectible bits of intel, actually subtract from the experience slightly, in my opinion. The game is still fantastically immersive, and will draw you in, unlike many other titles to date, but in comparison with the first title, I feel F.E.A.R. 2 sacrifices a chunk of it's biggest strength -- the raw gripping psycho-horror elements, for a few fun, but unnecessary scripted gun battles.Balance: 4/5--Longevity: 4/5The game is slightly shorter than the first game in the series, containing only 14 missions of roughly 30-45 minute  length each. That being said, it doesn't rely solely on the immersive experience, unlike the first game, and provides a number little bits of intel for the player to run around and find, if that's your thing. There may be room for a second playthrough with F.E.A.R. 2, between looking to find the rest of the missed bits of intel, playing through on a higher difficulty, or simply just to enjoy the beauty and fluidity of the game for second time.

												Strictly inF.E.A.R.ior to the original and its expansion packs, Progect Origin is a comedy wearing the skin of a relatively drab military shooter. There are numerous things missing from it that gave the original much of its charm- the fact that when you bicycle kick someone in F.E.A.R., their head spins round and round thousands of degrees. You can't peek around corners and the stealth system is gutted in favour of run-and-gunning. Even on the hard difficulty. The voice acting is a mixed bag. Enemies are terrible and unconvincing. Your allies are pretty good, though, despite that their personalites aren't explored further than the most elementary of brushstrokes. The gunplay feels weaker, despite that enemies do explode into giblets when you fire a shotgun in their direction and I'm not sure how that's possible, but there it is. I mentioned comedy earlier: the ""actual"" plot- that is, the plot you get if you don't obsessively read all the pieces of intel- is a continuation from the first game, a horror-inflected, slightly dumb action-scifi. However, if you take the time to read the intel, it transforms into a sunday morning cartoon with more blood.  I realised this when I got to the elementary school level, finding a log talking about the side affects of drugs that were put in the children's food. Drugs that caused projectile vomiting. Additonally, in the school office, the parents of children report that their darlings are having nightmares about being shown violent images, strapped to chair and jabbed with needles, and that the parents were at a loss because they never showed their children anything of the sort, and are SURE that they weren't exposed to such things in school.  Even the bullet-time seems dull in comparison. What they have improved on is the degree to which the environment is degradable, and given you the chance to pilot a stompy robot. But even stompy robots cannot save this game from its sheer mediocrity. Don't waste your time. Replay the originals or watch a let's-play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's overall a very good FPS, but is totally different from the first.They screw up all the funny physic, smart AI and the gun feeling to have a more polished and realistic experience.In my opinion, the game is no more funny as the first, but graphics, level design and animations are very good and optimized (very good PC port).The game is short (6 hours with DLC), but the plot is dense and adds details to the story.Since I prefer the funny side of the game rather than the good looking side, I think this sequel is a deep step backward.

												Originally posted Jan 5 2012 gameaday-ish.blogspot.comStop me if you have heard this one: mute protagonist known as “Point Man” blessed with psychic/physical abilities to perceive time as a higher rate and plagued by nightmarish visions of a deranged and violent little girl shoots his way to the revelation that the bad guy, Fettlel, is in fact his cannibalistic brother. Both characters are children of the the little girl Alma, who is projecting her younger self from cryo-storage in the basement of a facility. Alma is a powerful psychic driven insane by extended experimentation and apparently,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to pregnancy.That, in a nutshell, is the mythology of the original F.E.A.R. Running concurrently to the last half of the first game is F.E.A.R 2 , featuring mute protagonist “Beckett” blessed with psychic/physical abilities to perceive time as a higher rate and plagued by nightmarish visions of a deranged and violent grown woman. He shoots his way to the revelation that Alma wants him to make babies with her, if only in a psychic not physical way.F.E.A.R. 2: Fear Harder is good looking game marred by an annoying choice to run film-grain effect over the visuals. Rather than emulating Japanese horror films this aesthetic makes the game look muddy, especially when I played it on 360. The controls were sluggish as well but on PC, and with film grain off, it looks and feels like the original F.E.A.R. which is not a bad thing.Added to the mix is the ability to operate the once feared mechsuits that terrorized players in the first game. Essentially invulnerable until the power runs out, the mech sequences are explorations in destruction as hundreds of enemies are mowed into pulpy gore. Very satisfying and never outstays its welcome, unlike the main campaign.2 Fear 2 Furious addresses valid complaints about the endless monotony of office corridors that plagued the original by providing larger more open environments that act as funnels into smaller corridors. Industrial design still dominates but there are some massive setpieces that offer real scope, especially in the aftermath of the explosive conclusion of the first game.Fun and propulsive, F.E.A.R 2 The Fear Police, suffers from hindsight that the tricks of the original that thrilled and amazed have lost their sheen.

												What is F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin?--F.E.A.R. 2 is the successor of F.E.A.R., an immersive psycho-horror FPS with a fantastic bullet time mechanic.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R. 2?--If you loved the first F.E.A.R. game, you'll most likely love this title as well. That being said, if you felt the first game was too visually dated for your tastes, or too mechanically clunky, the game has improved leaps and bounds in that department. The game also favors action packed gun-battles a little bit more heavily than the first. The tension is very slightly lighter than the first game, but it holds enough strengths to more than compensate for this.----Over-all: 80.0%As a whole, F.E.A.R. 2 is a more solid title than the first game, and will appeal to a wider audience. That being said, some of the elements that make F.E.A.R. 2 a better game as a whole, slightly subtract from the immersive experience that was  the terrifying glory of the first F.E.A.R. game.--Mechanics: 4/5The mechanics are a definiteive improvement here, over the first game. Movement in much more fluid, bullet time is possibly even more smoothly integrated, there's more interaction with the world and terrain, the AI is very well done this  time around, and as a whole, the game feels very appropriately smooth and fluid.--Experience: 4/5In the five years between the release of F.E.A.R. 1 and F.E.A.R. 2, the developers have come along way in improving the audio and visuals of the game. The game went from passibly average looking (just enough so's to not distract from the experience) to downright gorgeous. The textures are fairly average, but  the artistic embellishments in conjunction with the fantastic visual effects definitely help this game shine. The audio has also taken a massive leap, helping tie the experience together. With all that being said, the psycho-horror elements of the game have been toned down just a touch, and that in combination with a few crowd pleaser moments, and the addition of collectible bits of intel, actually subtract from the experience slightly, in my opinion. The game is still fantastically immersive, and will draw you in, unlike many other titles to date, but in comparison with the first title, I feel F.E.A.R. 2 sacrifices a chunk of it's biggest strength -- the raw gripping psycho-horror elements, for a few fun, but unnecessary scripted gun battles.Balance: 4/5--Longevity: 4/5The game is slightly shorter than the first game in the series, containing only 14 missions of roughly 30-45 minute  length each. That being said, it doesn't rely solely on the immersive experience, unlike the first game, and provides a number little bits of intel for the player to run around and find, if that's your thing. There may be room for a second playthrough with F.E.A.R. 2, between looking to find the rest of the missed bits of intel, playing through on a higher difficulty, or simply just to enjoy the beauty and fluidity of the game for second time.

												The best of both games on either side of this release. I personally think this is the best F.E.A.R. overall as it is graphically impressive enough not to be plain to look at, the game story and mood is very faithful to the original. It feels like a modern version of the first FEAR game. The design choices are a little different than the first FEAR which some people might not like. I know a lot of people miss the high contrast lighting that was traded for a more realistic, ambient lighting style, which I think is a fair complaint, as the old lighting was pretty cool. In terms of the overall graphics however, #2 as a whole is far superior.Multiplayer is dead, only purchase if you want to play the single player campaign.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I enjoy all sorts of war games, but this one is always so intresting & I'm always hooked too it. And I just love Alma, she is amazing. Scary but amazing.

												it certainly is a more action driven but it still has some good horror elements that can make your hair stand up. the story is well told and the new chatacters you are with are memorable. some new enemy types are welcomeing but nothing amazing. alma is still creepy and this time she is all grown up to a young lady. for some reason she is attrackted to you until the unexpected ending. the AI isnt as good anymore as in the first game but still put up a solid fight.

												It's good, better than FEAR 1. Ideally play the original first so you have some idea who the heck Alma is and why everything is happening. I think enough is explained in this game that you could get the story without having played the original, but you probably want to anyway because FEAR 1 is also a really good game.I found this sequel scarier than the original. Graphics are nicer, I got higher framerates than in FEAR 1, most of the guns are better designed (the SMG and assault rifle in the original felt awful, in this installment they're both very fun to use). The developers' aptitude at storytelling has improved from where they were when they made FEAR 1. This game feels like someone made the team from FEAR 1 play a Call of Duty game and they learned about making big cinematic explosion-filled bits and scripted sequences work amazingly well.Some small technical issues, none pressing: the default keybindings are strange and I changed a lot of them; the game doesn't recognise the buttons on the side of my mouse, which is weird because FEAR 1 did (how spooky!); the lowest mouse sensitivity you can set in game is still much too high for me at 800dpi and I wound up turning my mouse sensitivity down to 250dpi in order to get a ~35cm turning circle like I prefer in FPS games.The quicksave & quickload feature is just gone but after about 15 minutes I stopped missing it and started having more fun without it. Difficulty is a little lower and gameplay feels streamlined relative to FEAR 1.Some nice technical fixes too: widescreen resolutions now work properly, some noticeable graphical defects that the original had are gone (in FEAR 1, the decal system kinda fights with the particle system, but I didn't see that happen here), framerates seem better on the same hardware.Didn't pay any attention to the multiplayer, I assume that it probably doesn't work because there's a GameSpy logo on it, but I didn't check, I don't care, I bought this only for the singleplayer game, which is excellent.

												Like the first FEAR game, FEAR 2 was slapped around when it came out, ironically, for not being a replica of the first game. The main complaint was the watered-down melee system, which didn't matter to me, because I play first-person-shooters to shoot stuff, not punch stuff. What really bothered me was the weak story.But I got over it.All you need to know is that this game is made by Monolith. MONOLITH. These are the same people who gave us BLOOD, the best first-person-shooter ever made. Monolith is one in the trifecta of FPS giants: Id, Raven, and Monolith. Nobody makes shooters better than these three.Sure, I could go on a lengthy tirade about how the graphics have aged beautifully, the slow-mo gunplay is amazing, the level design is fantastic, the weapon animations are breathtakingly gorgeous, the enemies are compelling, the art assets are top notch, the story is basically a rehash of the first game with a twist at the end, the mech sequences completely crash the flow, and the elementary school level is scary as ♥♥♥♥... But all you really need to know is that it's a Monolith game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R 2 Project Origin, is a game where fear is really not an issue. Although one of the best shooters around, the fear factor is not the one i would appreciate in a game like this. True there are scary moments, but the game's basic core is the awesome gunfights and the bloodbath that follows. Even a scary sex hungry ghost seems kinda little, when you face her with:1 Lasers (Big deal, nobody is afraid of a big red beam that pierces everything!)2 Plasma Guns (So what if you can explode everyone with a single shot!)3 Apb Turret ( This is the reason why Arnold will hate you...)4 Mecha Armors (Cause if using an armored suit filled with machine guns and missiles cant guarantee you victory, then you are doing it wrong!!!)Also, if you ever feel like the game is really challenging, you get to use super slow motion to help you make the fights easier and more enjoyable (You get to splatter people like that and become a monster yourself ^^).The story is big and kinda generic with an ending that will make you wanna peck your eyes out, but still it was fun to play. If nothing else i got to feel like rambo ^^If you want to buy this game for a spooky ride dont, cause you will be terribly disappointed. If you on the other hand  want it for a pure shooting fest, by all means dont let it w8ing. You will love it!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It has a much better graphic than the first. Alma is a *lot* better. But there are fewer horror scenes, and they're not so intense. I've ended it on hard level, and it wasn't hard at all. 80% of the time you'll beat all the enemies using Slow-Mo. The other 20% are real hard parts, like the Training Center, the Wagon, and the arrival at Still Island.Also, crouching doesn't save you from being shot when you're behind an obstacle. What's the point on crouching then? It is not possible to lie on the floor too.Putting these cons aside, it's a really nice game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin (F2: PO) is one of 2009's most underrated games and still continues to get a bad reputation even today. It is puzzling as to why since the story is intriguing, the gameplay is solid and the graphics are up to par in modern day gaming. F2: PO's gameplay is similar to the original F.E.A.R. where ""slow-mo"" is still a favored featured that never gets old in its use. F2: PO has one piece of DLC called ""Reborn"" that is essentially a standalone addon that hardly contributes to the story. It's disappointing that the game never utilizes SteamWorks when the in-game setup seems so close to supporting features such as Steam achievements.All in all, the game is a solid shooter with a great horror-like atmosphere that continues the story of Alma.

												A great follow up to the original. I liked this one a lot. The gunplay was very solid and responsive, the slo-mo is just as fun as the first one and I don’t think there is anything better than pinning a replica to a wall with a giant spike. Well maybe blowing one to bits but they are pretty close. Good shooting mechanics and a variety of guns, plus you get to ride around in a mech, who can complain. The enemies were relatively easy to I would crank up the difficulty and don’t bother saving ammo, you will have tons. The story for this one is pretty good, it could have been fleshed out more but it does the job and advances the overall story arc for the FEAR series. The characters were relatively generic shooter fodder yet I was still intrigued to see what happened to them and compelled to get to completion. Also the collectables, although not necessary to get, add fun lore to the game. One more thing, Alma is as creepy as ever. As for the DLC Reborn, it was pretty good. Fun to take on the role of a Replica for once. It doesn’t do anything new from the main game and the story is rather throw-away but if it’s on sale it’s well worth a couple bucks.Over all its an above average shooter with a cool mechanic, awesome world and great set pieces.Have fun ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I'm going to start by saying that this itineration of FEAR is not nearly as good as the original. But after that has been said, its not too bad of a followup neither. The graphics are top notch, the story is not bad and a little bit creepier. Adds some new weapons and best part: you get to drive a mech. 7/10 for this one. Buy on sale and have a bit o fun.

												I have strange feelings about this franchise. I hate the first FEAR and refund my money back. After playing the game there is only very bad emotions and anger left inside me. So I have very strange feeling because i love the sequel as much how i hate the first one. I can't explain why but i just get myself smiling while i fight through my way and i enjoy the gunfight very well ! The paranormal effects didn't annoying and sometime works well and sometimes i just laughing on it. The whole game works for me while the prelude did not. If you don't played FEAR and FEAR 2 read the story of the first one then play the second !This game seriously f|_|cked up my brain. The hailed ai is a b|_|llsh|t anyway. It's just irritating and fustrating bad. The big essence of it : just drop enemies behind the player and respawn units from nowhere... This totally break the mood and make me seriously angry and kill athmosphere... After finishing the game only positive feelings left and i recommend to anyone. This is a great game !

 This game was executed pretty amazingly for an FPS horror game.  I thought this game wouldn't be as atmospheric at times in a gun game. But then there were those times where you didn't have a gun.I mostly got this game for the horror. I loved it. The school scene was absolutely the best. However, I find it was a bit too short. Obviously, there are multiple difficulties, but I don't really find any fun in playing the whole game over where the only thing different is rage factor. Of course, you can always come back to it a year later to give it another playthrough.I would definitely recommend this game. Although I did not care for the robots and all (I was mostly for the grudge girl, hehe), I still find this game worth playing if you like the horror genre. The school part was amazing.

												If you dug the story or gameplay in F.E.A.R. then its sequel shan't disappoint. More of the same but (generally speaking) going a little further with both ingredients in its formula.More spooky? Yeah, pretty much.More gunfight/explosion-y? Yeah, pretty much.All in all, packs the story quite nicely though and goes quite 'out there' with its content with some pretty grand 'OH MY GOD' moments.Nothing particularly new but if you liked the first game then it's quite unlikely you'd dislike the second one. ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, probably the scariest of the series; so long as we're only talking about 2 and 3. I haven't played the original, so I can't really say how scary that one was, but regardless; F.E.A.R. 2 may, in my opinion, stand as the definitive FPS horror title. It will never quite be in the realm of the big name horror games like Outlast, but it doesn't need to be. F.E.A.R. 2 provides a great FPS experience while still managing to scare and disturb.

 This game was executed pretty amazingly for an FPS horror game.  I thought this game wouldn't be as atmospheric at times in a gun game. But then there were those times where you didn't have a gun.I mostly got this game for the horror. I loved it. The school scene was absolutely the best. However, I find it was a bit too short. Obviously, there are multiple difficulties, but I don't really find any fun in playing the whole game over where the only thing different is rage factor. Of course, you can always come back to it a year later to give it another playthrough.I would definitely recommend this game. Although I did not care for the robots and all (I was mostly for the grudge girl, hehe), I still find this game worth playing if you like the horror genre. The school part was amazing. My favorite part of the game, by the way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wer die ersten drei F.E.A.R.-Spiele gespielt hat, wird einen großen Fortschritt in Sachen Grafik und Gameplay feststellen, aber auch einen geringeren Rückschritt in Sachen Horror. Dennoch: die Balance steht und die Story wird sinnvoll weiter geführt. Dass zu den beiden Expansion Packs zu F.E.A.R. kein Bezug genommen wird, merkt man nichtmal.Es ist nicht mehr ganz so horrorlastig wie seine Vorgänger, aber das macht F.E.A.R. 2: Project origin nicht zu einem minder guten Spiel. Ich würde es jedem empfehlen, es sich zumindest einmal anzuschauen, der die oder den Vorgänger gespielt hat - einen Blick ist es wert!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

F.E.A.R 2, while probably not as interesting as its predecessor, is an excellent continuation of the series. Its a first person shooter with horror eliments, nuff said. Many improvements have been made; combat system is deffinetely more fluid, weapons feel weak though. Overall interesting story, deffinetely a lot of freaky and dissarming moments that really scare the sh@t out of you. Alma is in your face from start to finish....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This recommendation is for the players that finished F.E.A.R. 1.I must admit that F.E.A.R. 2 was less interesting than the first one in many points. Even if the graphics were upgraded, and even if they understood one thing or two about level building (not making compounds too huge so the player doesn't feel like they will never get out of it).The story was less interesting because of the lack of mystery. In F.E.A.R. 1, you never truly understood what was happening, and it was this that make you continue. You wanted to know what was about to happen next. The sequel just makes you wandering throught compounds, outside environnements and an elementary school to find one people or an other. The presence of Alma is fast explained (in my opinion) so you don't need to find out anything by yourself.The horror moments, that were truly horrific sometimes in F.E.A.R. 1, are lacking solidity in Project Origin. It is way more direct, like representations of Alma attacking you, and hardly any shadows on the walls or any moments of chill throught your spine (elements that were doing really great work previously).I am still recommending it since it is a great FPS, the weapons are upgraded and less precise (in F.E.A.R. 1, the weapons were stupidly precise, the pistol was the best weapon in the game), and the environnement are really well done.

												Building upon the story of F.E.A.R. core story (excluding the expansions, sadly) you pick up shortly before the end of the first title. This sequel is a bit of mixed emotions for me, personally. The game introduces a sprint as well as Iron sight aiming familiar with other modern shooters, and retains the SloMo mechanics. Story begins as a different character who had showed signs of being able to be a psychic commander not unlike Fettel and thus is thrown into a multitude of tests and challenges to confirm it. How I felt this title lost a bit of its identity by switching to another developer, as well as story not quite likable or the NPC's either. Though there are some aspects that really called true to the genre. I would get this if its on sale, a damn good sale at that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not OP anymore like the SPAS 12 in the first game. Also the shotguns sound weak and feel weak too. Meh~Jumpscares are more frequent ~Bigger attempt at being ""scary""(But really this game's attempts at being scary with dark blood and jumpscares is laughable and made me almost fall asleep a lot~Boring underground dark science labs~Replica soldiers look badass but they sound weak, aren't as cool sounding and creepy and realistic as they were in the first game ~Alma wade is no longer a creepy adorable little girl, they decided to turn her into some naked women~Quick time events(Seriously)~Gunfights feel...less serious and dangerous ~Grenades don't explode on impact ~ShortOverall, this game is okay but it's nothing great and not as amazing as the original F.E.A.R.I never payed attention to F.E.A.R.'s storyline but I heard they screwed it up in this one so there's that.

Because it does it right.The music, the atmosphere, the gameplay, everything is great, the difficulty is pretty easy even at the highest difficulty but it's all right, I've seen worse.It's not a strategy game at the same time so let's be fair.I really love this game, both F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 are great games.Unvaluable gems In my opinion, of course, unlike the third one which is a fine game but not so great considering it is a F.E.A.R. game.You should absolutely get this game if you don't already have it, fan of FPS? Horror? Great music? Great atmosphere? You'll love it.This game deserves 9/10 In my opinion.F.E.A.R. 9.5/10F.E.A.R 3 7.5/10 (F.E.A.R. is a good game just not a good F.E.A.R. game).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin manages to continue on with the achievement that its predecessor began; it manages to nearly perfectly combine horror and action into a single game. Though they keep the two genres seperated by making each segment devoted to one, it is done extraordinarily well and I can't think of a better game than this one to scratch both itches simultaneously.The story is enjoyable and the combat mechanics are well done as well. The variety of weaponry was an entertaining aspect of the game as well, each player might end up with a different arsenal at the end of the game based on their tastes. The horror scenes were enjoyable, and some parts were downright scary (I'm looking at you elementary school). My only real complaint with F.E.A.R. 2 was that the story seemed to get a little slow right around the middle. Once I returned to the game after a short break and powered through another level, it got very exciting, though, and I'm very glad that I kept moving forward.I recommend this game to all fans of FPS and horror. The game was enjoyable on both sides of that. If you are a fan of the original, definitely pick this one up as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sequel to one of my favorite FPS games. This game feels like it was made to make the series more accessible for people. The guns are changed this time around to make the game feel easier when in gunfights. The A.I. is not as impressive as the first game unfortunately. It's not bad, but it has been toned down a bit. The grenade particle effects are also gone from the first game :( It's not all bad though! The long cooridor filled levels from the first game are gone. This game is changing it up every level. You even get to control an awesome mech to go down streets blowing up everything. This game is more difficult than the first one, mainly due to not being able to quicksave anymore. It has a checkpoint system this time around, which balances the game a lot better. The scares in this game feel even more terrifying this time around. The school easily has some of the scariest moments I have ever seen in a game. The new enemy types love to pop out constantly when you are least expecting it. The graphics have also got a nice upgrade. The deployable turrets were a fun new weapon, but I wish I got to use them more. The game is about 8 hours long, depending on how much you explore.

												F.E.A.R. was an incredible game with an AI the likes of which had never been seen. It had a decent enough of a storyline that acted as a great vehicle for getting to explore a very Akira-esque underground facility. It's still visually stunning to this day (I played it a few months back). All of those traits are dumped for F.E.A.R. 2. An alarming percentage of the enemies will stand off in the distance as you shoot them repeatedly in the head. If they aren't standing perfectly still, they will abandon cover and run straight at you. The storyline  is much more limited than the first. While I think the J-horror jump scares of the original were pretty dumb, the story was at least compelling enough to create a real sympathy for Alma. Alma plays a minor role at most in Project Origin, with the devs perferring you to have a strong bond with your mindless, soulless teammates while giving you no reason to feel connected to them except by telling you how close you all are. All of the imagination that went into the original facility is gone here. The sense of scale has been scaled down, if you will, to a couple of small buildings and an itty bitty underground lab.Everything about it feels more like an ambitious yet terrible expansion pack than a real sequel. If you adore the original as much as I do, I would definitely suggest you just appreciate it and it's second expansion pack, Perseus Mandate, and leave F.E.A.R. 2 alone as to not spoil your fondness for the original.

												F.E.A.R. 2 is a First Person Shooter Horror game.Also check my first review about F.E.A.R. 1 since this review is not as extensive as usually.This is because my F.E.A.R. 1 review already has most of the aspects in it. Also positive/negative wisely most is just the same.It doesnt continue where F.E.A.R. ended as some might think.It tells the story after the explosion from a different perspective.You are Becket. Just like in the first game you dont know who you are, except your name and your job.You are hunted by Alma again. But why is Alma mostly after you? What does she want from you?There is more than you might think. And why the hell does a guy called Snake Fist contact you?All this you have to figure out in F.E.A.R. 2.Game is mostly the same compared to the first F.E.A.R. except that some gameplay mechanics were updated like your hud. You wear glasses now which display your hud also your flashlight has no limit now. The graphics were updated just like the engine. Actually it looks very fancy. You can sprint now too.Game is still scary, even if some persons say its not as scary as F.E.A.R. 1.Cant really agree with this. The halucinations are even better now. They look amazing.The scene in the school is the best. I dont say anything more, I try to avoid spoilers in my reviews.And now you get actually directly attacked by Alma. You have to defend yourself when she approaches you.But actually she doesnt seem to want to kill you as other persons in the game tell you.Or maybe she is impressed that you are the only one who can resist her attacks.There is something more, something pretty surprising. But you will get this after finishing the actual game.Multiplayer is down because of Gamespy being dead.The actual playtime is around 7 hours for the campaign.There is also a DLC available but im reviewing this seperately.Positive:- Bullet time- Good Story- Big amount of options ingame- Alma is one of the best game characters ever- No health regeneration!- Somewhat good graphics (2009)- Great play with the dark and shadows- More modern feeling- Good and fitting unique soundtrack- Great freaking hallucinations!- Some nice environments, especially more compared to the first game- Good Enemy AI- Shooting is a lot of fun- One of the best and most surprising videogame endingsNeutral:- German Steam store version cutNegative:- Some questionable keys like shift for zooming with the weapon... Changeable- Multiplayer dead, gamespy downReplayability: MediumFor me this game was just as good as the first part. In fact I actually thought its even better, slightly. Mostly because it feels more modern and doesnt have problems with modern systems.I personally would rate it with 9/10 points.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If there was a neutral instead of negative, this would get it.Where as it isn't bad game, it's mediocre compared to first game. If first game felt like an Half-Life gameplay wise, this feels like Call of Duty. It's also pretty short. Guns don't have much punch in them, and the combat feels boring.Maybe if I didn't play it back to back with first game, it would've been more enjoyable, but only thing that this game does better is the looks. I was surprised when I launched the game that damn these graphics are quite good compared to first  F.E.A.R. But everything else it lacks.If you liked first one, and want to complete the story, play this. If not, it's just a mediocre shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The consolized follow-up to the classic action-horror shooter. It does not live up to the intensity of its predecessor due to its lack of soul and innovation.Pros* High production values for the graphics, the voice acting and the quality assurance* A few urban or underground setpieces are genuinely cleverCons* The horror sequences are not scary and the gunplay is far from being as satisfying as in the first game* The level design is unimaginative and the story doesn't pull you in – you have to wait half of the (short) game's length for anything remotely interesting to happenThe game is less surprising than the two expansion packs for the original game. Even if you are a fan of F.E.A.R. the revamped visual design is so different this game may not even work out for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really average shooter , Which  is a shame because F.E.A.R and its expansions were amazing . The game suffers from a lot of problems . They moved from a manual save to a checkpoint system which is terrible because they  are really badly placed. Enemies spawn out of thin air . The AI isn't any where near as good as F.E.A.R . The enemies often run out of cover , and don't communicate with each other  . The guns feel like pea shooters , and the difficulty is all kinds of unbalanced . Either the enemies are total push overs or they're pulling off crazy headshots from across the map . There an absolutely stupid amount of post processing effects in the game ,so many that actually has a negative effect on the gameplay . The only redeeming feature is the kickass mech  but you only get to play with it in two sections.  Its not the worst fps I've ever played , but Its a poor sequel l to one of the greatest games ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You have to be joking. Waiting almost 3 years to play this patched up mess did nothing to help the fail that is at the core of this rubbish. Laughably cliched in every sense of the word and utterly, uselessly dated. Little girl leaving entrail splattering destruction with a horror movie ""gotcha"" scare attempt every 45 seconds isn't merely cliched, it's just lazy.

												High quality console shooter. Graphics are nice, sound is present, there is even some kind of story. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A F.E.A.R. GAME AT ALL. All they have to do is to copy the first game and polish graphics - bam, another award-winning shooter. Instead of that devs decided that players like being tacticool - press ACTION TO CREATE A BAD COVER. Walking robot parts are plain boring - w+m1, stop to regen. Weapons feel light (probably because of reloading animations, especially sniper rifle which is made of paper. Speaking of sniper rifle - you can quickscope). At least the enemies seem to be as smart as before (on hard). Unfortunately they are just cannon fodder - walking robot and turret parts will make you yawn. Btw right before the last interval you'll be forced to sit behind the turret to shoot enemies while listening to some generic rock music ( Snake Fist (Instrumental) - look it up on YouTube). Oh, and your dudebro ally will be shouting some nonsense - like I am in CoD or something. Lack of manual saving, weak story, short duration, casualisation - all of this killed the spirit of F.E.A.R. The game is good as a console shooter, I cannot deny that. It is just not the game I was expecting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OVERALL THOUGHTS:A good game that has two brilliant gameplay facets, that are let down by several smaller problems. However it shouldn't ruin the experience too much, as those ""brilliant gameplay facets,"" are really freaking awesome. Would recommend, definitely.STORY:You play as a man named Becket who, despite actually having a name, is as quiet and as the Point Man from FEAR 1. The game begins right before it's predecessor ends, with Becket and a team of soldiers trying to find and secure Armacham employee Genevieve Aristide. After a simple first level that teaches you the basics of gameplay and gives you a few good scares, the operation goes south when the entire city is levelled from the nuke Point Man detonates in FEAR 1. You wake up in a hospital and discover you and your teammates have been experimented on, against your will, and now Alma is drawn to you, as well as a very stereotypical sergeant with all of armacham's military might intent on wiping out Genevieve Aristide, you, and anybody else who could spill the beans on the company's bad deeds. The over-arching story is a little nonsensical but is presented dramatically and it's very, very well done (except for a few not-so-good voice actors along the way) so it is forgivable. The story also expands on Alma Wade, the figurehead of the series, and turns her from spooky ghost girl into a character you actually can feel very sorry for, until her naked, wrinkled corpse begins hunting you and trying to... do things to you... The ending of the game is actually really good though, and even though I knew what was coming, I couldn't help but still be a little freaked out. It WILL make you want to either replay the game, or go and buy F3AR (Yes, they spell it like that).GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is pretty similar to the first game. It's a first person shooter with a heavy emphasis on strategic combat against squads of intelligent AI but also comes with levels that aren't just corridors (and encourage exploration), as well as some truly horrifying sequences. Unfortunately the game is a little uneven in some regards, as the action-shooty-shoot-bang side of the game feels rough compared to FEAR 1 with the AI seeming less intense and almost less intelligent , and a lot of the new features feel shallow and useless. However the enemies are still fun to fight, and are still much smarter than the average COD campaign AI. You won't use the optional ""Flip cover"" mechanic at all, however, as it's quicker and easier to duck behind something else than to press ""e"" and go into the slow animation of flipping a table. A few guns also feel stupid as well, such as the pulse gun. It's supposed to be like an energy bazooka thing that fires a big plasma ball that travels reaaaally slowly before melting anything it touches to bones, which sounds cool, but its clunky and awkward to use and doesn't even feel powerful, so instead of that I just used the awesome missile launcher as my heavy weapon, and it worked just fine. There is also an added feature of a giant mech walker ala Titanfall you climb into at certain points and wreck stuff with, and those two sections were amazingly fun and I loved them very much as it gives you the ability to grind through tough enemies like a hot knife through butter and blow holes through walls. It's empowering and a blast, and it's rare enough to keep from getting in the way of the horror.Speaking of horror.... The horror lands on the side of horror that is a slow, creepy build up where your jumping at shadows and noises, to full on freaking the heck out when things escalate, and boy do they escalate. The first bits of horror you encounter in the hospital level left me horrified beyond words, then the ruined, nuclear waste of a city had even more potent scares and mutant enemies who could raise the dead to fight for them which was frightening, stressful, and a lot of fun to battle through. But, like the action part, the scary parts have their flaws too. The developers seem to have decided, ""well there's a few parts in the game where you're just solving puzzles, or progressing through an area between firefights without shooting anyone... This'll be scary if just throw in a few spooky looking enemies, or those invisible ninjas everyone loved from the first game."" Unfortunately, this was not a good decision. In the third or so level I got tired of blowing through the same enemies that once frightened me so badly, and while I loved the invisi-ninjas in FEAR 1 and was excited when they came back they too grew tiresome. Fortunately there must've been some devs who understood scariness, and after the third level those enemies were replaced by a much scarier opponent (and their scares lasted much longer) until much later in the game, when they were re-introduced and made very frightening again, and the invisi-ninjas don't show up enough to ruin the experience, but they will cause serious annoyance. Overall, the horror side is fantastic and can be downright terrifying as it makes you, the gun-toting soldier, feel weak and powerless as some young woman with godlike abilities is hunting you down.SIDE NOTES:- Alma is fully grown in this game, and she likes to wander around naked. There are also heavy forced-sexual themes, so this is especially not for younger players, or for those sensetive to those materials.- While not a very graphically intense game, it did give my ancient Radeon HD 5750 some trouble before finally ending its life. The replacement card (an HD 6850) did just fine running the game, but it built up a bit more heat than I would've expected.- While the game is fully enjoyable on mouse-keyboard, it is, unfortunately, a console port and plays better with a controller.- The save system is annoying when first starting the game, as it only saves at checkpoints and the first checkpoint in the hospital level is really far in and I had no idea, so I wandered around the hospital for at least 20 minutes, did some stuff and got off only to get on later to realize I had to restart that level because I didn't hit that one checkpoint. All the other checkpoints in the game are well placed and non-bothersome, but that one is a pain.- On the subway level I somehow fell out the map twice and had to restart from a check point. The rest of the game seemed rather stable on the bug-side.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can hate and defend with Fear anything.  Yes much more then just a scare flick, it is tactical, nerve racking and just fun.  many dog this story and say Fear 2 is lame with bugs all over.  The truth of it is that there nit picking looking for reasons.  Stuff like shadows that dont' fit the object casting them.  listen if your picking on litle stuff like that, your not playing the game, your watching someone else			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F.E.A.R. 2 takes place concurrently (only for a short time) and during the aftermath of the first F.E.A.R. You play a SFOD soldier named Becket whose team is grabbed by Armacham, juiced full of experimental drugs, and then sent on a mission to stop Alma while chasing down leads on the how and the why of it all. You get the gist of the story in radio communications and in-game cutscenes but all the details are in logs scattered throughout the levels, similar to the first game but there's a lot of more of them this time.F.E.A.R. had amazing graphics at the time and Project Origin doesn't disappoint. The effects are similar to the first game with lots of sparks and dust when the bullets fly. The best looking effects come when you're having hallucinations. Colors fade, return, your view goes blurry and sharp, lights flash on and off. It's impossible to describe effectively.A big complaint about the first game was the lack of variety in environments. It was a lot of offices and industrial areas. Personally it didn't bother me much, but Monolith took it to heart. Of course there's more offices and industrial parks but there's also a school, a medical facility, research labs, and the destroyed streets of Auburn. You never feel like you're walking the same corridors over and over and no one environment really overstays its welcome.F.E.A.R. 2 also has the same fantastic gunplay that the first game had. Enemies are quasi-intelligent in dropping for cover and flanking your positions. That said, on normal difficulty, the game never gets too hard. I don't think I died a single time. Between the abundance of armor and health packs, the whole game is just a little easy. The only nuance that threw me at the beginning is that when you hit the slo-mo button on and off, there's a little bit of a spin-up and spin-down. It was basically an on-off switch in the first game so having a second of delay really threw me off at the beginning.My favorite part of this game were the areas where you get to stomp around in the elite power armor. It isn't just for the amazing amounts of firepower the elite power armor brings, or the carnage of the fights you get into with it, but the effects while you're in it. As it takes more damage, alarms scream, the screen gets distorted, and warnings flash manically. It's a hell of a lot of fun and really makes me clamor for Monolith to make good on the easter eggs it's put in recent games and make a sequel to SHOGO: Mobile Armor Division, a mech game they made a decade ago.There's no easier way to put it: F.E.A.R. 2 is an awesome first-person shooter. I played through it all in a single day, which is a task I don't think I've ever done. It's basically amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After the stellar FEAR, I was interested to play FEAR2 and see how it would compare.  One of the main issues in FEAR was the lack of variety in the environment. This is thankfully fixed in FEAR2! With varying environments such as schools, clubs and hospitals. Also the fun slow motion combat still remains intact thankfully. Also the environment graphics and paranormal effects are really well done. However the horror is still the same, maybe creepy sometimes but never really gets scary, even with obligitory cheap jump scares! The story is bland and the ending is not only really dumb but exposes plot holes in the story. Also the game has been made rather mainstream in comparision to FEAR, with no save anywhere features, a focus on large set pieces and lots of quick time events which is a shame. But it's still a fun game if you're a fan of the FEAR series and of FPS's in general, hell you could do alot worse anyway!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although this game is a slight step backwards from the first it is still alot of fun, if your a fan of the first game you will find enjoyment here (although little to no innovation) and if your a new comer to the series you can jump in without any previous knowledge of the first games story. The only criticism's i have is the lack of innovation from the first game although some may actually like that and the game seemed alot easier than the first on normal difficulty though that is easily remedied by playing on harder difficulties or not using the games Slo-mo mechanic but despite its ease i still felt scared whilst playing.

												Continues the story from the original F.E.A.R. and actually starts right before the explosion. You are assigned to the team and ultimate mission is to stop Alma. This game is very enjoyable if you're not expecting it to be exactly like the first. The second stands fine on it's own and has a nice creepy paranormal feel to it and some gamers found it scary. It runs fine maxed out and what few bugs it released with have long since been patched out. This game has also had a nice price drop and should be played if you're a FEAR fan or just like paranormal (1st person) shooters. It has single player and mp, though the focus is on the single player. There is also a single player (priced) dlc ""Reborn"" that reintroduces Paxton Fettel, and the video for FEAR3 has him and Pointman returning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
