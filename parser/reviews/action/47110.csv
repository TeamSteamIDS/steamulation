												Fun to play.You can do quests and get new items. Each quest unlocks something new.. Also you can play mini-games. Some kind of survival game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had hoped for a simulator of being stranded like a kind of Gilligan's Island the game sort of things, but instead it appears to be a game where you do a lot of building which is all fine, however building takes so long that it is best to play the mini games. Problem with the minigames is you start with only 50 as a cap and many games give you far more than that as a reward.Fun little game and great if you're one of those green-skinned casual gamers too.
