												I love this game with the same passion that I hate it. I can't recommend it to general/casual players, because it is so harsh, unfriendly and unforgiving. But I can recommend it to people looking for a real challenge, who won't mind looking for information on the Internet and dealing with frustrating game features (which are most of them).The core mechanic of this game (a brawler fight with flying machines and attached weapons) is loads of fun. It's a fresh original concept and it is done perfectly. Different weapons have _very_ different characteristics, every each one feels different, and there is extreme attention to detail. Basically, every pixel matters - if you hit your enemy with the tip of your sword has a completely different effect than if you hit it with your blade (and how much you slash him) or the hilt. Every weapon has different weight, different sharpness, it's harder or easier to manage. Blades are very good againt skin, but it's difficult to penetrate armor with them. This is a paradise for someone enjoying exactly this - different weapon/armor combinations and their interactions.The game is based purely on skill. It's extremely hard to master and there are so many details you wouldn't even think of (until you read web guides). You'll die all the time, and repeat, repeat, repeat. But once you become good at it, the battles are so enjoyable. They are still very hard - you haven't dodged a flying debris? Half dead. You haven't dodged or deflected a sword thrust? Dead. But you'll start seeing the details and be able to react better; it won't be just a chaos on screen. And then it starts to be a real fun.Unfortunately, as much as the battle mechanics are awesome, the rest of the game implementation is awful. Weapon selection is bad, weapon market is bad, game UI is especially tragic, a lot of features are not explained at all, there is a lot of bugs, often you have no idea why you died, enemies are frequently off-screen but still can attack you, allies often perform actions that hurt you (like shooting or throwing bombs your way), .... I could go on and on. You'll grind your teeth every time you have to deal with this or you make some mistake that can't be reversed (like imbuing your weapon with a gem during the battle because of clicking a mouse button in the wrong time - what a great feature).If you want to play this game, here are some tips:* http://wikicheats.gametrailers.com/Hammerfight_-_PC* http://hubpages.com/search/Hammerfight* http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2035787* in order to reduce graphical clutter on the screen, set quality to 0.2 in game and also edit Config.ini and set GFX_RENDER_* to 'false'* you can switch full-screen with alt+tab and you can release/grab your mouse cursor with ctrl+g ",138,39,2,15,10,2,31

												I can highly recommend this game. Doesn't take that long to complete the campaign but I had more than enough fun to play it through a couple of times which will also be needed to explore the entire game. Well worth its cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright listen up. I've read a lot of useless reviews about this game, and most of them contain misleading or just plain wrong information. I've played this game an insane amount (the number you see is only a fraction), so I feel like I should try to set the record straight.If you have a mouse with adjustable DPI, put it as high as it will go. Put the in-game DPI at 100. If you still can't move around easily, buy a new mouse, because yours is horrible. You want a mouse with at least 800 DPI, which shouldn't be difficult to find. Pretty much any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wireless mouse now days has that.I'm not going to give this game an across the board recommendation. It's full of perplexing design choices: Really hard at the beginning, need 2 mice to trade items between profiles, can't un-equip gems without editing the game files, gem farming is really tedious,(just edit them, it's not worth farming), can't manually select levels in the arena, runs at 50 fps (why?), need to play through multiple times to unlock every game mode and weapon, and the giant hud gets in the way a lot because the game is locked at 800x600.That being said, POWER THROUGH THE FIRST LEVEL WITH THE flying insects. Yes, it's hard. It's hard because you suck. It gets easier after that, and even easier once you actually learn how to control your momentum and spacing properly. Controlling the flying thing while wielding a weapon is weird at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works incredibly well, and the game has a ridiculous amount of depth. I'm still learning new techniques after over 100 hours in.As for miscellaneous stuff you should probably know: Once you put a gem on a weapon, you can't take it off. You have to edit the gem away. There are plenty of guides on how to do that. Blood rubies are essential for arena (the best part of the game by far), and they are very difficult to get. I'd recommend not farming them and just editing them onto your weapons once you finish the main story. This is one of the most unique and most satisfying games I have ever played, but it takes some time to actually learn how to play well. Give it 4 or 5 hours. If you can tolerate it that long but still aren't having fun, give it until you start doing arena fights. If you still don't like it, then I guess it's not for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best indie games i have ever played. The combat mechanic is absolutely solid and completely satasfying. Now, the concept of the game is very strange i'll admit, but the world will truly grab you. This game was a massive part of my childhood and at $5 it's an absolute steal. The dozens of weapons and upgrades are incredible, and the gameplay is basically endless. I love this game.P.S.The pickaxe is the best weapon in the game			",265,30,7,13,9,4,11

												Hammerfight is based around the nifty concept of flying machines laden with swinging weaponry that you control using your mouse. However, while the concept is pretty cool, the actual game leaves a LOT to be desired; the menus, UI, controls, story, objectives and general game format are horribly confusing, the resolution is poor and the game is unfairly difficult. Often you'll die very suddenly after being stunned and rammed into a wall, and there's so much happening on screen that even when you can control your machine it's easy to lose track of what's going on. In spite of this, I enjoyed it for the most part, but a less determined gamer may quickly lose interest or quit from frustration.			",106,29,0,16,17,1,18

												Will you load for♥♥♥♥♥sake? Yea this♥♥♥♥♥♥is buggy as hell. But, it is great.Quite amazing how a completely new game, that was not influenced by any other games, can bee so deep.To unlock all of the weapons (I believe it is more than 50 !!! ) you will have to finish the campaign several times, oh yea and you will have a few choices there. There is more - a few minigames, arenas, weapon socketing and even weapon combinations. Some combined weapons have a bug that spins them automatically, like your dryer during full moon.Hammerfight could be easily worth even $20 if it was slightly more polished - better resolution, fixed bugs and some sort of meaningful help system. Before you play it make sure you have enough elbow grease and your mice is warmed up. ",379,102,4,31,34,2,55

												If you can get over the somewhat difficult to understand story and the occasional bug, this game is fantastically fun. I spent hours swinging around weapons and smashing ships and flying maggot things. It's incredibly satisfying landing a strong hit on a creature or an opponent and send them careening into the walls/ceiling. If nothing else it's a fun little physics game.			",244,52,7,47,34,5,20

												I just love this game, it really makes me change my personality and plunge into that steampunk Dune-like world of tub-flying knights. The secret is in the physical skill you need to develop to succeed as a young aristocrat, defending his world from all kinds of airborn dangers. Sitting in an iron barrel you energetically move your mouse in spirals to aquire hitting impulse on the dongle and crash smth ('Mount Your Friends' veterans should feel familiar). The physics model is allright and you soon get to feel the weapon almost like a real object. Overall, it is innovative & well designed, has a story, a lot of crazy incidents during fights, some roleplay elements and all the reasons to recommend!PS: Particle Mace's author clearly has borrowed the idea from here!Обожаю эту игру! Летаешь в пепелаце, размахивая этаким смертоносным *** (ветеранам игры ""Оседлай своих друзей"" будет проще) при помощи энергичных спиральных движений мышью. Эта физкультурная нагрузка вкупе с неплохо реализованной физическеой моделью заставляет плотнее вжиться в роль и сопереживать происходящему, пепелац скоро начинает восприниматься как весомый объект. Из диалогов становится понятно, что пилот - юноша из аристократической семьи в мире навроде Дюны, где большой спрос на эти навыки. В общем, присутствуют отличный новаторский дизайн, сюжет, куча веселых случайностей в боях, небольшая прокачка и все основания рекомендовать!ПС: Попробуйте также свежую абстрактную аркаду Particle Mace, идея которой заимствована отсюда!

												One of the most original games I've ever played, and also one of the most entertaining.  Hammerfight can be played with a mouse or a gamepad, and either setup will have you swinging around rocks, maces, and blades in no time.  This game also has absolutely stunning visual and audio design.The storyline is interesting but extremely difficult to follow (at least I found it so), partly due to the fact that a lot of the words are seemingly made up.  Where this game really shines is in its pure gameplay.Despite some flaws, I can't recommend this game enough.			",802,239,27,63,64,8,118

												I was not expecting a game about whirling your mouse around in circles to swing a mace to be so fun and have a deep, complicated, story.From a VERY frustrating start, it takes until mid to late game for things to start rolling, but when they do♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real, real fast. One thing you'll want to do, is set your mouses' dpi (in the menu, not your actual dpi) to be lower than the game predicts, because it can make it very hard to move if the sensitivity isn't cranked way the hell up. With the quite sizable armory you build up, missable weapons and armor, and alternate endings and mission choice, the game has quite a huge amount of replay value to.I mean,♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's crazy just get it.

												Interesting concept, poor execution. The game does very little to explain useful mechanics, the useless HUD takes up large portions of the screen, and the camera often fails to follow you properly. Landing solid hits is very satisfying, but when you're dealing with more than one or two enemies, you're relying less on your own coordination and more on the awful AI to fly right into your swings. If they had put just a little effort into polishing the gameplay, tweaking the mouse settings, or working on the AI, this could be a truly unique gem of a game. Instead, it's a cluttered mess with decent potential. Don't spend money on this unless the developers make some major changes to the mouse mechanics, AI, and UI.			",161,62,7,35,13,3,13

												This is honestly one of my favorite games of all time, but I HATED it at first. The controls are some of the most counterintuive of any game I've ever played, and it feels incredibly awkward until you get used to them. Starting out, you will die, a lot. But if you stick with it, the physic-based movement and combat are incredibly satisfying; everything has a great sense of momentum and impact to it and it's a lot of fun just wailing on enemies in the arena and smashing them to bits with your giant mace helicopter.

This is the kind of game you play twice and mess around with and then come back to a couple of years later to do it all again. The whole culture and society is just incredible and complex, it feels like the author's created a whole alternate universe. I can't really say anything else without giving away the story, but trust me, if you're not put off by the graphics and aren't turned away by the idea of level / checkpoint based gameplay, you'll love it.

												Hammerfight is a ludicrous physics game that is tough to get into, but rewarding once you get the hang of it. The story is convoluted and confusing, and is presented like the player is meant to know exactly what the hell everyone it jabbering about even though they do not - this is not necessarily a bad thing though.Pros:*The game is (usually) fun*Physics combat is fun*Campaign is decently long*Branching storylines with varying rewards and endings*Convoluted story that is neat, but takes a long time to get your head around*Encourages experimentation with equipment and techniques*Minigames are alright - though unlocking some involves playing against cheating AI (e.g. hammerball)Cons:*Game has a very steep learning curve*Enemy choppers do not have to follow the laws of physics*Enemies can do things you cannot (e.g. spin their weapons without momentum, manually aim their guns)*Unlocking most minigames is a frustrating experience for first-time players*Particle effects and smoke make it extremely hard to see what is going on at times*Large HUD also gets in the way at times*No new game+ options means starting from scratch every time you want to view the other story paths*You need A LOT of room on your desk to be able to play effectively - clear out a wide area around your mouse or it will do it for you...

												Personally, this is one of my favorite indie games. It has a lot of pros, and a whole lot of cons.Pros:SMASH! - You can smash pretty much anything, including many parts of the environment. Landing one of those perfect hits on the enemy, going blue, and just generally destroying everything is one of the most satisfying things in this game.GFX - The attention to detail is superb, as seen in the environments, weapons, and ""vehicles.""Story - While difficult to understand at times, I enjoyed it a lot, and though it interesting.Weapons - There are a great many weapons available, and each is different.Modes - There are 5 working gametypes: Solo: single player campaign, Hall: where you select and buy weapons, Grim: where you hunt flying worms, Arena: where you fight other flying machines, Hammerball: where you fight weird machines in some sort of soccer type game.There is another gametype called Tribal Wars, but it doesn't seem to work (at least, for me).Cons:SMASH! - Sometimes, if you go blue and miss an enemy, you might wind up outside the map.GFX - People are really weird sometimes. The animations can be... odd.Story - Lost in translation applies here. Quite a bit of it.Weapons - Sometimes the chain type weapons will break. No idea under what circumstances, and it doesn't happen terribly often.Modes - Solo: The story can be very confusing and jumps somewhat. Hall:sometimes weapons can be lost if you drop them, Grim: the idiot AI enjoy dropping bombs on your head all the time, Arena: it often pits you against 3 AI at a time, and that can make it extremely difficult at times, Hammerball: Not for the faint of heart, this is the single most difficult challenge I have EVER faced in a game. More on that later.As I mentioned, Tribal Wars seems to not work at all for me.On the subject of Hammerball: For the first round, you have to face a single flying mechanical lobster. Not too difficult. Second round, you have to face two. One goes for the ball while the other uses some sort of taser on you if you don't dodge it. Third round you have to face three flying mechanical flying lobsters. One goes after the ball and the other two attack you with some sort of taser.There are 4 different ball types I have encountered in Hammerball. The first, a rock, is easy to deal with and gives you one point per score. The second is a bomb that will go off after a time unless the game ends, or you manage to score. It's worth two points. The third is a flying buzzsaw that will get angry if you hit it, and it will move around. It's somewhat manageable and is worth three points. The fourth is some sort of flying tentacle monster that will generally kill you when it appears. I would assume it's worth four points if it's actually possibly to push into the goal. Bit of a spoiler here: it looks like the final boss of the game, but can fly around.On the subject of AI: In general, they aren't too bad. Your allies like to throw bombs though, and sometimes, the human AI like to seriously ""derp out.""Overall, I think that, even with all it's flaws, it is a GREAT game. It's incredibly fun to smash the AI with hammers, flails, axes, swords, etc. The graphics are amazing, and the AI can be dealt with. For only $5 I think it's a great game, and has entertained me for hours on end.			",196,26,2,16,26,0,20

												Is this game still being developed? Because it's sooooooooooo good, if a little short (and lacking in multiplayer co-op, i'd love to go on a hunt with me and 2 other friends, swishing our better-than diamond swords around ;-;). The armoury is a huge assortment of mostly unique weapons each with a potentially unique fighting style.The weapons are divided up in to 5 main categorys: swords, maces, flails, guns and axes, *note: there are a few other things that don't exactly fit in to any of the categories and also a fair few misc usables and things* flails have chains and can deal a massive impact on a direct blow, the chains are normally a fair amount longer than the other weapons, and therefore have more reach, the swords seem to be a little weak as they can not deal a huge stunning crush like the axes and maces and flails, but still have a greater balance which makes it easier to aim when coupled with guns, oh and i forgot to mention, you can combine any 2 weapons together to make a combo weapon thing, quite fun! There are not too many guns (There are 5 guns to be precise) and it's not easy to just use them as they are, they have an infinite amount of ammo, but the reloads are long and tend to have only 5-20 ammo cap. They are unfortunately over powered when in the AI's hands as they seem to have aim-hacks and a much faster cooldown etc. The axes are sort of a combo between maces and swords, and can deal a crushing blow like the mace, whilst still capable of the alacrity contained by the sword. The maces are a great way to start of your learning, easy to handle and deal a crushing hit, but not so useful late-game.There are also ""singing stones"" in the games which are gems, there are in total 5 different kinds of gems (i think) and 2 different sizes of each, the bigger ones being more powerful. The gems can be slotted in to slots in your weapons to have valuable effects. The emeralds add a wraith effect which when the click button is pressed with the weapon you can go invulnerable for 1 second or so (and also unable to attack), the topaz sets things the weapons hit on fire, the ruby heals battle wounds when it deals dmg, the purple gem (I forget the name) has lightning damage, not particularly sure how it works, but i think it's something to do with coming in to contact with metal... The blue one (idk either) freezes things it attacks, which doesn't really seem to do much, but i think it slows the enemy down...There seems to be a 4 special weapons that you can obtain in the story line and through hammerball. 2 are swords, 1 is an axe, and the other is a hammer. None of them seem to be particularly special, other than looking fancy.There are 5 game modes (they like the number 5 don't they!) You have to unlock each one as you go through the story line, the first one is ""solo"" QED the story line. The 2nd one is the ""hall"". The armoury is there too and a few practice dummies. The 3rd is the arena, it's where you go to make your name and rise through the ranks so you can make a very long dangling piece of wool hang from your airship thingy. The arena slowly get's harder and more challenging as the game goes on, it would be so much easier if I wasn't crying evry tim i accidentally mash one of the enemy airships in to the floor and have them explode in my face (it is possible to have them surrender when you do enough damage and disarm them and stuff), the third is ""grim"" or the hunting challenge, it's sort of a survival, there are always 4 rounds (i think) every game, and every 4th round has a final boss that is shown above spewing poison and throwing tentacles around. The other 3 have a load of floating worms, kamikaze bees, and angry floating lobsters. The final round isn't much fun after the first try... It's called hammerball and you have 2 teams, you and a few robot lobsters, they fly around trying to get the ball in to your hoop and you fly around trying to get the ball in to theirs, if you win 3 rounds you get given a posh looking hammer to mash people with.The good stuff:> Wonderful fighting mechanics> Fun story line> Completely unique game (i think)> Has hilarious moments (A requisite for all good games)> I think (that is i haven't got to the end yet, but i have gotten quite far...) that the challenge game-modes, are endless and slowly get harder every time you win.The bad stuff:> Short story line> The story line ends up in the same place no matter what you choose...> Some of the weapons are unobtainable depending on how you choose the story lines> Evil AI (perhaps a nerf of the stunning and 2 hit killing tri-cannon things...)> Judging. (They have morals ;-;)How to make it much much much better:> Add custom made weapons!!!!> Co-op (hunt) +PvP! (arena)> A no-morales mode where you don't get hated when you accidentally throw your gigantic flail at someone;-;> Add in other ways of healing other than buying healing pots and the blood gem! (this makes the gem less OP)> A way of adding in more gem slots! ",61,5,0,8,4,0,7

												This game is overall very fun. The physics combat is very well done and enjoyable. The controls are responsive and well implemented. Do not play this game for the story, though. It is confusing and intricate, not in a good way. The game has its physics bugs but they don't interfere with the gameplay too much. The ai is well done,  and there are a large variety of weapons that can be dual-weilded. It allows for a range of combat styles. There is no multiplayer, unfortunately. An arena gamemode offers more gamplay beyond the story. Overall, the game has solid gameplay but is lacking on other  things.			",114,16,0,1,15,1,14

												Gives new meaning to the idea behind beating down your enemies. Behind hammering your foes with everything you've got.Behind taking a worthy challenger and smashing them into the ground, giving yourself some distance whilst they pull themselves out of the rubble that fell around them, and lining up that perfect swing that sends their battered corpse hurtling to the side at JUST the right angle to skip along the ground at a speed JUST high enough to send them around the arena in JUST the right time it takes for your hammer to come crashing down on them, sending them into the ground for the last time, never to rise again.God it feels awesome when that happens.

												Hammerfight is a simple game, swing your mouse around to fly and swing your weapon. The right movement for control is hard to pick up at first, but it gets easier as you learn. As you continue through the game though, you find more new elements that aid you in fighting and add complexity to the techniques you can use to beat up opponents. You pick up new weapons that suit a variety of play styles such as swords, axes, hammers, flails, and more. You can even mix and match these weapons for all sorts of combinations. The gems add another layer of complexity by enchanting your weapon with various attributes. Armors, bombs, ballistas, and all sorts of other components are also available to be used. You end up switching around all sorts of equipment trying to create a machine that best fits you, whether it be a speedy swordsman slicing everything, a slow and heavily armoured juggernaut with a massive flail to smash enemies, or even a long range fighter that precisely aims and snipes out targets from afar. This game is still fun long after you complete the various routes in the story mode to just crush some guys in the arena mode and take out some stress.			",46,12,0,6,6,0,7

												Wow, the reviews are unfortunate. You've be suprised how fun this game really is, I know I was. There isn't anything quite like it, and it plays very well.What's not to love? It's a steampunk game with hyper realistic physics, dozens and dozens of items and weapons to unlock, and more.  Different weapons function in diferent ways, there's slashing weapons like swords, bashing weapons like hammers, piercing weaons, cannons, and some that are even a combination. If you strike an enemy with the giant pick-axe or example, sometimes it gets lodged into their ship, fun stuff!TIPS:-Press ALT in game to get help menu-In game settings, lower the DPI to very low for easier ship control			",526,78,4,57,23,2,43

												This game is a lot of fun in short bursts - you control a little airship swinging weapons such as hammers and axes at other airships and creatures.  There is a strong sense of physics, so swinging a heavy weapon around will also fling your craft.Quick tip, customize the mouse sensitivity, and move your mouse more slowly than you normally would, otherwise you'll exhaust yourself and run out of table trying to get speed up on your weapons.

												The combat in this game, which is the real reason to play it, is really fun, and I haven't seen other games like it . You use entirely the mouse to swing your weapons and deal damage. The force you get form the momentum is how strong the damage will be. Dodging while swinging and being dragged by the physics is amusing.That said, the story was quite short, though you can redo and pick a few different routes, seems like... and it wouldn't be a problem if the arena afterwards were more fun and more fleshed out. I liked the idea of it, but not only is it lackluster but it's way too hard. Some enemies can throw bombs that hit you even from pretty darn far away, and it's really hard to do anything about it besides one stage. If it was just hard, that'd be one thing, but it feels a bit unfair.I recommend it just for the first while of fun, at least on sale.			",127,28,1,16,4,0,11

												So many, so, so many flaws in this game. The difficulty curve is as bouncy as Commander Keen on coke and has some of its nastiest peaks very early on. Parts of how the game works are barely explained at all. The story is more concerned with how many different setting archetypes it can throw in a pot (is it steampunk? Cosmic horror? Science fiction? Arabian Nights?) than with making sense. The huge UI obscures far too much of the screen when you're playing. I had to edit a config file to get the mouse sensitivity to a level where it feels good in gameplay, and at that level menus are barely usable because the cursor jumps around dozens of pixels from the slightest bump. Etc, etc..But none of that matters when, once you get into the game, it's just *that* satisfying to whack things with heavy weapons. Hits *connect*. Bits of armor go flying off, a good hit might detach an enemy's weapon, and over time in a long fight what's left of the devastated landscape gets covered with refuse. It's a beautiful game, too, with stylish and well presented 2D art that will hopefully prove timeless.Just, you know, it takes a little while to learn the game. And you might have to tune some settings, and even after tuning them, things will be a little bit weird and clunky. Yet so damn satisfying.			",75,35,0,11,14,0,27

												I will always love this game. This is one of the few games I've played that really has _atmosphere_! I get a real sense of the world being an actual world and not simply a backdrop for the action, the story, while not tremendously deep, is compelling and really helps drive the action along. I would love to see more games like this, either a direct spiritual successor or otherwise.I had a dream recently where the physics mechanic of this game was expanded to the point where the flying ships could be used for construction; attach a scoop shovel and dredge up dirt or liquids, chop trees and air-lift them to where other flyers worked with ground crews to construct the cool environments of the original game.Work on this game appears to have ended and no similar projects appear on the horizon, so I guess I'll just have to console myself by coming back to this one every couple of years			",390,76,4,37,43,2,62

Posted: October 7, 2016
												Criminally underappreciated! This game is packing more quality pound for pound than most others. It's a real diamond in the rough, and it certainly is rough, but it offers so much that you can't find in other games. I don't think that there's any other game that uses its thematic style, for one thing. It seems vaguely middle eastern but not really, vaguely steampunk but not really. It's just endlessly interesting. The engine, too, is astounding considering how little it's talked about. It's so robust that it enables crazy things to occur. I once hit a guy so hard that, in the endlessly looping arena, he passed over my head multiple times before he hit the ground. It really is amazing. The game has so much replay value, too. You start out with only the ability to do your story missions as an almost nameless grunt, but you unlock the ability to buy weapons and go on hunts. Eventually you're decked out in ornate armor and weaponry, with titles so long that they take half a minute to list. It never stops being satisfying. Definitely buy this game. 5 bucks is a steal.A few vital bits of information, though: - When you first load the game up, go into the options menu and set your DPI as low as it can go. It often gets set too high and players can hardly move. If you've set it properly, then the cursor should be very sensitive in menus and your craft should be quite responsive. You should be able to swing your weapon in a circle without removing your mouse from the center of the pad.- When you first get to choose which mission to take, choose the harder worm hunt mission. Doing it unlocks a game mode that's incredibly profitable and supplies you with powerful stones that you otherwise can't get.- You can spare people by either lowering their health until the bar turns red or disarming them and knocking their weapon away. Given how cluttered and dangerous the ground gets during battles, you'll want to be hitting people upwards. Giving them more time to fly will often make it so that you won't be credited with a kill even when they land on a sword and explode. Knocking their weapon away works way better, though. If you manage to launch it outside of the level boundaries (usually up, but sometimes to the side) then the enemy will bloodlessly retreat unless it can find a new weapon. There are no fights against humans in which you have to completely kill them, but sparing them doesn't influence the story.			",127,46,1,28,14,1,34

												I love this game and it is a blast and recommend it dispite the issues. Those issues though... The main proplem is that even with the highest setting, the sensitivity just isn't enough, especially for a game that requires you to move the mouse constantly in circular motions. It can become very fatigeing after a bit of play. Also some of the sections and ememies in the latter stages of the game are tedeious and agrivating when you factor in the main issue. Still, over all its a fun game despite this.			",183,46,4,33,50,0,45

The difficulty randomly jumps from easy, to insanely luck based, and back again - fighting from one opponent, to seven or more with no room to maneuver or actually survive and using the same machine (where is the option to use the money you collect, or upgrade?) leaves you just wishing to survive.  Objectives are not at all explained, you often have no idea whom you're fighting or who is an ally.  Very messy.			",292,33,1,39,43,2,62

Sadly, while there is no online multiplayer, you can get a friend to plug in their mouse on your computer and you can smash about each other with whatever you have. The storyline for the campagin is fairly interesting as well, with great characters and a non-linear plot with multiple endings.

												This is one of the best physics-based action fighting game that I've ever played. To make things easier, I'll list out the pros and cons of the game.Pros:-Cheap and reasonable price. -Small size. Only takes a minute or two to download the whole game. -Great, smooth yet chaotic physics-based gameplay. So far, I haven't encountered any glitches, and the physics of the game is overall pretty smooth. You can definitely feel the weight of the weapons as you're swinging them around and crashing them into your enemies, let alone when a bunch of other machines are doing the same thing.-Grim mode is awesome. It's essentially a casual mode where you fight flying worms, giant bees and a bunch of other random demonic creatures from hell. Mass-killing a ton of monsters by swinging around gigantic axes or maces is very stress-releasing, too. -Decent storyline. Not much to say, I'm just kinda glad the game at least has some story to it.-Can't really explain it, but there's just something very satisfying about swinging a flail at full momentum and hurling it towards a machine/ monster, hearing that majestic crushing sound and watching the guts/random metal parts and coins raining down upon the glorious battlefield.-There's a multiplayer feature too, if you have a bunch of other mice that you can connect to your PC. Cons:-You need a large mousepad that is glued to your table in order to comfortable play this game. Otherwise, expect the mousepad to constantly move around.-The gameplay is too chaotic for co-op missions since in a game where you're mostly ramming yourself towards the nearest guy on the battlefield, friendly fire is near unavoidable. This is especially problematic in Grim mode, since the other hunters can unexpectedly and suddenly ram into you. In most of these missions, 50% of the damage you take comes from your allies.-Explosives are very uncontrollable, especially when a bunch of people are using them at the same time. Again, this is an even bigger problem when even your allies are using explosives.			",21,3,0,2,1,0,0

												Even though this game is dated by today's standards in both 'graphics' and age, it still holds up as a fun experience. Its core gameplay mechanic being hitting (other) floating mini-helicopters with gigantic flails, swords and hammers using your mouse movements to swing the gigantic weapon attached to your own little helicopter; you'd expect it to feel wonky because the game is powered by physics. Spoiler: this is not the case. ""Hammerfight"" gets the feeling of swooping giant flails, smashing flying machines against eachother and utterly destroying miniature steam-copters exactly right.

Including firearms.+ Physics-based combat is really fun, skill-based and realized well+ Destructible environments+ Many types of enemies+ Story choices will determine what missions you end up doing+ Original, very inspired lore and setting+ You can steal fallen enemies' weapons and make them your own forever if you manage to do so+ Decent storyline+ Multiple game modes: Story, Arena and others you will find out during the campaign...+ Arena is endless and each level the enemy becomes stonger and better equipped - Cons - - No Multiplayer- Some bugs that force you to restart the game- Graphics resolution is somewhat low-definition- Some unbalances in weapons- Cannot upgrade the hull of your airship, just add armor to it- Pretty short (took me 4 hours to finish campaign on hard) if you don't consider Arena=== Final Thoughts This game is extraordinary. Its gameplay is unique, fun, and well done. It can decieve you and appear like a cheap flash game, but don't be fooled, it is really fun and good. One of the best 2D vehicle fight games i have ever played. ",273,28,1,44,20,1,28

												a very hidden gem if I ever did see one. great story line with a great concept and gameplay. you'll get addicted quickly by the simple yet exciting battle system and you'll get a rush when you embark on your adventure with cool boss fights. only negative I could see was that steam menu wouldn't appear so I couldn't take screenshots of the awesome visuals. only a mouse is really needed for most of the gameplay.enjoy all :)			",292,91,2,56,13,3,14

												Swing your mouse like a madman to smash blunt intruments from your flying machine into anothers. The difficulty curve is brutal, but the payoff is a brilliant physics-based game that can steal away hours at a time. Well worth a couple bucks for the week of entertainment you'll get out of it.

												A very nice little game that sports an uncommon 2D combat gamplay mechanics that is somewhat physics-based and builds upon mouse-based control. The game not only has entertaining combat arenas, but also a decent scenario route. The game asks for a mutiplayer mode, but alas...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This weird indie title is one of my top games of all time.  There are some problems and quirks that often come with small studio projects (pretty sure this game was a solo-piece), but I've never played anything as visceral.If you're going to give it a shot, make sure to set your in-game mouse sensitivity as high as it can possibly go.  It makes menus annoying to navigate, but it'll improve your gameplay experience immensely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mouse control might sometimes be a bit clumsy. Besides from that, it's a 9/10 game for me. A great story, replayability, choices and a wide range of different weapons.It might be difficult at some point, and some missions will have to be replayed all over again due to the difficulty, but it's not one of those ""frustrating"" games. It simply requires the right weapon, the right technique, and maybe some skill with the mouse.			",213,30,5,16,10,1,10

												The controls of this game are the thing that will catch your eye first. Using momentum as your primary weapon you will find yourself swinging the mouse in circles and making motions to crush your opponents with blunt weapons, or making refined slower movements to slice with bladed weapons, which will do more damage if the target is grazed by them rather than struck down. Also you will have at your disposition: Guns, mortars, poisons, explosives, throwing weapons and shields to make for all sorts of different combat styles. Additionally you can unlock gems that give you life steal, fire damage etc. if you embed them into your weapon. The game also features different game modes in which to play which you will have to unlock first. In regards to graphics Hammerfight might seem a bit pixely at times but some of the scenery is breathtaking and the others are perfectly fine.As much as I love this game the beginning of it has some grueling parts to it that I wish they had fixed to be less so. You will fight something called a Sophit, a flying creature. The Sophit can be tricked and defeated but will take you a few tries and will be your first true test. There is also a siege that quickly becomes a survival scenario as you repel enemy forces and those have the best hammer style weapon in the game TIP: Get that hammer! Its a rust red hammer and you will find it quite useful. To get it defeat one of the enemies then go to the weapon and hold down space.But heres the deal -> you can SKIP levels with an item you can buy if you have died a lot, so you might want to do that a few times until you have gotten the hang of things.The story of the game can lose you at some points but it is fun to follow.All in all I can understand why people would not like the game as it has 0 mercy on people not willing to put at least  a LITTLE time and practice into it. Game won't hold your hand thats for sure but once you get the hang of it you will have a ton of fun swinging heavy maces with crushing force, watching is slo-mo (literally the game will go slo-mo if you land a REALLY good hit) as your opponent slump to the ground in their little helicopters or downright shatter to pieces.

												TLDR: Good concept, bad implementation.Hammerfight tests your skill at flying a steampunk helicopter (best description I can think of for someone who hasn't actually seen one), which seems to be refered to as a ""machine"" while attatched to various devices of war which you swing via the momentum imparted by moving your machine. You use this as a weapon in combat aginst whoever is thrown at you.This review centres around mouse contol as it is the only control in the game.Note: I played the opening chapter of this game while it was free on Steam which was as far as I could before it became thoroughly frustrating. Not due to the game being hard, but because of the many initial obstacles are due to implementation.Once calibrated, my mouse (Logitech G5 gaming mouse) was able to give me a distinct and measurable feel in moving the machine around, which is great, the initial close quarters fight felt intense and I felt like I had good distinct control over the momentum of my weapon.That sounds like great implementation. What's wrong with it?As I progressed through the chapter, I was pitted against more and more foes simultaneously, on progressively larger battlefields. My high precision movements covered a tiny area, and with no other controls than the mouse, I found myself pounding my desk with my mouse as I pick it up to move it back to a comfortable position.Why not recalibrate your mouse?Okay, So I started again, manually calibrated the mouse to give me greater freedom of movement.Panned in the first fight. Why? That smooth distinct control over the momentum of my machine had gone. But I could move around at pace. A few calibrations later, I still couldn't find an acceptable balance between pace, control and not having to pick the mouse up every time I want to move.Which brings me to the enemies knockback. When an enemy stikes you, you go flying, not surprising at all, and not a huge problem in game, but you guessed it, you're gonna have to move the mouse if you want to get out of that corner (the sky has corners right? I'll get back to this in a minute.) and this simply added to the wrist flicking madness.Maybe your setup is poor? Do you have a tiny desk?Nope. I have two 23inch widescreens, wih room for a third if I really wanted it and the entire width of the 2nd monitor is where my mouse lies.Something just occured to me, time to Google.I'm amazed, this game is NOT a port of a touchscreen tablet title. Which seems absurd, as it occurs to me a touchscreen would be a perfect control method for this type of singe control game.Enough with the controls, what's the rest of the game like?Visually, I like it, the menus are crisp, the setting seems familiar yet unique, (Think Tatooine, but with apparent unlimited access to trees.) The inspiration for the characterisation seems middle-eastern, and the ideas of fame glory being important seem to fit well. The opening does not seem to do justice to the potential of the game, with the first three fights contested in or near grey mountainous regions, and with the grey brown machines, you can easily lose both yourself and your enemies.Mechanically, it CAN be good and fun, but I would say only as fun as conkers. (for those of you who didn't grow up in England, we put large seeds on the end of a length of string and take turns bashing them against each other until one breaks.) However, getting back to an earlier point, having the near infinite expanse of the sky to fight in, hitting ""the edge"" is terrible for a sense of immersion.Probably not worth your time, as of 7th May 2014.

												I've been playing this game for quite some time before I bought it on Steam and for a reason. It doesn't matter that it's just singleplayer and local MP (and boy, this game could sure use network MP), Hammerfight somehow made me play over and over.In Hammerfight, you pilot a tiny helicopter that can have weapons hanging out from it. Swords, axes, flails, hammers, even guns later on. To use the weapons, however, you usually don't use buttons. You need to move yourself in order to make the weapons swing and hit your enemy. You start out in a campaign mode with an interesting and mysterious story about an original world and unlock new modes depending on your progress and decisions in the story with multiple endings.The sortiment of weapons is vast and even different weapons of a same type offer quite a variability. As if that is not enough, you can also socket them with gems with powerful abilites, such as elemental enchantments, heal on hit and even temporary ghost form that makes you pass through enemies and ignore damage. Other equipment includes throwable weapons, shield plates that are normally hanging too until you hold a button, when they equally spread and hold, making a turtle. Speaking of which, these weapons can be activated handily, by holding LMB, you can press any key that is defined as that item's shortcut, which is great and makes you more efficient.The feel I get from the game is both satisfying and frustrating. It feels awesome to swing your hammer, sending your enemy into ground, blowing him up by the impact. When I pair two weapons together, forming a staff that stretches to both sides out of your copter, it actually looks graceful and deadly and it's a kind of a challenge as it requires different handling. This game is a challenge from start to end for players of any level of experience. But it's an experience not worth missing.The developer has abandoned the game and this is probably the last version you will ever see. Too bad. It deserves a sequel to an amazing story, or a prequel to enlighten us to the origins of the world, or networking to play on LAN or Online. Also, quite certainly, there are bugs. So the game can sometimes play on your nerves, but if you ask me, you'll keep coming back. It's too fun to miss.			",129,7,1,5,7,0,5

I was in Arena level 71, until I accidentally delete my save (Working back to it, might cheat and just continue where I left off), and this game is worth it. I love this game, and wish the developer would consider a sequel or update to the game.

												This game is a little unpolished. At times, you'll find yourself cursing at events beyond your control. But the feeling of smooth mouse movement is worth every frustrating moment. Every perfect counterattack that leads into an armor smashing assault or eviceratingly smooth slice through the enemy makes that moment when the AI threw a tnt barrel into you worthwhile.Long story short? the smooth mouse movements make up for the feeling of ""out of your control"" difficulty,And the arena mode makes for endless fun.

												Hammerfight is a really unique game with a fairly steep learning curve. But once you start to understand its unique combat system and appreciate its interesting setting and aesthetic all of the initial rage you might have felt for the game goes away. There are tons of different weapons, each with their own feel and heft to them. Because of this, you will be able to create your own fighting style and strategies, yet never feel stuck in one mode of combat. A very fun game and worth playing.Make sure to own a good mouse for this game (all controls are done with moving the mouse) and despite the game's urging, do small, gentle circles with your mouse during the calibration. It makes the game much more enjoyable and saves you from needing an enourmous mousing surface to play it.I got this as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 4 and I have played it the most out of all of those great games. Get it and enjoy it for all of the freshness it brings to the table!			",358,111,4,61,38,7,59

												Hammerfight is fun and funny - I literally laughed out loud when first playing this game. It's very satisfying to whallop the computer opponents with a rock on a chain.However, this game is not without problems. Menu navigation is an afterthought. The HUD is frequently in the way. The HUD is stylized to the point that you can't read it at a glance. There's too much story. The ""learn as you go"" elements appear to still be under construction.Worst of all, sometimes there is so much happening on the screen, you can't find your ship among all the layers of smoke, explosions, sparks, friendlies, and bogies. This game requires precise control and timing to succeed, but the busy-ness of the game takes that precision away from you. I really hope the developers clean this game up. It has great potential, and I look forward to trying it again in the future. But for now... I'm uninstalling.			",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												I really like this game.Pros: Extremely unique gameplay.Fun (very fun)Challenging but ..with a feeling of mastery when you finally figure out how to control the clumsy vehicles.Surprisingly good storyTons of weapons with customizable upgradesDifferent story line branches. (either by choice or by completing things in the missions)Cons: It makes you look like an idiot. (to play you spin the mouse in a circular motion constantly)Its tough as in no training wheels. (expect to die screen 1..in fact.. screen 1 is difficult)Its confusing and honestly frustratingly hard to control the vehicles. All weapons act similar even though they all feel unique. Its a confusing concept to explain. There are hammers and swords and other weapons but they all act the same way except they all have different weights which affect how you use them...but the overall gameplay isnt affected by themWeapons can be lost. You can play and drop your cool super sword and then win the level and you won't get it back. Its now gone forever.ITS SUPER HARD. ..ok maybe not that bad, but its difficult.Anyways, I totally say get it. No one may understand why you did and why you love it.. but hopefully you will love it. Its unique and unlike anything I have ever played. Its simple yet complex, fun yet frustrating, extremely clumsy to control yet there is some intense finese in learning how to. It is a true masterpeice of.... whatever it is.			",310,54,5,32,26,3,47

												Truly a terribly designed game. While the mechanics are there, and are very fresh and unique compared to contemporary games, with the generic, copy-pasted storyline and mind-rendingly poor level design, this game was just plain difficult to enjoy. Every level in which I had played had some sort of auto-loss subquest that was nearly a toss-up success. Either it was protect the dude, protect the dude, or the brand new, top-of-the-line, franchise-defining protect the dude quest, all of which had about a 70% chance of failing regardless of your game strategy. The controls are very unique, but overall awkward and have a steep learning curve that the game does not offer time to develop. The creators of the game also spent so much time and effort trying to make the game appear old or indie-retro, the overall experience was damaged. It did support the arcade style of gameplay, but just seemed too pushed.I expected a lot from this game; I was honestly impressed by the new and unique style of gameplay, but was quite heavily let down by this flawed product. Hammerfight gets an overall 3/10 from me.			",123,14,1,12,4,1,10

												To say this game is bad would be unfair, because I believe that I really would have had fun if not for two crucial points. I only played briefly, but a brief time was all I could suffer of it. I liked the idea and the look of the whole thing, but the fun I could squeeze between trying to make the controlls act...controllable, and squinting fiercly to get a decent look at what was going on in the puny, un-alterable, window that I was forced to play on, was just barely below the line of having a fun time.

												Incredibly poor background design makes it way too hard to discern where it is safe to go, and what is actually a wall.  Besides, the interface is very busy, making it very difficult to determine what is actually going on.  Everything is just making sounds, sparks, or having stuff fall off.  The basic gameplay concept is sound, but it should have been implemented with much simpler graphics.			",81,24,1,24,20,0,27

TL;DR: It is a game about not exactly knowing why you are waving your mouse in a circle with little success.The concept is very intriguing, which is all the more frustrating when you realize that it's not working out at all in this horrible, unfinished and overpriced catastrophe.Although the level design is insanely hideous, missions ranging from uselessly easy to sadistically difficult during the first ten minutes, the controls take the cake.If it's not baffling enough that pressing spacebar in the menu for some reason opens up the game website, which I really have no interest in especially after actually playing the game, everything else besides the menus is just as glitchy.For the first couple of minutes, I actually had a feeling of control and was compelled to play - until I realized that the more I tried to influence what would happen, the more frustrated I would eventually become.I was fooled into thinking that perhaps I simply should play more because hey, I probably suck, which still is kind of the case. But after I got comfortable navigating the cramped levels while trying to fling whatever useless weapon you are cursed with, the controls seem as glitchy and unreliable as do the physics feel artificially handicapped or simply buggy.The idea of flying around and crushing things with huge rocks or hammers is great, but the only thing you get to destroy in this game are your expectations and stuff right next to your mouse.As unfinished, glitchy, unnecessarily random and hideous this game is, I can't believe this game is not early access. In it's current state, I personally can not recommend anyone should buy this game without trying it out first. Who knows, maybe you'll want to like it bad enough to actually fool yourself into enjoying it.			",65,13,1,14,17,0,7

In its simplest you have a little bot that you move by moving the mouse. As you move, you swing a weapon (say a flail, or a sword) around yourself and try to hit others without getting hit yourself. Mix in lots of game modes, a fun story section, different weapons, some sieges and it's actually a lot of fun.			",114,27,0,19,5,1,25

												Dont get confused it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥simulator and not a game.You basically use physics and movement to control an armed airship in melee and ranged combat.The beginning is fun, but that changes after a while.The enemies get redicioulously powerful, start with 10 times better equipment than yours, shoot their guns incredibly precise, and the worst part in Arena you have to fight almost endless hordes of enemies, each one more deadly than you. You can outmaneuver some of them, but after defeating 7 enemies, 2-3 at once (!) and still more and more come, you just can't win anymore.The same goes for a soccer like ball game mode. At some point you have to play 1v3...Another mode is the hunt. That one is pretty cool you even have some allies in this one. But only until late game. Because at that point your allies will become your worst foes. They use highly explosive weapons wich can catapult you towards a stone wall and immobilize you while hordes of alien insects tear you to pieces.I like games with a good challenge, but not games that try to do that with plain rough unfairness and stupidity.Very high frustration level. The devs expect you to devote your entire life to this and play 12 hours a day to be able to finish it some day in the distant future.Sticking a pine cone up your♥♥♥♥♥♥will give you the same expierience at no cost.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not sure how other people are putting in 20+ hours in this game. The campaign is only around 3 hours long. After that you can just fight in the arena however long you want, but it gets repetitive fast. Overall it's a fun game if you can get past the bad controls.			",508,111,13,97,60,0,145

												The idea seems simple and fun, but unfortunately the controls are rather messed up. Allowing you to control your craft with the arrow keys or controller, or to have a cursor which your craft followed, would be far better. As is, it ""tries"" to calibrate the game to your mouse, which in my case made it almost impossible to control up or down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a seriously underrated game. I never hear about it, not even sure where I got it anymore. Took me a couple tries to get into. It's a skill game and once you figure it out it gets addictive quick. This is one of those rare games that when you do well you feel extremely rewarded. It has an interesting story if you take the time to play long enough for it to develop, has lots of interesting mechanics and the visual style is extremely unique.			",727,193,23,105,80,7,143

												I got this game in 2011, from the Humble Indie Bundle 3. It’s been a very long time since then, but I think I initially dropped it because there is no Steam cloud saving and I lost my save data.As you may have noticed from the “Mixed” user reviews on Steam, Hammerfight is a bit of a conflicting game. First of all, this game does not have any sort of video options. You’re stuck with a 4:3 window. This wasn’t so bad when I played it on Windows XP, but we’re kind of far past that point now. The window is tiny if you are running a 1900 resolution setup. I can’t really say the physics engine has aged well either.I used to love this game, really. But every time I tried to come back and play it again, it just didn’t click with me. It feels like I’m fighting against the controls, and nothing has really kept up with the times. The idea behind this game is nice, but it’s too old and doesn’t play well after all these years. ",152,30,5,19,19,1,25

												Hands down the best old school game on steam. By old school I am referring to it's brutality. If you cannot learn from your mistakes and master the physics and mechanics then you will lose over and over again. If you are a bad gamer, you will lose. That is why ALL the bad reviews are done by people with less than 1-2 hours gametime. That is what makes it brilliant. You can't beat the campaign unless you train in the arenas. Not because of some item unlock, but because you need to learn and improve. THe controls are seemless, the immersion is absolute, and the enemies varied. It is incredible. Check it out if you want a real challenge. And when it gets hard, don't leave a bad review because you are a bad gamer :/(Note: It says I've only played three hours but that's glitched because of family share - well over 60).

												Very rough. Designed around the mouse but I'm pretty sure it would have been much better if it supported gamepads(oh, it does. That's not shown on the store page, and it doesn't support my gamepad(xiaomi), though I'm told it supports 360s). You're constantly pushing the mouse higher and higher as you play to keep yourself from sinking. It's something you have to constantly do but also something you don't want to do because the more you do it the more often you have to recenter and lapse your control for a moment. As such it's inherently uncomfortable to play.Very irritating screen blur effect that happens, not when you get damaged, but when you do damage. Other games have pretty much trained me to respond to screen blur as pain, like literally an aversive stimulus. It is not conducive to player advancement to give blast them with aversive stimuli(effectively, ""don't do this"") every time they land a successful hit.The atmosphere, setting, and central mechanics are very good though, this game really deserves to be fixed.

												The AI on this game is SEVERELY broken.  During hunts the AI will get in your way, hit you, fire explosives at you (why the ♥♥♥♥ did you give the AI explosives during a mission where they're allies you stupid ♥♥♥♥?), and generally are in the way or shoving you in the walls.Either change the AI or remove the ""help"" from the hunt portion of the game altogether.  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥  It is extremely buggy and has a variety of issues that I doubt will ever be resolved.  It's hard to remain civil and composed having paid for what is, effectively, a worthless piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't win the game without playing the same mission 10x or more... simply because of the random glitches, terrible mouse control (your slider works BACKWARDS AND DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE YOU DRUNK), and crashing... as well as the severely mentally handicapped AI.  It's almost as if they gave their AI the same IQ as room full of drunk, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Russians: 0Fix that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I will change my review entirely.  Otherwise I'll do my best to make sure this game never sells another copy because the developer doesn't deserve the money.			",102,4,0,3,6,0,20

Posted: November 30, 2013
												One of the worst games I've ever had to play in my entire life.The whole premise of swinging around a mace, hammer, ball in a circular motion to smash enemies seems like a great premise for an indie title. However, it's executed so terribly that they might've well not tried. When you swing your hammer or ball around, it feels sluggish and incredibly slow, and not powerful in the slightest. You'd think that this could be fixed with sensitivity settings, but no, if you try to crank it up, your weapon spazzes out and cannot even complete a full circle. Your character, which is a ship that swings this weapon around, also moves like a escaped gorilla that's just been shot with four tranquilizer darts. Sometimes it moves too fast or too slow, but never at the speed you want it to.One of the other biggest flaws about the game is its difficulty. I'm usually the last person to complain about if a game is too hard or not, but this game went way too overboard. The difficulty is straight up unfair and heavily biased to the unfortunately dimwitted AI. They can nudge you for a good chunk of your health while not even swinging their weapon around, but if you try to do it, they take no damage and instead, you get hurt. Don't even get me started on how the AI, usually allies in a fight, love to just shout random phrases and one-liners in the middle of combat with these giant dialogue bubbles that obscure the combat. I've died on several occasions because of this horrible idea, where the developers felt the need for these poorly-rendered faces to say stupid phrases while the enemy sneaks underneath the dialogue bubble to get a cheap shot.Speaking of poorly-rendered, the graphics are atrocious. Particle effects like smoke and sparks, dramatic red flashes that block the screen if you get hit for like 5% of your health, and just noisy textures makes it extremely difficult to see what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. It's bad enough when you can barely make out what's happening on the screen, but this is one of the few times a game has actually made me think I was controlling a different unit than my own, which ends up in me getting killed. It's quite depressing when the original Fallout games had better visuals with the same sort of graphical style, especially when it came out 12 years before this game did.And sadly, unlike Fallout, the story is virtually non-existant and very two-dimensional. It's a standard ""big evil empire comes in to crush our native, peaceful way of life"" story, with no attempt on trying to give it life or make it feel like you're invested into it. Sometimes, bad gameplay can be set aside for a good story, but the plot here is nowhere near decent and even if it was, I'd probably still wouldn't want to play through the awful controls and cluttered mess that Hammerfight is. I played through the whole game thinking it would eventually get better.It didn't. So, for the sake of your sanity, stay away from this game at all costs. The fact that this game costs $10 by default is a joke as it is. I paid four cents for a pack with the Humble Indie Bundle a good while ago, and I still feel cheated out of my money.

												Putting aside the personal dislike of the games overall atmosphere, I find that the gameplay itself is rather hard, And very unforgiving. One thing I've also noted about this paticular game is that the scripting it uses is very bad, As well as the actual coding itself. While the artistic style matches the theme of the game, And doesn't look to bad, I'd have to say that the ammount of bugs it has makes the game damn near unplayable. Now, I'm all for a game being challanging, And infact I do love challanging games, But this is more of a challange because of its floaty controlls and as I've said before, Bad coding. One paticular moment was at the start of part III - I, Where the worm-caravan-thing would quite litterally, Bash its own head in off screen, And crash into the ground, Leaving me stuck in an endless cutscene. When I restarted it, I was greeted to the same thing, Over and over. In the end, By shear luck, I got the second phase of the cutscene to initalize and actually FAILED, Where I was able to use their built in level skipping mechanic at the cost of all gold I had earned upto that point. Not only was this rather rage endusing, But made me feel like I was being punished by the game for simply playing it. On another note, The game engine feels very floaty in physics. One thing is the lacking of a real feeling of gravity to the world and the feeling of too much air resistance. This makes it very hard to quickly change directions as the rock-chain wouldn't switch directions dispite me yanking it the other way and swinging it that direction several times. Yet another issue with the game is its overwhelming difficulty. Dispite the floaty and bad controlls, The AI seems to have damn near full controll of how they swing their weapons. While I have to pitch, Roll, Slam into walls and the floor to pull of my many orbits to get my weapon to actually swing, (Wimpily I might add.) The AI was able to dead-on charge me and send me flying into the ground, Dealing almost 50-60 damage to my starting vessel, Which is almost 80% damage. Another thing is that on MANY occations, While fighting enemies like the worm-like creatures, After bashing them in the head, They would go limp for only around a quarter of a second before shooting at me like they were fired out of a cannon, And deal a killing blow or damn near.To cap this off, I just have to bring up the broken coding one more time. On the mission where you battle a... sky-shrimp-thing?... and defend another... Worm-blimp-thing....? ....While I would try my best to defend it, The sky-shrimp would just crash into the worm-blimp-thing and spaz out, Causing everyone to, In a way, Explode. Honestly, I tried the mission again and stood completely still while it crashed into me, And amazingly won... In under 10 seconds...  One thing I also didn't note above is the HUD. The HUD is far to big for some missions as I can't see the entire battlefield. Of corse, this issue could be just my monitor's res, But I've read that it is a big issue for others as well as myself. Of corse, The HUD issue isn't as much a problem as most other things that could be wrong about this game.While I understand that I probably can't do better then this, I also feel that the creators could do so much better. They put a lot of work into this, And while the consept would be great, The actual game itself was executed rather poorly. I would NOT recommend this game, Unless it was free... Which its not, And never will be. To the Devs of this game, I would STRONGLY advice a revision of the games engine and a quick once over of the scripting and dialog of cutscenes throughout the story.And thank you in advance for reading my review completely.  ~<3 Violet.

												I don’t really get this game. Your mouse cursor is attached to this physics simulated swinging hammer and as you fling your mouse around you can duel against other swinging hammer ship things..? It’s just not very fun; nothing is inherently broken about how it controls, everything is responsive and the physics aren’t janky or anything, but Hammerfight is just not fun. I’m glad I got it as part of a bundle because even if I had picked this game up on a sale I would have been rather disappointed with my purchase.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												An interesting and fun concept, with a unusual an curious world to boot.HOWEVER.Half the time I'm not sure who I'm supposed to be fighting, and you sort of just get dropped into situations without a clue as to what you're supposed to do. I wouldn't mind this so much...BUT.The controls. WHYYYY??!?!?! Really. The tutorial, yes, is playable. Barely. But in order to get any semblance of motion out of my machine, I have to move my mouse in a 12"" circle, which is just about the limit of my mousepad. Also, at the speed you're doing it, you're going to be dropping the mouse off the desk, cursing, and just about screaming at the game. Increase the mouse speed to the the maximum? Marginally better, but not by much. You still need to move the mouse a ridiculous amount, and the frequency of the spins required to do any damage to your enemies is ridiculous, to the point of being RSI-inducing. Not to mention, at that mouse setting, it's a mission in itself to click anything in the menu.I would like it, if the controls were revamped. But otherwise... No. Just no.Do your hands a favor. Y'know, unless you've used some bluetooth software to hook a Wiimote up to your PC. Then it might be fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrid, I thought this game was going to be a good change (because I've been getting bored of shooters lately and have been going back to fighting and RPG games) I saw this game was free for 7 days so I decided to download it.. I completed the first 3 levels and started thinking this might be an alright game, but after the fourth level it just got boring. The basic concept is you just swinging your mouse and destroying enemies (it feels really dumb) I was really hoping I was going to like this game but sadly didn't.			",206,19,8,16,17,4,24

												Yes, I like the idea and concept, but when it's all put together Hammerfight is completely different than what you may have expected. Yes, the game is fun, but way to hard.The difficulty of the game is obsurd. It doesn't support cloud, trading cards, emotions, or backgrounds. I personally think this could be a great game, but it's not as of now.			",31,3,0,3,4,0,3

												It's actually a very clever concept for a PC game--just poor execution. They've tried to create a game where the mouse acts like a Wiimote and you use it to directly control a flail attached to a flying machine. It kind of works, but a mouse is really too clumsy to be whipping around in continuous circular motions--it just feels unnatural.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												The style of the game's setting and plot is some kind of primative time where clans are warring and the only technology are these out-of-place floating ""fighters"". Basically it's a game where you use momentum to swing weapons around and hit others. It's fun for what it is, just swiping your mouse around to bas things against enemies, getting different weapons, from sheilds to swords to guns that you can combine for different strategies.I had a nice amount of fun with this since it's a very simple game with a simple concept, the difficulty of enemies as the game progresses seems fair and it gives you some choices on what to do at times, giving you an normal way or a hard way for more rewards.

												It's  incredibly imprecise and has little more information to give you in terms of how to play than ""Swing your mouse around."" And that you do. Unless you have a space that is at least a few feet to move your mouse around you'll constantly be moving your mouse of the edge of the desk, let alone a standard size mouse pad. I had little to no idea if I was doing well or making progress in a given stage, and would die in an instant with no idea how. If you can learn to control this game with any kind of precision or consistency then more power to you. But buyers beware that this isn't something to get unless you're really interested in and have seen some gameplay, or desperately need to buy a game for some arbitrary reason.			",97,24,0,35,11,1,11

												I keep trying to play this game but every time the mouse either locks up, or I get it to go but there's no differing resolution support and the text is INSANELY SMALL for the size of the window. Just atrocious to start off. And then this game is one of the ""Impossible to close out"" games where it actively fights my cursor to stay inside the window. When I alt-tab, let me hit the x, don't FORCE my cursor back into the window. I can handle it myself.I haven't played the game more than 10 minutes, in which I thought ""Wow I need a bigger window"" but the game is so unintuitive that I miss where to set the resolution if that's even there, and I don't have the patience to edit another .ini file. Is it the 90's or are resolution options a well-established thing at this point?Just an absolute mess. Thank god I got this in a bundle less than the cost of the game itself. Do NOT recommend.

												Techically, this game is incredible... but if you can be killed in less than six seconds on the second, third and fourth level, consistently, there's either something seriously wrong with the settings, or i'm missing some fundimental 'don't get dead' tehcnique explained earlier.So far, it feels like i'm using a giant flying glass hammer! the controls are revolutionary, but unresponsive.no matter how many adjustments I make to my mouse, the craft moves too fast or too slow and an unpleasant mix in between.I really want to like the game... but starting a level, being caught by surprise by an unexpected jerk of movement, stunned, then destroyed by the first enemy you see in a level for the seventh time? no... not fun any more...I think everyone should play this game at least once, but to be honest, i feel there is something seriously wrong with either my difficulty settings or my mouse (for the record, not a cheap, simple mouse at that, so i'm not expecting any trouble from it)I want my mind changed about this, but there's something very wrong with how this is playing.

												It's so insanly difficult, most of the times you won't have any clue what's going on, the cutscenes arn't well placed and you'll see most of them for like 10 times atleast, that if you didn't smash your head on a wall by then.. The controls arn't good at all, unless you have a wireless mouse, you're going to suffer. You'd manage to get some epic hits, but most of the time you'll struggle. The tutorial was one of the hardest, and it's basicly Dark souls but with flying tubes.Passing a level is so damn satisfying, the concept is awesome, but the story line's kinda of meh.

												Seems like an interesting game. I'd never pay for it however, as it's nightmarish for me to try playing it with my trackball.Having it require you to calibrate the mouse during setup seems like overkill. Can't it use DirectX or something to figure out the DPI setting on the mouse? Ugh. Moving my trackball cursor in circles with my thumb is tricky enough during the game. Having to do it while setting it up kind of let me know that this game wouldn't be enjoyable for a guy with a trackball who can't really use a mouse due to ergonomics/RSI issue.For those of you without such problems, it's probably a fun and interesting game.

												Hammerfight is a fairly innovative game; I've seen mouse-based combat of the likes in a few games beforehand but none were memorable enough to recall by name. Overall, it was an enjoyable, albeit frustrating, experience to beat the game. I spent 5 hours to beat my first playthrough and finished it again in under 3 hours.There is a steep learning curve in the game, requiring you to be very in touch with your movement and each weapon, as each weapon is balanced differently and has different amounts of damage.There are four types of weapons in the game and they all behave differently: Swords, Axes, Maces (Actually flails), and Hammers.Swords are best used as a slashing weapon, obviously. The best damage I have done with them has come from dragging the very tip of the blade across the enemy as fast as possible. They're great once you get the hang of them but not good if you expect to smash the side of the blade into an enemy and kill it.Maces/Flails are the heaviest weapons in the game, encumbering you further by the momentum they pick up. This forces you to use the momentum to throw not only the weapon, but also yourself at the enemy. They are the best weapon type for crushing armor and I have killed many foes in one hit with a well-placed ball of iron to the skull. Many players may find them cumbersome because they pull your craft around with their weight; I see it as good physics.Hammers are my personal favorite weapon type; they are based on precision. I wasn't proficient at using hammers until about halfway through the story when I was forced to train for the tournament. The best hits from a hammer come from timing your strike to hit the enemy with the entire head of the hammer flat-on. Glancing blows do very little damage but a hammer can be swung at incredible speeds and a well-placed strike can destroy the heaviest armor.I can't say much about axes in the game. I haven't spent a lot of time with them but from the time I have used them, I've seen they are a mix of swords and hammers but slightly heavier than both.The repetitive mouse controls tire me out at times but the game became immensely more enjoyable the second time I played through it, being able to enjoy perfecting the use of my weapon instead of wildly swinging it about, hoping I would hit something. It becomes much easier to play without dying if you know how to properly use the weapons and take your time. I found myself toying with the enemies and stealing their weapons the second playthrough.The story is interesting, in a well-enough developed world. Some cutscenes seemed to drag on for me, especially being a fan of the fast action in the game. I often found myself skipping through them to proceed to the next fight. The graphics are obviously not meant to be top of the line but I found a certain simple charm in the art style. The entire game has the appeal of a flash game you would expect to be free on the internet but it engrossed me for some reason.The music was enjoyable and didn't overpower or distract from the satisfying crunch I make when destroying the aircrafts of my enemies. I didn't pay much attention to it but it does have a definite prescence. Once again, overall, I recommend this game. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it's different and that is something the gaming industry desperately needs more of. I enjoyed the challenge even though I did have to walk away and take a breather once or twice from frustration. It's worth trying out, especially while it's free. I would consider buying it while it's on sale otherwise. Not a 10 USD game but worth supporting the devs nonetheless.			",179,15,6,14,11,0,5

												This game is extremely long and difficult, which usually make for a good game. The only problems I had were some parts were impossibly difficult and the story is very hard to follow with multiple choice paths. Overall I liked the game because of how the phisics were used and the way one has to move their machine.(speaking of which, it would be nice for a choice of machine type in a future update) I give this game an 8/10 and recommend it for hardcore players looking for a challenge!If you dont know if this game is for you try the demo ;D.

												Hammerfight is a fairly innovative game; I've seen mouse-based combat of the likes in a few games beforehand but none were memorable enough to recall by name. Overall, it was an enjoyable, albeit frustrating, experience to beat the game. I spent 5 hours to beat my first playthrough and finished it again in under 3 hours.There is a steep learning curve in the game, requiring you to be very in touch with your movement and each weapon, as each weapon is balanced differently and has different amounts of damage.There are four types of weapons in the game and they all behave differently: Swords, Axes, Maces (Actually flails), and Hammers.Swords are best used as a slashing weapon, obviously. The best damage I have done with them has come from dragging the very tip of the blade across the enemy as fast as possible. They're great once you get the hang of them but not good if you expect to smash the side of the blade into an enemy and kill it.Maces/Flails are the heaviest weapons in the game, encumbering you further by the momentum they pick up. This forces you to use the momentum to throw not only the weapon, but also yourself at the enemy. They are the best weapon type for crushing armor and I have killed many foes in one hit with a well-placed ball of iron to the skull. Many players may find them cumbersome because they pull your craft around with their weight; I see it as good physics.Hammers are my personal favorite weapon type; they are based on precision. I wasn't proficient at using hammers until about halfway through the story when I was forced to train for the tournament. The best hits from a hammer come from timing your strike to hit the enemy with the entire head of the hammer flat-on. Glancing blows do very little damage but a hammer can be swung at incredible speeds and a well-placed strike can destroy the heaviest armor.I can't say much about axes in the game. I haven't spent a lot of time with them but from the time I have used them, I've seen they are a mix of swords and hammers but slightly heavier than both.The repetitive mouse controls tire me out at times but the game became immensely more enjoyable the second time I played through it, being able to enjoy perfecting the use of my weapon instead of wildly swinging it about, hoping I would hit something. It becomes much easier to play without dying if you know how to properly use the weapons and take your time. I found myself toying with the enemies and stealing their weapons the second playthrough.The story is interesting, in a well-enough developed world. Some cutscenes seemed to drag on for me, especially being a fan of the fast action in the game. I often found myself skipping through them to proceed to the next fight. The graphics are obviously not meant to be top of the line but I found a certain simple charm in the art style. The entire game has the appeal of a flash game you would expect to be free on the internet but it engrossed me for some reason.The music was enjoyable and didn't overpower or distract from the satisfying crunch I make when destroying the aircrafts of my enemies. I didn't pay much attention to it but it does have a definite prescence. Once again, overall, I recommend this game. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it's different and that is something the gaming industry desperately needs more of. I enjoyed the challenge even though I did have to walk away and take a breather once or twice from frustration. It's worth trying out, especially while it's free. I would consider buying it while it's on sale otherwise. Not a 10 USD game but worth supporting the devs nonetheless.			",179,15,6,14,11,0,5

												There are some enormous problems:There are bugs. Game breaking, the story won't progress ever again, and your save is toast, bugs.If you do the mouse calibration in the settings, the game is unwinnable. A handful of enemies, even early on, will take no damage from wonderfully timed, direct hit smashes.There are serious upsides, too. The game features a novel combat mechanism, a reliable story, and some tortuous challenges that can't be easily abused, avoided, or mitigated.Overall, this is an oddly addictive game stunted by a handful of deeply entrenched flaws. I'm conflicted, but ultimately I have to conclude that there are better games to spend your dollars on.			",102,17,1,21,19,0,14

												This is easily one of the most frustrating games I've ever played... and this is coming from someone who loves to play Super Hexagon. The mechanic is cool, sure. The controls are supposed to be hard, yes. But I don't think I'm in the wrong to completely give up on them. Maybe if it wasn't so dang easy to get cornered and devoured on literally the first level you play, I'd like it more. I feel like most of the time, my flying machine doesn't respond at all to my mouse. I'm just bait for those ridiculously molesty catepilar things. The worst part: I've knocked things off the table playing this game. If you use a mouse pad? Not enough space. Clear your desk off if you want anything to do with this game. (And my mouse was only on 400 DPI)And the graphics are banal. There are 3 or 4 different styles that I feel would fit this game better. 3-D characters that sit uncomfortably in the uncanny valley have no real purpose. If the graphics were more appealing, I'd rate this higher. I would be less convinced that this game is just a neat mechanic with some thrown together, undirected artistry.I wanted this to be fun. I truly did.4/10.			",192,40,2,27,39,3,34

Very unfun over-active simulated physics (rage inducing ""physics"" like in Cortex Command) and poor, mouse-only controls round out this terrible flash game. I got this in the Humble Indie Bundle #3 and I am appalled that this poor excuse for a game costs $10 normally. Do not bother with this   tripe even if it's free because there are ""better"" bad games out there to play for a joke.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

Posted: November 11, 2014
												I can't recommend this game, mainly because IMO the control system is too difficult for it to be enjoyable.  The game description does say that it uses a ""realistic physics simulation"" for the combat system, and this is partly why I wanted to try it.  Swinging around a hammer (or the like) using the mouse seemed like an interesting way of playing.  But it's hard -- harder than I expected it to be.  I suppose if you spend the time and effort to figure out the physics, the game is probably a lot more fun.  But I didn't want to.  I like to be able to get into a game right from the start, and I couldn't here.  I also expect early levels of games to be fairly easy and help me learn how things work.  Here, after only a few levels, I failed one repeatedly and the game offered to let me skip the level.  IMO something's wrong when you're given an option to skip levels that early.  If you can't pass early levels, what hope will you have in later levels that should be even harder?  I tried calibrating my mouse, and I tried another review's tip of increasing the mouse's DPI out-of-game and putting the in-game setting to 100, but neither of these seemed to provide any real improvement in the contols.  I guess that means they were working as intended, and I'm just too impatient and/or lazy to spend the time necessary to figure them out.  I've got a huge backlog of games though, and if something's not working well for me from the start, or I can't easily see how to improve and get things rolling, I'm not going to stick with the game.  Sorry.  If you like the idea of rather unique controls and are willing to put enough time and effort into learning the physics to get better at using the controls, give this a shot, but maybe wait for a sale; $5 isn't a bad price, but if it turns out you don't like it, you'd prefer to have spent less money on it.  For others like me who may not want to spend that time and effort, I'd suggest you skip this one.			",1084,532,46,115,100,10,184

												Well bless me bagpipes!  Just the other day I wanted a game that would remind me of the good ole days where games were windowed.  I have found it it ""fists of hammering"".  In this game you play as a blob with a thing attached to yourself.  Swinging the mouse makes you look like an idiot in front of everyone, but makes the game move forward.And what movement.  ""Hammering fists"" boasts left to right, up to down and everything in between.  You'd be hard pressed to find any other game that fists with hammers as much as ""Hammertime: fists of gold"".Heartily recommended to all those that enjoy maces, talking heads and fists.

												I got this as part of a Humble Bundle years ago, and didn't get around playing it until the winter 2014 term. When I launched the game, I was kind of impressed at how poor the graphical quality was; it was really hard to stomach. I kept playing because the idea was neat, you control these flying machines with your mouse and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of opponents. It's pretty niche, and I can totally see it working as a multiplayer as well, but there is none.Regardless, the story is awful. It's some strange revenge story that never really goes anywhere, and it's a struggle to get through with the sluggish controls. I guess the setting is pretty cool, but I never really cared too much for it. The music was lame and unexciting, the enemies could be annoying and unpredictable at times, and there is little variety in the gameplay.I would give this a 2.4/10. I think this is a pretty terrible game. The only redeeming quality it has is that it's a neat concept. But boy, is it ever poorly executed.			",110,27,2,7,1,0,5

												I cannot fathom how this game made it out of development.  I can understand how it got into development, someone had an idea for what might be an interesting combat mechanic.  Have flying machines swinging weights attached to them at one another.  It is one of those, ""It's so crazy it might just work,"" ideas.  However, I would have guessed that 5 minutes of play testing would have disabused the developers of that notion.  It didn't and thus the game was released.  Much to the detriment of my afternoon and pocketbook.			",208,33,2,38,45,4,51

												Hammerfight's setting seems to be a variation of cyberpunk with a hint of light fantasy. The music is fitting, and somewhat interesting, but quite repetitive. The graphical presentation is reminiscent of PC games from the 1990s, even though the ship animations could be considered fluid. What is most unique (and incredibly problematic) about the game is the attack mechanic. This involves using the mouse to create inertia and physics based weighted action, which is more complicated than it sounds. There isn't much of a tutorial, nor any kind of instruction for the player besides minimal between mission briefings, and much of the game play is discovered by plenty of trial and error. Meaning that you will have to repeat the majority of the levels a multitude of times until victory is achieved. Upgrades to your ship are obtained as you earn money and purchase items from the shop. The plot appears to be involved, but ends up being a disorganized and fuddled mess, leaving the player with not much care as to what is actually happening. Hammerfight also seems to be prone to crashing at random times, for no apparent reason whatsoever; with an emphasis on when you quit to the desktop. Even though the idea for the game is unique, the implementation for its most important mechanic is a complete and utter failure. Hammerfight has the absolute worst controls and mechanics since Gish. Controlling your ship is the most imprecise experience I can think of, and manages to be generally worse than Gish in all comparable ways. There are various gauges and panels that mysteriously appear and disappear on the screen during battles, and there is never anything explained as to what they mean, what they do, or what they are supposed to be. The mechanic of circling your mouse around continuously and inconsequentially gets boring and tiring extremely fast, as your arm, wrist, and hand will feel like quitting minutes into the game, besides feeling like an idiot for performing such a task. Then, when you realize that your attempts at attacking your enemies are mostly frivolous and ineffective, you will have even less reasons to continue. Hammerfight is yet another good example of a good premise going to waste due to achingly poor and limited design and execution. It has some of the worst controls and mechanics I have ever experienced.Hammerfight is awful.			",1294,339,60,143,147,16,197

												I'm going to rate this as a ""no"" and only for one reason - the price. This game is worth $2.99 - $3.99 and that's about it. It's a fun game. It's very very unique in its play, and it's fun spinning your mouse around like a crazy person. However, the UI isn't great, the sound effects when entering new areas are annoying (horribly annoying). The menu when you log in is annoying. A LOT of things about this game are annoying, even the graphics, and the story-line. The thing about the game that isn't annoying? Actually playing it. It's really fun, silly, and would be something I'd play often, but there's just NO way I'd ever pay $10 for it and is why I do not recommend it for that price. Also, the game seems unfinished, it really does. But, again, it's fun. :)			",126,35,1,26,29,1,26

												Do not waste time on this game, even if you got it for free. Played for 10 minutes, enough to know that it's not fun at all. * strange mouse behavior upon first execution, forcing you to quit and relaunch the game * a screen resolution which cannot be changed, which ends up reducing visibility and text legibility * at least on my system, I cannot change to fullscreen * initial story has no hooks, completely boring * terrible controls (difficult to move and attack at the same time, enemies don't have that problem) * combat victory, if attainable, ends up feeling completely a matter of luck * does not induce you to persevere, frustrating but in a bad way * not fun at all, not even for a minute  ",283,54,6,25,26,0,61

												For people saying, ""wait it'll get better"" I doubt it. I got this game in a bundle. I've had it for years, the devs aren't going to release a game fixing update. It is what it is, missed potential. The visuals & concept are really good. However (The important part) the gameplay/controls are terrible. You want to know why landing a solid hit to your enemy is so satisfying? It's because of the rare chance you'll have any sort of success, while fighting with the crappy controls. Save the $4.99, download the demo & then spend your money elsewhere.			",819,184,6,73,31,7,49

												Hammerfight is a challenging physics based that is attempting something new but lacks refined mechanics that makes other physics based indie games successful. It takes a lot of practice in Hammerfight to get anything out of the game. It is brutally hard not because the game itself is challenging, it is because the controls are very difficult to master. Balance is also a huge problem in the game, it becomes more apparent during escort mission where getting hit by the enemies sends you flying across the map, leaving you unable to fulfill the escort mission. While the theme of the game and ship customization is great, the plot is very much lost by the time you are in mid game. At that point the story disintegrates and you are left fighting arena enemies. If you are looking for something very experimental, give this game a whirl, personally I have no intention to play this game ever again.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Hammerfight launches the player into a Roman and Greek-influenced steampunk age, fighting waves of enemies with a weapon of choice slung from your steam-powered flying machine. A great choice for determined players, not so great for ones who will give up too easily. The story line is not really intricate, though as you progress through levels, you will find you have to make choices, which cannot be undone; thus the player must choose wisely. I recommend this game, because although I can not afford it, I almost finished the game, and I loved it. It just takes perserverance. Would definitely play again. Here are a few tips for new players: Consider changing your DPI to something lower, to increase mouse sensitivity, which will in turn alow your machine to perform with easier manouverability.Although the decision after the introduction is to either take an easy or a hard path, they are both equal in difficulty. I actually found that the one marked HARD was easier. DON'T PANIC! You will get to choose what weapons you use later on, and there is actually a large variety of weapons available to the warrior. Don't know what else to say here. Pretty fun game, just a bit of an unsure start and story line.7.5/10			",61,3,3,9,2,0,1

												Hammerfight is quite unique.  The feeling of swinging your mouse in an arc to hit enemies with a weapon is surprisingly solid.  There are many different weapons -- blades, hammers, heavy things on chains, even firearms... I think the rock-on-a-chain ended up fitting my flight style the best, but each had their uses and strategies.Wrapping this interesting combat system together is a very creative setting and story.  I love blimps/zeppelins etc, so a desert warrior society with traditions of dueling propellor-powered hovering craft maneuvering to swing physical weapons at each other?  Count me in!There's even a branching story with different gameplay twists and challenges.  I must admit, the path I took became far too hard so I modded the game to give me a bit more health... but I'm pretty sure that path was supposed to be harder than the others to begin with.  So try Hammerfight -- there's a demo now (there wasn't when I bought it).  Make sure your mouse is in good condition! :-)			",272,77,3,25,24,1,69

												Another one of my favourite games, theres just something about it that makes me go back and play it.It has a campaign that you must finish a few levels in before you can acess the best parts of the game like arena.To explain the arena mode, think being a gladiator in the Roman Colliseum but you control a big flying machine which swings swords, axes, hammers, ect...A personal tip would be to turn the mouse sensitivity to the highest setting rather than what they recommend you.

												Terrible resolution, small text is impossible to read. The game has high difficulty and I sucked at it. I confess, but it was mostly  because the fights are quite unfair. Enemies are outnumbering you, sometimes you´re not even given a weapon and most of the time your comrades only cause damage to you. For all of your gold (no exact number, just all of your gold) you can skip level, which seems like it´s pretty useless since you want to play the game, don´t you? But the levels become so hard it´s practicaly needed. If you like being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the♥♥♥♥♥by super large rod buy the game. Anyone who wants to have fun playing the game should stick to something easier. Like Dark Souls.			",109,28,3,14,5,2,12

I'll simply briefly resume my opinion:This game is a great game, it is complex yet very simple. You have flying machines fighting one another using basic physics to flail their weapons at one another.It can be very frustrating, but you will enjoy spending some time trying to master the basics of your flying machine, adding weapons of your choice, gems that'll give you small boost and... Surviving!I've done the complete game and at the current price, I know the game art, coding, sounds and every single work that was spent over this game is a rightful price for such a good time (There may be some problems, but they mostly came to my advantage)So start your engine and go up high above the ground, or deep down in the dept of a cave hunting down furious beasts, as you will be the greatest pilot! Move on! Crush your opponents! Slice them! Or burn their engines and collect the coins of victory!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hammerfight is quite unique.  The feeling of swinging your mouse in an arc to hit enemies with a weapon is surprisingly solid.  There are many different weapons -- blades, hammers, heavy things on chains, even firearms... I think the rock-on-a-chain ended up fitting my flight style the best, but each had their uses and strategies.Wrapping this interesting combat system together is a very creative setting and story.  I love blimps/zeppelins etc, so a desert warrior society with traditions of dueling propellor-powered hovering craft maneuvering to swing physical weapons at each other?  Count me in!There's even a branching story with different gameplay twists and challenges.  I must admit, the path I took became far too hard so I modded the game to give me a bit more health... but I'm pretty sure that path was supposed to be harder than the others to begin with.  So try Hammerfight -- there's a demo now (there wasn't when I bought it).  Make sure your mouse is in good condition! :-)			",272,77,3,25,24,1,69

There is literally no reason you should buy this game, its so bad that its not even worth buying it to make fun of it. 1/10 They gave it their best shot.			",29,6,0,1,3,2,0

One other complaint is that it sort off gets REALLY REALLY hard really fast. On the second level it took me a hour to complete! Maybe some improvements cane me made for some minor issues. From what i can see you dont need a hardcore PC to run this game. It is really good game and i would recommend it to the people with normal PCs that cant run game very well.			",90,11,1,17,8,1,2

												Every review I have read thus far on this game has said something to the effect that this is the worst game in existence. I for one find it addictive and fun. I keep coming back to play during other game downloads. I thought it was kind of stinky at first until I realized that my mouse speed was turned way up in game which translates to HIGH DPI AKA A SLOW MOUSE SPEED. To get the most of this game SET YOUR MOUSE SPEED LOW TO GET THE MOST MOMENTUM. Once you get guns on your steampunk copter killing machine the game starts to open up and you are forced to pay attention to when your gaining weapon momentum and where your gun is pointed to fire massive damage at impossible foes.  You will get frustated and you will think of quiting once or twice but it's all reminiscent of the old NES and SEGA games that I've grown up on, it's definitely not as frustrating as playing Atari. I give this game an A for visual fidelity, A for difficulty, B for controls explanation, A+ for unique experience. I think of this game as the GoldenAxe of this age.			",30,2,2,2,2,0,0

												I wish Steam had more than an upvote and downvote for games, cause this is a great game as an example for why we do.This game is balls to the walls hard, sometimes seemingly unfair, and can be downright annoying at times.So why am I still reccomending this game to you?For one simple reason.The core mechanics and principles of the game.What are they you ask? Why, simple. Flying around in a steampunk machine and beating the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of literally everything you see with a weapon crudely attached to your machine in such a way you have to swing it and build up momentum for a hit. You control the flying machine with your mouse. And whenever you hit anything with your weapon at high velocities/you hit the at the perfect time the game slows down time and gives you a massive movement speed and control boost, meaning you can do it over and over again given the right skill level.Now there are some problems with the combat as well, some pretty big, like the fact you can be stunned by your enemies, and 9 times out of 10 you will be outnumbered and out gunned, meaning you have to fight tooth and nail just to survive. I cannot count the number of times I have gotten stunned and then just died because of it. The sound design is also quite lackluster, as whenever a bomb goes off it feels like someone shoved a blaring smoke detector in my ear, and in the later levels of the arena, THERE ARE A LOT OF F***ING BOMBS.Oh yeah there is also a pretty cool story mode set in a steampunk arabian/middle east world. It's pretty cool. It evne has multiple endings depending on what you choose to do and who to fight.All in all, even though I do reccomend this game, it is only to someone who is ready and willing to get his♥♥♥♥♥handed to him several times before getting down the core mechanics. Then, and only then, are you going to really enjoy this game.Also, THE DPI CALIBRATION IS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BROKEN AND YOU SHOULD NOT TRUST IT. Set it about half or less than it says you should set it to, and then try and play. If that still doesn't work you can always change them in the main menu.			",145,12,0,23,20,0,13

EDIT: The text below was written before Steam Recommendations became Steam Reviews.Hammerfight will quickly wear out your mouse and that's because the game uses it extensively, but in a cool and unique way. The original idea of steampunk war machines and their heraldry, the storyline and nice graphics are the major virtues of Hammerfight. Although the game may seem to be very hard at the start, nothing is more gratifying than smacking enemies at full speed with your weapon of choice.			",266,67,3,53,21,6,63

In few words that is a Dark Souls in 2D, with climat of One thousand and one night fables.Have a physic based combat what is easy to learn but hard to mastered, uniqe art style and not bad climatic music.And most importand, you can easy fall in the world of the game, feel adrenaline rush when you fight with horror of night, prud when you win fight on the arean and more.You looking for game, what challenge you but still is fair, that is a good choise.Let's devil's of desertet don't crush your ship, child of the fortune.

												Simple, yet very addicting. And using only mouse (and eventually keyboard for shortcuts), which is a good thing. It's just so fun to destroy everyone in this game - after you'll get used to weapons. NPCs can be painful to deal with sometimes, but it's a minor thing. Gameplay is the key - and, while it has some flaws - it's still very good and original.			",125,15,6,16,5,1,28

												Every review I have read thus far on this game has said something to the effect that this is the worst game in existence. I for one find it addictive and fun. I keep coming back to play during other game downloads. I thought it was kind of stinky at first until I realized that my mouse speed was turned way up in game which translates to HIGH DPI AKA A SLOW MOUSE SPEED. To get the most of this game SET YOUR MOUSE SPEED LOW TO GET THE MOST MOMENTUM. Once you get guns on your steampunk copter killing machine the game starts to open up and you are forced to pay attention to when your gaining weapon momentum and where your gun is pointed to fire massive damage at impossible foes.  You will get frustated and you will think of quiting once or twice but it's all reminiscent of the old NES and SEGA games that I've grown up on, it's definitely not as frustrating as playing Atari. I give this game an A for visual fidelity, A for difficulty, B for controls explanation, A+ for unique experience. I think of this game as the GoldenAxe of this age.			",30,2,2,2,2,0,0

												Yes, the core game mechanic is fairly novel: you swing around a mace, via the mouse, to smash enemies. I would accept the inherent difficulty in moving and attacking being one in the same, because its fun as hell. But even if the controls were not bug-free (which they aren't - you can often try to attack and find yourself moving erratically to the other side of the screen instead), there are too many problems. The HUD is too large. Between the ""health"" indicator in the lower left corner, and the huge circle in the center top, which seems to be just for your mentors to shout at you, easily 33% of the screen is wasted. Combining the buggy controls with the stupidly large HUD, it's easy to completely lose track of where you are.And here's one more thing. The camera doesn't center on your character. It's possible for you to veer entirely off screen, and combined with the HUD and the control issues, you're completely screwed. This isn't difficultly stemming from a game mechanic. This is just poor design. Centering the damn camera would make this game completely different, and 3 times better.			",109,26,0,11,9,0,8

												The game controls has serious issues. The flying machine is virtually impossible to control, either not going in the direction I'm trying to move it or not flaying the hammer, so I either stand still when I want to move, doing nothing usefull at all, or my hammer moves like a limb fish.If these issues are sorted the game looks promising.

												Woops! Sorry about that, I completely lost track of what game I was writing for and what company I work for and who the ♥♥♥♥ I even am actually. I sure hope the cops don't show up out of nowhere to lock me up because that's what happens when someone suspects you're crazy. Speaking of cripples, let's talk about the actual gameplay. Apart from it being long and repetitive, the game is actually quite UNIMAGINABLY LONG AND REPTITIVE. Remember when I said all you do is point your flashlight at enemies until they go away? Well you do that about sixty times between every checkpoint, and yes, there are checkpoints, and it's the same encounter every time. Three enemies jump you while the game zooms out to show you in slow-mo where they're coming from, then you turn around and kill them, more pop up except this time it's not really an ambush, it's just happening /again/. And there are always enemies popping up like that, in slow motion so you can see exactly where they're coming from and exactly how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they are to see you. Especially if you get your hands on any ♥♥♥♥ing ammo ever, because this is one of those games where nothing is going to happen when you're walking into some crazy place,♥♥♥♥♥♥is going to happen when you're walking back /out/. Find some flares and a god damn nuke? Have fun having to waste it all when you get jumped after finding it! There was actually a time when I had to RUN AWAY from a boss, and apparently you can do that, because I had no ♥♥♥♥ing ammo left after the game sent 50 pimp-slappers at me. Speaking of bosses, let's delve deeper into this amazing enemy variety. There are only 5 ♥♥♥♥ing types of enemies in the game: regular♥♥♥♥♥♥eaters, buffed up♥♥♥♥♥♥eaters, bosses, flocks of evil birds, and, get this, ♥♥♥♥ING TRACTORS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most original games ever. The game is centered around physics-based melee combat of steampunk flying machines, in other words, swinging the weapons by only controlling the machine itself. Swinging the weapon, while also dodging at the same time turns the fight into an incredible dance, fluid and graceful. The amazing setting, crisp visuals and above all, the unconventional gameplay makes this a one of a kind experience not to be missed.			",344,105,4,28,13,2,74

												good concept, poorly executed, as soon as you start it up it is confusing, the mouse calibration system is awful don't use it manually calibrating it will yield better results as the calibration system sets the sensitivity way too low for the game to be playable. the main problem with the game is that there is absolutely no obvious instructions the game just expects you to know how to play it which is incredibly unhelpful as you only get one trial fight before you start for real, the combat system is poor as brushing anything will instantly wipe out 20% of your health, the story need not be there as it too is confusing and makes little sense. the concept is a great idea and could be really fun and worth paying for but because it is so cheaply put together (everything just feels rushed and desperately bolted together) and unhelpful, it is not worth buying in it's current state			",11,2,0,5,2,1,7

												Hammerfight is surprisingly fun and if the creator was a much better programmer it would have been an instant indie classic. While this might not be the full version, the steam version is incomplete, it is worth the price.Tip: Since you likely won't read this longer... If you play this turn up the mouse sensitivity in the games options. The game SERIOUSLY overestimates the power of your mouse.In Hammerfight you play a flying machine with a flail, sword, or hammer attached that you can swing wildly. The gameplay at first is quite hectic but soon you get the hang of things and will be able to fight with the best of them, expect to stink a lot at first, it will be 2 hours before things click and until then you will feel like this game is unfairly challenging you. After this period the game is all about timing and finding your opening, and when you strike the enemies FEEL it, your weapons have actual weight and not only do they affect how you fly, heavy weapons do affect how you fly and when an enemy gets struck by one expect them to fly right into the wall with a satisfying SPLAT! You can even strategically attack the opponent's weapons to stop their momentum or even destroy them.The game isn't without its flaws. There is no Newgame+ so as soon as you beat the game it is OVER and you need to start a new game... There is no way to grind crystals, they enhance weapons, in this game (only in the full version) so whatever you end up with is all you get. The game feels short and you can easily finish it in one afternoon... Enemies in the Arena have a large tendency to just blow up to kill you or use a ""blow up the entire stage"" attack, making the high-level Arena feel cheap rather than fun. As well there are a few game ending bugs in the game. Multiplayer would have elevated this game to instant greatness, but there is none.All in all Hammerfight is a very fun game that is short but ooooooh so satisfying. This game could have been a great game worthy to be one of the greatest indie games of all time, but it falls short and becomes instead simply a very good game worthy of anyone's cash. If this is on sale BUY IT! there really is no excuse.			",111,39,0,40,16,0,29

												Fun physics game overall and would still recomend it, however: The graphics far from ""high quality art"" and remind me of the original fallout graphics. Secondly controls require some definite tweaking before you can begin to enjoy the game. If you insist on using the auto-calibration, try to move your mouse at a comfortable constant speed you would use to swinging your weapon in circle. I would recomend setting it manually then testing it in game. I personally prefer it between 700 and 800 dpi but I find that the lower the number the easier it is to fly around the screen without swinging your weapon and higher makes it easier to swing your weapon without moving around to much. And lastly the story can be difficult to follow do to the text boxes automatically scrolling through at what apears to be a speed based on the length of the text while clicking to skip to the next box will frequently pass multiple texts because of the timers. All that aside, once you have your controls set to your liking and have made it far enough into the game to be able to customize your machine with new weapons the gameplay can be very enjoyable.

												Well very interesting game. I love the graphics the story seemed solid but many times I was wondering what was going. The combat took a little getting used to but after a few levels you get the hang of it.I find this game had some problems with difficulty scaling some levels were a piece of cake others I seemed to die for no reason at all. Biggest frustration was when you are exiled into the abyss. The first time I had an enemy pick up the hammer I was supposed to use. I had an instant death from the enemy another half dozen times at what I would consider a safe distance from where the enemy pop out fo the ground. I died another 3 or 4 times just picking up my weapon in that fight again starting a safe distance from the ground. I notice in general that with all the chaos from the fights that at times I could be hidden in the smoke and other effects making me an easy kill. The stun effect, while it made some fights easy could easily screw you over if you accidentally touched a wall. While understandable I hated how if I swong my weapon full force and hit a guy it would do decent damage but if I run into a motionless enemy's weapon it would crush me. A bug I found was in the pendelum if you equip to heavy a weapon and actually read the text for the story I started in the lower gear with no way of escaping death from being crushed. Also at times I found during the boss fight with the void robot thing that I would take damage for no apparent reason and no I was not anywhere close to the purple things. I found this happend most when anywhere straight above the boss.I loved any level with battling armies in front of towns. The environmental distruction.

The game took a good idea and went pretty far but never polished it up with a good UI or controls.The gameplay is hard but enjoyably so.In the end you may or may not like the game but... its hard to enjoy at times.

												Okay, I know this is an old indie game.  And I suspect you've already tried it, and then said, ""Oh, Christ, the controls make me want to vomit bloody chunks.  And it's way too damned hard.""  And you'd be right.  But -- get this:  You know how hipster game developers talk about The Flow, that zone you get when you're cruising that thin line between utter keyboard-eating frustration and repetitious boredom of cakewalk comp stomping?  Where you end wasting all night long on a single game?That's Hammerfight, right there.  The learning curve is so steep it's practically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ singularity in spacetime, but once you manage to overcome it then you are in for one hell of a nice game.Be prepared for cheap moments.  (Insta-kill point blank explosive weaponry, in particular.  GRR!)  But then you'll learn to dodge those moments and smash enemies flat with a 10-♥♥♥♥ing-ton flying hammer.  And by God, does it feel GREAT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'll simply briefly resume my opinion:This game is a great game, it is complex yet very simple. You have flying machines fighting one another using basic physics to flail their weapons at one another.It can be very frustrating, but you will enjoy spending some time trying to master the basics of your flying machine, adding weapons of your choice, gems that'll give you small boost and... Surviving!I've done the complete game and at the current price, I know the game art, coding, sounds and every single work that was spent over this game is a rightful price for such a good time (There may be some problems, but they mostly came to my advantage)So start your engine and go up high above the ground, or deep down in the dept of a cave hunting down furious beasts, as you will be the greatest pilot! Move on! Crush your opponents! Slice them! Or burn their engines and collect the coins of victory!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Combat in Hammerfight is like nothing I've ever experienced before. There is something really satisfying about smashing your enemies to bits with a flailing piece of metal.

												I wish Steam had more than an upvote and downvote for games, cause this is a great game as an example for why we do.This game is balls to the walls hard, sometimes seemingly unfair, and can be downright annoying at times.So why am I still reccomending this game to you?For one simple reason.The core mechanics and principles of the game.What are they you ask? Why, simple. Flying around in a steampunk machine and beating the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of literally everything you see with a weapon crudely attached to your machine in such a way you have to swing it and build up momentum for a hit. You control the flying machine with your mouse. And whenever you hit anything with your weapon at high velocities/you hit the at the perfect time the game slows down time and gives you a massive movement speed and control boost, meaning you can do it over and over again given the right skill level.Now there are some problems with the combat as well, some pretty big, like the fact you can be stunned by your enemies, and 9 times out of 10 you will be outnumbered and out gunned, meaning you have to fight tooth and nail just to survive. I cannot count the number of times I have gotten stunned and then just died because of it. The sound design is also quite lackluster, as whenever a bomb goes off it feels like someone shoved a blaring smoke detector in my ear, and in the later levels of the arena, THERE ARE A LOT OF F***ING BOMBS.Oh yeah there is also a pretty cool story mode set in a steampunk arabian/middle east world. It's pretty cool. It evne has multiple endings depending on what you choose to do and who to fight.All in all, even though I do reccomend this game, it is only to someone who is ready and willing to get his♥♥♥♥♥handed to him several times before getting down the core mechanics. Then, and only then, are you going to really enjoy this game.Also, THE DPI CALIBRATION IS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BROKEN AND YOU SHOULD NOT TRUST IT. Set it about half or less than it says you should set it to, and then try and play. If that still doesn't work you can always change them in the main menu.			",145,12,0,23,20,0,13

												[The History of] Hammerfight is a game about combat using flying machines with maces, axes, guns, and other weapons attached.  The trick is, your movement imparts realistic momentum to your weapons.After his village is attacked, a young hunter is the sole survivor of his clan.  Taken into slavery in the gladiatorial arena, he must work his way up the ranks until he can exact revenge on those who killed his people.  The game plays out as a series of missions, each a fight sequence either against a set number of enemies or for a certain amount of time you must survive.  Arena mode is an ever-escalating sequence of fights that allow you to loot weapons and money from enemies that you can then use in the main story.Hammerfight can be played almost entirely with the mouse.  Spin it in a circle and you’ll fling your weapon around your machine.  Learning the correct timing on when to speed up and when to juke to deliver a crushing blow to an enemy is critical to your success.  Eventaully you gain access to a training hall full of weapons you can select from, each with their own style of play.  Swords are good against soft targets, and hammers crush armoured enemies.  Guns are a great multipurpose tool.  It is a unique and innovative control scheme that allows for a few different playstyles.The graphics are pretty cool, but often it becomes difficult to tell what is going on in the heat of battle.  With all the effects from explosions, bits of the destroyable environment flying around, and the multitude of attachments you can get on your machine, the entire screen is just a blur of wood and metal and flame.  Often your machine will get trapped in a corner, unable to move while you take constant damage from touching the walls or your enemy, but you can’t see where you are to try and escape.  The soundtrack is awesome, though.  Just listen to the battle theme in the trailer above and tell me you don’t want to fight someone.The story suffers from an over-abundance of Proper Nouns.  Events and characters are not described very well at all, and you will struggle to determine who each character is and how they relate.  Not that it really matters, you can just work your way through the game destroying anything that tries to kill you and you’ll win.  But the game wants you to take the story seriously and to invest in its narrative, yet it never gives you the chance to do so.  I still do not understand how to find gems to augment my weapons, or how that helps me, even though I stumbled upon three of them throughout the campaign.I have mixed feelings about this game.  On the one hand, the gameplay is innovative.  But the nonsensical story, wild difficulty spikes, and visuals that easily obscure the action make me say you should take a pass on Hammerfight.

												really hard and not in a fair way, but it's interesting to see a game where you're on equal footing as the AI, and different weapon type do actually do different things and are more useful against specific cases. it's also pretty long for a simple indie game, but the difficulty might be a big part of that. mouse sweeping should probably be more sensitive, have a large mouse pad or desk space or you'll probably feel useless.

You also aren't sure who is enemy. And camera is also bad, sometimes you disappear from screen, camera moves and you have no idea where your ship is. What this game is great at though, is interestig concept and physics. If other negative aspects I listed were eliminated, it could be fine game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hammerfight is a game that will make you scream in excitement and scream in frustration, often in the same play session.  Perhaps the most frustrating thing about Hammerfight is that it so bipolar: innovative and terrifically executed core mechanics make you want to play, then the significant frustratings and nagging issues make you want to stop playing, but then you get drawn back in by the core gameplay, and so on.  I'll recommend this game, but only to the buyer with substantial patience and forgiveness for a game that is in itself unforgiving.At it's core, Hammerfight is a 2d aerial combat game.  Battles are fought between flying machines with attached swinging weapons (hammers, swords, flails and the like).  Here's the thing: there is no ""swing weapon"" button (except for the throwable weapons that I don't use anyway because they're not nearly as fun).  You swing your weapon by moving your ship in such a way that the weapon swings around you (side note: in the options menu, crank up the mouse sensitivity unless you like moving like a snail) and connects with your opponents.The core combat fueled by this gameplay is exhilarating.  You have a massive variety of weapons to choose from, and while they are various takes on classic archetypes (e.g., sword, hammer, axe, etc.), they have a variety of nuances that give them distinct advantages and disadvantages.  Swords, for instance, require close-range flying and are repelled by armor, but carve up a flyer in no time on a direct hit.  Hammers and flails don't do as much hull damage, but can shatter armor and send enemies flying across the screen.  When you get the flying skill to start delivering massive hits, the results are extremely cathartic: the sounds of crumpling metal and splintering wood combined with the sight of your opponent hurtling into a wall and exploding rank among some of the most epic moments in any game I've played, let alone a 2-d one.But underneath this overwhelmingly successful core is a wealth of nagging frustrations.  The UI is abysmal, often blocking your view of fighters that are well within striking distance.  Enemies and allies alike - especially in higher levels of play - have a tendency to pepper you with ranged weapon fire that, even if it fails to hit you, still blinds you (white screen) and produces an extremely annoying high-pitched noise (if you have tinnitus, you know).But above all: the game is loaded with unexpected and seemingly unfair deaths.  You will die a lot in this game, and while many times this is because of poor piloting, on numerous occasions you are killed from full health for seemingly no reason at all.  As best as I can tell, the game's physics are such that sometimes a thrown weapon or environmental object can get ""jammed up"" in your ship's weapons, which results in it constantly hitting you.  In arena, some enemies explode when you kill them, often times killing you from full health.  I get that this is an intentional mechanic (suicide bombers), but in a game that's supposed to be about shattering impacts, punishing a player for attempting to deliver such an impact is unbelievably backward.  I have died many times in this game, and probably <1% of my deaths is from actually getting hit by an enemy's weapon; almost all of them are from random explosions, a single thrown weapon or environmental object, or unidentifiable cause.I love this game, and I hate this game, and I can't stand how its bipolarity keeps me conflicted.  I play it because I love the gameplay, and while it's fun I will inevitably stop playing it out of frustration later.  I recommend this game with *extreme* caution; if you have the patience for the game's unforgiving, and at times seemingly unfair, nature, it'll be a lot of fun for you, especially at its price tag.

												A fun game ive played for quite some time outside of steam. Dont get me wrong, it has its faults. A fairly considerable number of them, But even knowing that id still reccomend it. It you think this game was good, but couldve been better implemented, theres a flash game based off of it called Arcanorum that was also good.			",124,19,0,13,8,1,8

												A game about flying machines propelled by a single engine that produces a sound which's calming effect is yet to be beaten by any of sounds of the nature.Story starts right off the bat with, what seems like, no tutorial at all. You're ordered to pick up your sharp-swingy toys and go kill some flying worms.Aforementioned situation lasts for several short levels and frankly gets boring quickly, fortunately the moment the player starts wondering if there's more to Hammerfight than vermin that define the rules of gravity it happens - the game starts for real and you get to confront airborne machines that resemble yours.It's worth lasting those few bug infested levels so you can enjoy the rest of this beautifully crafted and unforgiving title.Hammerfight already has a respectable amount of years under its belt yet it manages to age gracefully due to its specific, rich in detail, graphic style.Controls are fully mouse based, both movement and weapon attacks are executed by performing circular, rhytmic mouse movements so it is vital that you have a perfect feel on them translating to in-game responses - start your adventure with this game by tinkering a bit with mouse sensititivy setting in the in-game menu and you should have loads of fun between dying by getting smashed with a rock on a chain or getting bitten right in the engine by an angry flying bug thingy.Final aspect worth mentioning is that Hammerfight is a strongly physics based game, weight of weapons and defense modules affects both your speed and the way they feel and interact with enemy machines. Blows or slashes dealt to foes are sensationally gratifying which combined with possibility of mounting two different weapons at the same time make you just want to see if it is possible to gracefully stab an opponent while trying to follow with more traditionall approach - smashing him with a boulder on a chain.

												Yes, the core game mechanic is fairly novel: you swing around a mace, via the mouse, to smash enemies. I would accept the inherent difficulty in moving and attacking being one in the same, because its fun as hell. But even if the controls were not bug-free (which they aren't - you can often try to attack and find yourself moving erratically to the other side of the screen instead), there are too many problems. The HUD is too large. Between the ""health"" indicator in the lower left corner, and the huge circle in the center top, which seems to be just for your mentors to shout at you, easily 33% of the screen is wasted. Combining the buggy controls with the stupidly large HUD, it's easy to completely lose track of where you are.And here's one more thing. The camera doesn't center on your character. It's possible for you to veer entirely off screen, and combined with the HUD and the control issues, you're completely screwed. This isn't difficultly stemming from a game mechanic. This is just poor design. Centering the damn camera would make this game completely different, and 3 times better.			",109,26,0,11,9,0,8

												The game controls has serious issues. The flying machine is virtually impossible to control, either not going in the direction I'm trying to move it or not flaying the hammer, so I either stand still when I want to move, doing nothing usefull at all, or my hammer moves like a limb fish.If these issues are sorted the game looks promising.

												Not a really good game. The controlls are very bad. Controlling that machine is much harder than you can expect with your mouse only. Using mouse only was a terrible idea! Because of that the gamplay is bad too. You can die very easily and fastly, and you can not do anything against it. Controlls are killing the game. If the controlls are good, the game would be good too, I think.			",1133,252,58,104,140,14,230

												Every review I have read thus far on this game has said something to the effect that this is the worst game in existence. I for one find it addictive and fun. I keep coming back to play during other game downloads. I thought it was kind of stinky at first until I realized that my mouse speed was turned way up in game which translates to HIGH DPI AKA A SLOW MOUSE SPEED. To get the most of this game SET YOUR MOUSE SPEED LOW TO GET THE MOST MOMENTUM. Once you get guns on your steampunk copter killing machine the game starts to open up and you are forced to pay attention to when your gaining weapon momentum and where your gun is pointed to fire massive damage at impossible foes.  You will get frustated and you will think of quiting once or twice but it's all reminiscent of the old NES and SEGA games that I've grown up on, it's definitely not as frustrating as playing Atari. I give this game an A for visual fidelity, A for difficulty, B for controls explanation, A+ for unique experience. I think of this game as the GoldenAxe of this age.			",30,2,2,2,2,0,0

												Every bit as viscerally enjoyable as actually smashing something with a hammer. Seriously, it's a pitiful failure of the indie gaming market that this studio was unable to release a sequel. PvP would be unrivaled. The sinuous grace necessary to properly carve an opponent to ribbons with a sword is equaled by the brutal instincts needed to feel exactly when to commit the momentum of a hammer swing. The meeting and subsequent contest between the two could only be called glory. Buy this game, tweak the mouse settings till it feels right, and enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The biggest issue I had with this game were the controls. That the mouse is both the momentum generation and movement controls was a neat idea, but just doesn't work. Half the time any swinging momentum I generated to hit the opponet was wasted as I would instead run into the enemy myself. The other half I would simply miss and catch their weapon with my face.If I could control movement with my keyboard, then I would have probably had more fun. Also the idea of local co-op seems a little absurd. I was covering half my desk moving the mouse around, trying to keep the momentum going and aiming it. Up to 4 people going head to head sounds like it will take place more in the real world than the game as players slam their mouses into each other. The design aesthic and story seem nice, but they aren't enought to hold a game that is in dire need of a controls rework.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm playing this on a laptop with a trackpad, so I think that might be making things a touch easier for me (for once) but this game is still hard.  You spin your mouse in a circle to get a ball/hammer/rock/sword/whathaveyou spinning around your dinky little flying craft, and then you hope to god you lined it up with the nasty little monsters flying at you.  Be warned, you probably didn't and you're going to have to watch that cutscene yet again.I'm not sure I'd grab it for $9.99.  Maybe see if they put it on sale, then grab it.  Because it's a heck of a time waster, but it is still filler between more filling indie games.			",276,85,4,51,43,1,38

The game is centered around physics-based melee combat of steampunk flying machines, in other words, swinging the weapons by only controlling the machine itself. Swinging the weapon, while also dodging at the same time turns the fight into an incredible dance, fluid and graceful. The amazing setting, crisp visuals and above all, the unconventional gameplay makes this a one of a kind experience not to be missed.			",344,105,4,28,13,2,74

												I love smashing things in this game. Specially enemies. Or giant worms. Or unmanned machines of evil. Or just bricks, really.It's a blast, an interesting concept for fighting games with many, many weapons that can be used. Swords, axes, hammers, a boulder bound by a chain, guns, and blends of those.The main campaign is sadly short, but it's worth it. Besides there are a few minigames, including one where you can fight indefinetely against enemies, which kind of compensates for it.Although I already beat all endings I still play it casually because... hammerfighting feels great.

												Only controls are mouse, and yet still they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t since there is no response. Cutscenes for every mission even when you die you must rewatch. ♥♥♥♥ing Talking everywhere, a story line thats ♥♥♥♥ed up with stupid names making it too much too even bother with. Just no fun, with the lack of control response its just utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to play. My DPI was maxed out, on windows, on the mouse itself and in-game even then it just didn't go. Also everytime you kill an enemy it does this cinema cam thing. But the game is still going, so you slowly watch one of the thousands of enemies fall as you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",168,28,5,8,16,0,14

												Surprised not to see more positive reviews of this game. It's quite good, with a unique physics based combat system, as well as nice art design and an interesting world. Other reviews do point out the lack of responsiveness in the controls, leaving them feeling sluggish. While this definitely feels intentionally designed, it can be mitigated very effectively if you adjust the mouse DPI slider to a lower number. The mouse DPI slider is basically a difficulty option, where the higher you go, the slower the controls become. Use it if you're really having that much of an issue with the game's controls. Also, don't be fooled by the first few levels. There's a much larger amount of customization and weapons once you unlock The Hall. Plus, the main story is only one part of the game, with two extra modes for each style of combat the game offers. This expands the game's life for quite a while after the main story ends. Overall, 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hammerfight is surprisingly fun and if the creator was a much better programmer it would have been an instant indie classic. While this might not be the full version, the steam version is incomplete, it is worth the price.Tip: Since you likely won't read this longer... If you play this turn up the mouse sensitivity in the games options. The game SERIOUSLY overestimates the power of your mouse.In Hammerfight you play a flying machine with a flail, sword, or hammer attached that you can swing wildly. The gameplay at first is quite hectic but soon you get the hang of things and will be able to fight with the best of them, expect to stink a lot at first, it will be 2 hours before things click and until then you will feel like this game is unfairly challenging you. After this period the game is all about timing and finding your opening, and when you strike the enemies FEEL it, your weapons have actual weight and not only do they affect how you fly, heavy weapons do affect how you fly and when an enemy gets struck by one expect them to fly right into the wall with a satisfying SPLAT! You can even strategically attack the opponent's weapons to stop their momentum or even destroy them.The game isn't without its flaws. There is no Newgame+ so as soon as you beat the game it is OVER and you need to start a new game... There is no way to grind crystals, they enhance weapons, in this game (only in the full version) so whatever you end up with is all you get. The game feels short and you can easily finish it in one afternoon... Enemies in the Arena have a large tendency to just blow up to kill you or use a ""blow up the entire stage"" attack, making the high-level Arena feel cheap rather than fun. As well there are a few game ending bugs in the game. Multiplayer would have elevated this game to instant greatness, but there is none.All in all Hammerfight is a very fun game that is short but ooooooh so satisfying. This game could have been a great game worthy to be one of the greatest indie games of all time, but it falls short and becomes instead simply a very good game worthy of anyone's cash. If this is on sale BUY IT! there really is no excuse.			",111,39,0,40,16,0,29

												good concept, poorly executed, as soon as you start it up it is confusing, the mouse calibration system is awful don't use it manually calibrating it will yield better results as the calibration system sets the sensitivity way too low for the game to be playable. the main problem with the game is that there is absolutely no obvious instructions the game just expects you to know how to play it which is incredibly unhelpful as you only get one trial fight before you start for real, the combat system is poor as brushing anything will instantly wipe out 20% of your health, the story need not be there as it too is confusing and makes little sense. the concept is a great idea and could be really fun and worth paying for but because it is so cheaply put together (everything just feels rushed and desperately bolted together) and unhelpful, it is not worth buying in it's current state			",11,2,0,5,2,1,7

												This game is a one-shot stroke of *utter genius*.This is the most fun I've ever had swinging large hunks of metal around arabic steampunk gyro-copters.  If you have a few hours on your hands, give it a whirl.Pros:- so much detail!- so much attention to beautiful, beautiful detail!- destructible scenery and opponent armor, little chunks of things flying all over the place- multiple possible endings and story branchings, with multiple profiles available so you can try them all- very thickly developed background story (makes more sense each playthrough)- challenging levels and opponents- the creator really plays around with the various things possible by swinging around large swords, hammers, and chunks of iron- local multiplayer if playing on a 32-bit operating system and in possession of multiple mice (not sure what the limit is, but it's more than 2, that's for sure)Cons:- LACKS Tribal Wars game mode, as the game is presently (as of writing this review) v1.004, rather than v1.005 or later, which is really sad (Humbe Bundle (3?) version of the game includes it)- could do with even more game modes, like the minigame competition levels in the middle of the Solo story- not a lot of explanation of the rules behind gaining/losing weapons, finding/applying gemstones- occasionally bugs out at level start or end (sometimes, waiting a little while is all you need, though)- no sequel, NO SEQUEL, WHY IS THE NAME OF FLYING RUSTIC MECHAMINDS IS THERE NO SEQUEL!!?!??!!???

												This game is like Dark Souls but as a 2D, physics based, melee, helicopter game... It's rage-inducing like nothing you've ever played but far more satisfying when you win because of it. Also it's hard to beat the feeling of using a heavy flail and nailing an armored enemy so hard that it shatters their steel shields and sends them flying into a spiked wall where they burst into flames and shrapnel.The victory screens will be few and far between for the first while and you'll probably break a mouse or two before you beat the first sophit you fight but if you're hard headed enough to stick with it you're in for a treat.

												I love this game, it sometimes made me rage and want to throw the computer out the window... well.. Mostly x _ x But it's a   very interesting and fun game to play if You don't have too much time on your hands. I found that the mouse was sometimes a tick too slow, but turning up the sensitivity helped that, since the machines movement is influenced by mouse sensitivity. I found it a lot easier to play with the highest possible sensitivity. The weapons are awesome, though I wished that when You lost a weapon with gems, there was some way to get it back and I wished there had been more weapons or weapon types. A spear of glaive would have been amazing and more types of gems. Also.. Bombs are really damn overpowered when you already have 3 other enemies on you and especially since the enemies can't hurt each other, even if the bombs explode right in their face. I found that to be a huge bother since enemies could just freely throw bombs in your face without having to think of their teammates. Also it was very frustrating to be thrown into a wall  and instantly dying without being able to do the same with the enemy. Though the enemies are not too difficult to beat most of the time, when you have 3 people spamming explosives of different kinds, it becomes very hard to win (arena)I also very much enjoyed the different game modes, except for I believe it's called hammer ball, where you have to score goals. This one was highly unfair in my opinion and I never found myself enjoying it. Nonetheless an amazing game with interesting and unusual gameplay.			",30,1,1,3,2,0,3

You need super High DPI settings on your mouse and basically a you tube tutorial for every type of weapon you have. Or you like it enough to find out yourself.Hitting enemies with a heavy flail, smashing them into walls that break and tumble down is one of the most satisfying experiences in gaming history.

												Surprised not to see more positive reviews of this game. It's quite good, with a unique physics based combat system, as well as nice art design and an interesting world. Other reviews do point out the lack of responsiveness in the controls, leaving them feeling sluggish. While this definitely feels intentionally designed, it can be mitigated very effectively if you adjust the mouse DPI slider to a lower number. The mouse DPI slider is basically a difficulty option, where the higher you go, the slower the controls become. Use it if you're really having that much of an issue with the game's controls. Also, don't be fooled by the first few levels. There's a much larger amount of customization and weapons once you unlock The Hall. Plus, the main story is only one part of the game, with two extra modes for each style of combat the game offers. This expands the game's life for quite a while after the main story ends. Overall, 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely steep difficulty cuve (actually more like mile-high glass wall coated with soap), but when you get through that BS this game is an extremely fun and unique, with a nice middle eastern steampunk atmosphere. I'd recommend it if you are okay with raging a while, only to be able to enjoy a great game later. Also, this concept has so much unused potential that we will sadly never see because this game is so obscure and underrated.7.5/10 No reason not to try it if you have the money.			",72,11,0,8,5,0,24

												A fantastical whirley-gig adventure!  Pilot a... helicopter(?) as it flies through the massive void in a series of mission.  Compete if gladitorial combat.  Branching storyline results in several very different endings.  A variety of weapons and guns to choose from.  Physics are very important.10/10			",74,26,1,32,12,0,25

												I like the game alot, its kept my busy when I need to play something offline such as when i want a steam game to download faster. The game can tend to be pretty buggy at times, but nothing to make the game seem broken or something just weird fun bugs such as when I atacked an enemy (and I play this game with very high sensitivity to make the swings alot more responsive and hit ALOT more harder) it made me go into the slo-mo reflex mode and I created a implosion with my hit and the physics freaked out making the opponent and me fly across the map hitting the walls then quickly get pulled back towards eachother (rare glitch but hilarious). I don't know game has alot of potential with quite a bit of choices of weapons, such as maces, axes, swords, and even cannon(s? I say it with a question cause I see some guns I've yet to obtain) making it have a nice uniqe fell to how you like to play. My only gripe is to how short the game is, sure its just a indie game still would be nice to have more story to it to say the least. Other than that its a nice, unique experience for those who wish to play a game with flying machines that use physics to swing swords and s*** around to kill eachother, its a verry fun game and as for a rating i'd say...8/10			",133,9,0,21,6,0,5
