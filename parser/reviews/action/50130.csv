												I am blown away.I had this game for a long time in my library, I loved Mafia 1, everyone told me Mafia 2 is not as good, I did not get it.Some years later I get it as steam gift, ignored it a long time, tried it now and I am totally shocked how good this game is.It starts good, it gets better and it stays so until the very end.You just do the main story (14 hours for me), drive around in your stolen cars and are all the time looking the wonderful graphics and listen to the songs from the radio. From time to time you get into fistfights which are fun too.And then the firefights, they are... you knew it? fun too! :)You can really use cover, shoot from cover, use pistols, colts, sub machine guns or a shot gun. Grenades and the like exist too but I did not really use them a lot. I LOVE my shot gun.So what is there in the game:- story: very good- graphics: very good- sound: very good- fist fights: good- gun fights: very good- driving: goodAnd if that is really not enough for you: there are playboy magzines to find which each show one picture. This alone is a reason to get the game. Ok, not really, but I like it nevertheless :)I really think that most older gamers who did ever enjoy a shooter will enjoy this game too.Now I am waiting for a special on steam to get the DLCs:- ""Jimmy's Vendetta"" and - ""Joe's Adventure"" which tell stories and seem to allow free roaming.I have to repeat, I was blown away by this game, I did not expect such an old game to be that good.update: I do not like the DLCs, don't waste your money for the DLCs. But get the main game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This review is based on a purely vanilla playthrough.+ While the graphics are nothing special, they seem to have aged well+ Top-shelf voice acting for the entire cast+ Getting in trouble with the police is much more interactive than many other products of this genre, allowing you to pay fines, bribe officers, or attempt resistance on-site+ Fist-fighting mechanics are cinematic, intuitive and entertaining+ There is a speed-limiter key for toggling ""safe driving mode;"" a massive quality-of-life feature that every free-roam game should have+ Game boasts very competent storytelling, with an even pace and solid character development+ Has a great cliffhanger ending; seeing the story through to the end felt worth it+ Every aspect of the aesthetics, from the clothes, to the vehicles and music, is period-appropriate and has a pervading feeling of authenticity+ Vehicle handling feels realistic and smooth+ Stock, reliabe cover system and shooting mechanics; nothing you haven't seen before, but the devs seemed to have settled with the 'less is more' approach, and it complemented the gameplay nicely+ Engine optimization is excellent+ While the explorable area is more of a medium size compared to competitors, there is still much to explore throughout the game world, and it feels appropriately sized for a small city+ Active modding community, and the game itself is easy to alter+ Some minimalist stealth mechanics that are well-implemented, though it isn't often revisited- Many crashes; I've heard that this game has problems with AMD cards, though, so NVIDIA users may not have these issues- Poor weapon selection (only about 7-8 usable firearms)- No side missions, and little in the way of collectibles or extra content (though I cannot speak to the DLC); little replayability- NPCs feel flat and generic, doing little to liven up the atmosphere of the city- Lack of post-campaign free-roam (though a simple mod can fix this if you don't mind the small hassle)LockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												Mafia 2 places you in the shoes of Vito Scaletta a boy who's parents emigrated to the USA - specifically the fictional city of Empire Bay (fashioned after NYC) - from Sicily. Think of Mafia 2 as the best of your favorite gangster movies only much longer and with you in control of the action and you'll get an idea of what the game is really like.Gameplay is reminiscent of GTA only without the auto-targeting aspect. At its core Mafia 2 is a 3rd person over the shoulder shooter.The game takes place in 1940's - 1950's America so expect period guns (M1945, Tommy Gun's, shotguns); vehicles (not actual licensed cars but closely based on period autos); and clothing. The driving mechanics in Mafia 2 in my opinion are a vast improvement over the on-ice feel that the vehicles in GTA IV featured. Driving insane speeds is possible but expect a quick death if you crash (on hard difficulty anyway).Unlike other open-world or sandbox games, the focus of Mafia 2 is the main story. Admittedly Mafia 2 is short on sidequests and minigames. This is generally a problem if you go in expecting a GTA clone. Mafia 2 is most definitely not that. Personally I found the focus on the story refreshing. Instead of distractions like pizza delivery missions or other time wasters, Mafia 2 is about story driven events that include everything from jewelry store heists to covert missions planting explosives to assassinate a rival family member.While Mafia 2 doesn't feature any type of online gameplay there are plenty of collectibles in-game including Playboy centerfold magazines (complete with nudity) and wanted posters to keep you occupied. I highly recommend this title!			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

												One of my favorite games, The story line is amazing, I can't stop playing this over and over.Graphics - Especially for a 2010 game, the graphics are amazing, you can get some really amazing scenery in this, Not quite on the level of Skyrim, But looking over the map is very nice to do :)Gameplay - The gameplay is very easy to get used to, from stealth missions to full out combat, this game gives you some brilliant gunfights, robberies, boss missions and car chases. The police evasion is a very tedius, but over all more fun method, Unlike games like GTA where, you loose the police and you can then drive past them with a car thats smashed up, covered in blood with bullet holes in it and they won't beat an eye, this game requires you to get your car fixed up, new plates added, and a change of clothes to get the police to not suspect anything next time they see you.Controls - The controls are very nicely done, as far as combat is concerned, the aiming, the slow motion, everything is brilliant. As for driving, They have gone for realism with it, Some people might like it, I wasn't really a fan of it, it takes a bit of time to get used to meaning I spent most of the beginning of the game crashing into things and getting shot up in no time, but with a bit of practice you become a good driver in no time, But then again, its realistic, its how cars where back then. Story - One of my favorite stories of all time, I can't really describe it, but you will have to play it to find out. Its a whole story of betrayal, emotion, sadness but at the same time, partying, trust, money. The story is a crazy mix of family life and gang life. The best way to describe it, is sort of on par with Breaking bad. A hardworking man taking up illegal tasks to help support his family. I can't actually believe I got this game for free by voting in a contest, The fact that it was a free giveaway made me think quite poorly of this game and it took me a while to get round to playing it, and that was a big regret. This is by far one of my favorite games.			",389,103,10,54,40,1,52

Overall Opinion: For those that prefer story over everything else, Mafia 2 is pretty much the perfect game for you and is worth every cent. And if you're not invested in that story, Mafia 2 is still a good game, but probably only worth $20 or so. Number Rating: 8.5/10Mafia 2 is arguably the most underrated game of the last generation. And honestly, I can't blame people for saying that. I had never heard of the game until the 2K Humble Bundle...yeah. Before you even think about getting or playing Mafia 2, you need to know, THIS IS NOT A GTA CLONE. This game is ALL about the story, is extremely grounded, and the world is mostly just there for looks while you go from objective to objective. If you go into Mafia 2 expecting GTA in the 40's and 50's, you'll be disappointed.PC Port: Meh. FoV is too close indoors, but you're not indoors for that long so it's not a big deal. Also the game's AA solution is really strange, and only applies to some objects it seems. I have no idea what it uses because all it says is ""On"" and ""Off"". And for some reason the game uses what appears to be DoF when you start driving really fast, but the DoF messes up so much that it can really chug on the frame rate at times. The BIG issue with the port, is that it appears to have a memory leak issue, and after long sessions with the game, it can get really annoying. Physx will just stop working after a few hours of playing, but comes back when you restart the game, and it starts to drop in FPS REALLY badly in cut scenes after a few hours of playing. It's too bad this was never patched, because the game looks great, easily one of the best looking games from 2010. It also runs good for the most part, and stays around 60fps most of the time on my 660 and i5 rig. Come on 2K, I know it's been 4 years, but patch that crap! For now, I recommend just restarting the game after each chapter if you REALLY need those Physx effects (and they do look pretty good, I have to say). Visuals: Like I said, looks really good for a 4 year old game. I actually found myself just stopping the car for a moment and looking at ""Empire Bay"" in the middle of the night during winter. It really does look that good. Now, yes the textures haven't aged well, some of the fatter characters with round faces look really odd due to the sharp edges, and the DoF will sometimes mess up and ruin a scene (although it only happened once for me). At the end of the day though, it's a really good looking game. Story: The selling point of this game. All you need to know about the story is that:It's well actedHas a fantastic soundtrack with itHas a polarizing ending, I loved it thoughGameplay: Sadly, this is the part that gets thrown under the rug for the story. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay works fine and is fun, but the depth just isn't there. The shootouts are great fun, and the environments they happen in are pretty destructible, which forces you to change strategies in a moments notice. Plus the AI is challenging (I got my butt handed to me a few times on the medium difficulty). The boxing matches are really cinematic and fun, the stealth works fine, and driving is shockingly realistic. However, all of this lacks depth. You have a pistol, shotgun, grenade,Tommy, SMG, and that's about it. Yes, these guns have different ""versions"" of them, but they're barely notable, the revolver feels identical to the M1911, each takes 3 shots to the body to kill, or one to the head. Fighting is limited to a light punch, heavy punch, and dodge. And, once your enemy becomes ""stunned"" you have a little QTE finisher, that's it. No knives, bats, or anything to give it variety. The stealth is bare bones: crouch, stick to cover, don't get noticed, and hit ""q"" behind someone to watch Vito knock out someone. The driving is pretty much the only area that this game shines at in terms of gameplay. You actually have to follow the speed limit, Vito will die on impact if you get into a car crash too hard (no going through wind shields and getting up just fine in this game), watch for red lights, etc... It's actually quite impressive how detailed the driving mechanics are. Sadly the cop AI is pretty inconsistent, I've crashed into cops before at 60MPH, and the cops did nothing, and I've also barely tapped a cop car and gotten arrested for it... Setting: ""Empire Bay is a fictional city on the East Coast of the United States of America, based on a combination of New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Detroit with elements from other US cities during the '40s and '50s..."" - Mafia 2 wikiThat pretty much sums it up. I did feel LA Noire nailed the ""Post WW2"" era USA better, but this game does a pretty solid job, with 3 radio stations filled with 50's and 40's classics.  Music: Normally, I don't give music its own category in my reviews, so that should say something about how amazing this game's soundtrack is. The first thing I thought when I booted up this game was ""Holy crap, if the game is as good as this theme...this is going to a fantastic game."" Seriously, even if you have no intention of playing this game, just do yourself a favor and listen to the soundtrack:

												If you're looking for a free-roaming game like Grand Theft Auto, fuhgeddaboutit. Mafia 2 has an open world, stores to shop at or rob, a police system, and many other things you'd expect from that sort of game, but like Mafia 1, the game is a lot more structured, and instead of having much in terms of side content it plays out like a traditional game campaign, with little time for free roaming. But the game's world is still well-designed, even if it's mostly pretty window dressing, and it makes the campaign feel more alive than it would if it was just a corridor shooter. It's not an amazing game, but it is a unique one. Mafia 2 is the kind of game where the police are actually police, and even though they'll probably never catch you they'll still try to ticket you for breaking the speed limit. It's the kind of game that isn't afraid to be a little tedious to give a sense of contrast between a ""normal life"" and the mafia life, like an early level that has you packing crates into the back of a truck to test your patience until you give up and leave. The developers do a good job at recreating the time period, and the cars, radio, and weapons all handle and sound pretty nice. The story and gunplay are both pretty well-done, and overall if you're a fan of mafia stories like The Godfather than Mafia 2 is worth a shot, as long as you don't go in expecting a true open world game.

""I BECAME A CRIMINAL BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO BECOME A VICTIM""Welcome to Empire Bay. Sunny place full of opportunities for those who can take them. Yes, I'm talking to you Vito & Joe. Yes, you too Mr. Vinci. I see you over there Alberto Clemente. Yeah, that's right Carlo Falcone. I can keep on naming these fellas over and over again because this game was filled with gentlemen like these.Vito Scalleta got tired of bureaucratic bullsh*t so he got shot right in the butt, that he could leave Europe and go straight back to Joe, so these two can put in the work, get up in the Mafia hierarchy, sky rocketing up in the mob family ladder so he can get what they all want - THAT GREEN THING.Mafia II was released almost 7 years ago and if at least 5 out of 10 people still not playing this in 2016 they're not even in discussion. I'll be absolutely honest with you. During the release of this game I did not have my own computer and my own internet connection, so after school I went to some friends who was already playing that so I could watch them. Yes bros, I'm talking about 2010 not 2000 when one friend in the village had computer and just got brand new DOOM or QUAKE and 20 people was around the computer watching that masterpiece. S/O to you id Software.This game can offer you 12 unbelievable awesome chapters, full of great acting, cutscenes, twists, story elements and saga about one boy from Sicily who wanted to be better than his drunk hard-working dad. When he drop out of the boat as a kid and saw Mafia member for first time, he knew that he will be like that one day. I like the way the story is, so it is not fast jumping into the family, and he actually have to prove himself before going in.Some of you may say that because the game was short like that, it was not good move. But me personally, I feel like it was better as they could reflect on the fact that life of Mafioso is really short. Let me say that back then we did not know Vito will be in Mafia 3 so the statement above is still correct.Empire Bay is truly beautiful, big and full of nice spots. Various clothing, weapons, CARS, the options of the customizations, or just cruising around the city is experience. I have to admit, one evening I've found myself wandering through city on eet for good 40 minutes. That might tell you how it is.On the other hand, is it true, that from option spectre, Empire Bay doesn't have much to offer. Places where to go, and things to do are very limited and for some people the ""free ride"" gets repetetive very very soon.Soundtrack and music throughout the whole game is very-well choosen, from the main theme to every one out of 130 songs available in the game. Collab with Prague FILMharmonic Orchestra was great idea. That was awesome move by 2k. DLC - I'm not going to step inside this that much but for me, only one DLC is really worth and I guess you already know what it is - Joe's Adventure. This one will add additional 5-7 hours depends how you play it and will show you years when Vito was away. Both The Betrayal of Jimmy and Jimmy's Vendetta is not worh, only if you want 100% achievements, get TBoJ. From the small packages it is all based on your taste and what cars you like. For me it was Vegas Pack.Getting achievements was fun, collecting Playboy magazines was fun and so was and still is the whole game. Czech dabing was unbelievable awesome and the English one wasn't bad at all! If it is still worth 30€ today is optional, and you may or may not hesitate that, but if you can scoop it during sale for estimated 7,50€ definitely grab it and you can also get some DLC with it and it will be all positive vibes.Bonus Point: Daniel Vavra involvedRating: 9/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												The story is ritch, the voice acting superb.Driving is fun once you get the hang of it.The action (shooting/fistfighting) is ok.What makes this game so good is the mix of all these things and the setting of the game in the 40's/50's.It's a good movie and a good game in one. Reminded me of one of my favourite games, 'Sleeping Dogs'. The game can be unforgiving at times and you'll have to play a chapter from the beginning when you die. But that's ok with this game, never a dull moment and practice makes perfect.The DLC's for this game are great by the way. More hours of Mafia fun after you've finished the main game. The DLC's have their own achievements to hunt for Steam.			",154,29,4,35,16,1,28

Very less activitie's, can't go nor swim in water.- Hand do hand combat is just nothing special just your generic dodge and punch. dodge and punch. Just rinse and repeat. Could use many touchup's.Mostly your generic third-person shooter but with a good cover system and solid gun's and okay for the driving part. While hand to hand combat is dissapointing and can use many touch up's. Graphics + Very well for it's time on high they look amazing.+ Even on ultra low still great+ Texture's well done while could use a touch up but fully fine.+ Nice lens flare.+ Great and simple working animation's.A well done job for the part, Fully fine. And of course we have now game's with more better graphic's take crysis 3 or witcher 3 but alright this was before that okay and again like i said nothing spectacular but very well done and fine job here.Design+ A very well touch of the 19's.+ Well designed city and map.+ Simple,clean menu.- Not many building interiois thus not much building's in which you can go in.- Not fully open-world. Very very few activitie's thus leading to only a feel of open-worldish.Well done for the part. Suit's the theme of 19's and plus some okay map design. While not fully open-world. A.i+ Well the driving A.i is well done.+ Enemy A.i fine for the part.Do take cover here and there.- Police A.i can get a bit unfair many time's.They only target you even if your friend joe did something he just get's away easily.- Team mate's A.i could use alot of work. While responsive but mostly all the time you have to kill everyone.- Can get buggy at time's.While most of the A.i is fine done but could use many touchup's.Sounds(plus OST)+ Crisp sound's for all car's,gun's and all.+ Radio is nicely done. Many old good song's+ Great Ost (soundtrack), Well done and matching to the story.- Only 3 radio station's.A fine done part with all sound's and same for the ost but few radio stations. Conclusion A game mainly story focused with some open-world element's thus i would prefer the word open-worldish. While fine for the gameplay and A.i part but can use many touchup's,nice texture's and graphic's but with no side queste's and very few activitie's,Fully reccomended if you are looking for a good story focused game with some open world element's and a nice value for the money.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator ",167,22,8,12,13,2,29

												Mafia II, ha?Is it GTA 4? - no. Did I enjoy it? - yes.  Is it open world? - yes & no. Due to the story-driven progression your experience is limited and all the cut scenes and missions prevent you from doing as you like. As there are no real side missions the game isn't heading to do that and even though if you take your time and avoid ""triggering"" the next mission / day, you will return soon to go on.If you accept these limitations and don't expect the GTA-features (it is too linear for that), though Mafia II has GTA-like elements you will have a good time playing. Moreover, you should be interested in the story that unfolds - at least I've enjoyed the cutscenes (even though there were loads of them) but otherwise you won't find much to what you're actually doing here.What would be a great addition which is missing here, is some sort of free mode where you can do as you please. So there is little replay-value if you are not aiming for the story or hunting achievements.What are the gems of this game?- Story - Voice acting - Music - Atmosphere & Details (40s, 50s nostalgic)As I am a sucker of that time I can recommend getting this game, gameplay is solid as well. The map is just big enough to suit the purpose. (Note: True PC-gamers will be a bit disappointed as it feels like a console game BUT a great one, the PC-port is well donein my opinion.)> Thumbs upEDIT: I discovered that there are DLCs for Eastern Europe that aren't even available or listed on steam. I don't get why the full Mafia II experience isn't being delivered in the Extended Edition - Thumbs down			",530,149,8,67,39,3,54
