												Return to Castle Wolfenstien has been my favorite game every since I found my dad playing it when I was little. I would sit on his lap and watch him play. I've mastered this game and played custom maps or mods I even played with HD textures. This game has been my one time favorite I used to own it on disk or downloaded I geuss until one day I got this game on steam and now I have played it for a very long time. So I'd recommend you try this game out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Powered by id's Quake 3 technology and released in 2001, Gray Matter's Return to Castle Wolfenstein features a tremendous campaign spanning over 25 levels across numerous missions.  Soaking rich in atmosphere and modded to support current widescreen resolutions, the campaign is an excellent precursor to 2014's Wolfenstein A New Order.   Despite it's age the game plays perfectly.  Combat at times is brutal and difficult.  The AI is a great challenge and surpasses many a modern title.  Weapons are inventive and feature what be may be the most well implemented chain gun ever to grace a video game.   The game falls far short of New Order's stealth mechanics but the combat is so over the top satisfying that I doubt anyone would notice.Gray Matter Interactive developed Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  The studio was acquired by Activision in 2002 and later merged into Treyarch of Call of Duty fame.Return to Castle Wolfenstein; a true classic, a phenomenal FPS that has aged well and plays well on modern systems.

												Fast, bloody, and bloody brilliant. RtCW is a fantastic blend of fast-paced shooter action, stealth and exploration. Levels are huge and offer many secrets and the occasional puzzle, enemies are tough and fairly intelligent and come in many varieties. I could go on, but really if you like your classic fast paced FPS action games like Doom or Duke Nukem but also appeciate a bit of stealth then you should really take a look at this.

												One of the best multiplayer games of the early 2000s. If you want the multiplayer, there is still an active community of players playing Enemy Territory, which was going to be a full release, but was scrapped and released to the public as a stand alone free multiplayer game. No free to play mechanics, just solid multiplayer action. The single player can be great, but I probably wear nostalgic eyes, as I bought and played this game when it first came out in Nov 2001.

												One of the most fun FPS I have played set in WW2! Yes the graphics are not that great, but what matters is the plot and gameplay. It also has secrets on every level that you can search for that are not a part of the plot. If your interested in The Return to Wolfenstein series get this one before the new one comes out later this year. Put it this way, The Return to Castle Wolfenstein series is right up there with the Doom series in terms of innovative FPS gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mein leben!Return To Castle Wolfenstein is a first-person shooter reboot of the Wolfenstein series which much like its predecessor focuses on fast-paced gunplay with a number of improvements made to compensate for the new engine technologies available at the time. Firstly, unlike Wolfenstein 3D, the developers actually tried to implement a compelling story to a franchise known for not actually having a “story”. To some degree, the story in this game, at least from a concept point of view, brings something new to the table by adding elements of occult. The plot revolves around the American soldier, B.J. Blazkowicz, trying to impede the Nazis from discovering and extracting a serum hidden in an ancient tomb capable of augmenting soldiers into “Dark Knights”, an evil undead army from the 9th Century. Nazis and occult? Absurd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but what’s not to like. However, while the concept does enhance the single-player campaign, the story itself is mostly ignorable since it generally feels like it is there to fill in the space. Blazkowicz, while a total badass, still remains one of the blandest protagonists in existence. He takes orders from his superiors like a puppet with no remorse or personal motives. Even when the Allies want to give him a medal for his efforts and persumably a well deserved break at the end, he is somewhere outside still kicking Nazi butt. Boy, he sure is souless; born with only one scope in life: to kill Nazis for eternity. Plus, it is silly how the Allies' solution to most problems is to send a ""one-man army"" to take down Nazi headquarters single-handedly without even breaking a sweat. But that is Wolfenstein after all; it purposely does not need to explain how Blazkowicz does it -- and hey, some ancient voodoo magic is involved, so anything is justifiable, right? Fortunately, the story did manage to create the cool villain by the name of Deathshead, who later becomes the franchise’s main antagonist.The gunplay in here is hasty but satisfying, reminiscent of older games such as Quake, Doom and Unreal Tournament, and unquestionably the strongest point of the game. While it all boils down to sprinting and shooting enemies in quick manners, the game does offer some moments of straightforward stealth where you get to sneak behind enemy lines. Additionally, there is an adequate variety in enemies from the deadly female squads in tight leather uniforms (those butts though) to juggernauts like the Über-Soldats. Different weapons are at Blazkowicz’s disposal too, with the Tesla gun being the most fun one to use, even if the MP40 probably becomes the most practical throughout most of the game, thus making pistols pretty redundant. One problem with the weapons though is the fact you never seem to run out of ammo. Retrospectively now, the gunplay does feel very basic, but mostly thanks to its fast paced action killing waves of enemies does not get dull, surprisingly enough.The level design has the mentality of most shooters back in the late '90s and early noughties based on maze-like corridors and paths, essentially allowing the player the freedom to pick whichever route to travel back and forth within the somewhat confined space. Exploration is also encouraged and rewarded by finding secret chambers filled with collectables, even if these give no gameplay advantages to the player. Graphically, at the time, the game looked great but as time went by its visuals sure look dated today. On the other hand, the same cannot be said to its soundtrack which even to this day remains memorable and rather ageless. When you can recognise a level/map by a specific track from the soundtrack, then you know the soundtrack left a good impression.Boasting a strong single-player campaign, (wherther you take the story seriously or not), many probably remember the game for its multiplayer component which at the time was very popular and considered by many superior than the campaign, even as far as being regarded one of the best multiplayer components in a game ever. I cannnot argue with that, although it was not until the highly acclaimed free standalone Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory came out that the multiplayer component peaked in popularity. Featuring a class-based gameplay similar to Team Fortress, two teams (Allies and Axis) fight each other to complete objectives on various maps. Personally, I spent far too many hours in the multiplayer alone when I was younger because it was balanced and had a very enjoyable experience. Currently, the multiplayer from Return To Castle Wolfenstein seems dead. Rest in peace.In conclusion, Return To Castle Wolfenstein still remains a classic in the eyes of many, including myself, who played it in its heydays online and/or offline, and a milestone on PC. But it definitely lost its relevance and appeal to the general public as years have passed due to more ambitious and realistic shooters showing up years later. More old-school than modern, it still is a solid shooter, nevertheless, which does not spoil the player with today’s regenerative health and cover-base mechanics and can still provide enough hours of fun mindlessly killing Nazis. Pick it up only for nostalgic purposes or if you are curious to see how fast-paced shooters were like more than a decade ago in case you never grew up with them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RtCW is gonna draw you in son, and youre gonna thank it. youre gonna thank it as you gun down hordes of the resurected dead. youre gonna thank it as you make a nazi WISH they were dead. youre gonna thank it as you climb the first boss's entire body and cram down 400lbs of shrapnel down its throat. youre gonna finish that first chapter and smile, knowing satan's got himself company.... and then uninstall after how much bull the stealth mission is in chapter 2.

												Wolfenstein.... Or RTCW you get me right ?Actually ( when i write this review am 28 and soon 29 ) Date 27/12/2015 at 00:30 on the planet earth...... Sh!t !I bought this game in 2001 in the beautiful metal box so the limited edition.My friend at that time was jalous ^^My mother was mad about me cause she always said it was a Nazi game, and me to tell her that it was just a game.....And yes its just a game ! Dont confond game and reality.Anyway let start.....Wolfenstein using the graphic motor of quake 3. And hell yeah this graphic motor do perfectly his job, very very well optimized ( well we know its a old game ok.... ) But imagine those graphic in 2001.... I remember and it was just amazing !!The graphic are still very enjoyable and nice ( i dont givashit about graphic btw except for Thief 1 ... )The environnement are very nice, there are different kind of environement too, castle for sure, forest, ruins, airport, small village in the snow, laboratory, there is also a U-Boat with the symbole of the smiling sawfish on it. Das Boat movie reference ?  And way more stuff....For sure if you are like me, saying that old game are .... Old but gold, you will, like me do the game in the hardest difficulty, your not a noob right ? You like it hard right ???...So you will do the game in  the I AM DEATH INCARNATE difficulty ! I did the game straight without pause, it took me around 7h30 the first time, using most of the time the sten, the G43 and the K98 + killing all the ennemy finding also all the secrets area.... For sure you will rage a little bit, the I.A ennemy are still very very very good ! They are smart, use environement object, use cover or take cover, throw back your grenade ^^ The badass thing in this gameThe differents boss! You can hear the ennemy reloading, so rush them and kick ther /-\ss You can open the door by kicking them and destroying item too that way.Definitively in this game the IA is so GOLD, the intelligence of the ennemy in the hardest difficulty is just amazing seriously !Different and nice environement.The sound i like them... Especially the sound of the Alarm.But time to time the music can appear too much repetitive, so i like to play without during some missionThere is some infiltration mission ! You can also use the sten to stay silent if you want.And also my preferate thing is that in almost all the level there is some secret area, if you see a place where you cant go its generally cause this place is secret and you have to find your self the way in.Last thing.. If you see a couple of barrel near a wall... Shoot them....THE MOST BAD /-\SS SH!T IN THIS GAMEThe boots !! Yeah you can kick with your foot door for example !! This is nuts !!But with your boots you can also kick.... Lets say some poster paint picture, radio, chair,windows, soldier, door for sure,  SOME BOSS :D, zombie and more !!!! BOOTS THAT SH!T MAN !Opening a door the normal way ? NO USE YOUR BOOTS BOOOOM HELL YEAH !!! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)What about the weapons now ? They are realist for some and fun for the other one ^^ But enjoyable.My preferate is for sure the Sten with the silencer what the fuerk man seriously this gun....  pew pew pew pew pew pew shhhhhhhhh ....   <3The headshot in the game are real headshot, one shot in the head = Ennemy down ^^ So the Hitboxe are good and better then csgo hahahahaha ..... ( badjoke right ? ) ...What else ???  I think you can really enjoy this game seriously. Different weapons, different environement, ennemy too.The story is not the most important in this game, there is some reference about Indiana Jones for example... ^^ Find yourself..ps I am French my english is not perfect, but you get me right ? Wolfenstein is a must do.ps² There still some player on Ennemy Territory mod... <3EDITTo avoid open GL error at start of the game and to be able to use high resolution in the game install this patchBe sure to read the README from the patch.Link >>> http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/downloads/rtcw-sp-1.42c-win32-bin.zipAnd also i just re finished the game in like 3hoo new record.. :D i love RTCW ............ <3

												After clearing the game 20+ times and putting a good 200 hours into it, I would say this is one of the best SP games I've ever played, Its interesting, the plot is amazing, the gameplay is mindblowing, you can choose to either go in guns blazing or take the splinter cell approach and sneak behind your enemies and take them out, The levels are so well made its insane, I started playing this game when my dad introduced it to me, it was my first FPS game on the playstation console, and now that it came to steam, I've gotten a piece of my childhood back! I wish there was a update or a remaster to this game because its so freaking awesome!! I would recommend this game for anyone of any age, its a really simple game to follow and dont need any hard instructions that newer SP FPS require, You can even introduce your parent to it and I'm sure they wont be dissapointed!

												I came to review this game right after I played it for around 10 minutes, cuz' all I can see when i was running this game was memories. This game called up my childhood like a movie. I can remember every single frame of ten years ago, when I was sitting by my father and watched him playing thie game. It seems like it never came to him that little girl shoudn't watch such violent game. But, I had a good time. I did. I hated the background music, it was creepy, so was Germany that they were yelling. Every time the character died, I closed one of my eyes and pretended to be easy, well, by drinking my milk. OMG, I just so love old times.   The year before last year, a summer, I went back home and tried to teach my father play League of legends. He watched me played two rounds, then said that he felt dizzy. I never responded. Well, here I bought this game already. If it's possible, I do hope playing with him again.There's cons for this game, but if I have to put up something, it will be:The cons:- Those people who played with me, where did they go ?10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Once and a while we have to pull this shooter out of the basement, blow the dust off the cover and fire it up just because of its originality and old-school fps digital jazz.  Throw today's carnal desire for graphics out the back door, kiddos, because this game is not just a game. Woa ho ho ho no.  This here is how we revive one of America's favorite pastimes: Killing nazis and eating steaming hot meals after riddling some sausage eating rhino's body full of bullets fired from the granddaddies of all guns.  You have explosions.  You have your cheesy sci fi german science experiment mutation jim jam.  You have your secret rooms full of stuff you don't really need but still really want because you want to feel smart for finding them.  And last but not least, you have your backpack that can fit whatever brass throwing wooden or metal sticks you find on the ground all at once with no added difficulty to run/leap/twirl/salsa and whatever else I missed because screw logic this is f**king Wolfenstein, b*tches.

												I'll be honest, I've never played a Wolfenstein game and I only had a friend that was interested in the franchise. I only took notice of it when Wolfenstein The New Order was announced so I decided to try one of the earlier games and holy crap this game is so much fun.Return To Castle Wolfenstein does so much right in the single player campaign. Cool settings, tight gunplay, epic orchestra music and a good array of weapons to take out the many types of (Nazi) enemies. This game is pure fun and it achieves at that with flying colours. The best part about it is probably the lack of handholding and not so linear level design which is sadly not so popular in many modern FPS games.I would give this a total of 8/10 for the fun challenge and gameplay this game has made but unfortunately I couldn't find a game in the multiplayer which is sad but the game is still very much worth the price for the singleplayer campaign alone. Nothing is better than shooting nazis, super soldiers and the undead at the same time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RTCW is a fun game and has aged well. The premise of the story is very interesting. It centers around the Nazis' interest in the occult during WWII. While the story isn't the game's strongest point, it is satisfactory and never takes away from the gameplay. I appreciated the various letters that you find lying around during the game; they really add to the game's atmosphere. Despite the game's age, the graphics are still good, in my opinion. By 2001 standards, they are exceptional. The Quake 3 engine not only provides decent graphics, but, more importantly, makes for an awesome FPS combat experience. The weapons are great, and your character's movement is smooth. Combat is the game's main focus and without a doubt its strongest point. The enemy A.I. is tough. I played the game on Bring em on! (the ""normal"" difficulty) and died several times during my playthrough. However, my deaths were never frustrating; I always felt as if each of my deaths was due more to my own shortcomings/poor play than by any cheapness from the A.I. I was forced to keep multiple save files and I recommend the same to anyone who isn't an expert at these sort of games. The level designs are great. Plenty of hidden spots with loot for the players that appreciate that sort of thing in a game. I've  heard complaints about the stealth missions, but I found these levels to be really fun and a great change of pace. My only complaint is that some of the levels were a little too dark for my taste. They made it difficult to see enemies who have no problem seeing and shooting you in the same poor lighting. The game's music is good as well. The sounds of the game really add to the atmosphere, and in some parts the game is downright creepy. You also stumble on conversations between Nazis who are unaware of you presence. These conversations often add to the game's story, and a few of them are hilarious and memorable. It took me about 6.5 hours of total playtime to beat the campaign. At the end I was more than satisfied. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced FPS games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first wolfenstien may of been old school and hard but this will be even a bigger challenge. As the Nazis continue and start using science and bio weapons to take you down and you will even be facing undead zombies. Can you make a stop to there plans of taking over the world. Will you pervale and be victorious or die and let Hittlers army take over the world? Put your skills to the test. This game may be old but still puts you on the egde of death. In the game that is.

												Even though the first time I played this game was about 12 years ago when I was like 4, I just barely found out you could pick up chairs in this game.

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is supposedly a sort of remake of Wolfenstein 3D, but I don't know how you can have a remake of Wolfenstein 3D where you don't get to fight and kill a mech-clad Hitler.RtCW is all good fun when you're fighting Nazis. Basic Nazis, elite Nazi ladies, and the what have yous. Where it loses me entirely is when it does the Monster Mash. The first mission is great! Fighting your way through Where Eagles Dare (a classic) and feeling like a boss. Then you get to mission 2. And now you're facing skeletons with swords and shields. For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, the most basic, stereotypical video game enemy possible. And yes, I am complaining about that in a game where you fight NAZIS.But that's the thing, isn't it? I wanted to fight Nazis. I was playing Wolfenstein, and it turned into medieval DOOM with Germans. The final boss is an undead guy with a sword. Quite a step down from Hitler in a mech suit, I can tell you that. And sure, Wolf3D definitely had zombies. But they were experiments created by a Mengele-type guy. And they were basically just regular Nazis, but with an extra arm in the middle so that they could point their gun at you quicker than you could at them. There are electricity-shooting legless monster things in RtCW that the Nazis did create, and they're pretty cool. The game does a great job of building tension with these guys, and when they're not leaping into your face and being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they add a fun level of depth to their levels. But then you also have to deal with Super Soldiers, who are also sciencey, but ultimately boring. Don't get me wrong, here. The majority of the game has you just fighting Nazis. Snipers are awesome and paratroopers are awesome and the extra-skillful leather-clad ladies are awesome, and... well, the guys with flamethrowers suck. But luckily there aren't many of them in the game.The level design is very good. Each mission looks and feels different. In one you'll be sneaking around a wooded area, in another you'll be sniping through a snowstorm. In one mission you'll be fighting from a cable car as you descend from Castle Wolfenstein, in another you'll be infiltrating secret Nazi labs, and in still another you'll be escorting a tank through a town. There are plenty of secrets to find... at times. After you leave Castle Wolfenstein, they seem to just stop existing for several missions. It's a bit of a bummer, to be honest.The pre-mission cutscenes are dull, I'm not gonna lie to you. A fat guy behind a desk far away from our protagonist speaks with some suits as slow and boringly as possible (not even having Tony Jay voice the fat guy saves these scenes). I also found that the music drowned out half of the other sounds in the game, making stealth tougher and making it impossible to overhear conversations that you're meant to overhear. Make sure to turn that option down a good deal.The guns feel good when you're fighting humans. Otherworldly creatures often take too many bullets and don't react enough to being shot, leading one to wonder whether you're even damaging them at all.So I like it. I do recommend it. But I wouldn't blame you for using console cheats to go invincible or skip levels when you have to deal with doofy skeletons and anything else that just fills you with apathy. And if there's a mod out there that replaces the final boss with Wolf3D's mech suit Hitler (in all of his pixely sprite glory), I'd suggest getting it. And if there isn't, I'd suggest making it.

												Awesome game. I had this as a teenager, and think it's an essential for any FPS gamer's Steam library. Also, to share this with the community, there isn't actually a need to use unofficial patches to get proper widescreen resolutions. RTCW runs on Tech3, the same engine that powered Quake III. Simplest method is to use the console:r_customwidth 1920r_customheight 1080r_mode -1vid_restartReplace 1920 and 1080 with your native display resolution.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know what? I'll say it. This is actually one of the best shooters of all time. Everything is so thoroughly thought through, even to the point where you can basically stealth most levels in a game that isn't even really about stealth, just thanks to how good the AI and mechanics are. You an pick up a chair for no real reason and you can't just pick up a chair and then use a knife or handgun with it. Plus, NAZIS! SCIENCE!THE OCCULT!GREAT GUNPLAY!GET IT!Just be sure to right click on the game, click properties and click Set Launch Options and enter the following line into the box: +set r_primitives 2This will fix all performance issues you may have, and let you run the game at max settings without stuttering. Also possibly grab the unnofficial patch: www.markshan.com/knightmare/downloads/rtcw-sp-1.42d-win32-bin.zip This fixes several bugs and adds widescreen support.Just get it and beat it so you can say you were man enough to do it.

If you loved it then, you'll still like it today.

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein (RTCW) may look dated but it is a great FPS without political correctness!I have enjoyed RTCW in early 2000s and it still is a pleasure to play it again in 2014 :)You go back to ""Castle Wolfenstein"" in order to investigate on an occult and secret program. Indeed, Nazis look for some kind of supernatural power in order to beat Allies and win the WW2 …. and your job is to try to stop them by all means ^^### Pros:- Immersive FPS & interesting story (WW2, Nazis & Allies, occult quest, zombies)- Good level design with great gameplay- Both real WW2 and imaginary/fun guns (e.g. Luger, Sten, Mauser, flamethrower)- Lots of secrets (e.g. you must destroy Hitler posters to access to Nazis gold or ammo)- Elite SS-girls dressed in Black Leather & Boots xD### Cons:- Only passable graphics because the game is quite old- Nazis should speak German (with subtitles) … instead of some “German accented English”- Improvable AI & easy bosses- Impossible to be out of ammo :(### Conclusion:- Killing Nazis is fun (++)- Killing Zombies is fun (+)- Killing both Nazis & Zombies is extremely fun (+++), especially with flamethrower xDRTCW is an incredible game and a “must have” for any serious library ;)17/20			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Play as B.J. Blazkowicz, an epic hero in FPS gaming? Check. Fight against Nazis who impede your progress with MP40s to flamethrowers? Check.Battle the undead that tend to pop out of their tombs and crave for flesh? Check.Lots of weapons to shred enemies into a messy, bloody pulp? Check.Explore in diverse environments, from Castle Wolfenstein to Norway? Check.Awesome soundtrack? Check.This game may be over a decade old, but it's still gold. I couldn't find anything bad about this game as I enjoyed every moment of it, from the beginning to the end. I'm still thankful for my friend who gifted me this game. I wish newer games had the same charm as their predecessors. In fact, playing this game gave me a better experience than most movies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although released 15 years ago, Return to Castle Wolfenstein still packs a punch. Do note, however, that installing the game is not enough to have it run properly under newer systems - there is a guide available on Steam that tells us what patch to download and what files to overwrite. Once it is done, RoTW can be enjoyed even in the HD resolution!The story of Wolfenstein has always been about Nazis and the occult. Blazkowicz, our hero, now faces some pretty gruesome monsters - beside eliminating soldiers we have lots of undead warriors here, plus, we get to see how Wilhelm Strasse's Übersoldat project unfolds. The Lopers are pretty nasty creatures - they are cyborgs whose lower body has completely been amputated and replaced with some sort of generators. Thanks to them and the undead creatures encountered in the labs, crypts, RoTW's atmosphere becomes great and creepy at times.This is a classic shooter i.e. you shoot first then ask questions later. There are no keys to collect - just shoot everybody in your sight in order to proceed. Classic also means there are several hidden areas with lots of golden bars and chalices hidden throughout most of the levels. Finding all of them can be quite the challenge! While the game is old and has dated graphics the environments can still be appreciated. I still remember how critics marvelled at the flamethrower's effect which was one of a kind at the time.I only have two complaints about RoTW - first, it misses a shotgun. There should at least be one weapon that is efficient during close encounters. Second, there are some levels where the emphasis is on using stealth playstyle. This is not executed very well always - sometimes you do not know what the reason was for the Germans to raise the alarm.RoTW is a classic and should be played as such! Thanks to the great community there are means to run it on modern PCs and reminisce during its roughly 8-hour long campaign. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a linear FPS released in 2001 and takes place in a ww2 scenario where supernatural phenomenom exist. You take control of agent Blazkowicz, an Polish-American agent, who is fighting against nazi germany.+ a lot of weapons+ graphics have a certain charme to them+ there are nazi flags, swastikas, blood, gore and I heard an adolf hitler speech on the radio once.+ stealth kind of works+ some interesting dialogue of some random German soldiers+ No hand-holding- if you die, it doesn't always load the most recent save, which is annoying.- forced stealth missions, but luckily not too many- plot is kind of meh. would have worked better without supernatural elements- Sadly, the German uniforms you can pick up don't actually allow you to go undercover. It only adds some armour.- Maps are sometimes too linear- Some technical adjustments are required if you don't want low and capped FPS.Additional links:http://steamcommunity.com/app/9010/guides/#scrollTop=0http://steamcommunity.com/app/9010/discussions/0/540740501101248264/?l=englishYou might ask yourself if this game is still worth to play today? And the answer is yes, it is. The campaign is of good length, it makes fun and it does still hold up.Replay value: Average (too linear, but you can search for all the secret and treasures if you want to) Rating: 7.5/10Recommendation: Yes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What I liked about the game	Not your typical WW2 game. This game has a mixture of the supernatural (like raising the dead) and futuristic technology (like super soldiers).	A great arsenal of weapons to choose from. You get to use weapons which were actually used in WW2 and you also get to use experimental weapons like the Tesla gun and the mini gun.	Secrets to be found throughout the levels, some are hidden in quite clever places. 	You can find letters throughout the levels which are interesting to read. You also have a note book which tells you your mission objectives and it also has the mission briefing. 	Cool boss fights, especially the first one. 	No lives and score system.	Awesome soundtrack.   What I disliked or was disappointed with 	I wasn't keen on the stealth aspects of the game. When using the silent Sten gun it wasn't really a quiet weapon to use because it still alerted enemies near by.   	The A.I can be stupid sometimes; two enemies trying to get into a room and as a result they get stuck. The enemies are sometimes deaf; when I used the MP40 the enemy in the watch tower never even heard me. 	I wish there were more secrets in some of the levels; some levels only had one secret. 	Finding and collecting gold in the game was kind of pointless because there was no score system, although I think it was just a reference to the first game. 	I wish there were more items you could store away and use later with the inventory system. Conclusion A good game; like I said not your typical WW2 game. If you enjoyed Red faction, half-life or your a fan of the Wofenstein games, then I highly recommend you give this a go. 79/100 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RtcW is a game from yesteryear. Back before the days of regenerating health and scripted sequences. When the Quake 3 engine was still king and everyone still waited for Duke Nukem Forever.Return to Castle Wolfenstein's most memorable element to me is its simplicity. It is very similar to Wolfy 3D in that you basically do two things in this game: Kill Nazis and find treasure. Infact it is to the game's benefit as it has aged startlingly well for a game from 2001. It encorporated elements like secret areas, treasure, eating food to restore your health etc, and added slightly more fantastical designs like mutants and zombies. RtcW is more linear than the previous game, but it has extremely good pacing and map design. You uncover shortcuts back to prior areas, and always feel in control in gunfights.It's a shame RtcW isn't talked about as often as other games from it's era, since it is one of the best games Id ever published. A game that is just as epic as the name it carries.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is an extremely satisfying game, especially on higher difficulties. It lets you play multiple different ways. You can sprint around kicking down doors and jumping around spraying people with bullets or quietly walk around stabbing people and landing headshots with pistols and rifles as to avoid setting off alarms. On higher difficulties it forces you to be perfect, avoid any unnesecary damage and manage health packs for a fair yet overwhelming challenge. but on lower difficulties you can run around killing everyone in a highly satisfying joyride. It's a masterpiece, and I highly reccomend it especsiallly at $5 due to the game's old age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, but you'll need to do a little tweaking to get it to run native 1080p. So, what youll need to do is click on the link below, that will take you to the kmquake 2 download site. From here you will need to click on the download button on your right, and from there you will need to scroll down until you see ""Return To Castle Wolfenstein Patch"", click on the ""win32 binaries"" link, and download the file. Once you have done all this, all you have to do is extract the folder into you main directory for wolfenstein, AND ENJOY!- http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Return To Castle Wolfenstein			* 7/10Return To castle Wolfenstein is the next chapter following the classic Wolfenstein 3d, Our good old William ""B.J."" Blazkowicz is on a mission after some Nazis and Magic artefacts, and he's once again imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein.RTCW (Too long to write) is a classic FPS, with few little innovation, and the engine is essentially a heavily modified version of the trusty Quake III Arena Engine: iD Tech 3. The most evident modifications are lightning and Flamethrower effects wich for the time really were an incredible innovation. Level structure is always linear with various settings, from castles to citadels, big large buildings, catacombs, hills and laboratories. In other words it has a large variety of ambiences, both inside building and open air.The game structure is a classic ""shoot-everything-breathing"" but there are few sections where the mission requires your discretion, so you must use a stealth approach.The story involves much more the occult side of Nazism, infact Helga von Bulow (one of your targets) is after some artifacts and as a consequence you will face some revived corpses.Anyways AI is something quite odd as I've noticed that soldiers and enemies in general can sight and shoot you with millimetric precision even at the longest distances which is something really ridiculous especially for the stealth sections.Your arsenal presents some interesting innovations and a very big variety of weapons. There are 3 kind of rifles, 2 sniper rifles, grenades, Panzerfaust and a Powerful Experimental Tesla Cannon, not to mention the Efficient Flamethrower.I would like to point out the possibility to play in Co-op (which is how I've played in this run) through a very good mod, you can look into it in the always useful Steam community.+++PROs+++SETTING.  Once Again We're ""B.J."" Blazkowicz, Once again we face the Nazi Army and much worse, from ubersoldiers to rising deads. There's a very large variety of ambiences and places to visit, so it is unlikely for the game to be boring.COOP. This isn't a native option but there's a thread in the steam community discussion forum that points toward this mod: RTCWCoop.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY ISSUES.Obviously this game's age is creating few minor issues, one of them being the 4:3 aspect ratio for the resolution. Nothing that can't be dealt with, anyways, there are useful guides in the steam community, though laptops could still have some trouble. WAR GODS. You're not going to face common SS Soldiers, but war gods that can and will hit you with whatever gun at any distance... repeatedly... And Hard... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												READ THE REVIEW IF YOU WANT FULL HD SUPPORT FORT HIS GAME (LINK AT THE END)This game is the reason my name is the legendary Arashenstein, combine of my real name + wolfenstein = ArashensteinThe only reason i bought it on steam again is to post a review and finish it one more time.I played wolfenstein 3D and spear of destiny many times when i was a kid, and even later when i upgraded my PC in 2004 on my windows XP i kept playing them over and over again cause i just couldnt have enough of wolfenstein.When i was 12 this game came out, my PC could not handle it on that time, 6 years passed when i was 18 i bought this game on CD from some retail shop and damn after 22 hours playing on hardest difficulity without making a pause (cause i could not it was soooo addictive) i finished the game.What is needed to call a game wolfenstein:1. World war II element2. Horror3. High tech enemies4. Bosses5. Area called Castle WolfensteinUnfortunately i can not call ""the new order"" a wolfenstein game because it has none of the elements mentioned above, the last true wolfenstein was wolfenstein 2009 (when it came out i said it sucks but after i played new order i noticed that game was actually more wolfenstein than new order) so i suggest you people specially you ""new generation"" kids who think if a game has out dated graphics (which RTCW does not have) that game is worthless and you should only and only buy the new one with epic graphics, the new order and old blood are not even wolfenstein game they are starwars with NO horror element and NO true boss fights like what we had in RTCW and 3D and 2009. Wolfenstein is the name of a castle which you escape from it in 3D and RTCW, and return to it in 2009 and Spear of Destiny, in wolfenstein new order this castle does not even exist so what is the point in calling that game ""wolfenstein""?To all those classic fans of wolfenstein who are playing this game since it came out in 1992, there is a JAVA mobile versino of this game called ""Wolfenstein RPG"" that game story is combine of wolfenstein 3D + Spear of Destiny + RtCW, and if you have not played that one then trust me your life is wasted, i love RtCW so much but RPG is something else, once you play it you see how developer of that game was so smart to combine story of 3 games into 1 and make something truely epic, make sure you play that even if you need to buy a JAVA phone.How to run RtCW in 4K + FULL HD:Google this rtcw-sp-1.42c-win32-bin and look for download links, once it is download extract the files and copy paste them (replace) them with the orginal one in your steam directory. second step: there is a .exe file in those files you extracted run it and it starts the game without steam overlay, go to options set your resolution and graphics settings to whatever you want. save and exit the game then run the steam version. GG now you have a steam edition of RtCW in full HD and ultra textures with steam cloud support ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best Wolfenstein out there, in my opinion. It's honestly not very known, sadly. But if you liked the first 2 Quake games, you will also like this game. It's not as fast paced, but it has the same ""shoot everything in sight"" feeling to it. I really like the story, I really like the enemies, though it's kinda broken once you learn to head-shot the game becomes insanely easy.  But that's a small factor. Buy this game it's really, really, really, great!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this game because first of all - it trails along a legacy of the classic that was known as the original Wolfenstien 3D - This game lives up to the expectations that made the game a success when it was in a DOS Flavor. Runs very smooth on my Windows 7 32 bit laptop without a problem. I did not see Windows 7 listed here but it works. I can't speak for the multiplayer components - I don't know if they work or not as this seems to be the original game. They do have a stand alone game I think it's called Enemy Territory - But its a standalone and not a part of the original game. This game does include plenty of references to Nazi symbols and Hitler, and may offend some depending on someones cultrual background. My Grandmother is from Germany - And I actually showed her a portion of this game when it first came out as I owned it on disc but it ended up making her cry because of the sensitive nature of the games references.Me - I just play the game for what it is I don't let it bother me, it's just a game , nothing more.

												This game has aged extremely well. At no point was I making excuses for graphics or gameplay because it came out in 2002. Everything about it still holds up. But that's what's expected of id games.You get sent to Castle Wolfenstein and all over Europe tracking down nazis looking for supernatural elements to bring new super weapons to life. You then single handedly gun down, electrocute, eviscerate, explode, and otherwise put an end to every soldier, zombie, stiched together flesh monster, and big titted latex wearing nazi that crosses your path.Which makes this a very historically accurate representation of World War II as well.Excellent level design, an interesting story, and classic FPS gameplay makes this game still stand out amonst all the others.Check it out.

												Remember, 10 years ago, when gamers didn't have problems with so-called linear games with so-called linear missions? When traveling from point A to point B was appreciated if it was fun? Remember when FPS genre wasn't just a tool for graphic cards benchmarking? Yes, RTCW comes from that long lost age, it's a smell of blood, death, and awesomness, available just now for mere 2,5 €. Why should you pick it up again? Elders will go for that nostalgia throat, and you youngsters should stick around and have some innocent, 'linear' fun in one classic FPS.If Return To Castle Wolfenstein would be a band, it would be Slayer with Jeff Hanneman alive and Kerry King not being a♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's how good it gets.***This game has been inducted into Backlog Raider's Halloween Special alongside five other great titles!Want to know which one?

												Return to Castle Wolfenstien is a simple game starting BJ ""I'm special because I eat Med packs and armor and have bottomless pockets"" Blazkowicz, but underneath one of the simplist and oldest game mechanics in existance, one of the best shooters of all time, In a year with the likes of Medal of Honor and Call of Duty were funneling you down corridors shouting at you with a large army, RTCW sent you on your own to fight the German might singlehandedly, no map, no sense of direction just you, alone, outnumbered but certainly not outgunned or outclassed.Decide to be stealthy? Shock horror, you can do that, Use a silenced weapon or go for a backstab (instant kill), while listening to your enemies chat away about simple things Thief style, as a stealth shooter it does its job if its a little rough.Decide to go loud? You have enough firepower in your arsenal, with classic WW2 weapons and a few experimental toys to play with, oh and bottomless pockets mean you can carry them all into battle and use them whever you feel like it!Map design is a little rough but still classical old school, no arrows, no waypoint markers but designed in such a way you always knew where you were going and where you were.Overall Return to Castle Wolfenstien is a great example of a classic shooter and should rank up for someone who wants to dive into old school shooters, people after yet another cookie cutter corridor crawler look elseware.

												At some point in life every gamer is a child, and as a child, we often harken back to a few games we played with friends and family, back in the old days when we were still too young or poor to get onto online games and annoy people with squeaky voices.for alot of us, this is the game. I played this with my father at least 100 times all the way through. It has aged well, and is still a very well made game. This game is the reason why any ww2 shooter I play that doesnt have zombies or monsters in it feels wrong. Buy it for the nostalgia, keep it for the fact it never stopped being fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in the day this game was the♥♥♥♥♥♥When I was a 5th grader I used to wake up at 2 a.m. to sneak to my pc just to play this, so that my parents wouldn't find out I was playing a supposedly M rated nazi/zombie shooter( yes they did catch me eventually), It brings back so much memory. This game is definitely old, very old, but the content still rocks even compare to today's games, the new wolfenstein games are alright, I just don't feel that excited to play them any more.

												My all time favourite game EVER. I grew up on this game back when it was released in 2001. I used to fight my brother and dad over this game as we only had one PC at the time. I made a lot of friends on it, and it's nice to know some of them still play despite how long it's been.I've missed this game soo much, and I'm glad theres a way to play multiplayer (despite majority are bots now), since they removed the master server.

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a follow-up to the original landmark FPS, Wolfenstein 3D. As the name implies, you return to the castle, in addition to visting various other locales. This game has many strengths during the course of the campaign: the maps are varied, the enemies challenging, the weapons diverse and the adjustments in gameplay style (i.e. stealth vs. all out aggression) do an excellent job of mixing it up and keeping everything fresh.If you're playing on a modern-day system, I suggest following the below guide to enable widescreen support. It worked perfectly for me on Windows 10 Pro x64 (all credit for the guide goes to OP):

												In 1992, id Software released Wolfenstein. Which later became known as Wolfenstein 3D. And it became known as one of the grandparents of first person shooting games and one of the first person shooting icons back in the day, such as DOOM.Later in 2001, we received another title for the series, known as RTCW. Return to Castle Wolfenstein, for the full title. Now whether it was expected or a needed sequel to the original game, Idk. I don't know if it was expected. But I can say that it was a good treat from id, that year. More Wolfenstein, more nazi shooting and also some supernatural as the icing to this cake.Centuries ago, Heinrich I was imprisoned on the battlefield by a wizard who dared to face him and to put an end to his reign of terror. Later in 1943, nazis from the SS Paranormal Division, led by Himmler, find themselves at the exact same spot, digging for Heinrich's final resting place, hoping to rely on his power in order to win the war. This reaches the OSA's ears and they send in two agents to investigate and report their activity to the office. Unfortunately during their mission, both agents are captured and taken to Castle Wolfenstein to be interrogated. One of those agents is the same character you played before, if you played the original Wolfenstein. You're once again, put in the shoes of B.J. Blazkowicz (pronounced ""Blaz-ko-vitz"") with the starting objective of escaping from the castle and contact an agent from a german resistance group called the Kreisau Circle. After your escape from the castle into a village near the castle, your contact tells you to head to the graveyard, where the nazis are also doing more excavations. That's where things start getting out of the ordinary for both the nazis and yourself as you have to deal with the undead.The game will take you through various places as you foil the SS Paranormal's plans, aside from Castle Wolfenstein. You'll also go through places like a rocket base, an airfield, catacombs, even the ruins of a city in Malta in order to reach a weapons factory.The game will also provide you with a wide variety of weapons, from a knife and the classic MP40 to guns like the flamethrower, the Panzerfaust and crazy stuff like the Venom Gun which is like this smaller yet just as powerful gatling gun and the Tesla Gun, which is like an electricity cannon.The game's graphics... even for a 2001 game, they could look a little better. But if you wanna make the game look better, there's an HD graphics mod in the Steam forums. And trust me, the game looks like it's from 2010's, with that.As for how long it can take you to beat the game, I'd say about 12 hours. Probably less if you manage to die as little as possible. Probably around 9-10 hours.The soundtrack is also on point and it doesn't really deviate from the atmosphere the game tries to create for you.And with that, I think it's time for the final score. I give Return to Castle Wolfenstein a 7/10. It's a good experience. If you're one for graphics, you're gonna want the graphics mod I mentioned, because with its original graphics the game looks kinda outdated even for the time it came out. It keeps you engaged as well and does a good job at it. I recommend you getting this game and if possible, the rest of the Wolfenstein games. At least up until the 2009 title. I still have yet to play The New Order.Enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Damn good, if flawed, classic FPS.  The thing that developer ID absolutely nailed was the atmosphere.  From Nazi castles, undead crypts, genetic science labs, to firebombed cities this game really wraps you in its WWII, sci-fi, paranormal universe.  It's action-packed from beginning to end.  I think as far as classic FPS goes, this is one of the premier options.  Be advised, I had to install the rtcw-sp-1.42d patch to get it to work.  After that, certain video options would crash the game.  Be careful.You can read my nitpicks below, if you chose.  But I have full confidence in recommending this title. ID made a few mistakes.  The silenced sten is absurdly overpowered.  You will use this 90% of the time after receiving it.  Some more reason to switch to other armaments would have been preferred.  This was early in the fusion of FPS and stealth so while most missions have a stealth option, it is damn hard to achieve.  Enemies will be alerted at the slightest peak of you.  They also fire the millisecond that they see you with deadly accuracy.  This can lead to some tough segments on harder difficulties.  Some larger outdoor environments have stupidly short draw-distances as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even after 16 years I consider Return to Castle Wolfenstein one of the  BEST SHOOTERS  OF ALL TIME!!! You just MUST, MUST, MUST play this classic. This is the real Wolfenstein out there. I'm full of praise for this title. What a game!+ Storyline- The history background mixed with the Nazis+ ATMOSPHERE- The Mystery behind the discoveries, digouts and science+ Nazis+ Young BJ Blaskowitz+ MP 40+ An epic escape from a fictional Nazi Castle+ Killing a surrendering Nazi scientist with a grenade and watching his limbs bounce everywhere+ ""z American iz hier. Kill him."" (German accent lol)I'm sorry but I can't give you any cons since the game is 16 years old and because back in the day this was the best out there and even though the graphics (well ♥♥♥♥ graphics because the story is fantastic) aren't really up-to-date the game ATMOSPHERE is so intriguing.BUY IT! My rating is  12 out of 10BTW .. Did you guys know that you can actually read the diaries when you pick them? I've finished this game about 5 times (maybe more) but never noticed it.

Can't tell much about single player, but with co-op mods it's extremely fun also and you should definitely try that out with friends.Nowdays I'm playing Wild West mod based on RtCW. Still having some good times there. Also, I guess there are still some servers (US based) left who run Beach or Depot 24/7.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourite games of all time by far. This game is just so greatly executed and creative as well as fun. I can't think of a single reason to get this game other than1. Not a FPS fan.2. Picky about Graphics.3. Doesnt Run on your system.4. Don't like games with ""Nazi's"" featured in them5. Just simply doesnt peak your interest.I however love this game and everything about it and yes I'm being a little biased as shown ovbiously there are some bugs here or there due to when the game was made but nothing game breaking maybe just a moment where in the boss fight they repeat  dialogue or get stuck here or there. So rating this game off of it's time and pure nostalgia. 10/10 off of comparison to games now 4/10 however that wouldn't do this game right so yes i recommend it this game, ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D fo sorts. Well, of prequel. Or reboot. After 9 years or so and technology advancment you shouldn't expect things to be same anyway. It's a WW2 shooter from 2001, made by id and Gray Matter and Nerve Software (one handled singleplayer, another handled multiplayer), it runs on Quake 3 engine. And well, was released in the beggining of those horrible times when every second shooter was WW2 themed.There also was Enemy Territory, a sort of stand-alone multiplayer expansion pack that is free. It's not included there, but you know, it's free.It also had XBox and PS2 version, both with additional prologue level and new shotgun as weapon. XBox even has 2-player coop as far as I am aware. Worth tracking down.Surprisingly, for id software title, this game on Steam works pretty fine. It just doesn't support widescreen, which I think can easily fix through config files or so. Check guides.Well, if forget that multiplayer portion still tries to use master server that was shut down times ago. In all honesty, I didn't bother fixing it, I doubt that it has active enough player base nowdays. Multiplayer the main reason people were praising this game, but with free Enemy Territory around, I don't think anybody will be playing this now.In this game you play as agent Blazkowicz, noted for his ability to infiltrate bases and infiltrate every nazi he meets. And you have to Return to Castle Woflenstein!If forget that you already start inside it and it's not as pretty as your rose-tinted nostalgia glasses were telling you, so now you have to Unreturn to Castle Wolfenstein!All while learning about occult stuff on your way out, which then excites people at headquarters enough to send you to every Nazi evil project in the world, to learn more. And to sabotage every possible invention that Nazi came up with. Which is fun, no complaints.As for game itself, well, it's an early WW2 shooter. It was past Doom times when your movement was your defence, since pretty much every attack here is hitscan. It was also before regenerating and cover systems. It's just an early realistical FPS where your main defence is how fast can you react by headshotting soldier and where you can get into unfair situation where you randomly die due to random hitscan bullets and you can't do anything but to reload quicksave until you luckily pass it.Thankfully, this FPS is one of those 2000s shooters that mix stealth and action instead of fighting straight on. You could lean left and right to peek around corner. You could just walk to sneak onto enemy. And you have knife that instakills if used on the back of unaware enemy with stab stab stab animation. You will also get silenced weapons that will help you. Oh yea, and pistols in this game are useless, don't bother.Just don't think that Stealth is all that goodly done. It's on a weak side, somewhat, just enough to vary action up, to remove some soldiers before main action starts. It's not often required, outside of two mandatory stealth missions, that aren't as hard as worst examples in some other games. Just don't expect it to work well, you can always get noticed seemingly randomly. And then once alarm goes on and everybody notices you, or if it was straight action mission to begin with, you get to shooting part. And well, it's mostly reaction game. Enemies who aren't exactly aware what and where are you don't react so fast, but once they do, they can be pain. Now, you can easily outshoot common enemies. You can even effectively snipe them at long distance, and it's fun. Or you can use grenade around corner, fun too. Awesome music helps.Game gets to worst when you get to straight fight, when you can't sneak or ambush or take advantage of enviroment much. These are bad moments of gameplay. It gets worse if you meet tougher enemies in such situation. Unlike, say, enemies from Rise of The Triad, game that handles crowds of hitscan enemies, soldiers can shoot with no problem back while being shot at while screwing your aim off. And then game can have unfair situation, especially when you are on low health. Like, getting ambushed right while crawling up the ladder. Or second boss, Das Ubersoldat, immeditly hitscan-attacks you even before you can take cover or even check where you can take cover. Unless exploit his AI, mhm. Or just getting shot at by sniper in a foggy valley, where sniper is only barely visible from the fog, is placed behind tree, is on the hill somewhere on the side, and keeps dropping your aim off by shooting you succesfully. All yay quicksaves.But hey, outside of shooting itself, game has nice exploration feel to it, despite being linear. Small detail spread over realistical, yet not painfully gray, levels. Secrets are placed through levels, nicely hidden. First mission, castle Wolfenstein, is especially awesome with all the secrets hidden. Graphics are nice. It also has plenty of less generic guns, like flamethrower or tesla gun.I also didn't mention the very few parts of a game where you handle undead. It becomes something more simple here. Not great by itself, but helps to vary up.Bosses aren't great. First one is good, second is hitscan bulletsponge, final one is bulletsponge that has harder time to kill you than anybody else.Soundtrack is also awesome, improving atmosphere and actually helping you to get into mood required for playing this game.Return of Castle Wolfenstein is pretty good when compared to other early WW2 shooters. It's a mix of not-so-strong stealths and not-so-strong action, which will give you fun when both of those are present. When it comes to parts with straight action, it gets as frustrating as expected, though.Still better than Wolf3D. It is however amazingly overrated, while being more of meh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crikey! I cannot belive that I'm playing the classic Return To Castle Wolfenstein again. I first played this back in the days of Windows XP ten years ago. Sure, the graphics are dated but it's still has that old-school charm about it. It still makes me creep out on occassion when I have to go down in those creepy catacombs where the scary things are. Yes,..I'm a very jumpy type of person and this game still makes the hairs stand on the back of my neck Lol. There is a fantastic tutorial on how to get this working in modern full-screen 16.9 mode for todays modern widescreen monitors. I still rate this game as one of the best all time classic shooters as an agent who works alone dealing with the Nazis and the occult.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Originally purchased on CD in a retail box when Best Buy and CompUSA had aisles and aisles of PC software, this game marked the return to the classic first person shooter. The original Wolfenstein is a favorite that I go back to time and time again to relive the simplicity and fun. This version gave the franchise a much needed upgrade to all the enhancements that had come to first person shooters, yet it was its multiplayer mode that won me over. I would come home from work and fire up the multiplayer around 8 p.m. and within what seemed like 30 minutes, it was already 2 a.m. No other multiplayer has affected me as much initially as this one. When a competing WWII-themed multiplayer-only game came out a year later, Battlefield 1942 was no match for this perfect balance of role, maps, and play modes. Unreal Tournament was the shindig then, but this one made players passionate about the sides the chose.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A masterpiece, plain and simple. To this day I am amazed at the length, quality, and replayability of this game. Levels are unique, in that there are different atmospheres when you are dealing with occult, deathshead, undead, etc. Gameplay itself is very satisfying, the mechanics are brilliant for a game released in 2001. There are a variety of weapons you receive as the game progresses, and you are introduced to new enemies as well (nazi's, undead, those undead experiments in the xlabs). I have beaten this game many times, and i have never felt bored on any of my playthroughs. Also, the availabilty of mods bolsters its replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best shooters. It is great game in 2016 as it was in 2001. The story is fascinating, Deathshead and Marianna Blavatsky are great villains.The atmosphere is really thick thanks to great music and level design. Gameplay thanks to the diverse content of missions and environments is interesting and making sure that you will not get bored after a while. If you never played Return to Castle Wolfenstein than you must buy and play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10If you like killing Nazi's and Zombies, then this classic game is for you. It is really good, and a game that I always come back to here and there. Though, the reason why I'm giving it a 9/10 and not a 10/10 is because it lacked what the Xbox could bring. ( I know Playstation had things too, but I only played the Xbox version. )The PC version does not have the prequel mission, the shotgun, those dogs with the miniguns, rewards for getting all the secrets, and those weird zombie wizards that shoot electricity at you. But the PC version still is extremely good. It's just since I played the xbox version like crazy, I come into some areas expecting a certain enemy or weapon, only to be disappointed. I also do not use the Thompson, or m1911 (duel or single) because of the 'no reward for getting the secrets', I miss getting the ammo for those weapons since the Thompson sounds badass.The PC version does have a few other things the Xbox version does not. Like the music in the town (Xbox version is Beethoven), the sniper scope, the stamina, and it seems that the guns and explosions sound different (Maybe not all of them, but I noticed a few better sounding things).Overall, this game is still amazing, and you should definitally get it. I'm not sure if the PC version has a mod that adds in what the consoles have, if it does then I'll try to download it. If not, then I guess I'll wait. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GET THIS GAME!!!  Even if you didn't grow up with RTCW (I didn't), you will thoroughly enjoy this game.  RTCW has LOTS of levels with varied environments, from secret Nazi labs, rocket bases, towns, haunted crypts, and even Castle Wolfenstein itself.  There's also lots of secret rooms and nazi gold to be found in the various levels, but they are hidden, so be sure to search the walls for hidden buttons and look behind every Hitler poster and swastika! The graphics themselves are nicely detailed.  Some textures on the terrain are what you'd expect from early 2000's, but the characters themselves are actually very nice looking.  Most of your guns are from the appropriate WW2 era, but you get some interesting ones like the flamethrower, tesla gun, and venom machine gun; you'll probably stick to the mp40 and sten 80% of the game though.  Only complaint with the game is that it might break it when adjusting the screen resolution higher than 1024 width, so be sure to visit pcgamingwiki to figure how to adjust the resolution and you'll have NO problem at all!All in all I'm impressed with how well this game has held up and entertained me after over a decade of not even knowing about it.

												Amazing Throwback, I haven´t play this since 2002 and all I got say, is replaying this today was the best decision I could ever made.Saddly the multiplayer is pretty much dead, and this is where I spend most of my time with this game, however the single player is short but amazing, killing nazis it never felt so nice. This game have the perfect pulp feel, you don´t really need to pay attention to the plot, the only thing that matter is that it take you through great locations and put you agaist enemies, that will put your FPS credentials to test, this game hold up surprisingly well, it even looks nice for today standards, you won´t go wrong with this classic.

 Quicky   After playing through the game and its missions, I can definitely recommend the game to anyone who's a fan of arcade styled shooters like Quake, the Wolfenstein series and/or have a sweet spot for a bit of challenge in their game.   Long Version   Gameplay  Gameplay in Return to Castle Wolfenstein is your standard fare of arcade FPS fun, which is very similar to Quake III. Quake players should feel right at home, mostly because the game is based off the same engine, but we'll get into that later.Gunplay in RTCW is solid. You will be delighted to see the game offer up a large and powerful arsenal. Ranging from a silenced SMG to a highly effective TESLA gun.  Same can be said about the enemies, as you fight your way through your typical Nazi grunts to something of a bloody terminator. This game is hard, really hard. Enemies can inflict large amounts of damage in a matter of seconds and a small squad could pick you off easily if you're not prepared. This gives the game a sort of tactical feel, as you start leaning and checking every corner while picking off targets more cautiously. There were multible times I felt like I was honestly playing a Rainbow Six game. Difficulty really ramps up by the end of the game and since there are no checkpoints, you should keep that F5(quicksave) key close. There are moments in the game that are very cheap however. There were enemies that could zap you from across the room without once stopping to reload or enemies that could quite literally zap you to death from the floor below without giving you time to react. Moments like these make the game feel cheap, but luckily those moments are far in-between.  Atmosphere  The atmosphere in Return to Castle Wolfenstein is excellent. While the music in the game isn't anything to really brag about, it works for the most part to keep the tone of the game right. Luckily though, the typical military music is countered with an insane level of map detail. Every level in RTCW is very different from the other- you'll be sneaking through a village one moment and fighting your way through undead vikings(?) inside a hidden crypt the next. The game really changes its themes a lot, which really help keep the game fresh. Not all is sunshine and buttercups though, as the aforementioned Quake engine has aged a bit and that can definitely be noticed in some of its maps.    Story  Story wise, you play as the returning Nazi genocider B.J. Blazkowicz, as you uncover the dangerous and mystical project the Nazis are cooking up. The story feels a bit vague for my taste and the subpar cutscenes and voice acting don't help. But it is there for anyone who cares about the reasoning behind all the bloodshed. B.J stays silent throughout the whole game, but there are still some cutscenes that do make me crack a smile and be interested in every now and then. I personally feel the ending of the game was a bit off.   Compatibility  Compatibility is not the best at first. I had to install an unofficial patch to fix a framerate issue I kept having, where the game would start studdering whenever I looked at a certain direction. After the patch the game ran silky smooth. I've only encountered one application crash. Final Thoughts  Personally, I find the game to be a great shooter and definite classic to the shooter genre. RTCW never failed to keep me interested in the game with its wide range of settings and weapons. And though there were moments I wish I could throw my keyboard out of the window, that's just the charm of the game. I only wish the game was a bit longer, as the multiplayer is dead. (Though there is another game called ""Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory"" which is based off this game and still has a beating multiplayer as far as I've heard, and that's completely free.)  The game is cheap as hell and a solid shooter. It'll run you for about 6-7 hours, completely depending on the player. I find no reason not to recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly interested in FPS games.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now if u are reading this review (u better be I spent lke 10 mins of my life typing this and I won't get them back!) I am reccommending this to people who like old school shooters games hard games (I bet all u Dark Souls fans will be excited to hear that) or both has this game is hard has hell as old school shooters are now if u don't know what an ''old school shooter'' is then read on in this paragraph if u do know what it is then skip to the next paragraph the review continues there now old school shooters are games that force u to scavenge for resources that in each level theer are just enough resources to get u by there are also secrets that u can find and they do different things in every old school shooter and these types of games are very hard meaning u are going to die alot (all u Dark Souls fans will be used to that happening by now)and they tend to have very maze-like missions I don't believe old school shooters are made anymore unfortunately It is about u are an American spy named ''BJ Blaskowitz'' i'm not messing ur name is actually BJ....anyway u are sent with ''Agent 1'' to investigate a German project led by the ''SS Paranormal Division'' so that tells u everythign about the game this is ridiculous it involves zombies mutants super soldiers a weird undead boss and of course the good old SS and the Heer (that was the Regular German army) so at the start of the game Agent 1 is killed but he isn't important so u shouldn't carePros:Fun gameplayVery hard difficultyInteresting weaponsGreat replayability Interesting story Interesting weaponsFair gameplay (as far as old school shooters go anyway)Good endingFun boss fightsCons:Disappointing final battleRidiculous diffuculty spikes at periods In the end it is a very fun game and I am a fan of hard games (yes I like Dark Souls) and old school shooters this game is a perfect example of an old school shooter and is very enjoyable however it's difficulty or mechanics or maybe both may put alot of people off and just because of my playtime don't assume I know nothing I use to have a PS 2 and completed this game 4 times on that so I know perfectly well what i'm talking about but if I rated it a score I would give it a 9/10 it's a must buy if ur an old school shooter fan or like hard games if not then this could be a hard sell for u but that concludes this review.

												This game is a masterpiece. Best Wolfenstein game ever. After you complete the game, play it again with the ""stoopid mod."" It's awesome.Also check out RTCW: Enemy Territory. It's mostly just bots these days but you can find a few servers with actual players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												shooting nazis.This is the third game in the Wolfenstein FPS series and fifth overall, released in 2001 and still playable even today, especially when compared with its preceding titles. (Not that they were bad, but they are considerably more dated.) Notably, it was developed by Gray Matter Studios, the same people behind Call of Duty's expansion pack United Offensive, with help from Nerve Software. iD only published it.You play as Agent B.J. Blazkowicz, allied saboteur/spy/killing machine sent behind Nazi lines in World War II to...spy on the Nazis, specifically their paranormal activities. Unfortunately, you and your fellow agent-in-arms are captured and sent to the ubiquitous Castle Wolfenstein, where you must make your escape from the retrofitted dungeon.The gameplay consists of making your way through levels and fulfilling objectives in any available manner you see fit - there's little hand-holding here. The levels are designed well and realistically, and even when they are linear it does a good job of convincing you otherwise, like in Half-Life.Obviously there are Nazis in your way, and the number of weapons you get to choose from to kill them grow in accordance with the types you'll face. RTCW starts out akin to Call of Duty: World at War, but starts to resemble something more like that game's zombie mode pretty quickly and gets hairier from there.The gunplay is great. Most of your weapons are generally useful, and you'll go from blasting troopers with a pilfered MP40 to silencing enemies with a silenced Sten that is both accurate and great fun to use, to roasting all manner of monsters with flamethrowers, Panzerschrecks and other big guns.Interactivity isn't something you might expect from a game like this, but there's a good amount of it here. If an enemy sets off an alarm, you are capable of switching it off or simply destroying it to silence the alarm. You have a dedicated kick button, which lets you kick down doors and destroy objects with your mighty boot such as pictures of Hitler. Sometimes you must do things like destroying walls to continue. There are also secrets to be found in the levels, containing health, ammunition and sometimes Nazi treasure, akin to Wolf3D. The treasure does nothing but increase your treasure counter at the end-of-level score screen, but it's nice to grab it anyway.There are two stealth levels that are nice ideas in theory but can prove frustrating and sometimes nonsensical in practice. Expect them to take a few tries, and don't be afraid to save. There are also ways to take stealthy approaches to the other missions, which are much more enjoyable.The game has 3 difficulty settings, which are basically akin to the three hardest from Wolfenstein 3-D, the easiest setting from that game being removed. Playing on the middle difficulty, by the time you're nearing the end of the game it will prove rather challenging, with health and armor (especially armor) in short supply and a good amount of tough enemies...and those are just the regular mooks. There is no shame in quicksaving at certain points, or really ever but that's another matter. The AI is generally good, but not perfect (elite troops barrel rolling into walls come to mind), and while the final boss has the distiction of being easier than the levels preceding it you still need to watch yourself.I have not played the multiplayer, but as far as I know it still has a relatively small amount of players. It primarily revolves around Axis players defending installations from Allied attackers, and is class-based. There is also a free multiplayer-only title out there called Enemy Territory that contains more features.Overall I'd place RTCW as a slightly below-average length game, but with how atmospheric and difficult it can be you'll likely spend a decent chunk of time during your first playthrough.RTCW runs off the Quake III Arena engine, which means fast default movement speeds and strafejumping when the levels permit it, but you can change it to a slower walk if you wish for a more realistic/difficult game. I'm sure this accounts for the graphics, as well, because when you max it out (and it's easy to do), the game looks very good, especially for a 2001 title! There is a fan patch to increase resolution sizes beyond 1028x760 and enable widescreen, but I personally couldn't get it to work and I didn't feel a need for it.The plot, as befitting a Wolfenstein game of this period in the series, revolves around sci-fi/occult Nazi meddling with a bit of camp and a portion of horror. It can get outlandish at times, but the atmosphere the game presents only serves to complement it. If you're at all interested in secret Nazi stuff and alternate history, or blowing up secret Nazi stuff - especially with their own wunderwaffe - you'll probably like it.Tony Jay is a voice actor here, and he's good as usual. That's worth quite a bit, at least.While the game is good, I'm not sure about the Elite Guards. They're an all-woman enemy force, and while it's nice to see women taking action-oriented roles I could do without them wearing revealing outfits that I'm not sure are entirely practical. They serve as challenging enemies at least, but that's about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite its age it still is a great FPS even today, the WW2 horror atmosphere is amazing!The weapons in it, existent and non, are awesome, especially the minigun/venom gun is one the best I have found in a game (together with the one in Unreal Tournament).The game is also very fast paced (kind of like its predecessor and even more like the first two Doom games, something the third Doom lacked to compensate the heavy horror atmosphere), so killing enemies with these great weapons and while listening to its epic score is a rare pleasure.Nazis, zombies/monsters, experiments gone wrong, dark magic, awesome weapons, fast pace, epic soundtrack, what more could you ask?

												Return to Castle is a first person shooter that seemed like a Pre-Cursor to DOOM 3, given the development history of DOOM 3.This is a infinite times better than The New Order. It's fun, fast-paced, funny quotes from the Nazi. and has a big weapon variety, and enemy variety as well with the mutants, female assassins, and nazi soldiers. It's also more gameplay focused than story driven that TNO tried too hard to be. Also, UberSoldats are the best and tough to kill because of their rocket launchers.Just to clarify, Gameplay > everything else. It's all about fun, not putting so much focus into a silly story that killed the canon one of id Software's early games.Get it! Great fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An amazing fps! If your used to run and gun shooters you'll love this. First off let me say that this game does have recoil which might be weird for an old school shooter but you get used to it, just remember to fire in short bursts. This is old school, so no regen health, no iron sights, no hand holding, no 2 weapon limit etc. the way it should be. Also one more thing to note is that this game is hard and i mean brutly hard. You will be quicksaving often as its very easy to die. Overall this is a great game and i recommended to the older fps crowd looking for some old school fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For all you CoD players saying this game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ this was 2001, and this game. THIS GAME, is the godfather of brown, generic shooters like Call of Duty.So let's talk about the games ambienceWell, the crypt levels have perfect ambience due to the entry cutsceneEverything else is pretty good, compared to the resources and technology they had.The developers? Well, this is a three-way development, with Grey Matter making the game, Activision being the publisher, and id Software overseeing the entire thing.Now let's talk about graphics The graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to today's standards, but this was the Quake 2 engine. The difficulty is just like any other difficulty, it makes the enemies do more damage and take more shots, but it's harder due to the lack of regenerating health.Yep, you have to run around every previous area just for a small medkit.Did I mention that this game has secrets?Well, not the secrets as a dancing bunny rabbit, I mean treasure that increases your score at the end of the level.So this game has leaderboards, then why is everything singleplayer?For one, this was when gaming was a social thing, so you can head to the pub and brag about your score in Return to Castle Wolfenstein to your friends.

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a  pretty solid game with some minor issues. Level design is pretty good in this game. It's definitly not a corridor shooter like most modern games. However I felt that a lot of secret rooms should of included health and armor instead of just treasure. Health, armor, and weapons are the reason I look for secret rooms so as to help me progress further into the game not collectables. The quicksave system is slightly annoying. Whenever I would quicksave and then die shortly afterwards the game would not load the last quicksave but instead whatever was last loaded. So you would die, then the game would load an older save, then you have to  reload the new save. It gets quite irksome after a while and the only way around it is to immediatily quickload after qucksaving. I felt the gunplay was ok given when this game came out. I do feel that the AI in this game has unreasonable accuracy though. Their were numerous occasions where I was about to snipe someone who doesn't even see me and they would spot me at the last second and immediatly shoot and hit me sometimes before the character model even turned around fully. I didn't really care about the story that much but I don't think anyone really cares about that. Overall I would say Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a decent FPS that is really starting to show it's age. It's still by all means playable though and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an FPS that isn't a corridor shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best multiplayer experiences for a fair and balanced game. Most of the game modes require you to have one of each of the classes to actually have a chance of winning. Unlike the other FPS games like COD, CounterStrike etc where one person could carry the team, this game required teamwork.The single player was one of my favourites growing up. Delving into the mysticism of the Nazi occult with great gameplay. Well worth a couple of quid for hours of entertainment.If you do want to try out the Multiplayer (And i highly reccomend) then you should look on the forums for a fix to the servers as ID have stopped support.

												This being one of the formative games of my teenage years, I expected to trip balls on nostalgia when playing this, and delete it and forget it. However, what I found was an incredibly solid and challenging shooter (and the best looking game from its era) that somehow made killing Nazis seem cool and different, despite being from 2001 - the eye of the WW2 shooter storm.The secret to RTCW's success is solid core gameplay complimented by sound technical design, loads of atmosphere, and a thematically colourful and interactive world. The running and shooting all works very well, and the variety of weapons and enemy types all make for a compelling and exciting FPS. The stealth works, and the number of silenced weapons you are given allow the player the change their play-style from time to time. It's not a central feature, but it works well enough to compliment the game rather than detract from it, which is more than I expected. But this all would mean little if it weren't for the layers draped over the framework.The level design, while not always consistent in terms of level length or complexity, is more often than not interesting, and the variety of environments leaves the player feeling like they've experienced a great deal between the beginning and the end of the game. At its best, RTCW has multiple routes that the player can take, and plenty of secrets to uncover for the completionist. However, if one chooses to run and gun, the action is responsive and the enemies well-programmed and well-placed enough to compliment this play style as well. The game is just dripping with atmosphere, and this is in no small part due to the fantastic sound design. The soundtrack is excellent, and on par with the classic Medal of Honor soundtracks from back when that name actually meant something. Since the narrative covers both battle-oriented military settings and creepy horror, tonally the music shifts frequently and dictates the level of tension in an individual mission, saturating the player with emotion before a single thing has happened - this is especially noticable in the creepier levels. The weapon sounds are similarly powerful and convey a sense of accuracy skewed just enough towards dramatic licence to give each shot a sense of fulfilling drama. A small but powerful feature is the changing sound of the gunfire as the enemies move further away - the crack of a nearby rifle gives way to a dull thud as they are fired in the distance, and enhances the tension of the battles as your brain is left to process the direction and distance of the shot, and you are immersed further into the world. I found the voice acting to be delightfully tongue-in-cheek as the actors embrace the schlocky nature of the story and deliver their lines entertainingly, allowing the tone of the game to shift from moment to moment and lifting the game beyond a single note played ad infinitum. I also was pleased with the in-game narrative dealt up to the player. Whilst there are a number of cutscenes that are not always that compelling, from level-to-level one can find a number of papers to read, or pick up on enemy conversations that are shockingly effective at rounding out the otherwise faceless goons that you plow through. One particular example is a conversation between and officer and a subordinate regarding a soldier that has been sent to the wine cellar to find some wine and has failed to return. As you venture around the level you can eventually hear some drunken singing, and you find the soldier in question staggering around one of the cellars. Not only does this give the NPCs some personality, but it also adds to the larger narrative, in which you are infiltrating a city in which there are a number of officers gathering for an event. You know how they're occupying themselves, and how they treat those around them, and it all adds up to make you feel like you're in a real place, which is essential for a game that is trying to sell you a fictional story of such outlandish proportions. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid shooter that is a cut above the rest in terms of imagination and personality. P.S. In 2001, the leather-clad she-Nazis were the hottest things in gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does a fast shooter that's half Quake and half classic WWII fps sound fun? Do you think WWII could have been livened up alot more by cybernetically augmented abominations and zombies? THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!Holds up quite well, other then the craptacular forest level which is one of the worst stealth scenarios I recall ever being put in. A lot of fun, and really hard, even on the easiest difficulty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An old Classic I've played through it a few times and play it when I'm bored and want something to do. I'm using a texture HD mod that breathes some new life into the game as well. Some stupid bits like the female enemies equipped with British weapons and the undead warriors that can block and reflect bullets with wooden shields. A shame that the 2009 game is not available on steam anymore.Try it for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this game when first came out. This game awesome and exciting, great graphics at the time and I couldn't get enough.I am not a game playing geek (well maybe so), just a grandmother and enjoy shooters. Never play online team just by myself and it certainly clears the cobwebs. Liked it better than Wolfenstein that came next.I would definitely say you need to play before the new game..

												This review is based mostly on the CD ROM and gog.com (DRM-free) releases of Return To Castle Wolfenstein. So my Steam stats leave out alot.PROS:+ Tight and Fluid controls.+ Great sense of atmosphere.+ Diverse locales. From Castles overun by Nazis to creepy crypts to military bunkers to weapons research labs.+ Equally diverse enemies. From Nazi troops to midevil zombies to bio-engineered monsters to low-tech cyborgs.+ Environments feel explorative at times.+ Multiplayer is fun and kept alive via user run servers.+ Very low hardware requirements. + A steal at only $5 (USD).CONS:- Graphics snobs will take issue.- No Linux or Mac support. Running RtCW on Linux via Wine is rather iff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have never tried this legendary game or have lost your copy, now is a good chance to buy this! :) Price is right (atm. 2,49e). There are still few multiplayer servers available (ours too) and even though they can be empty mostly, players are there. Singleplayer campaign is fun of course too.Dated graphics and stuff, but it is fun! I've played it since it was first released (or the first demo...). Most hours of course towards the multiplayer.Help to get the game working if problems (especially for multiplayer) can be found from many sources, but also from our web forum: http://s2.excoboard.com/mad4funCheers...

												Classic ""must have"" FPS game. There's a good old HP bar which makes this game harder. Sometimes one attempt is not enough to complete the level. It took me around 20 hours to complete the single-player campaign for the first time. This game is defnitely fast and dynamic, the gameplay is a good mix of styles - gun blazing, fast running, and even stealth - you must complete the entire mission without making any noise, which is great. The weapons are just normal, you can find many well-known weapons from world war II, like german MP-40 or classic american M1A1 Thompson. The effects are incredible, especially flame. AI ain't all that bright, but it's not a big deal after all. The good thing is you can always try to sneak from the back and backstab your enemy. In conclusion, I highly recommend this game for everybody, it's definitely worth your money, so just grab your wallet and purchase it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Man, this is the best Wolfenstein game out there and one of my all time favorite FPS games. I wouldnt mind if they did a remake of this one. Here you have a nice story, a lot of cool enemies, a lot of weapons to choose from and interesting locations. Why they dont make games like this anymore? The new Wolfenstein is a complete let down compared to this one. Buy this game if you like FPSs, its one of the best even though the graphics are a bit old, but the gamplay is still top notch.

												This is one of my all-time favourites and for me the best game in the Wolfenstein series.The story is that you play as Bj blazkowicz (you play as him in all of the games), you work for the O.S.A (office of secret actions) and you are to ruin the Nazis plans to bring back an ancient Germanic prince in hopes he will win the war for them, this also delves into the supernatural and horrific science themes, but at the end of the day the story matters least in this game. Wolfenstein has always been about mixing old with what’ new at the time so the old aspects in this are that: you collect health and armour, you carry all of your weapons at once, you run really quickly, and there are secret areas, other than scopes you fire from the hip. Then there are all of the newer elements such as actual objectives, stealth, a weapon handling system, and stamina. The levels are very diverse and you won’t be in the same looking area in a different section of the game again. The stealth is done  by destroying the alarms, slowly walking or crouching up on enemies and stabbing them with your knife, or you could shoot them with the silenced luger, the silenced sten or the silenced and thermal vision scoped m1 carbine. There are only two missions where stealth is mandatory, the rest you can go all guns blazing. There are a few things that replicate Wolfenstein 3d such as you can eat chicken just like in wolf 3d, there are plenty of secret areas where you’ll collect treasure just like in wolf 3d and you even start out in the same way (in your cell with a dead Nazi soldier only with a pistol and a knife), you have tons of weapons nearly all of them are war time weapons but two of them are: a mini-gun that liquefies people and a tesla gun, all of the machine guns (except for the mini-gun) are best used with controlled bursts to kill the enemies as quickly as possible. There are quite a few types of enemies in this game half of them you’ll find to be really annoying. This game does get increasingly difficult and I half to mention this one boss fight half way through the game is one of the highest difficulty spikes and one of the most annoying boss fights I’ve seen in a game. It’s a super solider (heavily armoured cyborg Nazi) who has a tesla gun (a gun that shoots an electric beam when they use it) so if he can see you he’s going to shoot you and it will drain your health pretty quickly and to make things worse the fight takes place in a very open area. Now that I mention that when you use the tesla gun it has a really short range, and it isn’t very accurate and it isn’t all that effective whereas when a super solider has one it’s a laser pointer that drains your health really quickly. Also near the end of the game the regular enemies will sometimes get stuck in this sort of staggering animation where it seems like they take very little damage, and for some reason on the second last mission the paratroopers seem to take much more damage than they can from the rest of the game.Other than that this remains one of my favourites and you should definitely play this game if you like old school shooters.

												This game is very close to my heart I used to play it with my brother all the time was I was little, but less of that and more of the actual game. Obviously we all have different opinions on what games are good or not and how well they’ve aged, but to me this game to me has aged very well, currently playing it and thoroughly enjoying it, I’m about half way through and have 5 hours, but I did not look for secrets I just played the game, looking for secrets would probably add 1 or 2 hours, that being said with game times when it comes to replayability I’m not too sure, I myself would happily play the game again on a harder difficulty but others may just play once and never again depending on how much they enjoyed it.

												Something of a strangely forgotten classic amongst the variety of id games which have come out, and for the life of me I'm not entirely sure why.Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a re-envisioning of the first popularized first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D. In it, you take on the role of an Allied soldier working his way through waves of nazi soldiers and supernatural elements that the SS have brought to life in order to turn the tides of WWII. It's irreverent, and is actually still quite a lot of fun.I'm not sure how much of a community remains for the multiplayer element, but in its heyday this was one of the best multiplayer experiences one could have.Effectively, this is one of the few FPS I can think of which straddles the need to hide behind cover of modern shooters for the complete insanity of running into mobs of enemies of older shooters. Worth a look if you want to have some fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mein leben!Return To Castle Wolfenstein is a first-person shooter reboot of the Wolfenstein series which much like its predecessor focuses on fast-paced gunplay with a number of improvements made to compensate for the new engine technologies available at the time. Firstly, unlike Wolfenstein 3D, the developers actually tried to implement a compelling story to a franchise known for not actually having a “story”. To some degree, the story in this game, at least from a concept point of view, brings something new to the table by adding elements of occult. The plot revolves around the American soldier, B.J. Blazkowicz, trying to impede the Nazis from discovering and extracting a serum hidden in an ancient tomb capable of augmenting soldiers into “Dark Knights”, an evil undead army from the 9th Century. Nazis and occult? Absurd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but what’s not to like. However, while the concept does enhance the single-player campaign, the story itself is mostly ignorable since it generally feels like it is there to fill in the space. Blazkowicz, while a total badass, still remains one of the blandest protagonists in existence. He takes orders from his superiors like a puppet with no remorse or personal motives. Even when the Allies want to give him a medal for his efforts and persumably a well deserved break at the end, he is somewhere outside still kicking Nazi butt. Boy, he sure is souless; born with only one scope in life: to kill Nazis for eternity. Plus, it is silly how the Allies' solution to most problems is to send a ""one-man army"" to take down Nazi headquarters single-handedly without even breaking a sweat. But that is Wolfenstein after all; it purposely does not need to explain how Blazkowicz does it -- and hey, some ancient voodoo magic is involved, so anything is justifiable, right? Fortunately, the story did manage to create the cool villain by the name of Deathshead, who later becomes the franchise’s main antagonist.The gunplay in here is hasty but satisfying, reminiscent of older games such as Quake, Doom and Unreal Tournament, and unquestionably the strongest point of the game. While it all boils down to sprinting and shooting enemies in quick manners, the game does offer some moments of straightforward stealth where you get to sneak behind enemy lines. Additionally, there is an adequate variety in enemies from the deadly female squads in tight leather uniforms (those butts though) to juggernauts like the Über-Soldats. Different weapons are at Blazkowicz’s disposal too, with the Tesla gun being the most fun one to use, even if the MP40 probably becomes the most practical throughout most of the game, thus making pistols pretty redundant. One problem with the weapons though is the fact you never seem to run out of ammo. Retrospectively now, the gunplay does feel very basic, but mostly thanks to its fast paced action killing waves of enemies does not get dull, surprisingly enough.The level design has the mentality of most shooters back in the late '90s and early noughties based on maze-like corridors and paths, essentially allowing the player the freedom to pick whichever route to travel back and forth within the somewhat confined space. Exploration is also encouraged and rewarded by finding secret chambers filled with collectables, even if these give no gameplay advantages to the player. Graphically, at the time, the game looked great but as time went by its visuals sure look dated today. On the other hand, the same cannot be said to its soundtrack which even to this day remains memorable and rather ageless. When you can recognise a level/map by a specific track from the soundtrack, then you know the soundtrack left a good impression.Boasting a strong single-player campaign, (wherther you take the story seriously or not), many probably remember the game for its multiplayer component which at the time was very popular and considered by many superior than the campaign, even as far as being regarded one of the best multiplayer components in a game ever. I cannnot argue with that, although it was not until the highly acclaimed free standalone Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory came out that the multiplayer component peaked in popularity. Featuring a class-based gameplay similar to Team Fortress, two teams (Allies and Axis) fight each other to complete objectives on various maps. Personally, I spent far too many hours in the multiplayer alone when I was younger because it was balanced and had a very enjoyable experience. Currently, the multiplayer from Return To Castle Wolfenstein seems dead. Rest in peace.In conclusion, Return To Castle Wolfenstein still remains a classic in the eyes of many, including myself, who played it in its heydays online and/or offline, and a milestone on PC. But it definitely lost its relevance and appeal to the general public as years have passed due to more ambitious and realistic shooters showing up years later. More old-school than modern, it still is a solid shooter, nevertheless, which does not spoil the player with today’s regenerative health and cover-base mechanics and can still provide enough hours of fun mindlessly killing Nazis. Pick it up only for nostalgic purposes or if you are curious to see how fast-paced shooters were like more than a decade ago in case you never grew up with them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best FPSs I've ever played (Serious Sam aside, but that's a more Serious story). It has everything that a good FPS has to offer, long and challenging enough, the missions and surroundings are varied enough, immersive atmosphere CHECK, good storyline with fantasy and sci-fi elements also some additional real history to make it more interesting CHECK. Awesome single player mode CHECK, surprisingly addictive multiplayer mode with epic mods CHECK (with a still active community with dozens of people to play with, even after more than a decade has passed since the game's release, not to mention the master server's recent shutdown).In a nutshell it's a must have for the older ones and a key part of the Video Game History for the younger ones to discover.

												I recommend this game – next time it is 75% off in a steam sale, pick it up! Works fine on Windows Vista, at least. The graphics are obviously a little old looking now, but the levels are still fun to head around and some of the secrets feel rewarding to find. There’s a few times in the games where you get your weapons/armour reset so once you’ve played once you can remember those times and use up all of the ammo etc in the last level before the re-set. When I had this game the first time round the multiplayer was a lot of fun, but it seems to be a pain to get running and find other players now. Might as well play free Team Fortress 2 for that. Took me less than ten hours to go through single player with a lot of the secrets from memory, but if you didn’t play it before you could get more time out of it – and at 75% off it is pennies per hour of entertainment!

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is overall a pretty good title. While it isn't an AMAZING title, I can't think of anything that I didn't like about the game. Everything it does is at minimum good.PROS:- Good mix of different kinds of missions, from run in and blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything to sneak around and try not to sound the alarm.- The guns are very well balanced so you will actually find yourself probably using almost every type of artillary you can get your hands on. Each type of gun is suited to different types of situations and/or enemies.- Good balance of different types of enviornments from castles, crypts, dams, ice fields, arial bases, etc.When I think of how to rate a game I try to compare it to similar games of its genre within its time period. I think Duke 3D is a better title than Return in general. And System Shock 2 is well... System Shock 2. That game is omega tier good. Return to Castle Wolfenstein isn't quite as good as either of those titles but it is still a lot of fun. Return takes about 10 hours play time to finish. 8.5/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest im only playing this game because its the only thing the windows xp runs. But, even if i didnt plan on playing this too much it is a really great game but to make it easier on your self make checkpoints. because nothing sucks more than to retry a mission 11 times and have to go for a thirteenth because you were near the end of the mission and didnt watch your back but yea. if you are true gamers where gameplay is more important than graphics and classic games are better than CoD then this is the game for you!

												After almost 10 years resting Wolfenstein returns under hands that's not Id Software... And how did that fare? Very, very well!This game pays a good tribute to its predecessors while still standing on its own as a new experience. And to be honest, what beats killing Nazis? If you're tired of the way FPS games has been evolving these past 5-6 years the I'd recommend that you pick this game up, get a fresh experience of a classic and a challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game – next time it is 75% off in a steam sale, pick it up! Works fine on Windows Vista, at least. The graphics are obviously a little old looking now, but the levels are still fun to head around and some of the secrets feel rewarding to find. There’s a few times in the games where you get your weapons/armour reset so once you’ve played once you can remember those times and use up all of the ammo etc in the last level before the re-set. When I had this game the first time round the multiplayer was a lot of fun, but it seems to be a pain to get running and find other players now. Might as well play free Team Fortress 2 for that. Took me less than ten hours to go through single player with a lot of the secrets from memory, but if you didn’t play it before you could get more time out of it – and at 75% off it is pennies per hour of entertainment!

												As I was scrolling through my games list looking for a game my laptop could actually run, my eye caught Return to Castle Wolfenstein. I hadn't played it for almost 10 years and I decided to give it a shot. Honestly, I was blown away with how well it has aged.It's a shooter, but it's constructed very well. The levels are linear, but they also feel open. Lots of corridors and extra rooms to explore (2 or more secret areas for those who wish to find them). The shooting feels and sounds good. Each gun has it's own unique punchy sound and there's a huge variety. By the end of the game, you're carrying 11 different guns and 3 different explosives.The story is cheesy and the voice acting is awful, but it's intriguing. If you've ever been fascinated with the Nazi's rumored interests in experimental weaponry, the paranormal and other weird things, RtCW takes that and runs with it.My only complaint, is that some of the enemies are very bullet-spongy. It could take 5-6 rounds from the Paratrooper Rifle (the best in the game IMO) to take down a Paratrooper solider. Some enemies can even withstand more than one or two rounds from a sniper rifle. Annoying.If you ever want to play an ""older"" shooter, give RtCW a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised.Note: Be sure to download the community patch that enables widescreen. It's a simple drag and drop installation and stable. I had no issues during my 8 hours with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a borderline Recommend (call it 3 stars out of 5).  First, the good:  the story that drives the game is a good one and, for a game initially released back in 2001, the graphics are pretty good.   The cut-scenes and voice acting are also pretty good.   The initial key-binding are awful, but with a little effort they can be made to approximate current bindings.Now, for the less-than-good:  there's nothing really wrong with the game, but the fact that the player can't affect the outcome in any way drags it down for me.  Specifically, most levels have Secret Areas (SAs) and Treasures.  But, whether or not you enter those SAs or pick up any Treasures is irrelevant.  You get nothing useful outside of the box saying you've found all the SAs/Treasures when you leave the level (and maybe some additional health, ammo, or armor).  Also, even though I used ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein Single Player v1.42c Unofficial Patch"" to fix various bugs and allow me to use my standard 1920x1200 resolution, I still ran across a few glitches associated with those SAs.  Specifically, in one case, even though I found, opened and looted a certain SA, the game refused to give me the credit for it.  In another case, when I entered one SA, I couldn't manage to leave it.  Also, in every level, you can go back to search for the SAs once you've cleared the it of enemies.  Except for one level.  But, again, that means nothing to how the game plays out.So, all-in-all, it's an OK game.  If you favor straight shooters over more quest-driven action games, you'll probably like this better than I did.  It's currently listing for about $10 and is on sale for $5.  At $5, it's a buy.  At $10, you might want to think about it a bit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A title deserving of the accolade of ""classic"". Mostly holds up after a decade, except for a few nuts and bolts. I naturally assue you ignore the graphics, you see, because this was another time and the general boxiness of the rooms and objects can be quite funny. However, the level design is very good, in the tradition of early shooters. Similar remarks can be made about the gunplay. If you like your shooters old, warts and all, this is a must.And even if you don't, it's cheap, short and satisfying. At a civilized difficulty, it will be fairly easy to blast through the game in a few hours.Also, hilarious german accents.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic entry into the FPS genre, combining fun, classic, gameplay with open-ended level design on many levels and a variety of ways to approach combat.  The AI is smart enough to keep it challenging even today, and there's not shortage of interesting weapons to use against them.  Don't be surprised when you find out later that Nazi's aren't the only thing to worry about.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over ten years after playing this game, I still play it to this day!! I play the single player game and desprately try to find MP games. The official server for RTCW is down now, but Enemey Territory is still going for multiplayer. Enemy territory is the MP only aspect of RTCW, and lives on. This game is so worth playing for SP alone!!!! Just buy it. It's on sale, and you'll experience one of the greatest gems of gaming ever. Sorry, but I can't say enough about the single player aspect, AND the multiplayer aspect. If you end up downloading Enemy Territory, try to find 'The Beach' map. The one where your objective is to grab documents deep below ground of an Axis base. I'm about to try to find this map myself in Enemy Territory. It is too nastalgic, Sorry for my spelling. I'm a little drunk and a little over excited from talking about this classic game. One of the BEST ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had never experienced this game before I bought it a few days ago here in Steam. I knew it was a very well received classic, and I wanted to get to know it just to educate myself since some of the people I know have expressed their love for this game.It runs very well for such an old game, and the gameplay is very accessible. The maximum resolution is a bit too small for my taste, but I believe it is easily possible to modify it otherways. I just didn't care enough to actually do it myself.The story is in the same time quite deep and still light. The overall atmosphere is supported with various notes you can find from the environment, and it helps a lot in the immersion. There is also some really fun dialogue, and the story doesn't take itself too seriously. Reminds me a lot of James Bond and Indiana Jones.The best part of it of course was to shoot a lot of nazis. Didn't care all that much about the monsters and bosses.I totally recommend this game especially if you haven't played it before like me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you put a World War 2 shooter in front of me, I'd usually look up at you and say ""Excuse me, this isn't what I ordered! Take it back and try again!"". My dislike of them is quite high. So when everyone started singing the praises of Wolfenstein: The New Order, I thought ""Looks like I better have a go with at least one of them"" and gave Return to Castle Wolfenstein a shot. Turns out I quite liked it.You probably already know about Return to Castle Wolfenstein. A First-Person Shooter set in an alternate reality where the Nazis usually have access to technology they normally wouldn't do. In this case, it's occult magic! As B.J. Blazkowicz, it is your job to find out what the Nazis are up to, kill them all through fairly linear levels and not say a single word to anyone. Bullets are all the talking this fella needs.B.J. Blazkowicz will be sent to some very different locations over the course of seven chapters, slowly understanding what Heinrich Himmler and the ""SS Paranormal Division"" are up to. The locations are nicely constructed and have some nice variation to them.I have to say, I wasn't expecting as much stealth as there was which was a pleasent surprise. I'd definitely call this a FPS Stealth game. Unfortunately, the game does have a habit of forcing this in some parts of missions. You get seen, its ""MISSION FAILED"" and back to the beginning for you. That's how real life works right?These sections tend to be brief though and, outside of these constraints, the overall stealth works really well. You can be rewarded with eavesdropping over funny little conversations the Nazis have if you manage to stealth around. If you screw up majorly with stealthing, not every enemy in the map is alerted about it (unless an alarm goes off). This gaves the player the chance to recover from mistakes and keeps the game interesting.There are plenty of secrets are to be found around the levels, usually containing Nazi Gold. One thing I really liked about this game is, before you're just about to finish a level, the game will tell you how many secrets and Nazi gold you found, giving you the opportunity to turn around and go back and find it! A feature that needs to be in more games with this sort of stuff inside it. Don't let me finish the level and THEN tell me what I missed, making me reload an earlier save if I have one at all if I want to go find all the goodies.The secrets aren't too hard to find and don't add anything to the overall outcome of the game, just fun little rewards for exploration.If I have a few gripes with the game (and I always do), the  snipers can feel a bit unfair on the higher difficulty levels  and  the end boss was laughably bad. Just circle-strafe around it and shoot until dead  but they didn't sour the experience too much.Overall, an enjoyable game.For the best experience possible, use the unofficial patch from here > http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love playing this game back when I have it for the PS2, so it's natural to want to buy and play it again for the PC on Steam.But this damn thing just doesn't wanna work. Well, it did work ONCE, then it just craps itself or gives me a greyscreen everytime I tried to start it.Tried all the fixes and unofficial patches, even edited the .cfg files and guess what? It didn't work.Reinstalling also didn't fix it. If a game wastes about nearly an hour of your time trying to fix it and didn't even get 10 minute's worth of gameplay, then it ain't worth it.

												I love playing this game back when I have it for the PS2, so it's natural to want to buy and play it again for the PC on Steam.But this damn thing just doesn't wanna work. Well, it did work ONCE, then it just craps itself or gives me a greyscreen everytime I tried to start it.Tried all the fixes and unofficial patches, even edited the .cfg files and guess what? It didn't work.Reinstalling also didn't fix it. If a game wastes about nearly an hour of your time trying to fix it and didn't even get 10 minute's worth of gameplay, then it ain't worth it.

												What a strange, strange game.  This game has an enjoyable single player game and most of the weapons are fun.  The idea is as basic as the really old old FPS games.  You start out in a room, hear strange noises, kill nazies/demons, and unlock doors.  I did love the atmosphere in this game and some of the levels looked interesting at the time... they look aged now.  My only gripe is that the few bosses the game did have....only made you wish it had more awesome bosses.This is still a decent, atmosphere, old school style game that I would recommend to anyone that missed it during its release.  I enjoyed it better than Far Cry (though the games are nothing alike), and the original Call of Duty game back in the day.   Worth it if you like old school shooter, horror, and killing nazi's~!

												RTCW is simply one of the best first person shooters ever made. Even now mid way through 2014, the game still looks spectacular and the level design and ai are stellar. So if you like your WWII shooter mixed with a lot of Dr. Frankenstein, than what are you wating for?RTCW is a must play - period. (And that 88 metacritic score should actually be a 95 by the way).

												Not only the best Wolfenstein game, but one of the best FPS of all time. Definition of ""raising the bar"". This game will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first game I played with a 3D graphics card. Ah, the old Quantex (no longer in business) Pentium II, 233 mgz and no memory to speak of. The GeForce I crammed in was too powerful for the old bird and continually crashed the system. The game ran like♥♥♥♥♥ but it ran, and I must have played through it ten times in a row. Great action, great sound, great story. Kudos for the subtle humor and attention to detail. Nails the pseudo-serious atmosphere perfectly; you could leave all the occult stuff out and it would still be a quality war game about killing Nazis, but there's a fantastic science-fiction story to boot! Legendary.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nothing about this game is great, every category is a 7/10 or 8/10 at best. I felt like a lot of the levels were copied straight from Goldeneye, but were still lame & dreary. There's nothing wrong with this game, its just mediocre or okay at everything. The terminator fights are BS, the paratrooper rifle makes it too easy, the cinematics are boring, the graphics look bland, the final boss is too easy. Most of all, instant failure stealth missions are STUPID.  Most games dont do that now.  But on the plus side, there's nothing wrong with this game, its a functionally ok FPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is morally challenging as it puts you in the shoes of one the most evil people in history, the allies. It is morally frustrating as i'd prefer to play as the good guys (The Nazis). The gameplay is great as it's a challenge because you play as a jew (as they are weak and inferior to the nazis). I think it's good that games potray Nazis. We've mr clean in commercials, now it's in video games. 10/10 would recommend. Not for the light heartedas killing the arian race is quite sad to do. Keep on white brother and keep our race strong.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Return to Castle Wolfenstein. General overview - average.Graphics - 5/10Sounds - 7/10Mechanics - 5/10Storyline - 4/10This game was released in 2001 and naturally, the graphics look dated. There is a total of 7 linear missions to blast your way through and, as per all ID software games, there are hidden areas and goodies to be had. The sound is average and unfortunately the developers had the German soldiers speaking in German accented English. This is very dull compared to Wolfensteins occasional screams of 'mein laben!' and 'achtung!'.Lucky there is a variety of guns to put to good use from your tradional dagger to pistols to machine guns to a tesla gun (among others). With all the options I found there was too much ammo in the game. The AI aren't completely stupid and will often hide and make you flush them out. They will also try to avoid grenades and will sometimes kick them back to you! They also have the ability to notice dead comrades and realise something is amiss and will either come searching for you or sound the alarm.The story line is a little lacking making me feel they just chucked in a heap of fluff to try and get some length to the game. It does, however, take you everywhere from towns, snow peaks, large open areas and underground caverns (to name a few) so there is plenty to see.Conclusion : Don't expect epic content from this game but if you'd like to take a crack at a classic then this would definately count.Other notes : I would go through the process of creating a saved game. I would have to double check through the save menu to make sure it had since sometimes it didn't!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
