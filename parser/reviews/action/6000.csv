TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:An old game (by the time I wrote this review) but a great game nonetheless.As you might know, this is a Star Wars game based on the Clone Wars era where you are the leader of an elite Clone Commando Unit tasked with some of the most dangerous and most critical missions in service of the Galactic Republic.PROS:+ Story: -Amazing story that places you not in the eyes of a skillful Jedi or a powerful Sith, but in the boots of Clone Troopers fighting the war. The game delivers in terms of story with its superior voice acting by Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett) as well and the various personalities of your squad mates really adds to the experience.+ Squad Mechanics: -You cannot Rambo (go solo) this game, mainly because the squad is mandatory, BUT also because the game is brutal as hell (like most old FPS games). Enemies are really hard to kill without your squad's support requiring the players to properly order their squads into position and direct their fire when necessary.+ Graphically pleasing despite its age: -Released on 2005, this game carries a dated visual design, but pleasing nonetheless. Animation is good and the atmosphere is immersive. (I simply love the HUD in this game)+ Sound: -One of the greatest OST I have ever heard. (Vode An is the greatest of these OST)+ Gameplay: -Lengthy campaign without getting boring: There is always action around the corner.CONS:- Squad AI is a bit limited: -Although the AI, for the most part, is intelligent and is far more useful than some of the other AI partners in modern games, I feel as though a bit more could have been done. They follow command well enough.- Bugged Graphic setting in terms of Bump Mapping: -Remained unfix to this day. (can be turned off in the options menu though)Additional Note:The game is linear (corridor shooting), from start to finish. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING PEOPLE. Not all games need to be open world, specially if the game, such as this one, is trying to properly tell the story in a progressive fashion giving the player a sense of direction and purpose.CONCLUSION:MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any Star Wars fan or First Person Shooter fans.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												People often complain about the stone-faced, bald and monotomous space marines in videogames; how they're an extremely overused template and stifle the development of round characters. Republic Commando puts an interesting spin on this complaint: It gives you four clones; four space marines. That's where the complaining ends.Republic Commando is a squad based shooter set in the Star Wars universe during the Clone Wars. You play Delta 38 ""Boss"", leader of a highly specialised and extremely elite squad of Clones. You're bred with a great affinity for your clone bretheren. Your squad is as much a part of your arsenal as your special rifles and armour. Repulic Commando translates this premise to gameplay in an absolutely incredible way. You can 'direct' your squad to perform tasks while you hold off the enemy. Or you can work on the objective while you let them hold the line. The surprise in this comes from their intelligence. More often than not, CPU allies are less than helpful. Not the Clone Commandos; they are in a league of their own. They take, and move through cover, hide when the odds are against them, secure the area before helping you instead of running in headlong, and their aim is about as good as your own, so they don't feel considerably overpowered. What also helps is a careful balance of enemies. There are just enough in each room to keep it interesting, but never too many to make it feel like a grindfest. Your three squadmates (and yourself) are the bread and butter of the game's presentation. 2005 graphics haven't aged so dignified, but the artstyle gets the job done. Everything looks slightly grittier and messier than it does in the films. You'll quickly determine this when you use the melee button a droid for the first time and the grease and battery acid are wiped off your visor with a laser. The helmet display resembles that of Metroid Prime a lot, complete with ambient effects and splatter. But, enough about the visuals, the real fun is in the sound. You, and your brothers engage in a lot comic banter to keep spirits up. You, the boss are the tough as nails leader, voiced by Mr Jango Fett himself. Delta 62 ""Scorch"" is the squad's demolitions expert and all-round joker. Delta 40 ""Fixer"" is the straight man and computer specialist. And finally, Delta 07 ""Sev"", the sniper and gruesome sadist. The dialogue exchange is worth its weight in gold and because the game's pace is tight and condenced, they don't end up looping up. It gives the whole endeavor a lively character that is a nice offset to the gritty visuals. Still, there are some things you'll have to consider. The game isn't very long; you can tear through it an afternoon. Replaying it wastes some of the surprise moments, but you'll be better at some of the positioning and directions, allowing you to focus on speedrunning for instance. Some gauntlets can also feel extremely cheap at first. Sometimes you'll end up reloading a particular section over and over again because you squad gets wiped within the first 10 seconds. And then there is the ending off course. I'll let you figure that out on your own. I can reccommend this game to anyone who is a Star Wars fan, and to anyone looking for a shooter with exemplary squad AI and gameplay.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												Edit 25/11/2016I'm giving SW:RC the Test of time award because out of all of the old games from my childhood I've tried to get back into, I got back into this absolutely no problem. If graphics aren't a dealbreaker to you, try this game, it truly is one of the best Star Wars games ever made, perhaps only second to SW:KotOR.Reasons to get this game. 1. Squad banter2. Detonate explosives3. Awesome breach door manoeuvers4. Great story (short but great)5. Awesome music which fits surprisingly well with the Star Wars universe			",94,4,0,13,5,1,6

												In this game, you play as Commando Delta 38 (Boss/Leader).The game follows the story of three missions throughout Delta Squad's career in the Separatist Crisis.From fighting alongside wookies to getting your face drilled by a scavenger droid, you lead your squad to complete objectives your normal, mass produced, counterparts could/cannot.The game and story is nice, I loved it and maybe you will too. This is from the soldier's perspective as to the usual jedi perspective. The game plays pretty damn smooth on PC. I haven't had any real game-breaking problems. The game is old enough to even play on lower-end laptops. You get to actually order your squad to do things (ex.When you issue the Search and Destroy order, they become aggressive and move ahead even if you're looking around, You can order them to set demolition charges on objectives to progress or you could order them to secure the area and plant the demolition charge yourself. You can even send them to sniper/anti-armor positions as well as turrets.)If you lose all your health, you get downed and the game doesn't end until your entire squad is downed. So while you're downed you could either tell them to maintain current orders (ex. search and destroy) or order the closest squad member to revive you. There's also the option to load the last save while you're downed. There's also quicksaves, I hotkeyed mine to F1 and F3 because I can screw things up a lot. I don't think you can really get through this game without ordering your squad around. You take quite a bit of damage, even on medium difficulty. Just for future reference, don't run infront of your squad while they're firing a sniper or a anti-armor grenade. Bad things happen. . .All in all this game was great for it's time and pretty short if you know what you're doing. I just REALLY wish there was a sequal just because of the ending. . .

												The moment you boot up Republic Commando is the moment your realize this isn't your usual Star Wars games.Presented in a darker, militaristic tone, you're placed in the shoes of Boss, a freshly manufactured clone, whose the leader of a commando squad of four. The opening epitomizes the message of the game, that you're a soldier and you have to rely on your squad-mates- as a side-note, look up during the short scene on Kimino, that's the attention to detail this game has. The art-style is harsher and the droids have an threating growl to their voices (♥♥♥♥ those whiny voices Lucas went with). It certainly feels unique since it uses its own soundtrack instead of constantly using John Williams pieces as a crutch. Stylistically, the game is beautiful, with a absolutely rocking soundtrack that knows when to throw in those vocals and drum-beats. Graphically, it's a 2005 game and console port, at 60 fps and proper lighting it's better than the original xbox version for sure. However, I believe it's the art-style instead of the textures that carries the visual direction. The actual gameplay harkens back to Rainbow Six with how you use your AI partners to clear levels and focus fire. Some of my favorite aspects of the game are the fact that you can 'prep' for battle. You can order a sniper to sit back or have one of your guys bombard the enemy from grenadier nest. Now you can only do this through context sensitive actions, but it's more a feature of the level design that rewards player thought than a ""you can only proceed after using a laser-designated airstrike on these helpless sand people"".The AI is very compentent too. They will require revival, but that's only on the hardest sections of the game. I never felt like they were idiotic, and actually they keep up with you extremely well. It's no F.E.A.R, but for a squad-based shooter, the AI never failed me on the several play-throughs I've had both past and present.Augmenting this squad is your own weaponry. The standard blaster is honestly a peashooter to me, but you get a mother♥♥♥♥ing shotgun in a Star-wars game, and it is god-damn awesome. The standard blaster can be switched to both a sniper rifle and an anti-tank grenade launcher, allowing to have a total of four weapons (one weapon you can pick up from an enemy soldier) with three types of grenades. You also have a blade-fist, and like Halo, your melee attack is brutal and effective in close-combat. In total, you have a solution for every problem and ammo is given often enough to use all your tools while given sparingly enough to not go willy-nilly with sniper and rpg shots.This game has become one of my favorite Star Wars games mostly because of the characters and story. Your three squad-mates have plenty of memorable quips and though they were stereotypical in their personalities, they give that Star Wars flair that prevents the game from being a super grim-dark slog. I'd never consider them annoying and by the end of the game you really detect how the characters have become more brothers than comrades-at-arms.  Story-wise you get some background information on some of the Clone-war plot-lines from the Prequels. However you never have a moment where it overly masturbates over the prequels' storylines or characters, it plays it straight and the only time you ever see a truly iconic character from Star Wars is once. RC is it's own game and story inside the Star Wars universe and I really admire that. It doesn't need Han Solo or Luke Skywalker to be a Star Wars game. And the aforementioned moment actually comes as a real reward to an honestly disappointing ending. A pat on the back for working through the difficult sections of RC.However I have my misgivings with RC. For one it's short. Not any shorter than an average FPS campaign of today, but at the time it was a very short game. There are only a handful of worlds to go to. Although the finales end with a bang (the Republic Ghostship's final mission has the most badass ending setpiece I've ever seen in a Star Wars game), they aren't extremely varied. You're going to be inside military compounds with only a few examples having open level design (these often have squad-points where you can assign snipers and grenadiers). There will be a few stretches where you have to go down a narrow corridor. Fighting waves of enemies. Ho-humming your way along. It'd be an injustice if I didn't emphasis a 'few' though. Most often the game gives you options and some cool set-piece battles to command through.The game can also be back-breakingly hard at points. I like this, but sometimes you'll get super-bullet spongy enemies (the reason why the main blaster feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥) back to back. The super-battle droids are the worst offenders. We're talking fighting up to six of those ♥♥♥♥ers at once, in a bare-knuckled shoot-out. On harder difficulties, this can make the game undeniably frustrating. Which turns those glorious finales into a sweat-inducing curse-ridden rant.Also no sequel. When you finish this game, you will agree that it ends at the worst moment. It doesn't feel unfinished due to just how badass the ending finale is. I mean there's a stretch that basically deconstructs the entire premise of the game and makes you realize just how important your squad is. But story-wise, you'll have to read a book to ever see the end of the Republic Commando series. And honestly, the book was 'meh' like most video game books.The squad gameplay can be a bit disappointing at times. It's more arcadey than realistic, and sometimes the squadmates are there to just hide how bullet-spongy the enemies are. I'd have liked to be able to always have a guy with his sniper-rifle out rather than them having to setup. I'd also have liked to have the squad mates use grenades more often or engage in melee instead of using those aforementioned blasters. Asking them to switch to shotguns would've been the best damn thing too. But every complaint I have with the game ends with a 'however'. The squad gameplay can be meh, however the way the game uses the squad adds extreme weight to the narrative and tone. The story is abrupt, however it has so many moments in the game that have struck with me for a damn decade. The levels aren't varied, however they really give that ""behind enemy lines blowing up their♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; feeling.For $10.00, you get a game that I would mention in the same breath as KotOR 1&2 and Jedi Outcast. It's not just a great Star Wars game, it's a game I would recommend to people that know nothing about the universe. It's a game I would play even if I wasn't in the mood for a Star Wars fix. This was a work of passion for the devs, who used Star Wars as a vehicle to tell a story of cooperation and brotherhood more through the gameplay than cutscenes.EDIT: Some things I forgot to mentioned or worded poorly. For one the AI of the squadmates is competent, but the enemy droids are as dumb as they are in the Prequels. Only the Super Battle Droid or Droideka pose any threat due to their bullet-spongey nature and their constantly attacking AI pattern. An enemy force you encounter later mixes things up, but their use of cover is only so effective and they do have a habit of mixing effective tactics with standing in the open.As a whole though, the enemy variety is noteworthy. Each major faction in the Clone Wars (as were present up to episode III) is represented and has units that are both cannon fodder and those that require squad focus fire. The enemy forces are gradually changed out and each world introducing a new faction that is better than the one before. Better armored, armed, and tactical. You'll never meet a force that can truly match your Commandos, but the array or melee and ranged enemies is remarkable for such a short game. Also, there is multiplayer in RC. Do I play it? Well, once or twice. It's a deathmatch arena game in the style of older shooters. Make of that what you will.			",160,10,0,38,9,0,27

												This game packs some great action from the Star Wars universe, but uses a very limited assortment of predefined positions that enables you to command your squadmates in this tactical first-person shooter.

Tl'dr version:  One of the best Star Wars games out there. To this day, an underrated and often overlooked part of the evolution of squad based shooters; also included is a fantastic soundtrack.Great, (for the most part) A.I, and likeable squad mates make this short, but engaging ride all the sweeterElaborated version: I often find that people have a tendency to harp on about SW: Battlefront and KOTOR a little bit too much. They were great games, (especially the latter) but I found them to be deeply flawed games. SW: Republic Commando, while flawed in some ways, manages to pull everything together in a much more satisfying way. This is obviously due to it's genre, and the nature of the mission structure. Not a thing is out of place. This comes at price however; the mission structure is disjointed to say the least, and the story is bare bones. However you'll get the feeling this was deliberate, as just like in real combat, and especially if you're a 'slightly less expendable' clone, you'll not be kept up to the date with the war as a whole. The game will take it tacitly that you know the Star Wars lore already and fling references to the films at you without guilt or trepidation. For a avid SW fan this wont be a problem, I unfortunately found myself lost at some points in the dialogue.  The mechanics are just as you expect from a Squad shooter; intuitive, tight, and easy to control. The PC version runs great with a M&C set up, but a controller is also possible. It might be necessary to have button mapping software however, as the games age breaks the controls. You squad mates don't need you to hold their hand, and can perform simple tasks without you needing to give the order. However, they will occasionally rush in a 'no win scenario' and be dropped in matter of seconds under a hail of plasma fire. This will happen to you over and over, and their really is no way to stop it happening. This does have the unintended use of keeping aggro off you, while you attend to other matters. The game features the modern invent system of the FPS. That is to say. You're limited to two normal weapons, 1 special weapon, and multiple attachments to your assault rifle, thus giving the weapon variety a much needed boost. There is a weapon for every scenario. Now, onto the soundtrack. As a avid collector of game Soundtracks, this would have a proud spot on my list. In short; it's fantastic. A mixture of choral, and star wars symphony tropes mixed together to create a chilling, but engaging and epic theme. Definitely worth getting on soundtrack.Finally, onto the negatives, and they are surprisingly few. The game is no looker, and is really showing it's age as of 2015. However, over a decade on and it's vista's are still rather eye catching, especially the later missions on Kashyyyk. Also, while I said the A.I was great; that was for last decade. Now not so much. Your squad mates will get stuck on geometry and regularly fail to revive you, even if their aren't any enemies in the area. This is all forgiven however by the amazing squad dynamic of banter that is constantly being thrown around. Very rarely will you actually care what your objective is, but you'll genuinely like and care for your squad as the game progresses, and you feel like this is a family. Final thoughts: By no means a looker, and to modern audiences this game might feel slightly lost in why this game was so great back in the day, however I still recommend giving it a try if it comes on sale.

												Well  Star Wars Republic Commando is imo one of the best Star Wars games out their....may even be better then Battlefront 2 or Knights of the old republic but damn that's a hard choice. All Star Wars games are awesome. But back to  Star Wars Republic Commando.It is such a badass game. You get to command 3 Squad mates while  battling your way though the galaxy on geonosis,A creepy♥♥♥♥♥spaceship,(That level still gives me the creeps), and kashyyyk.While at the same time getting a bunch of sweet cool weapons and fighting a bunch of cool enemies. Sadly their isn't any 4 player Co op but i'm pretty sure their is or someone is gonna make a mod for that.(I hope)In general you should buy it. Star Wars fan or not buy it. Like FPS Games? Buy it. Like Star wars? ♥♥♥♥ing Buy it.All in all 10/10 One of the best games ever made imo.			",103,2,0,1,1,0,0

												One of the better Star Wars games out there. I despise the prequel trilogy, yet I still found this game to be quite good. It's an FPS where you play as the leader of an elite squad of commandos sent on the toughest of jobs.You can position your squad members, each one is supposedly skilled at different tasks, and it's mostly just blasting your way through droids and bugs in caverns, facilities, and space ships. You get the typical weapons--shotguns, pistols, sniper, rifle, etc. mostly in star-wars-style laser blasting form. It's about ten hours long, and it's a pretty good campaign with some neat set-pieces. The squad members have some fun personalities and the voice work is solid. Since it's an older game, there are no iron sights, so that might be hard to get used to. The graphics hold up well, although I do believe it lacks widescreen. There are some compatibility issues, so you might need to take a look at the forums if you run into problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On the timeline of great FPS games, Republic Commando sadly lurks in the shadow of the classics, but outdoes them in many respects. This Metroid Prime-inspired and slightly darker take on the Star Wars mythos puts you right in the shoes of a squad of covert Republic infiltrators carrying out a series of increasingly tense missions in tightly designed levels. A cohesive package of sound, graphics, and story that coalesce to form one of the ofter overlooked masterpieces of the genre.			",187,80,7,31,13,2,47

												What a shooter. Other than a little short, I can't see anything bad to say about this. Maybe a bit too much of lonely time, but it makes up in other areas. A brilliant mix of just a bit of Rainbow Six and a lot of Halo, but in the Star Wars universe. There is something that I can't put my finger on, but at least for me it works quite nicely.

												EA, Disney, and LucasArts could quite literally make 100 million dollars by releasing a sequel for this game.Unfortunately, they're too busy releasing a washed out version of Battlefront.Updated 13.10.2015Like i thought, after playing the Battlefront Beta it's now clear that the game is absolute garbage. It's boring, cookie cutter shooter where you just spawn, run forward, kill everything you see and repeat. It might be ""fun"" for the first 30 minutes but after that you'll probably get bored and move to some other more mechanically interesting title. There are also dramatically less features than in the original two games, it was also announced today that they are going to be releasing a 50€ Season Pass for the game which will provide early access to future content for buyers etc.Now, business practices like this are terrible for the gaming industry. There is absolutely no way you can defend it without sounding like a sheep. Then again, i probably wouldn't be too♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about it if they actually released even half of the content that was already introduced in the Battlefront games more than 10 years ago.So, getting back to Republic Commando. It's still a great game, instead of buying Battlefront get this game instead. You certainly won't waste your money that way.			",707,83,10,93,25,5,85

												No nonserious review this time, I can't think of anything.And here's my little info thing. Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter taking place in the prequel trilogy, or the Rise of the Empire Era, during a period of three to four years known as The Clone Wars, which is infact, my favorite part of Star Wars. Yes, get mad at me for liking the prequels. You play as Boss, a clone commando who leads Delta Squad, a squad of commandoes. There is Scorch, the explosives expert, Fixer, what you could call a hacker I guess, and Sev, the sniper.Time for the review part.Pros:+ First off, THE MUSIC. It's amazing!+ The graphics are quite good.+ The gameplay is decent, better than some other first person shooters.+ It has a good storyline, even though it's short. + Good voice acting+The characters are good. Cons:- Widescreen support has to be edited in.- Campaign is short.- Cliffhanger ending.Star Wars fan? Pick it up!Get's a 9/10 from me!			",146,11,0,20,9,1,10

												Best FPS for Star Wars.Screw EA.Screw the new Battlefront.Play this game over and over.GG.In all seriousness, this game is a must buy for any Star Wars fan, even if you don't like the Clone Wars or the prequel movies. It's 1000x better than the new Battlefront game.You control Delta squad, a group of four clone commandos, Delta Sev, Delta Scorch, Delta Fixer, and you, Delta Boss, the leader of the squad. You fight your way through battledroids, super battledroids, droidekas, spider droids, flyings things that try to suck on your head, Magna Guards, Geonosians, and even lizards. It's true, the campaign is fairly short and multiplayer doesn't work anymore, but guess what. Those 9 ish hours were the best 9 hours of my life! I recommend this game 100%.

												I absolutely love this game! It shows how awesome the Clone Commandos are and is great because there are absolutely no Jedi! I'd like to say real quickly that if you want this game and are leery because it says 'blood and gore,' don't be worried. There is a little blood, but not much (most of it is green alien blood); and the 'gore' is nothing to worry about. There is also just a bit of language as well. The campaigns are great! I love the weaponry options in the game, and the commands you give the Commandos are easy to use and understand. For being an 11-year-old game, IT IS FREAKIN' AWESOME! Last note about the game: The multiplayer does not work because the company that hosts the server shut down a few years ago.			",2,0,0,0,1,0,0

												I remember playing this game way back on the original Xbox. It's not through rose-colored glasses that I say this is the greatest squad-based shooter I've ever played.Let's start with the atmosphere. It's spot on. Any casual Star Wars fan will recognize most of the enemies and locations. The level and character designs are grittier than what you see in the movies, and that fits the tone perfectly. The HUD is one of the best I've ever seen, because YOU SEE THE BORDERS OF YOUR HELMET! Such a simple design choice affects your immersion immensely.So everything around you is cool. What about the combat? This game FEELS great. The modular weapons system is genius.  The squad commands are easy to learn but hard to master. The difficulty is pleasantly challenging; don't expect yourself to be repeating tons of levels, but do expect to be constantly searching for health and ammo. The weapons feel rewarding to use, and above all, the squad-based combat is amazing. You FEEL bad♥♥♥♥♥ You FEEL like it's you four protagonists against the world. And you WANT to take 'em all on.Your three Clone Commando compatriots, Scorch, Fixer, and Sev, are exceptional AI companions (especially for 2005). They are effective in combat, respond to commands instantly, and generally don't make the kind of dumb decisions that make you rage at AI companions. They don't talk much, but you can still feel personality emanating from them.On the note of character, the one category where this game falters is story. You know where you are, and you know why. You have objectives. But that's about it. The characters don't change over time. There are no plot twists. There is an instance of tragic loss (I won't spoil it for you), and it hits you hard. But there is room for improvement in that area.Besides the story, what other improvements could be made? I won't comment on the graphics, because this game is coming up on 10 years old, but I will say they've aged well. The only thing that springs to mind is the level design. Don't get me wrong, the levels are designed fine, but it gives away what's to come. When you see a spot where you can issue a sniping command, you know there's enemies directly ahead. Health and ammo are always located directly behind large groups of enemies. It's textbook old-fashioned level design, but you always know what's coming.One final point: because this is an older game, a 1920x1080 aspect ratio is not an option it offers. It's a minor detail, but an important one.In conclusion, ten years later, this is still an incredible game. Although the story is never going to be a selling point, everything else about this game is great. It feels like you're taking a first-person trip through the summer action film spectacular that Star Wars never had. I highly recommend it to anyone who puts gameplay ahead of graphics. Amongst the vast troves of LucasArts treasures, this gem certainly shines bright.			",143,20,5,8,31,2,6

												Yes, the first few missions may be dull: Slice this, snipe that and so on. But that isn't the point. The point is, you need to work as a team. Sure, I may be a Star Wars fan myself but this doesn't affect my opinion on this fantasic game. To the people who say the graphics make up the game entirely, just do yourself a favour and don't play a single game for the rest of your life. Sure, the graphics in this game aren't up to scratch with today's standards but they sure were back in the good days of 2005. To be honest, I think they're great! The gameplay and story line is simply amazing. It brings you back to Geonosis, Kashyyk, an abandoned Republic Cruiser and a few other places. I don't think there is another Commando game out there that is based on Star Wars. But if there is, this has got to be one of the best around. I spent heaps of time playing Star Wars Battlefront 1 & 2 and let me tell you, those are amazing games too. The squad that you play with is also very responsive and helpful (unlike in many other games). They'll do what you tell them to do. No questions asked. Unless they are under heavy fire and it is protocol-wise required to defeat the enemy first (goddammit just revive me already haha). Scorch really does keep the squad alive with his 'jokes', athough he can say it the wrong times.But too bad Lucas Arts and Pandemic have left the Star Wars games, they were doing a fantastic job. Anyway, overall this is a fantastic game and I hope it won't be forgotten. If you are looking for a multiplayer, try going to Star Wars Battlefront 2. That is also an amazing game. I'll give it 9.5/10. Buy it already if you haven't! Have fun! :)			",51,3,0,2,4,0,1

This is one of the finest Star Wars games as well as one of the best FPS shooters of its time; heck, it's 2016 and it's still mindblowing how much of a quality game Republic Commando is.My only wish for this game is for it to be remastered. Take whatever DICE did with graphics and sound for BATTLEFRONT and apply it to this game, add up to 4 player co-op and reboot the servers for multiplayer skirmishes, add a couple of extra gamemodes like wave survival and extraction and I can guarantee that it would sell like hotcakes.

												After completing this game I can gladly say that this is a game that needs a sequel.This game follows Delta Squad. You are the leader, Delta-38 Boss. Your squad consists of Delta-07 Sev, Delta-40 Fixer, and Delta-62 Scorch. The chemistry between these characters is unlike any other game I have seen.  Sev is the most badass Clone I have ever seen. Scorch is a querky, funny joker. Fixer is a very self centered man. He has basically no personality besides a few funny quotes here and there. This game is very short. It consists of 3 ""Chapters"". Geonosis, RAS Prosecutor, and Kashyyyk. In all I rate this game 9/10. The game's story is very good, the only thing I can find bad about this game is that the firefights can sometimes be very bland and boring.			",161,14,1,9,3,0,1

												Ever thought Rainbow Six getting into Star Wars? Well here it is. A very fun and rather short game perfectly fitting into the Star Wars Universe. Your team, Delta, is formed by 4 RC clone commandos:-1138 (Boss, squad-leader, that is You)-1262 (Scorch, demolitions)-1207 (Sev, sniper)-1140 (Fixer, tech expert)It is rather great to give individual orders to this team simulating a spec op team behind enemy lines into a Star Wars universe. This feature gives the game uniqueness. For this reason I do recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars.Thanks for reading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let my hours fool you, I've completed this game nearly 3 times over. This game is frankly one of the greatest Star Wars games out there. Republic Commando puts you in the boots of (you guessed it) a clone commando, with 3 squadmates. You travel to locations like Geonosis, Kashyyyk, and an abandoned Republic ship. This game focuses on squadwork, while you or another squadmate is arming a charge to get into a locked door, the other 3 are stopping the super battle droid shooting at you (which are actually kinda intimidating in this game). This is an older game, but you will still be impressed with the graphics to a degree, and at the not-as-expensive-as-98%-of-all-fps-shooters-out-there price of $10, I believe that this quality game is well worth your money!

												-played for years not using steam-My undisputed favorite game of all time. Amazing game-play and squad controls plus an immersive world create a memorable campaign leaving you longing for more. The worlds and characters you meet along the way are varied. Enemies have distinct faults you can exploit to defeat them. Voice acting and level design are both fantastic and add to the great campaign. Your squad has AI way ahead of its time and for once you don't grow tired of them. Instead you develop a weird sense of attachment to each of their unique personalities. Beyond being my favorite single player game it was also my go to for multiplayer* in which it molded arena combat and amazing maps to create a fantastic experience.*multiplayer servers are down and there are many issues when trying to bypass that with the steam version.Pros:Game-playVoice acting immersionSquadCharactersWorld/lvl designenemiesplotCons:Servers for multiplayer are down9.75/10			",144,22,0,15,10,1,9

												I forgot how amazing this game was! Back in the day this was one of my favorite Star Wars games. The gameplay is pretty linear but thats not a bad thing. It is quite difficult at times and if you dont use your commands correctly, it could mean the end of you and your squad. Love the perspective it gives you as a trooper and in first person. This game is quite old but it still looks great! If you havnt played this before or havnt in a long time, i highly recommend this! Its a gem for Star Wars fans. Its only $10, why not get this?

												This game can be truly called one of the best StarWars action games, it was so good, I can't tell it was innovative, but it simply accumulated every single possible best concept of the action games and perfectly served them:+Visuals: Despite the fact that this game is old as hell, it's still beautiful. The character designs, the hud, all the effects are very well made gun designs. Everything was designed so well that you could nearly touch that feeling of how to be a Republic Commando.+Soundwork: The whole SW franchise is famous for great sound work in every single game, this game is no exception.+Gameplay: And now to the best part -this game offers a unique experience - how does it feel to be a part of the Clone Squad, amazing AI of your clone friends, different roles of each person, command each of your team members and its really easy to control them, so it's a pleasure to play even with bots, and on top of that you had+Multiplayer: So you can squad up with your friends for the Republic glory.All the characters feel so alive, I couldn't get enough of this game back in 10 years ago. You may see some rеtаrded comments that this game is underrated, it's all lies, you can't find a single person that would say that this game is bad or even mediocre if you'll see something like that it's either a troll or a very ill person.

												So, ive been a gamer all my life especially with FPS games, I started with halo in 2000, and moved to Call of duty, with the occasional Battlfield, in all my 20 YEARS of gaming, there has been no other first person shooter that has touched me the same way PERIOD. The story is compelling, deep and emotional having you go through real struggles. The gameplay is fluid, and smooth, better than any other first person shooter, and ive played : Halo 1 through 4, Call of duty : 1 through 4 Modern warfare 1 through 3 Battlefield 1942, 2142, battlefield 2, 3. This game TRUMPS THEM ALL. Commanding the commandos is easy to understand and simple without interrupting the gameplay flow. The amount of weapons is a comfortable amount that give you versatility without bogging you down. The commandos are like real people with thier commentary and feedback! Its also actually difficult, you dont regenerate health, the enemies are harder but not unfair, you dont get unrealistic amounts of ammo, and the scenarios are down to earth and feel like solid military situations that could come up. I cant rate this game high enough it holds the top 3 star wars games ive ever played. P.S its not 3rd i just couldnt pick a number 1 haha. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game you wont regret it.			",87,7,1,15,2,0,7

												This game may be old, as it was made over 10 years ago (2005), but, it still is today my all time favourite FPS and Star Wars game. This game puts you into the feet of an elite republic commando squad leader, only by the name of 'Boss: 38' (Voiced by the same person who voiced Jango Fett). He has three other clones in his squad, 'Sev: 07' (The Sniper), 'Fixer: 40' (The Hacker) and last but  deffinitly not least 'Scorch: 62' (The Demolishion, and my favourite clone in the game), who all take place in 'Delta Sqaud'. Campaign is FANTASTIC, AWESOME storyline, with amazing characters. Unfortunatly, multiplayer no longer works, but you can still system link with ur friends and enjoy tring to kill each other.All in all, this is an amazing game, I 100% recomand this game to all of you, AND IT'S ONLY $10. 11/10: BEST GAME EVER (or at least in my opinion) 100% GET THIS GAME, NOW, OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN IN MY RREPUBLIC COMMANDO OUTFIT AND KILL YOU, ok maybe that went to far, but stil, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												This game hold a unique place amongst the Star Wars games. There are no lightsabers, you don't have the force, you only have Delta Squad. The gunplay is fun, the gameplay is very interesting and challenging, and the AI is actually decent. In Republic Commando your squad of Commandos are not just fodder to absorb fire for you. They are good at killing, they can be deployed into a variety of tactical positions and be given a variety of orders, they get hurt, and they can be taken down. In the event you are taken down, they can actually help you up, which is pretty impressive. Another difference this game has from other Star Wars games is it's decidedly darker tone, as you aren't hanging out in the nicest of places. After all, you are a soldier and you are definitely in the♥♥♥♥♥♥I cannot reccomend this game enough to fans of both Star Wars and FPS games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												when i was 9 years old i saw this game while browsing on youtube and i really  wanted to play it but i didnt have a steam account so i couldnt really figure out how to play it, a few months ago i saw the game on sale and i decided to buy it just for the nostalgic childhood moments. I didnt expect the game to be fantastic, just a standard game with bad graphics because it was developed in 2005. But when i played the game i was really surprised, i didn't expect the game to be so good, when you look at it; the graphics are actually very good for a 2005 game, the story is amazing and the gameplay is very enjoyable. Because of the variety of different weapons there are options of playstyles for each individual person. and the ability to remotely control your teammates is very nice too, i just wish there was a sequel or a remake kind of thing, i would be very happy to see this game remade with modern day technology.

												For coming out in 2005 this game still is a thrill to go back and relive the ultimate Clone Special Ops experience. You will be tasked with dealing with the most elite and discreet Republic operations, and leading a group of 4 (including yourself) elite Clone soldiers called Commandos. To begin, the gameplay is really good for a 2005 game. The shooting action gets really intense in the latter part of the game, and you will have to learn how to manage your squads survival as well as your own. Get too caught up in keeping your squad fit, and your own health will fall and you will go unconscious. Focus too much on your own health and equipment, and your squad will be left without orders and ultimately end up dying. This ends up being a gameplay goal for you as you must balance the two in order to have a successful playthrough (unless you want to play on the easiest difficulty). Although this does end up becoming a problem when your squad completely goes against their own common sense and runs out into a crowd of a bunch of droids, guns blazing, and gets shot down within seconds. Your squad also tends to run in front of you as you're throwing a grenade, which is super annoying because it will take down your shields and your health, as well as your squad member's, and you will still have enemies firing at you. I also feel the game is a little bit too difficult as you will find yourself screaming at your monitor on the Normal difficulty setting. Perhaps the developers could have balanced the difficulties by adding a fourth one (easy would still be easy, add a normal, normal would be hard, and hard would be very hard). But still, the game is still enjoyable despite the setbacks of a few gameplay issues. The guns are also nice. Most of them have decent sounds (other ones being laughable), and they have a good difference in purpose and power. The grenades, with the exception of the flash-bang grenade, are all pretty useful. Although none stand out above the other in the department of usefulness as they're all pretty much the same: aim at your enemy and throw. But still, they're a decent touch.The presentation is at an average level. With your standard graphics card you can max this game out, and the visuals won't look too bad. The textures are decent, and you won't really see any frame rate drop or texture pop-ins. The game overall has excellent environments that all differ from each other drastically. You'll go from fighting on the sandy and rocky world of Geonosis to the ""abandoned"" Republic ship in a matter of hours. With the varied environments and average graphics with no presentation technical difficulties, I can confidentially saw this game has above par presentation given its age.Now, onto the fun part, the content of Star Wars Republic Commando. First off, the story is really good. You are placed in command of Delta Squad, an elite group of Republic Commandos, which essentially are just Clone super soldiers. You will be given a variety of missions ranging from destroying a Droid Factory to helping the leader of the Wookies on Kashyyyk. Along the way you will unlock a few extras, which aren't really anything special, but they're a decent addition. The game is honestly too short. With the edition of another planet this game would have easily felt more complete. But the content that is there is fun and replayable, so it doesn't diminish the game too much. The multiplayer is remotely enjoyable, but will get old quickly. The community is either dead silent or a bunch of snotty veterans who trash talk new players and exploit the more powerful weapons. The maps themselves aren't anything out of the box, and quite bland, which is a shame considering the variety and design of the campaign maps were quite well. You'll most likely end up playing the campaign 1 or 2 times and maybe the multiplayer an hour or two (unless you find the multiplayer really fun, which I doubt most will).All in all I can say this game was a very good addition to the Star Wars franchise. Although it is a little short and has some gameplay issues and a below par multiplayer, you will find yourself thoroughly enjoying the amazing campaign and its awesome storytelling, environments, and characters. For the current price of $9.99 you should definitely pick this game up and relive or enjoy for the first time one of the greatest Star Wars gaming experiences you can possibly find.

												Republic Commando is a FANTASTIC game, one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made and unquestionably the best Star Wars first-person shooter ever made (I do not count Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy, because the lightsabers kind of radically change those games to the point where they no longer really qualify). The squad AI is still incredibly good by today's standards, the characters are compelling and smartly-written, and the environments and story are original and creative.But I cannot openly recommend getting this on Steam without some qualifying statements.Republic Commando is an old game. A very old game. And it does not play nicely with newer computers. Problems with bumpmapping in the graphics can result in crashes, and trying to get it to run on a 64-bit Windows OS is a horrific struggle. If you have Windows 7 or 8 64-bit, Republic Commando may need to be sadly relegated to the history books. Hopefully your memories, if you got a chance to play it back in the day. You will likely not get another.EDIT: Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, it's worked perfectly. I don't know what changed, but I hereby retract the preceding paragraph. In the interests of transparency, I will leave it up, but the compatibility issues probably won't affect you anymore.			",430,235,2,96,59,4,102

												This may seem like an exaggeration, but Star Wars: Republic Commando may be the best game I've ever played. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I actually found out about this game from the  tie-in novels [www.amazon.com]. I bought this game during a sale and mostly left it alone until recently. Now, after playing it for a few hours, I can confirm that it is everything that its small but fanatic cult following says it is.This depiction of the Star Wars universe is much darker than any other I've encountered before. Rather than following the heroic Jedi in an unrealistic ""good vs evil"" fight, Republic Commandos occupy that ""gray area"" and win their fights through brutal efficiency. In fact, Jedi don't even play a significant role in this game. Also, rather than showing typical sanitized Star Wars death (no blood), gratuitous amounts of gore frequently splatters the player's helmet (yay), which is eventually cleaned by a nifty windshield wiper-like device.Gameplay is heavily centered around a squad of four, where the leader is controlled by the player. Commands are given to the other three soldiers, consisting of a sniper, a demolitions expert, and a hacker. AI teammates are actually useful in this game without making it too easy for the player (take notes, Overkill). Each member can be told to perform certain tasks, such as manning a turret, blowing a door open, or providing sniper fire. Everything feels seamless and well-executed, especially the  door breach maneuver . #SquadGoalsGraphics are, well, 2005. Can't expect much. The resolution doesn't even go to 1080p. Thankfully, there are mods to fix that. They're good enough to create a reasonably immersive environment, but I'd like to think that it's the story and gameplay that makes this game what it is. The soundtrack fills in the rest of the atmosphere, which is a combination of John Williams glory and some original compositions. Good music is pretty much a given for anything Star Wars related.About the story (SPOILERS AHEAD): I haven't played through the entire game yet, but I've played enough and have read enough of the novels to get a sense of what's going on.Late in the game, one of the commandos, RC-1207 or ""Sev"", is left behind on the planet of Kashyyyk following a botched extraction. The game then ends on a cliffhanger regarding the fate of Sev. The game then ends on that cliffhanger. In the novel, Sev's former drill sergeant and father figure Kal Skirata then embarks on a long journey to find him. Unfortunately, thanks to LucasArts getting really messed up and its transition to Disney, both the sequel to this game and the sequel to  Imperial Commando [www.amazon.com] were cancelled. There have been rumors that  EA will release a sequel [www.technobuffalo.com] and that  Sev is alive [www.polygon.com]. However, they are only rumors that we can only hope are true. TL;DR: Underrated squad-based first person shooter with great mechanics and story. Give sequel pls			",41,1,2,1,4,1,2

												One of the best Star Wars games I have ever played. You take the role of a Clone Commando unit which is basically the elite of the clone army. The game features unique squad commands that you can give to your squad members who are not operating on a stupid AI but actually good decision making that could make you recover from a stupid down and allows you finish the mission. The story is amazing, the atmosphere is superb, the graphics are a bit outdated but for a game that came out  in 2005 it still has lovely graphics. I can recommend this game to any Star Wars fan especially the ones who have interest in the Clone Wars era			",131,18,2,17,10,1,5

												This game reminds me of a point in my youth that wasn't the greatest time. Didn't have a lot of money and didn't have a lot of things to do. My dad bought me this when it came out cuz I played the demo on one of the Star Wars movies. This game was incredible. What do you get:Better squad interaction than 90% of games today with better personalities too. Solid shooting with an adaptive weapon system and enjoyable weapon pick ups from enemies. Level design is fun and in some places the tension is extremely high as blaster fire is pounding off your cover. You feel like a real commando going against brutal odds and sabotaging enemy lines. And an ending that will make you yell at your screen in a good way, none of that cliffhanger insert sequel here nonsense.			",210,8,2,16,25,0,42

The action, the squad leading, the voice acting, and the interaction with the adviser. I feel like this is the only game that I have ever felt that I'm a part of. The ending was a horrible decision, even if they were making a sequel. I was psyched that there was going to be a second, and was let down. This game was my childhood, and Vode An was my anthem.The game play was amazing, and this game is a must buy. 100000000000/10.You need this game.			",176,16,1,11,16,1,3

-Quick Review-Star Wars Republic Commando is a squad based FPS set in the Star Wars universe right at the start of the Battle of Geonosis and ending right at the battle for Kashyyyk. Republic Commando was developed by LucasArts and released March 1, 2005.


At last! Droid and Wookie can stand and have an equal conversation.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You join up with the Delta Squad, an elite group of clones whom have been cloned from the Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Jango Fett. They were also hand picked by Jango Fett to become commando's. The Delta Squad batch of clones were all raised in the same pod group, they're actually one of the closest knit clone groups.Okay PAUSE the review... I personally already had a vested interest in this game because I've read several of the Author Karen Traviss' Republic Commando Books. While Disney (and George Lucas) no longer accepts these books as cannon... ...Don't get me started, I'm just going to accept it and move on.I still prefer the ties between the series. That said, there's a lot of additional character development given to the Delta Squad from her books. Honestly the Nulls are way better, ORDO ALL THE WAY BABY! ..but I digress.


RC-1140 (Fixer... In the Green), RC-1207 (Sev... in the Red), and RC-1262 (Scorch... in the Yellow). 
A Screenshot of STAR WARS™ Republic Commando
By: Atratzu




The four Delta Characters are RC-1140 (Fixer), RC-1207 (Sev), and RC-1262 (Scorch) and you play as RC-1138 (Boss). Here's another reason to respect the game developers, the voice actor for Boss is the actual actor for Jango Fett himself: Temuera Morrison.(However each clone should have his voice, but the game developers gave all of the clones voiced different voice actors... Lets just pretend this is how they hear each other differently, because in Karen Traviss' Books they knew the difference between eachothers voices, but it was only clones and people who got to know them on a personal level would notice the subtle differences. ....aaaaaand it would be very difficult for a gamer to notice difference between the clones voices, let alone instructing a voice actor to change their voice just enough to be different.... BAH. It's complicated, just know I thought about it and attempted to explain it.)Anyway, to recap with less words: Republic Commando story on it's own is kind of shallow because there's very little character development. HOWEVER if you go read the Republic Commando Book series from Karen Traviss then you'll have a whole new level of appreciation for each of these clones.Multiplayer:Just a quick note about the multiplayer, it's gone. Since Gamespy was shut down the servers aren't there. There might still be communities and mod's which you can use to play it with other people though.Gameplay: Before I jump right in and explain the gameplay, lets fix something real quick. When you boot the game the resolution will probably be all wrong, and your mouse will probably be traveling lightspeed all over the screen if you full screen it (ALT + Enter)This guide helped me fix it.Basically you want to open your console mode with your Tilda key: ~ and then type in:setres 1920x1200setmousesensitivity 0.5Even then my mouse moved super fast, and would just use arrow keys to navigate menu's... but it makes the game much more playable. (Final side note: you need to join a game before you can get into the console commands, you can start a LAN game, or jump into a single player campaign game)You have all of the features of a standard FPS in this game, fire, zoom, crouch. The buttons are a wee bit weird at times, like you zoom with Z, and you throw grenades with your right mouse button throws a grenade. (Yeah, that was an unpleasant discovery. I was looking at a wall when I did that.)You Can jump too... but you really won't use that, you also can't sprint... it's the reverse, if you hit shift you move slower. Both of those were weird design choices, but I'm just going to blame it on being the 2000's when this game came out. We're probably lucky it turned out as well as it did.I think it's pretty safe to say most people have played FPS before, and so you come to expect easy and medium difficulties to be relatively challengeless and the only real challenge come from hard mode onward... This is not the case for Republic Commando, I played on medium difficulty (I didn't notice you could change the difficulty until I was half way through, and there's no way I'm switching difficulty half way through a game. Forget that noise.)Most of the challenge in this game comes from the team-oriented gameplay and game design. I normally exploited the AI's design, and let my team mates be cannon fodder while I set bombs, or knifed battle droids in the back of their armor plates... but even with that advantage the game can be down right brutally difficult. Especially if you run out of ammo! Which happened more frequently then I'd like to admit. (I became very well antiquated with the melee button... which is E by the way)


Campaign Mission Selection Map. It averages about 5 levels per planet/ship. For a total game time of 10 hours, that's pretty decent. 
A Screenshot of STAR WARS™ Republic Commando
By: Atratzu




There's about 5 levels on each world, I took roughly 10 hours to play through the whole game, and in my opinion hearing the song ""Vode An"" and a few Mando'a words and curses was definitely worth the price of admission for me.Conclusion: I really enjoyed my time spent with Republic Commando, unfortunately I'm disappointed there wasn't really any character development, the controls were awkward at times, and the technical problems you're bound to have with older titles.I was very pleased with the Mando'a tribe, the cutscenes, and the effort given to small details which Fandalorians will definitely pick up on and after hearing Vode An I realized I have a new ringtone for my phone.I hate to say it, but I don't think Republic Commando will appeal to everyone equally. But that being said anyone who enjoyed the clone wars era of star wars, and especially anyone who has read Karen Traviss' books should totally check this game out.Oya Manda!			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Bought this game when it was on sale. I loved it when I was a kid, so I thought I'll have it in my library, never intending to actually replay it. But then I thought I should give it a go just for fun. Oh wow, after all these years it's still fun to play! There's something special about this game that even the modern games lack off. And I think this is the only good thing that came out of the prequels (this and the Mr.Plinkett review).

												Tinkering might be needed.I needed to set ""bump"" setting in the video option to low. Then I could set everything else to highest.  Otherwise it would crash (Found this inf. on the internets).So now that I am 90 minutes into it I can see why everyone loved this game. Its a solid FPS. The guns are not great but the action is exciting, the voice acting is sooo much better than today's crappy FPS games. The music is awesome.  Your NPC buddies are kick **s. The world is simple old lo res but full of atmosphere.  It's smooth.  I'm enjoying it... It's supposed to be about 10 hours which is fine with me. It's too dated for me to put more then 10 hours into it. But it's more then worth a $1 per hour.  For instance, I managed to enjoy shadow of mordor (at least the killing chieftans) because of cutting edge animations and fun high res combat ** DESPITE the horrible  generic characters, awful forgettable plot lines, dreary music,  and repetitive environments. This game you will get as muchvalue for your money. The combat animations suck and the shooting is not the greatest(but it's OK - and there is some tactical parts) but the GAME as a whole is well conceived and extremely well executed. It's better than the AAA titles of the modern era. **I know Mordor is not a FPS so the comparison is not 1:1 but it's the last game I played and the most ""new"" and slickest game to have been released so I'm just comparing value and I'm making a case for trying out this dated title.

												Finally, some external marketing of Star Wars that does the franchise perfect justice.This game may be older, but it's one of the greatest and still relevant shooters I've played today.Tired of the jedis? Or massive Battlefront-style unit management? Take control of Delta Squad: an elite group of clones who all have their own specialties to bring to the team, and personalities that play well off one another in the amsuing dialouge.The shooting feels pretty good. Enemies die in a lot of visually pleasing and hilarious ways, keeping the good cartoon/serious balance Star Wars is known for. While there's a dissapointing variety of guns, the ones you have suit you very well.As Delta Squad's leader, you take advantage of ""squad commands"". Split up your three squad members to take up sniper positions, heal themselves, hack consoles, breach doors, blow things up, and a variety of helpful things. All these commands are administered and canceled with suprising ease, and the AI is FANTASTIC at fending for themselves and executing orders.Almost shameful to say that your team AI is better than most cooperative shooter-style games on the market today.You only play through three worlds. While the game isn't longer than eight or so hours, it's one long thrill-ride that is action packed with appropriate breathing room. Nothing's more intense than when you're the last of your squad not incapacitated and there's a pod dispensing Super Battle Droids infront of you.There's multiplayer. It's standard deathmatch and CTF type gamemodes. It's nothing special and nobody really plays it anymore.TL;DR?FANTASTIC shooter, very unique, BLEEDS Star Wars atmosphere, entertaining and likable characterss, and holds up as one of the greatest shooters and Star Wars games today. What's not to like?			",95,13,0,4,9,2,4

												One the best Star Wars games I have ever played.Let's expand this:The game holds up very well even today. Superb voice acting, epic set pieces, pulse pounding action, it does it all very well. Some games have bad pacing, feel like corridor shooters, or don't do the shooting mechanics very well, but this game manages to avoid those problems. SWRC doesn't have a huge arsenal, but the weapons feel good to use. The main characters are also very endearing.			",141,33,0,24,16,3,30

												Love this game!!*Spoiler warning*So alot of people are sad because Sev ""dies"", he doesnt. Lucas Arts was going to make a new game called Order 66(why they didnt beats me), where Sev was the first Rebel soldier, and there for sets out to recrute hir brothers. But the point is Sev isnt dead, he just says he is under heavy fire, witch if you have played this game for long, you know happens alot and a commando can take care of it. So Sev is still alive guys.			",35,6,4,1,9,0,4

												A remake of this would ♥♥♥♥ing rock. Its so ♥♥♥♥ing fun, but it just feels so old and bogged down. It would rock my world if this game was to have some fully supported multiplayer, and awesome, reinvented graphics. It has unlimited potential, and it certainly gave me hours upon hours of happiness when I was younger.			",105,3,0,11,4,1,1

												One of my favorite games of my childhood, truly a classic that should have had a sequal.AI is stupid but not useless, gameplay is simple but extremely challenging in later levels, as it should be. Easy to work hard to master sort of thing. The story is quite good, as well as the characters, while underdeveloped and not focused on are quite unique and welcome.PLease buy, please play, please enjoy.			",146,12,5,27,17,2,17

												I remember playing this game back when console gaming was good. I played this game pretty much when it came out. I loved it back then, and love it even more now, since I'm more concious about the game.Tremendous audio: great voice acting and clarity, amazing SFX, and epic music.Great graphics (for it's time).Aged perfectly well. It feels at home with today's FPS, only slower.Great multiplayer (now if we could get more people to play it online.)Great story, and they don't take much of your time.Intense gameplay, with quick desicion making action from full on attack and support, to revive you and turret cover. BUY THIS GAME! YOU'LL LOVE IT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A STAR WARS FAN.TAKE IT FROM ME!I recommend this game to absolutely everyone.			",44,4,1,0,5,0,1

												Even as an old game, it's simply brilliant and brilliantly simple.Even on the easiest difficulty, it's extremely difficult.Republic Commando takes place during my favorite point in Star Wars history, the Clone Wars, and provides an interesting story that provides a few layers of depth to the Grand Army of the Republic. Unlike most shooters, such as Battlefield and Child Online Daycare, your weapon isn't the strongest thing you have (in fact, it's kind of weak sometimes) - it's your squad. When presented with seemingly-unstoppable enemies such as droidekas and super battle droids, you'll need every single rifle aimed at the target. You cannot just blitz through the levels, like you can in most games. It requires a lot of skill and coordination, that both add up to make Republic Commando a very challenging game,  but also a really fun one.			",61,2,0,5,5,0,11

												In my opinion Star Wars Republic Commando has to be one of the best first-person shooters made to date. This is because:1. The combat feels great! running at a group of droids firing away at you with just the right amount of accuracy to be a threat and then dispatching them one by one with your wristblade is one of the best experiences in gaming!2. The Team. Your team is made up of 4 people (no spoilers, as you find this all out in the opening) you, the elite Delta 38, the sniper Sev (Delta 07), the hot headed demolitions expert scorch (Delta 62), and the trustworthy commando fixer (Delta 40). Your command over them is relatively limited as you only have 4 options, Search and destroy, Form up, Stay here and Do thing (sniper point, grenade point, breach door, hack, etc) Also if you ""die"" your squad will carry on fighting until finished and then will revive you with half health (you can order them to revive you sooner but that often puts them in a very vulnerable spot).3.The environments, without spoiling the game for you the envoronments range from full on battles with other troopers present to creepy environments with your enemies lurking around every other corner.4. The story. The story really attaches you mentally to your squad and by the end you'll be scolding scorch for shooting you in the back rather than cursing the AI, and there are some real moments of accomplishment in the story such as the end of the first ""chapter"". The ending is awesome too!.So to sum up, GO BUY THIS GAME!			",127,9,3,20,18,0,30

												Republic Commando is a very good game, though due to the multiplayer servers being shut down your pretty much paying for a 8-10 hour campagin. (Hamachi, Gameranger, and Orgin can be used to play multiplayer but I am unaware of how much people play)This is currently the only Tactical Star Wars shooter to date so compared to other Star Wars shooters out there it is very good and refreshing for me.Pros: Very good AI teammates.Good ways to make use of the enviroment tactically. The health system is nice, not too easy like regeneration nor not too hard like health pickups.Great Variety of enemies, Super Battle Droids fight like a super battle droid would. They get a bonus for making standard battle droids look somewhat more menecing.Intresting Story.Gun Fights feel like real tactical gun fights.Realistic Door Breaching and squad teamwork.Cons:The design of the Commandos is odd for me, they look too ""super human"" if you will.The campagin is only 8-10 hours and it is really the only thing your getting.Trandoshon weapons resemble real world gunpowder firearms way too much for my liking.Despite being short the way the levels of the campagin are designed makes you feel like your grinding in some areas.For those wondering...IS THIS GAME'S STORY CANON? (SPOILERS)For the most part no, anything that was not the Movies or the Clone Wars animated series were never really canon and they everything that was not the movies or the clone wars series were offically decanonized by Lucasfilm after the company got sold. IS THE CHARACTERS, WEAPONS, AND OTHER ELEMENTS CANON?Some things yes, Delta Squad made an apperance in the Clone Wars animated series thus making them canon. The Trandoshon Shotgun also made an appearance in the Clone Wars along with it being in a EA's Star Wars Battlefront DLC named the ""scatter gun"" (loved using it in both games)Other things no, The follow up to Battle of Kashyyyk does not line up with how it happend in Revenge of the Sith (this was made prior to the movie so that is understandable)General Grevious resembles the 2003 cartoon so i'd assume if he had any lines in this he would sound like he did in that series thus making his role in this game non canon by default.In canon the Trandoshons do in fact use regular blasters and when their shotgun made an appearance in the Clone Wars it did not eject any shells.

Justs a great shooter over all.Story: 5/5 (may end short, but has a good ending making you want a sequal so bad that you cry for years for not getting one)Gameplay: 5/5Game: 10/10  Game is awesome a must own.

												I can't get over how stunningly well this game holds up to the test of time.  I used to game away at Republic Commando when I was but a wee lad, though I never finished it because of that timed level at the end of the first act (let me just get it out of the way, that's probably the biggest doozy in this game).  I've since come back and completed it, but as a child, whoo, was that level rough.  If you can get past an occasional sharp difficulty curve through impressive strategy or dogged pursuit of your goals, you'll find this to be one of the most rewarding experiences you've ever had in a shooter.  It's polished, impressive, tense at parts, and will thrill you despite the limited mechanics.In summary, singlehandedly one of the greatest shooters I've ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: May 29, 2016
												Alright, this game is AWESOME.  Star Wars Republic Commando is an FPS based on the lives of Delta Squad, 4 elite clone commandos who are sent on the most dangerous and imperative missions the republic has to offer.  Each one has his own distinct personality and all 4 of them (you play as squad leader) are pretty likable characters.  Here are the commandos in order:38 ""three-eight"" aka ""Boss"" or ""Sir""- the squad leader and the player character. He is fully voiced by Temuera Morrison, the voice actor for Boba and Jango Fett in the films.  38 (said literally ""three-eight"")  is a no nonsense commander with a head for strategy and a dry sense of humor.  He leads the squad (obviously) and is able to issue orders to the other 3 commandos, for example, he can tell them to set up sniper positions, anti armor, mount turrets, use healing stations, etc.  (btw these are actual game mechanics, issueing orders to your squad is a huge part of the game).  He has all the weapons that the other 3 commandos are capable of wielding but unlike the others he is capable of using special, enemy weapons that can be found off certain foes.  40 ""four-oh"" aka ""Fixer""- Fixer is the tech specialist of the squad and specialises in hacking and computer interfaces, he is very useful for hacking terminals.  While all the commandos have the same skills and abilities, some are better than others at certain things.  For example, Fixer can hack faster than the others, Scorch is more accurate with grenades and can set explosives faster and Sev is a deadeye with a sniper rifle.  Fixer takes his job verrry seriously and doesn't talk about much other than the mission or how to accomplish it, but he does have moments where he loosens up.  Fixer is exceptional at melee combat and dispatches melee using foes with ease.  62 ""six-two"" aka ""Scorch""-  Scorch is the squad demolitionist and explosive expert and his outlook on life relfects that.  He loves danger and has a very positive, optimistic viewpoint on any sitution, using humor to deal with even the most harrowing of missions.  He is the squad funny guy and his upbeat personality is definitely helpful when things look grim.  Scorch's preferred weapon of choice is the anti-armor grenade launcher and grenades themselves.     07 ""oh-seven"" aka ""Sev""-  Sev is the designated marksman and stealth fighter of the squad and revels in war and battle.  He is a deadly sniper and the best shot in the squad (other than the player).  He is probably the most mandalorian out of the squad and by that I mean he lives for war.  62 finds his fervor for killing to be a bit creepy at times but he is a good soldier and a good friend... and a truly terrible enemy.  Sev's weapon of choice is the sniper rifle, which he uses with pinpoint accuracy.   The game's combat is pretty good and the squad AI is amazing even for today, the commandos feel very human and real.  The game even has multiplayer which I'm not sure if there is anyone on it anymore but it was good in its own way as well.  The story is pretty good and involving and gets pretty hectic at times which keeps things interesting.  All in all this is one of the best star wars games out there and I highly reccomend it for any star wars fan.  I know I spent most of this review talking about the characters, but I did so because they are  the game's strongest attribute.			",62,14,0,8,4,0,5

												This is my all time favorite star wars game. Being able to play not just a clone soldier but a clone with a story. In the game you get to see the front lines in a whole new way. This isnt battle front where once you die your just respawned as a new clone and thrown on the battle field. In this game you have a team and you have to keep them moving along just as you must move along. It reminds me of a mix between the first Halo game and rainbow six vegas. All in all I love it and wish that a second were made.			",9,0,0,3,0,0,2

												It's really good, gameplay is good, A.I can be stupid sometimes but telling them to form up or to hold a position can fix their positioning. It's a good game.Pros- -Squad combat is good (their accuracy and damage can be bad at times however) -Multiple weapon types that feel different- Good story - Your squad actually has character - Difficult at the right times (although there are a few unfair moments)- Game took 8 hours to complete (which is good for a good price) and I mostly had fun through the entire gameCons--The default rifle can't do damage for s**t- Some enemies are annoying to fight without the right weapons, killing a super battle droid or the spider tanks without special weapons or grenades is unnessicarily long (yeah yeah difficulty and challenge whatever) - Some sections were a little longer than i would've liked (like the wookie missions) - Bugs- Weird hit detection at times (not that big of a problem just thought i'd mention it, dont try shooting over boxes) - Unfair difficulty spikes - Don't hack or place charges, get a squadmate to do it because your squad will NOT be able to cover you - You can hack or breach doors, but theres really only a few times where hacking it will be helpful. Hacking takes longer and with breaching your squad takes cover and even throws a grenade after breaching, so theres no reason to hack (TL;DR, theres 2 ways to open doors and only one of them is helpful)  Cliffhanger ending  like honestly wtf happened to my edge lord Sev There was more cons than pros but the cons were either minor annoyances or things I felt the game could've gone without. It's a good game and I would reccomend it when it goes on sale. R.I.P good star wars games 7/10			",147,23,1,9,7,3,17

												I know I'm a bit late to the party on this one since the game was released almost 11 years ago as of this review, but this game is actually pretty good for what is. The game is fairly challenging, the AI honestly isn't half-bad, and the overall gameplay is pretty damn good; the music is great, the voice acting is solid, and the game actually looks pretty good for its time. My only real gripes are that the game feels a bit short for the campaign (personal opinion, I just felt that it was a bit shorter than what I expected) and that the ending feels like a bit of a cop-out since it leaves the player feeling as if there's going to be a sequel (which we all know is unfortunately never happening). I'd definitely say something about the multiplayer as well if I could, but since the multiplayer has been rendered non-functional due to GameSpy's shutdown, I'm unfortunately not able to do so.In the end, I'd definitely say that this is a game I'd recommend, even without the multiplayer being functional.

												Republic Commando is not a very deep or unique game, but it is challenging and pleasent to play! The multiplayer doesn't work, but the single player is engaging, and may surprise you. Enemies take a long time to kill and there are lots of times where the game feels like a ""bullet hell"" game because of all the enemies coming at you, but it just adds to the challenge. If you like clones, Star Wars, and single player fps games be sure to check out Republic Commando!			",18,2,0,2,1,0,1

												Star Wars Republic Commando is such a unique and addicting game that I find it may even rival the Battlefront series.Basically you are the squad leader of a 4 person squad.Delta 40Delta 62 Delta 07And you, Delta 38. Together, you form the Delta Squad. You are clone troopers that have been engineered to be the best of the best. You are the future. You are the commandos. You must strategically command your squad in order to beat back the droid army on various missions across various planets. Something i'd like to mention is that the droids are very tough in this game, while in the movie they seemed like bumbling pieces of metal that could easily be taken down.  Initially I started the game on normal but had to change it to easy because it was too hard. I may re-play the game on medium though. But even on easy, the separatists are a force to be reckoned with and the enemies are remarkably tough. This makes for thrilling gameplay as all the responsibility falls on your shoulders as the squad leader, and you must make hard decisions. In the end, only 2 things matter. Win the battle, and get your squad out alive. But later in the game, you must choose which is more important....Each squad member has a unique personality, and as the game progresses you feel very close to them. The members are: Scorch, (62)Fixer, (40) Sev, (07) And you, 38. Or, Boss.You are alone, cut off, and all you have is your squad. You do whatever it takes to save them. I'll never get tired of hearing:Engage snipe maneuver, Delta.Rearrange some architecture, commando.I want some explosives here, Delta!Stop limping around and get some bacta, soldier.Engage anti armor position, delta!Something i'd like to mention is that your character's full number is actually 1138. 38 is just for short. I think that's cool because THX-1138 was a screenplay George Lucas wrote in college. So that's a neat little Easter egg there.And also, at the end of the game you can hear the x wing pilots from a New Hope saying things they said during the Death  Star run. So that's another cool little Easter egg. I also like how you can attack your squad, and they fight back! I tried killing my squad mates one time, and found myself fighting against them. I actually felt really bad. XDThis game is spectacular, extremely fun, unique, and a must-buy. It was so much fun for me because I am a HUGE fan of the Clone Troopers. I just think they're really cool, and being able to not only be one, but be a commander throughout this game, was an incredible experience.I would definitely, whole heartily recommend this game. The only thing I'm disappointed about is that there isn't more. I thought there'd be several more planets and missions leading up to Order 66. Oh well, maybe there will be a sequel in the future called Imperial Commando. (Just please don't have EA make it) I give this game a 10/10.The game is extremely fun with a great story, good voice actors, great controls, hard bosses that require strategy to take down, good weapons, great graphics, and a great atmosphere. Would play again.			",20,8,0,2,4,0,1

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a unique experience for a Star Wars game. You don't play as a Jedi or a Bounty Hunter or any of the things in between. Instead you get plopped directly into the head of a Clone trooper and thrown onto the battlefields of Episode Two.As a clone trooper you don't get much back story or indeed any motivation beyond the occasional communication pop-up on your UI that tells you where to go next. Indeed you were bred for combat and unquestioning loyalty and that's what you do. This rather unique aspect does a lot of alleviate many of the problems that usually plague Star Wars games and makes Republic Commando a rather enjoyable experience.You are not just any Clone Trooper however, you are a squad leader and this is where the gameplay of Republic Commando comes into play. With you have 3 additional commandos, each with their own area of expertise. A sniper, a demolitions expert and a hacker. As you go through the missions you will be able to order your team around, into cover, mounting gun positions, or performing specific tasks suited to their specialty through a context sensitive command system. You basically just point at an object and click and one of your squad members takes the appropriate action. This all works surprisingly well and trying to play the game as a lone wolf tends to end badly as the game features some rather impressive AI, both on the part of your teammates and the enemies.The game is very pretty and in particular the background deserves notice as there is always something else going on there which often looks every bit as intense as the fight you are distracted from.The voice-acting is pretty good for a game but you will quickly realize that the developers took a little shortcut here as the many different voices and accents the clones have makes you wonder just how similar they really are.Star Wars Republic Commando is an attempt to take the Star Wars franchise into the squad based tactical genre and it comes away from the attempt quite nicely although it is a game that has it's flaws, most notably the campaign is extremely short and ends with a cliffhanger that's never resolved as this is the only game in the franchise. Still all in all it's one of the best Star Wars games out there and one of those that can be held up as a good game in it's own right.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												As a Star Wars fan, this was fun.  It's a first person shooter, has nothing to do with the elite characters of the movie, instead you are a clone trooper.  The teamwork works great, at least they listen to what you want them to do.  Outside of that, the AI isn't great for either your partners or for the enemies.  There are a variety of enemies, some that are rather tough, and others that just annoy.  The weapons are decent, but nothing spectacularly new.  The storyline is intriguing and connects somewhat well within the Star Wars Universe.  The fun, didn't last through the entire game though as the game gets quite repetitive.  The graphics aren't too interesting to look at these days, and this isn't to say that they aren't good, just that there's no real art design that stands out.  Everything seems bleak and without much detail.If you are not a Star Wars fan, this may not tickle your fancy.  However, it's a short game that can easily be beaten in less than 10 hours.  I enjoyed it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game...Is a masterpiece, I want to cry for the fact that the sequel was dropped, this was one of my favorite games as as a kid. If you haven't seen the behind the scenes video, a real special operations veteran was used for the MoCap in this game, which really made the authentic ""Elite clone squad"" Feeling. The game's graphics are just amazing, the squad system is beautifully crafted, AND LIKE HALF LIFE 3, we were left hanging in the end with no sequel in sight.But I digress, this game was one of the games (besides splinter cell, which is my first favorite) that holds a VERY warm special place in my heart. I recently discovered today it was on steam for only $9.99, letm e get straight I am no ""diehard star wars fan"" But it was just one of the games I grew up with, and since my disc barely worked anymore, I was ecstatic to see it was on steam, and from what I hear, you can still play multiplayer through direct IP connection, what's not to like? If you are a fan of star wars, but not a huge fan, this game is for you, because yes, it does have all the star wars aspects, but it's as if those are just masks making the game more beatiful over a core elite squad game.This game is  WORTH THE $9.99, BUY IT!

												It's not very often a Star Wars game (specifically this one) goes on sale. I remember playing this a few years ago when it first came out, just picked it up on Steam, too. Had loads of fun playing the campaign, lots of great memories from this game. I remember hugging the healing stations because I was worried I'd get killed during the next fight all the time.You can play as different specialized Clone Troopers (i.e. Demolitions, Sniper, etc.).This is actually one of those games where commanding your own squad is fun. The AI is decent (not perfect, but close enough). You can use turrets from fallen Republic Gunships and mow down enemies with it. All in all, a great game.. multiplayer wasn't that bad too. I had lots of fun dueling 1v1. One day, I was lucky enough to pull a direct headshot by bouncing a Wookie crossbow projectile off the wall on somebody. :D: Been a while, and I can't remember the name of the map, but it was an arena map called ""Clone Training"".I give the game a 8.5/10. Although the game was pretty enjoyable, I remember it being short (a few hours only) and there were some brutal levels.. well, that's AI squad-based gameplay for ya. Anyways, you can listen to me yap all day, but this goes on my list of Top 10 SW video games ever released. It's on sale right now for just $3, worth buying if you're a fan of Star Wars.

												The second best Star Wars Game of modern times, behind Legendary masterpiece Jedi Outcast.  Ive played it at least five times, and it still kicks major a.s.s.  The authentic feeling of Star Wars is what makes or breaks a game set in this universe, and almost all others fail to capture it.  Republic Commando has that feeling all the way to its bones, from the Clone Squad commands, to the run and gun of military squad combat, this game looks right, sounds right, and feels right.

												""GET YOURSELF SOME BACTA, SOLDIER""The prequels were flawed yes, but at least the Episodes II-III era (2002-2005) spawned some sweet SW games, for many the last great era for LucasArts (everything went downhill after 2005).Republic Commando is ""THE"" SW shooter, by that I mean the best SW shooter of all time (unless Dark Forces gets a remake, which is unlikely next to impossible). The Halo 2-Half 2 influence is evident (minus riding a vehicle and the gravity gun) and the game tries to be lean and mean (not bloody though). Explosions and melee attacks are everywhere, and the cheesy-cute humor of the prequels is nowhere to be found. Overall the game provides a solid Clone Wars experience.The graphics still look very good for a mid-00s game and the sound design is superb.But sadly, the game has some clear flaws, which put the game in a  8-8.5 out of 10 zone at best (it could have been a 10 out of 10)a) too short (like 4-5 hours on easy). Also, some people will find frustrating that there are only three (extended) maps: Geonosis, Republic Ship and Kashyyyk. b) the AI of the squad is not that great, they get killed easily on medium difficulty.c) some enemies are ridiculously overpowered and hard to kill without heavy weapons (which are hard to find)That said, the game was loved-popular enough so fans demanded a sequel, which never came due to the mismanagement of LucasArts that slowly killed the company until its 2012 disappearance.

												This game is so good that i had to buy it again after i lost my original version of the game.Pros:~Amazing action-packed about 8h story~Phenominal voice acting and backround music~Flawless combat~Quite a few weapons including: a concussion rifle, a geonosian beam cannon, a wookie bowcaster and the always reliable DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System which has three different attachments: Ion pulse blaster, RPG anti-armor, and sniper. If u have all three attachments fully stocked with ammo u will be able to solve any situation.~Some enemies can be a pain sometimes but that gives it that touch that u arent invincible and u need to think before u act~Graphics are pretty good~And there is also a decent multiplayerCons:~Ocational glitches/bugs for example a team mate goes down but cant be revived~The AI can sometimes be a little dumb but nothing too major~For me atleast the story was a bit too shortConclusion:I would give this game 9/10.

												One of the best star wars games I have ever played. It  was rather challenging at certain times and you had to really work as a leader to control your squad if you wanted to win. It did a wonderful job of getting the star wars feeling right in level design and  art. The only problem I had with it was it started to feel slow after i had played it off and on for 2 weeks. But it is an older game and free roam wassnt as standard as most shoooter games today. Also i have to remark the bonus making of the game videos are Well worth the watch for any fan and are availible in game for free.			",154,36,5,18,2,0,13

												This is literally a better Halo 5 from the story, to the AI and actual presence of squad commands, to the balance, and even the gameplay.Some people say the game is short and that's primarily because it's split up into 3 distinct campaigns which maybe about 2 hours a piece. Not bad especially considering the price. But where this game shines so well is the squad command. It may only consist of 4 basic commands, target a specific enemy, and attach to cover (grenade, anti-armor, or sniper position) but the way it implements it is so beautiful.You, as the leader of Delta Squad, have to constantly balance between defense and offense in a wide variety of scenarios and above all else it makes it feel like the combat is alive more than anything else. At any moment you have to react to something and figure out how to tell your squad to deal with it. And the great thing is: They are NOT dumb AI, they may be among the best AI I've seen so far and this game was made in 2005. Which if you fail you can't blame it on the AI, they did they're job meaning you failed yours. The responsibility to win any engagement falls squarely on you because your squad will perform and often perform very well. And somehow that makes it a game of personal skill in a squad command game and it's bloody fantastic. I love this game to pieces for that.And beyond that like I said earlier the story is great, it really does makes you feel like you're an elite Clone squad during the Clone Wars. The immersion is absolutley perfect and the squad mates accompying you all have distinct personalities are quite interesting. They even often say things during combat that range from helpful to entertaining.If anything this game left me wanting for so much more because what I got was amazing. Which is why I'm giving it my first non-humor 10/10. I will ALWAYS love this game, it is easily worth more than the price you're charged for it.			",35,3,0,9,8,0,1

												I liked that it involves mostly clones, as they were my favorite characters in the Star Wars saga, and the fact that this game is based on clone commandos has made it one of my most favorite games in Star Wars. I liked the Campaign as well as multiplayer while it lasted. What I dislike is the fact that GameSpy is dead, which means multiplayer is as well. It had been one of my favorite games mostly because of the multiplayer, and now my excitement in this game has decreased because of that very reason. While there are websites that offer to fix this problem, such as moddb.com, it's still not as fun as it was anymore. If there is anyone who is a fellow commando fan reading this right now, hope is not lost. There is a website that is dedicated to Republic Commando content that is attempting to reach enough followers to demand a sequel to a game that was once in it's prime. I will not reveal the name of this group, as I am taking precautions not to attract any attention of hackers or trollers because I do not want anything drastic to happen to this group that is attempting to keep the Commando name alive. Good luck commandos, and I'll see you on the battlefield.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A game ahead of its time Star Wars Rebublic Commando is set in the early stages of the Clone Wars. You are a clone commander in charge of Delta Squad, the republics deadliest soldiers. You and your squad are sent behind enemy lines and must fight the droids of CIS (confederacy of independent systems) However, the droids are not the only threat you must face.A very clever and simple squad based gameplayWhen I first dove into the game, I was expecting a squad based system which would be confusing, similar to Red Orchestra 2. The system was actually pretty simple. It did not take long to learn the mechanics. You have just a few buttons which you can use to give your squad commands. Commands such as defend this area, follow me, advance (search and destroy), cancel orders. You can also order your men to different highlighted positions like, sniper,anti armor, turrets and grenade. Might sound confusing, but it really isn't. I was surprised of the good physics in this game and the gameplay itself was fun, but only for a couple of hours. The maps and basic gameplay got a bit repetitive and I got bored after a half an hour or so each session. Still, it was fun and entertaining.Short and loose storythe story was not as good as I hoped. You get a short prolouge cutscene that tells you about the clone commandos. The story jumps from one place to the next. At first you are at Geonosis and suddenly you are investigating a lost republic war ship. So it is not a direct storyline throughout the game. What I did like was the chatter between your men. It was funny at many occasions and you got more feelings about your men. It also ends with a cliffhanger and since republic commando 2 was cancelled I doubt that there will be a sequel anytime soon. Though, the developers leaked information about how the story would continue, so the ending is still there.Worth it?It was a game ahead of its time, so I can't complain about anything really, except the story. Other than the story being very loose I would still recommend bying it, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. The music is top notch. Note: Multiplayer does not work anymore, so you will only be able to play singleplayer, still worth it though ",163,10,4,8,13,1,22

												It's probably one of the best Star Wars game you could get, it's cheap, fun, has a great soundtrack & nice level design, my favourite being aboard the republic ship. The levels are short but theirs plenty of them so you will get at least 8-10 hours of gameplay worth going through the campaign. I did have a few problems with the DPI it was way to fast & I had to set it down to 1 just to look around & aim correctly. I wasn't able to play at 1080p even tried going into the files to change it but it was pretty buggy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Star Wars game without any Jedi around, instead focusing on squad-based battles and tactical combat solving. As an FPS it takes inspiration from all the right sources, including Metroid Prime for its famous HUD.Pros* Tacticool as ♥♥♥♥. Door breaching, landmine ambush, air support, everything is there* Good ability at creating a believable atmosphere with a mix of large battles and claustrophobic resistance* Excellent OST, with some very bad asses Mandalorian songsCons* Low variety of weapons and enemies* You're never given quite enough ammunition to kill armored droidsNote that the ending is a slightly-frustrating cliffhanger that will likely never be resolved. Make sure to properly order your squaddies around for you won't go far without being a good field officer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Equal parts tactical strategy game and first-person shooter, Republic Commando proves itself greater than the sum of its parts.  Enemy encounters are varied and fun, in a way that only sci-fi shooters can be with their assortment of alien and robotic adversaries.  Squad commands are doled out in a system that is about as intuitive as possible, at least until voice recognition works its way into the realm of gaming.  On top of it all, great writing that de-emphasizes the Jedi Order does something that George Lucas failed to do; it makes the prequels cool.  Republic Commando is the rare Star Wars game that is more than just a money grab, and you know it because it would be just as good without all of the licensing.

Multiplayer Shall Live On! How to play Multiplayer 
A Guide for STAR WARS™ Republic Commando
By: (Eyeris)Toxicvirus1230

			Got Republic Commando? Want to play online with friends/others? Think its impossible to play multiplayer after GameSpy died? Think again! This guide shows how to play Multiplayer with others/friends!		


This game is pretty amazing. First of all, for a game that came out in 2005, the graphics are really well-done. The textures and graphic layouts really showed how much time LucasArts put into this game. The story is awesome too, especially for those who are interested in Star Wars lore. No spoilers on the story; I will let you experience it in full :). Lets not forget the Multiplayer, which is probably the best experience I had with this game. Once you finish the amazing story this game has, you will definitely have fun battling it out in the Multiplayer mode, especially if you love Arena FPS games like Unreal Tournament and Quake Live.I will recommend this game to anyone who loves Star Wars, or just loves online Arena FPS games.

												I love this game. Like this game has single-handedly made me look back into Star Wars games in general. Republic Commando is basically what happens when you make a Tom Clancy game, put it in the Star Wars universe, and make your AI allies actually listen to you. I know, I could hardly understand it myself at first.Your squad actually listens to you instead of going into random rooms (a la Mass Effect) or not doing anything (some Tom Clancy games). But even without the great ally AI, the game still holds up well. The gameplay is surprisingly furious for a mid 2000s shooter, and you'll nearly die many times in the crazy firefights that ensue during the game. The game's multiplayer is also fun (somewhat similar to Halo 1/2's splitscreen multiplayer) but not as lasting as the campaign. The game's story length (~8.5 hours) is also respectable given the depth and action. Did I mention that your allies actually friggin do what you tell them to do, even in a firefight?Honestly the only downside to this game is its lack of sequel. The game ends on an obvious cliffhanger that was meant to segue into a sequel, as one was in development before this even released. Unfortunately the project got cancelled, so the ending just gets left with nothing to follow up on, which is a shame. I wish this game was given as much love as The Force  Unleashed; it'd be more deserving to be sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll make this review short and sweet ( maybe ).STAR WARS™ Republic Commando™ is as it shows an FPS game featuring the Republic Commandos' dangerous missions throughout their first year(s) in combat. The gameplay is pretty good and for all you gamers out there with ridiculously sucky laptops or computers that have horrible fps in modern games, this game will run beautifully in your system. Your teammates are quite smart even though they are just AI's, they warn you about everything and anything throughout the game. Star Wars fan or not this game is truly a must have if you're interested in First Person Shooting games with a well made story. If you're thinking of buying this then do it, you absolutely wont regret it and if you do, well sucks to be you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked this game, and keep wondering why there isn't a sequel out given *spoilers* *spoilers* *more spoilers*. I'm hardly a fan of the Star Wars prequels, but the characters and plot are interesting and solid. I especially love the first half of chapter 2, with its ""haunted house"" feel. I can even get over the fact that Scorch is voiced by Raphael Sbarge (that guy who will forever be Carth Onasi to me and who only has one acting style), given that all the squad's personalities are both clearly defined and show development across the plot-arc. For instance, I love how Fixer is incredibly straitlaced but sometimes the facade cracks, just a little.I also don't play a whole lot of shooters, but I really enjoyed the feeling of being in charge of a squad that reacts to me without a whole lot of complicated keyboard commands to memorize. In fact, there's only one button to direct every terrain-contextualized action, and that's okay with me! A little odd that the boys will get infinite ammo of whatever type they're using while they're in a terrain position, but hey, Scorch lobbing unlimited grenades is also okay with me. The graphics are also fine for how old it is, and I like the little details like the visor windshield wiper for rain/blood/oil/scratches(!?). It was a little frustrating at times when running low on ammo or health and with no way to get more before having to survive difficult waves of enemies, but that's almost certainly because I'm not very good at shooters. :POverall, I really got the feeling that I was part of a team while playing this game, and it was really awesome.

												Here's my bottom line opinion on Republic Commando; it's the second-best Star Wars first-person shooter. Just below Dark Forces. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the best game to come out of the prequel trilogy, and doesn't escape the taint of the prequel's legacy. I may even like the ideas behind Republic Commando more than I like the game itself.Here is what sucks about Republic Commando: the weapons sound weak, and there aren't many different enemies to fight. So what does Republic Commando do right? The intro to the game is great. It details where you and your squad came from, all from the first person perspective. In fact, this game takes a page from Half-Life in that the entire game is played from the first-person perspective. There are a couple of scenes where you are not in control of your character, but they're limited.The squad AI is not smart but it's competent. They'll kill enemies, heal themselves, heal you when you drop, take cover, etc. There are certain set pieces that you can order a squadmate to take position at for a specific purpose (like sniping or anti-armor) and they're meant to be used. Your squad dies less when they're in one of these ordered positions. The squad also has fantastic vocal banter. Each member is a personality, and I got attached to them as the game went along.Though the levels are a little cookie cutter, there are plenty of objectives to them and no lack for fights. I was fighting in corridors, in small courtyards and hangers, on multi-level starship bridges, and in trees. They're not as varied as Dark Forces, but each environment is well made.And now I can get to what stops this from being a great game. They can fix the sound effects and toss in a couple more enemies, but it's harder to change the setting. Republic Commando takes place at the onset of the Clone Wars. It starts on Geonosha even. And though it takes place over a two (three?) year span, it could have gone farther. This was a pre-Episode 3 game and it shows. It feels like a teaser leading up to Episode 3 and, ultimately, suffers for that. It doesn't deserve to be timely movie release fodder. It deserves to be treated like a game that can stand on its own two legs. Something that can be taken out of the context of the prequel release. It doesn't deserve to be lumped in with Episode 1 Racer, Star Wars Starfighter, Bounty Hunter, Obi-Wan, or any other godawful prequel game.It doesn't carry the same tone as those games. The developers did their damnedest to give this game a fair chance. They go out of their way to make  you know that you are playing an elite soldier. You're no jedi, and you're not fodder either. You see your share of ally deaths and the Clone War takes its toll. But you're fighting bugs on Geonosha. And battle droids, even if they're way more menacing than they ever were in the prequel movies. They may bleed oil, wear a metallic gray paint job (rather than the orange seen in the movies), and the super battle droids may be some tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but they're still battle droids, which are inherently lame. There's a pitiful tie in with General Grieveous in the form of his bodyguards, which flip and hop around like acrobats, with electric sticks. They're not threatening in the slightest, more annoying than anything, and serve only to give General Grieveous an excuse to make an unwarranted appearance.What I'm getting down to is that in Republic Commando you are playing, in essence, a proto super stormtrooper. I wish the devs would've been allowed to run with that rather than get tied to the time frame that stuck them between the two prequel movies. I hope we can get another Republic Commando game, but I'm not expecting it. This franchise has legs that get cut out from beneath it by the movies it was made to support.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've played it before and have $10 to spare or if it's on sale, absolutely get it. The community for it mostly gone but if you REALLY want to get some multiplayer action going, there are small groups like ReiGn that will play and have servers up. I may or may not get one myself. There are plenty of mods for the game as well. I haven't put that much time looking into it but I believe there is one that adds an entire new campaign. Never played it before? This game is within that top tier of all Star Wars games ever made. Amazing and unique gameplay + story. The chat between your squad as you progress makes it even better. It can be incredibly challenging even now if you turn the diff. all the way up. The squad mechanic also ups the difficiutly a bit as you will need to utilize them correctly if you want to get anywhere.  You are not a God (i.e a Jedi) in this game and it will remind you if you try to lone wolf it.Like I said the game still looks AMAZING considering how old it is. One thing that makes this stand out in my eyes is that like the story for BF2, this is one is told from the Clone perspetive rather than the overdone Jedi one. All in all yes get this game. Maybe with all the hype coming back to Star Wars with the new movie and BF3 we'll finally get a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Not because it is Star Wars or anything like that. Partly cause it is Star Wars actually. But it has a certain feel to it that other games don't give me. Especially FPS wise. FPS wise I mainly stick with Halo cause I really enjoy Sci-Fi. For awhile Halo was my go to FPS. But this game takes that position now. Yes, I could be fighting the flood and watching them devour people. But for some reason that never made me as nervous as when I was roaming the abandoned Republic ship as Clones got torn limb from limb in the room next to me. Yes, I could be trying to take down a hunters. But a lot of villains in this game provide much more of a challenge.Another aspect of the game is the squad. You control your squad and tell them where to go. I'm constantly checking my squad's health and changing their positions. Yes, some current games have squads. You kinda control them, but I don't think as much as in this game. But that's just my opinion.With a compelling story and constant threats trying to kill you, this game makes for a great experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(although Super Battle Droids are WAY overpowered) weapons are unique, each one has its own style, and all your squad have their own personalities.Boss (you): Fearless leader.Scorch: Fun loving joker.Fixer: By the book loyal trooper.Sev: Brutal combat crazed vet.(SPOILER)*Salute*May you rest in peace Sev. We will always remember you, you bloody violent motherf*cker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid game. Hard to belive it was made in 2005, with the in-game squad mechanics being better than the ones found in most modern games. The gameplay changes little but there's something so endearing about it that it doesn't really matter. Not much else to say. Just get the game. It's definitely worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably one of the best FPS that are out on the market today. I have been playing this game for 7+ years and have enjoyed every second of it. Before the server shutdown, this was an amazing multiplayer game. There was constantly 50+ people playing per day on every server, and everyone enjoying themselves.As for the campaign, they really put in a lot of detail into this. They were able to establish a squadron of elite troopers known as ""Delta Squad"" and tell us about their story and what they were able to accomplish. Like any good game with a story, there is also a lot of sad parts, and enjoyable parts. The creators of this game also were able to establish a few easter-eggs for us as the players to figure out, and made the graphics far ahead of its time.All in all, I love this game and always will. If the servers weren't shut down, I would definitley recommend this game for anyone. But if you enjoy Star Wars, and Campaigns, then this is the game for you. One of the best on the market.

												Didn't expect much since it was a game that came out a decade ago.  But, surprisingly, this game hold up well on PC.  Although I can't get the bumpmapping option to work (using AMD/ATi card, seems to be for Nvidia cards), the graphics looks good (think almost at the level of Rainbow Six: Vegas on PC or Mass Effect ground mission).I feel that the weapon feel underpowered and I had difficulty at first.  But slowly I learn to rely on the squad members more, commanding them take sniping/grenade position, it became less overwheming.  I am only over one-fifth of the game and I like what I have played so far.  You don't need to be Star Wars fan to enjoy (I am not).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down the best Star Wars video game ever made. I've played through it on 3 different systems, multiple times now. If you have any love for the Clone Wars, or even Star Wars as a whole... Or Heck, even if you just love Sci-Fi shooters, you owe it to yourself to try this one.It still looks great today, with anistrophic filtering and texturework nigh on the best of its time. The Steam version goes on sale often and only takes a small mouse acceleration fix for the menus, otherwise it runs like a dream.It is a Squad-Based shooter, done very well. How many of those do you even know of that exist? Besides maybe Rainbow 6. You can and are given incentive to order your men to specific positions, breach maneuvers, or turret mounts, etc... They aren't dumb either, great AI too. They'll prioritize targets as you mark them.Not to mention everyone on the team can do every job, from splicing terminals to planting bombs to setting up sniping nests. You can do all of it too, but if you use the right guy for it, they'll usually do it better.And the story, oh the story... There are 3 zones you'll be going through, going from Geonosis, to something else, to Kashyyyk. I don't want to spoil the 2nd one because, well, it's frankly fantastic atmosphere and all that. Just trust me, Geonosis and Kashyyyk might be average, but the 2nd one, oh man it's great.I... I could keep going, but again just trust me, this game is a Home Run in every way I can think of. Buy it, play it, love it like everyone else who has bought it and played it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Zero Dark Thirty - Star Wars Edition. These boys would fit right in with modern day Navy SEALs or US Army Rangers, heck they even have a little SWAT in them. Call of Duty ain't got nothing on this gem. Their personalities are unique and easy going, if you can get used to TMNT then you can handle Delta Squad. The military tactics are down to Earth and easily recongnizable, plus each has a distinct voice unlike the Clone Wars Series were everyone has the same one, gives each one personality only your main character has Jango's voice. So if you are looking for realistic gritty Star Wars without any of those pesky Jedi or Sith, this one is for you. Its nice you can for once block out the Sith or the Jedi and pretend just for a moment Star Wars is actually a WAR and not a philosophical battle between a guy with a red sword and someone else with a (insert color here) sword. Very refreshing. It makes the Star Wars Universe seem not so far away after all and all the more enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is worth every cent that I payed and possibly even more if the story was longer! (already a fairly long and fun story, don't worry). I played this game non-stop on the hardest difficulty as soon as I got it and it is honestly perfect in every way. This game, not even kidding in any way, has thebest beginning to any game I've played. The awe that I felt as I saw my character's life begin was simply wonderful and irreplacable, it might just be me but everything about this was just beautiful and unforgettable. Enough of that though (I love this game so f**king much) it's time to go on to your squad. The squad gameplay is amazing and unlike most squad features in most triple A title games nowadays. The basics of what I'm saying are that there's good control over your squad and that without you your squad will likely die and if you're alone you will likey die, only together can you effectively triumph against you enemies both weak and strong. The story itself is fun and effectively gave me a feeling of bonding and love with my team, all of them of distinct personalities and traits that make them unique and lovable, they will even occasionally crack a joke between one another or yell something that makes me laugh or smile. To be completely honest, with how amazing this game is I am very suprised that it isn't as loved or known as star wars battlefront is. I'd much prefer this game over that (despite battlefront being my chidhood and being simply a great game). I really hope that someone eventually comes to finish the series with its canceled sequel otherwise I shall continue to cry at the thought of what could've been.as a final verdict I rate this work of art a 10/10, it has no real failings other than age and at this point I honestly want to play it all over again. (I don't usually give games this good of ratings, only other game to get that high on my list is portal 2). I cannot reccomend this game more if you like squad gameplay and fps games or if you like murderous-deep voiced badasses, funny-somewhat timid, or that one guy who follows orders and is fairly serious about most subjects because that's what this squad consists of and I love tham all.

Breach doors, give your squad positions, target enemies, and many more commands. Though I was disappointed at the end, actually I was kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. After losing one of your squad mates  and the droids invade, you get ready for the next mission, then suddenly the credits appear. I think this would be a great game for a sequel,  maybe even the main character being your lost squad member, fighting back and finding the delta squad!

												One of the best action FPS ever made. It's kinda like a Halo clone but to say it's a ripoff of halo would be unfair. It plays kinda like a first person Ghost Recon or Rainbow Six Vegas but with less strategy. The whole game is just really well made and you can tell the developers put their heart & soul in this. The characters in the game feel so lively and it feels like YOU ARE the commando the entire time. Using the DC-17m with the blaster rifle attachment never gets old and the sounds in the game sound very satisfying from blaster shots to droid noises. It is a rich FPS experience with a cheap price tag. Well worth your money. Easily one of the best star wars game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished the game and I just have to say that it's pretty damn good. Especially for its current price.Now, the combat is Bioshock style. Meaning that you just shoot and at some moment the enemy just falls down and is dead. There's no real feedback to the damage you're doing and due to that the gunplay is very unsatisfying. The melee however was strong and it made me take a lot of risks to just take out the enemy. If a game gets me to risk myself and forces me to not play safe without it feeling unfair and just artificial, then I'd say that it does a good job.The story is what it is. It's 3 main campaigns, each is about 2-3 hours. On normal, the game was just as difficult as it should be. I lost the game a few times, but not enough to have the game feel unfair. Almost every death felt like it was my fault and preventable.The graphics look pretty good and the game runs very well as well, even on my 4GB DDR3, FX-4100, GT640.The game's been in many bundles, so it's pretty cheap when it comes to value. You'll be able to trade for it no problem.One problem though was that it ends in an annoying cliffhanger and the last mission also ends very abruptly, which makes me feel that they were just pushing it out as quickly as possible. The A.I. is pretty good for your team, but the same can't be said about your allies and enemies. They usually just sit and do nothing and get themselves killed. I know that all allies are meant to die, but it's just so damn annoying that they die to one minion or something.Overall, is this game worth the full price? If you're not on a shoe-string budget, then yeah. Is it worth a bundle purchase or a trade? Yeah, definitely. Overall 7/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move up/down based on its pros/cons)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most criminally-underrated shooters ever made. The game manages to fully immerse the player in the Star Wars universe without using Jedi, force powers, or any other hallmarks typical of the Star Wars franchise. This is a tactical first-person shooter played from the perspective of a Clone Trooper, one of the expendable ""mooks"" who drop like flies in the movies and are predecessors to the Stormtroopers, the ultimate ""disposable bad guy."" Each member of the squad is a clone, but they behave with distinctive personalities and voices that make you actually care about them. The game has a fairly good difficulty curve, with the game gradually spacing bacta tanks and ammo dumps farther and farther apart as the game progresses without becoming noticeable. You will need to use teamwork to knock out larger enemies like spider droids, which are almost impossible to down with the limited grenade launcher ammo you have. To drive the importance of team work home, the game has several sections where the squad splits, meaning you have no one to revive you if you die. And you have at most 6 hits on normal difficulty before you're a goner. The presentation is fantastic. The graphics have aged well and it runs smoothly on modern operating systems with no compatibility issues. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, with memorable pieces like the Mandalorian chant ""Vode An"" punctuating intense action sequences, as well as familiar snippets from the film scores. The game will throw in bits of fan-service such as a squad mate quipping ""these must be the droids we're looking for"" which just make you chuckle even under pressure. The AI is decent but will occasionally get stuck behind barriers when rushing to revive you, leading to frustration. The cooperative nature of the campaign makes the lack of online co-op campaign play very glaring. If this game ever gets a sequel, this feature needs to be added first. The campaign only features three planets, and is pretty short. None of the multiplayer maps are very interesting. These are probably due to the game's status as a tie-in for Episode III's film release with crunched development time. Just get this game. You will not be disappointed. It's not perfect by any means but its extremely minor flaws do little to hamper an amazing experience. For a 9-year-old game it's extremely playable and not dated at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was my entire childhood. I played it nonstop over and over again and created very strong bonds with the characters. This is a truly amazing game that everyone, Star Wars fan or not, needs to play. The squad based gameplay is just incredible and the story is fantastic. Your squadmates are anything but bland, and will keep you entertained throughout the entire story with their very distinct personalities. This game is one of the few that truly deserves a sequel,  one where we save Sev, of course. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most criminally-underrated shooters ever made. The game manages to fully immerse the player in the Star Wars universe without using Jedi, force powers, or any other hallmarks typical of the Star Wars franchise. This is a tactical first-person shooter played from the perspective of a Clone Trooper, one of the expendable ""mooks"" who drop like flies in the movies and are predecessors to the Stormtroopers, the ultimate ""disposable bad guy."" Each member of the squad is a clone, but they behave with distinctive personalities and voices that make you actually care about them. The game has a fairly good difficulty curve, with the game gradually spacing bacta tanks and ammo dumps farther and farther apart as the game progresses without becoming noticeable. You will need to use teamwork to knock out larger enemies like spider droids, which are almost impossible to down with the limited grenade launcher ammo you have. To drive the importance of team work home, the game has several sections where the squad splits, meaning you have no one to revive you if you die. And you have at most 6 hits on normal difficulty before you're a goner. The presentation is fantastic. The graphics have aged well and it runs smoothly on modern operating systems with no compatibility issues. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, with memorable pieces like the Mandalorian chant ""Vode An"" punctuating intense action sequences, as well as familiar snippets from the film scores.

												Republic Commando is a nice squad based first person shooter. Playing as a clone delta squad commander provides a fresh perspective in the Star Wars universe where you get to use a blaster instead of a light saber. The squad based system is simple and easy to use and the AI actually follows orders well. The small assortment of weapons and attachments isn't impressive, but they get the job done. The game offers an engaging tactical story and traditional Star Wars music. There's no in-game options for wide screen resolution support, but you can manually modify some .ini files to get higher resolutions working. And the graphics look decent at 1920x1080.Although there's nothing great about it, Republic Commando is definitely a polished game that is fun from start to finish--worthy of its 2005 release date.

Short version: 87%Star Wars meets Rainbow Six in this tactical FPS, where you lead a group of strangely unique clones against the enemies of the Republic in three different campaigns. It may not be on the levels of Battlefront or the actual Rainbow Six titles, but Republic Commando is still a great game to play.Long version:Star Wars has a really successful and long relationship with the FPS genre, and Republic Commando is no exception. It may be nothing but a Rainbow Six clone in Star Wars costume, but this is hidden behind excellent game design.The story takes place during the Clone Wars, where the player takes the role of a special commando, leading his own squad straight into the heart of enemy lines. (The game is not tied to the animated series.)The settings are a bit clichéd: the battle of Geonosis, a (seemingly) desolate space ship, and Kashyyyk (because there always have to be wookies)… Luckily the writers knew these predictable settings need something to keep interest, so they spoil us with some good dialogues and fast-paced mission structure.The gameplay itself is simplistic squadron-based tactical combat where a single button replaces the command menu. It may be a significant limitation, but the system works as intended. All events are scripted, but you still need to continuously assess the situation and order your squad accordingly.Republic Commando may not reach early Halo levels with the AI, but it has nothing to be ashamed of. Just don’t expect your squad to win the game for you; team management is a very crucial point, especially in hold the line situations.The game didn’t age well from a technical standpoint; modern systems may have a bit of a problem running it properly. But when they do, you are offered one of the best Star Wars games to date to play with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game came out in 2005 and has a much better squad system then halo: reach which came out in 2010. You play as Delta 38 aka Boss, leader of an elite clone commando squad. You lead your squad of 4 commandos across 3 different campaigns during the era of the clone wars. Each campaign is relatively short (around 2 hours) but feel unique enough to give you a different experience through each one. Atmosphere is great and so is the soundtrack. Using your squad effectively is very important to succeed in this game. You can't finish this game by yourself you need to use your AI controled squad. Your squad consists of 3 other commandos that all have different strengths and personalities, which leads to some good interactions and interesting dialogue. The squad commanding is very simple but also one of the most effective ways i've ever seen in any game, even in 2016. the game ends on a cliffhanger ending, originally planned to continue the story in a sequel. unfortunatly this game got scrapped so the game ends with a very important part of the story unexplained. Rating 8.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this for a die hard Star Wars fan. If you're not a fan, then this is a generic shooter that falls down on some areas. Main problem is that the variety of enemies and guns are small, which makes the shooting part pretty boring. The leading of the team is made surprisingly well and the team is most of the time useful. For some reason, the team can only use grenades, sniper rifle and anti-tank weapons on certain specific points, which doesn't offer much of tactical challenge. Most of the time, you order your men to all available positions and run yourself to melee distance where enemy is very lacking. The game hasn't stood the test of time, and lacks memorable moments. Then again the music and sounds are pretty good that makes the atmoshphere quite good. Level design is boring, unmemorable and  and areas between loading times are really short(usually 5-10 minutes). The game doesn't change much after the first few levels. The game lasts for about 5 hours, which is good or bad depending if you like it or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like a swift kick to the stomach, this game will leave you doubled-over and gasping for breath hours after you finish playing. How many times have I been forced to kill a spider droid on my own with just a pistol because I ran out of ammo and my entire squad is incapacitated, or how often have I encountered a droid dispenser pumping out SBD's only to realize I've already used up all my anti-armor charges? These kinds of situations force to think ahead and plan & execute your strategies quickly. Keeping your squad organized is key. It's a beatiful thing when you give your squadmates commands and then find out that what you've decided for them to do is the perfect strategy. Good ol' Delta 38... he always knows just what to do.Squad control in the game is easy as pie, and the friendly AI is okay, though at times a bit frustrating. When they're given a command, the squad will go do it no matter what, even if it means doing something dumb like getting killed because they don't think to kill the things in their way first. Enemies are pretty stupid, but you don't need to be smart when you're a Super Battle Droid. The graphics and landscapes are dated but still amazing, from the windy, dusty canyons of Geonosis to the dark and foreboding forests of Kashyyyk. Except for the commando armor, everything is dark and gloomy. Gameplay is also awesome; everything is fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat (and sometimes out of it completely). Whether you're desperately trying to hold off an endless stream of enemies as one of your squadmates plants explosives on a droid dispenser while another hacks into a security system while under fire, or you're clearing a path through a group of fat Trandoshan slavers in the maze-like corridors of an assault ship, there's never a dull moment in Republic Commando, and the hard difficulty mode is just right.The Squad:Delta 38, the main character. A tough-as-nails commando, 38 don't take no crap from nobody. Even when under heavy fire, he calmly gives commands like he's ordering food at a McDonald's drive-thru. He's the voice of reason, keeping everybody under control.Delta 62 (Scorch), the Demolitions expert. Scorch likes explosives. That's all there is to say.Delta 07 (Sev), is a fierce hunter. His best use is as a sniper, providing amazingly accurate covering fire for his squadmates. His only job is to kill, kill, kill.Delta 40 (Fixer), is just a good old-fashioned soldier. He's uncomplicated and a great fighter, and always follows orders. Other than that, I'm not quite sure what his deal is... I guess he's the ""computer expert,"" though any commando can slice any console.Each commando has his own personality. Scorch can be quite humorous at times, and Sev has some pretty disturbing things to say. One thing I don't understand is why do all have different voices? I though they were all the same clones...Trust me when I saw that even still to this day this game is worth every penny. The only thing I wish is that more games could be like this.

												Back in 2005, Star Wars: Republic Commando was an unsung gaming classic, since then it has aged incredibly well in the gameplay department, standing defiant against both the tides of time and the trends of cover-based shooting and regenerating health. The gameplay, weapons, squad mechanics and even the graphics are still appealing even after all this time. The Steam release of Republic Commando is the third time I have bought this game, and I still love to play it now and again.The first thing that LucasArts got right with this game is making the Commados feel just as bad♥♥♥♥♥as the Jedi, while at the same time making them feel like soldiers. This is accomplished simply with the squad commands and context-dependant actions such as sniping and grenade positions. The scripted animations are icing on the cake like tackling droidekas or killing a kamikazi trandoshan with his own knives.But while each member of Delta Squad is comprehensively a one-man killing machine, they are not as invincible as a Jedi Knight, you need your squad, and again this really enhances the military feel of the game. Performing door breaches, setting up entrenched positions, and setting up covering fire while you outflank the enemy do a great deal to give Republic Commando a military feel that few modern military shooters can match. Putting you in command of Delta Squad was an awesome idea.Atmosphere is another area where this game shines. You start out being dropped behing enemy lines onto Geonosis, fighting your way into a Geonosian hive complex, down through a droid foundry and into a trade federation droid control ship. Then comes the genuinely creepy ghost-ship mission where you will be reduced to being hunted, alone by scavenger droids, and finally you will form part of the first wave in the republic's campaign on Kashyyyk, each location feels unique, and the game manages to capture the frenetic pace of a battlefield, the isolation and helplessness of a horror game, and the epic scale of a megaflora jungle.While some games start to feel dated and klunky as technology and design practices roll on, Republic Commando was at least 10 years ahead of its time. Everything about it shines, and the few flaws are minor and easily overlooked. Even when it's not on sale, this game is a bargain at ten bucks, the only negative point I can hold against Republic Commando is that it wasn't long enough and never had a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game, and probably my favourite FPS.It's also very short. There are three mini campaigns, which you play through sequentially. One on Geonosis, one onboard a Republic cruiser and one on Kashyyyk, all of them clock in at around 2 hours each.With that big, primary concern out of the way, do I recommend this game? I sure do.Beyond nailing the aesthetic of the Clone Wars (more the one from the films than the tv series) or even Star Wars in general it is a solid single player squad based shooter.Single player and squad based might sound like opposing descriptors, but they're not. The three titular Commandos are your greatest weapon, both in effectiveness and enjoyment. Every Commando can do what you do, at the same rate.Do you want to dash in behind the enemy battle droids and take out their dispenser or do you want to send one of your squad mates to do it so you can lay down covering fire? You'll have them hack their way into power generators to reactivate them, but could just as well do that yourself.Should they fall you can revive them by running up to them with a defibrillator, or order one of the remaining squad mates to do that. Even if you get shot down yourself your squad mates will, at your orders, run over and put you back on your feet.Opposing you are the expected Trade Federation droids, the Geonosian bug army and, the only group not plucked directly from the prequel trilogy, Trandoshan mercenaries. These all have their share of easy fodder (the basic federation droids especially are little more than target practice) as well as a variety of overwhelmingly strong enemies.If the game did not work as well as it does then the best strategy would be to have your squad hold its ground out of harm's way, go at it alone and have them come revive you if it doesn't work out, and it's a testament to the excellent work the developers put into making the squad mechanics worthwhile.Orders are given easily, point at a piece of cover and press the Order button to have a squad mate take cover behind it. Same goes with entering turrets, breaching doors, setting explosives, etc. etc..It's a simple system, but it works well and is easy enough to do in the middle of hectic combat situations, of which there are plenty.The plot doesn't really add anything to existing lore, but it does its job and all of your squad mates have their own distinctive personalities, voices and preferences (though the explosives expert is no faster at placing a charge than his brothers).As long as you keep in mind that this is a short game and that it will primarily stay away from the plot of the films then you're in for a great time, and I recommend this title.

Short version: 87%Star Wars meets Rainbow Six in this tactical FPS, where you lead a group of strangely unique clones against the enemies of the Republic in three different campaigns. It may not be on the levels of Battlefront or the actual Rainbow Six titles, but Republic Commando is still a great game to play.Long version:Star Wars has a really successful and long relationship with the FPS genre, and Republic Commando is no exception. It may be nothing but a Rainbow Six clone in Star Wars costume, but this is hidden behind excellent game design.The story takes place during the Clone Wars, where the player takes the role of a special commando, leading his own squad straight into the heart of enemy lines. (The game is not tied to the animated series.)The settings are a bit clichéd: the battle of Geonosis, a (seemingly) desolate space ship, and Kashyyyk (because there always have to be wookies)… Luckily the writers knew these predictable settings need something to keep interest, so they spoil us with some good dialogues and fast-paced mission structure.The gameplay itself is simplistic squadron-based tactical combat where a single button replaces the command menu. It may be a significant limitation, but the system works as intended. All events are scripted, but you still need to continuously assess the situation and order your squad accordingly.Republic Commando may not reach early Halo levels with the AI, but it has nothing to be ashamed of. Just don’t expect your squad to win the game for you; team management is a very crucial point, especially in hold the line situations.The game didn’t age well from a technical standpoint; modern systems may have a bit of a problem running it properly. But when they do, you are offered one of the best Star Wars games to date to play with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros Great voice acting, Great Squad Gameplay, Intellegent AI, Challenging Singleplayer, One of the best Stories I have ever played, and and one of the best games I have ever played. Cons It has been over 10 years and they have yet to make a sequel on a cliffhanger ending. Final Score 10/10 even though there is no sequel this game is a must own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't reccomend this game enough. As a kid, I loved the fact it was a gritty Star Wars game. it really showed a side to the galaxy that had not really been shown. The game has a tactical/strategic aspect of managing your three comrades and their positions, while trying to be an effective member of the team yourself. I started playing this again recently, and I still love it. Obviously the graphics are not great by todays standards, but the game play is still really fun. I still tilt my head away when my team breeches a door, and I still pray every once and awhile that a new version will be made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite me not having many hours on here. I put countless hours on this years ago back on my original Xbox. This game (in my opinion) still holds up with modern day games. Unfortunately, there are few and far between squad-based games out there like this. The only ones that still carry on this tradition would be Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon for example (Singleplayer at least). Which we need more games like this, instead of these one man superpowered (yet normal) soldiers that can regenerate wounds after getting shot multiple times, and with unintelligent A.I. (that seem like that they're just for show, like a hindrance, rather than helping the player take care of hostiles) that stays back 10 feet behind while the player is on the other side of the map, blasting their way through enemy territory. We need less games like that, and more of this, if the FPS Genre wants to at least survive in someway. Definitely worth buying, that is, if you like to work as a team. If you can't handle that responsibility, then look somewhere else.Oh and this game actually has a challenge to it. Pretty rare nowadays in the FPS Genre.9.7/10 Would buy and play again.

												 Star Wars: Republic Commando was a great experience for the most part, but it got fairly repetitive after a while. I got VERY tired of how many times I've had to breach a door or kill Droidekas and Super Battle Droids, and  It doesn't help how easy this game is. Anything one would consider ""challenging"" about it is how you run out of ammo in the midst of every other SBD/Droideka/Spider-Droid/Magna-Guard ""Ambush"". Because of the game's repetitive tendancies, the little length that the game has seems like less of an issue. The game does have it's moments though. For example, I personally found it fun mowing down Battle Droids and Geonosians every once in a while. The game's soundtrack was an enjoyable mix of music from the Prequel Trilogy, a bit of music from the Original Trilogy, and some original music written specifically for this game. Soundtrack aside, the graphics of this game compliment the feel of being in the Star Wars universe as well. Despite all the problems the game has, it still has that charm to it that many other Star Wars games have, so I definately reccomend it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a bit of Fun. I'll just say this: It is old, but it is fun. To be fair, i haven't touched the multiplayer. I Gather it doesn't work without 3rd party servers but I'm not to sure so i'm reviewing this on the single player.Pro's: 1) Star wars game! usually they are pretty good and this was deinetally one of them. If you enjoy Star Wars games, play this.2) The music is honorable to the movies. It was nice to be running around with battle music from star wars going in the background, it really supported the feel of the game.3) It's a different take on the general star wars universe. Your not a Jedi (Pro and Con) which is fun for a change in the Star Wars Games.4) Wookies!!!5) The allies in your party are not full retard. They actually do damage. You can also tell them to slice, blow up doors e.t.c and although primitive it still works and add's to the gamplay.Con's:1) The AI for the enemy is just...can't say anymore than that. 2) It's an older game. There are some moments were you can tell it's aged badly.**NOTE THIS ONE IS A SPOILER**3) The storyline. It's nothing fantastic but i feel that it could of been a little bit better. I like that it's set during the clone war era, i like running around as an elite team, i don't like how the storyline is practically inexistant. And that ending! What kind of ending is that.4) It is far from a long game. The whole game took me about 5.5 hours to complete.Overall, the game is enjoyable and i definetally suggest it for a star wars fan. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great if you want a game with some tactics and a squad of AI team mates with actual personality that say one liners after every kill. The game play is good , a little bit linear , but the heroism of these guys is admirable. The graphics don't hold up to the ones that we have now but you can run it smoothly ( but watch out when you first enter the game , you might want to change the mouse sensitivity , plus what do you expect form a game that can run on 256MB of RAM and 64MB VRAM) and so far I haven't came across lag , only on large explosions. Finally the game is good and shows the other side of the conflict , not only the rebel part and their struggles but the comando's bravery , determination, marksmanship , skill and what actually is a united squad( not like CSGO or BF).

												If you're looking into this game, you should really get it.It's a fantastic game, it has a pretty good story, unique weapons, and you play with your squad for most of the game.The biggest part of the game is your squad. They're really amazing, you've scorch, sev, and fixer. They all have their specialties, and it's not super noticeable, but they do better than the others in their area. (Scorch- demolitions, fixer-computers/slicing, sev- weapons expert{sniping, anti-armor posts, turrets, etc.}) They listen to your orders, you can set them to do different things. You can have one guy sniping, one guy disabling the droid dispenser and still have the last one fighting head on with you. You can have them on the full offensive, you can have them staying in formation, you can have them moving carefully, ready to blow ammo into anything that moves.Plus there's the Humour. Really there's some funny jokes in there. Gotta love scorch XDThere's a really unique weapon setup in the game, you can have 3 guns. There's your standardized pistol (infinite ammo, energy recharge), the standardized rifle (with sniping and explosives attachments), and then you can have a single enemy weapon. That could be anything an enemy drops, like a geonosian beam rifle (pretty much shoots a powerful beam of energy) or a trandoshan shotgun, or even a wookie bowcaster. There's also heavy weapons you can get, like the ACP Heavy Repeater or the Wookie Rocket Launcher. Personally, by the end of the game I really only used the pistol, and the rifle attachments if I really need to.It also has a fair ammount of extra fun one time kind of stuff. Most of them come as a surprise, so I don't really wanna spoil it for you.When you play, keep in mind how useful cover can really be. You have an energy shield, which recharges, and a pistol with infinite ammo. If you can find some good cover, you can use those two together and take out just about anything with relative ease.

												I have to say i was a little worried when i purchased this game mainly because of all the star wars games that turned out to be awful over the past couple of years, But i must say that this game is pretty darn good, It takes the clone wars to a whole other level. It is full of action and it can be pretty difficult at times. I am very surprised how this game turned out to be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very good Star Wars game, made back in the waning days when Lucasarts still cared about video games. You take control of a squad of republic clone troopers each with his own personality (my personal fave is Sev, the cold, silent, deadly sniper on a hunt for blood). The gameplay is short, unfortunately; I think the 14 hours for my playthrough that is listed here is because I either didn't know where to go many times or my file got lost and I had to start over for some reason. At any rate, this game is a must for any hardcore Star Wars fan and perhaps even people who don't care so much about Star Wars and just want some military squad-based action in a science-fiction setting. Gameplay-wise, this game is terrific. You fight your way through jungles, heavily-fortified enemy bases, desert-terrain, etc as you carry out your missions. You can choose, in many situations, to go head-on with the enemies or sic your bloodthirsty comrades on them with the press of a button. The music and sounds are top-notch as usual in Star Wars games. You will hear the familar firing of laser blasters and roaring of wookies, not to mention the authentic Star Wars music we all know and love from the movies. Cons: Game is short, but by today's standards of 8-10 hours, I would say it fits in nicely. Perhaps the AI is a bit boring with the repeated use of ""hide behind rock, pop out and shoot, maybe toss a frag, hide again, repeat"", but let's be honest, this is the formula for most games, sadly even today. Oh, almost forgot, if I remember correctly this game has what felt like a moderate cliffhanger at the end. This is a huge con because it leaves the story unfinished I feel. It doesn't take away too much from this great game, but it still sucks. Checking online I see that a sequel was planned and then canceled. However, in 2011 there appeared to be reports that a sequel is still in the works. We will have to wait and see.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very linear, hardly any replayability, but I thought it was a fun ride. There are only three missions. But all of them are quite long. Finished it at almost exactly 10 hours. Coming off from Battlefront II, I thought this game is much better in terms of presentation, especially concerning the first person view. The audio and visual effects in this one just feel more ""real"". I also like the strategy aspect of it. Fights were as much as a test of how well you issue orders as it is a test of your ability to shoot things. Though I found that it was really easy to just run and knife scores of enemies so long as there isn't a ""heavy"" thrown into the mix.The ending sequence was pretty anti-climactic. The endings for the first two missions were harder and more tense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was WAY ahead of it's time! I remember playing it a long time ago on an XBOX and just recently saw it up on Steam and decided to get it. And after all these years and with all the Next Gen FPS titles out today, theres just something about this game that sets it apart from all other games that are out today. Of course the graphics are outdated, but the gameplay is just incredible and the story is actually very interesting! I think it would be absolutely amazing if the there could be a sequal to this game, or even a remake! Playing this game using today's technology would be greatest thing since sliced bread!

												Honestly this is one of the best games I've bought in a long time.Despite being an old game I've only had it crash once and have encountered no glitches or bugs so far.It's hard to describe but the game feels right; you're not an all powerful being, you're a clone and you can killed easily by just about any enemy; similarly your weapons pack an equal punch.It's just so hard to describe, but the one phrase I come back to every time is: it feels right.The game is worth the money and time: if you want a Clone game then this is the game.

												Absolutley loved this game when it was new, was so excited about it back then I baught my first ever new aftermarket Graphics/video Card in order to play it at the best settings and it was beautiful. So many years later and the game is still awesome. Although the online multiplayer comunity has died since then, the gameplay is still just as fun and the squad A.I. and simple commands are still one of the best I've come across. In adddition I came to really like the squadmates as their own characters with their little banter back and forth. However I do have to point out and easily over looked physics issue, as the ""ragdoll bodies"" was new back then, sometimes the dead enemy units shake/twitch/jiggle about one the ground for a bit. Personally I think it's funny looking, but it is noticeable and you might see it a few times throughout the game. Other than that, the game is pretty much flawless in terms of squad shooter gameplay and audio  This game deserves a good sequal, but unfortunately probably won't get one. Anyways I'd recomend this game if you enjoy shooters and anything Star Wars, if you're not a fan of either, then this game may not be for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After the Jedi Knight/Dark Forces series started focusing more on Lightsaber battles and Force powers (which was eventually expanded even further in the Force Unleashed games) it was refreshing to play a good ol'-fashioned, Star Wars shooter again. The use of Star Wars assets isn't exactly done with the most accurate attention to detail, as the design of the droids and other baddies look very little like their saga counterparts, and the weapons would look very out of place in Lucas' universe, but the gameplay and level design more than make up for it. This is a short-but-sweet, fun, squad-based shooter, which doesn't try to be too clever or reinvent the wheel.It's incredible there was never a follow-up, considering the success of the game and the subsequent success of the Clone Wars TV series (which even featured a cameo by the Republic Commando squad), but who knows, maybe one day...

												In my own opinion, this game is probably one of the best, if not THE BEST Star Wars game out there. It puts you into the shoes of a leader of an elite squad of soldiers known as Delta squad. You can manuever and order your squad at will with multiple keys for oders. Telling them what formation to be in, or what foes to target. This game is just simply amazing, it has an AMAZING story and amazing gameplay. Star Wars fan, new or old, you definitely need this in your collection. Besides... Screw lightsabers when you have a good ol' blaster!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It sinks into mediocrity after the first few levels due to not giving the player enough interesting gadgets, enemies, toys and enviornments. One very unique feature however is squad commanding, as you send your troops to do certain tasks and get in certain formations on the battlefield. Worth the initial experience for a lower price.

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe, developed by LucasArts and published by Activision and LucasArts in 2005. The game uses the Epic Games Unreal Engine.In Star Wars: Republic Commando you play as an elite Clone Commando accompanied by three other squad members through three main missions with submissions included. In the game you investigate hostile areas and search for enemy Intel. You are Delta RC-1138 (Boss, orange suit), the leader of Delta 38 who meet up with Delta RC-1262 (Scorch, yellow suit), Delta RC-1140 (Fixer, green suit) and Delta RC-1207 (Sev, red suit). These elite Clone commandos are created at the clone factories on Kamino. As a squad leader you can order your squad members to attack, defend a position or blow up blockades and each squad member has its own abilities. During your military operations you will find yourself at Geonosis (Rocky desert planet) where droids are manufactured, at the Republic Assault Ship (RAS) and at Kashyyyk (Wookie Forest/Swamps Planet).I highly enjoyed this game because tactical functions and of the HUD (Head Up Display) interface which is built inside the Helmet of your character. Also the weapon designs are well done, for instance the DC-17m Commando Rifle Model which is an adaptable rifle of the Galactic Republic. You can change parts of the gun while in battle and switch a modular sniper- or anti-armor grenade launcher attachment when you progress into the storyline. I also liked the hidden blade (Knuckle Plate Vibro Blade) which comes in handy when you are out of ammunition or just for dealing massive damage in close-combat. The voice acting is great and the interaction between squad members makes the game feel lively. I highly recommend this game to people who like the Star Wars Universe or tactical first-person Sci-Fi shooters with great gameplay, certainly when the game is on sale! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This, in my personal opinon, is the best Star Wars game in the entire collection even to date. This game is rich in story, has great character build, and actually has a lot of content for a game that is going on 11 years old. I played this game when I was younger on the original Xbox console, and replaying it on my PC was amazing. I love this game and all its glory even to this date. You should definately play the game.Pros:Story richBeautiful character design and art style (even though the graphics are outdated seeing as this game came out in 2005)Quite a bit of contentVoice actors feel natural and make the funny/serious dialogue in the game so much betterQuite a bit of enemy varietyLocation variertyFunny dialogueCons:Slight glitches with character movement ocasinallySometimes some of the AI within the game don't target you as quickly as they shouldSometimes Delta Squad doesn't listen to comands (happened twice through my entire 8.5 hours)Overall, this game is a ton of fun even today, and the game is worth picking up when on a sale or if you happen to have a spare $10 in your Steam wallet.11/10 Seriously, the game is that much fun.SPOILER BELOW:WHY THE HELL DID SEV HAVE TO GET LEFT BEHIND?!

												'Best Star Wars game of the genre'This game although dated visually, (that said it is perfectly playable) has so much still going for it 10 years after it's intial release.I played through it twice back in the day (before kids), and hung out for a sequal - as it leaves you begging for more!I'm playing it now for the 3rd time.PROs+innovative AND effective teamplay controls. They feel right and work well+voice acting is top notch (Temura Morrison)+soundtrack, ahead of its time for 2005 and much darker and/or militaristic than other star wars gamesCONs+none, other than it's old+It's not a long gameif you dont have it get it!

												Unlike a lot of people, I only thought this game was okay (I'm giving it a positive review, but only just). I also believe that a lot of this game's positive reviews are a result of nostalgia (or being a devout Star Wars fan) at its best. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a MASSIVE Star Wars fan, which is exactly why I'm being honest. The idea for the game was great, and parts of it are fun, but it could have been done much better. Killing Super Battle Droids was just too time consuming. Pumping clip after clip of ammo into them just got monotonous very quickly. I did however like the conclusion of the story and thought the music was great.The multiplayer is a different story altogether. It reminded of Halo, to an extent (especially when everyone is grabbing a rocket launcher) and had solid enough gameplay which makes it fun with a few friends.In short, if you want a great Star Wars shooter get Battlefront II with some mods, you won't regret. I would still however pick up this game if it was on sale for the right amount since it's about as solid as any other average FPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic game!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont really know what to say, as its all ready famouse. Well this is a Star Wars game set in the Clone wars Universe, and you are playing as the Elite Delta Squad. (cant get any better than that :P) Furthermore its a First Person Shooter, with some pretty amazing graphics and the best sound u can get as its coming form Foley sound artists that created all the sound in the movies too, the best sound made form natural resourses, making Star Wars the best. ^^ Lastly u possibly cant get better than this, the main character the Delta Squad leader that you play (Delta 32) is voiced by the one and only: Temuera Morrison, the voice of Jango Fett, the notorious Bounty Hunter from the Star Wars movie: Attack of the Clones ^^Whats not to like??Star Wars game, in a First Person Shooter, and the character u play is voiced by flipping Jango Fett!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!! <310/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my all time favorites and best selling game in the star wars franchise behind battlefront, Republic commando gave me a glimpse into the darker and somewhat gory side of the star wars universe. the game features delta squad fighting its way through several missions and defeating iconic foes such as the droids, trandosians, and geonosians. the game has decent graphic for a 2006 game and i must say it really out did themselfs developing the charactors and evironments they encounter throughout the game. i would say that if your a star wars fan, PICK UP THIS GAME, it is a must play and really hooked me on the franchise.

												Okay to get this out before I had internet or even a steam profile I played the hell out of this game and loved it, I recently saw it on steam and was like ♥♥♥♥ yeah I want this game and got it.At the time when i played this alot i played this and halo 1 & 2 since no other halo is on PC and this game always remided me of halo if it was about star wars. Now i most likely made a bunch of people mad saying its like halo but its really the way it looks than how it playsThis game is great, Its one of those star wars games that was done right and live up to a single player star wars game. Compared to the newer star wars games from EA I would rather play this and if EA ever tried to make a game like this, to be a good game it needs to be a carbon copy pretty much. The game runs just fine for me on windows 10 no crashs and of corse no FPS problems. If u are a fan of star wars and is looking for a game that is a fun first person shooter that does not suck and can run on anything this is the game for you.Today they honestly dont make games like this anymore and its sad			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this. I finished the game twice long before having a steam account, just for clarification. As a diehard Star Wars fan, I've always loved the alternate takes on the universe. Sure, I love Jedis, lightsabers and stuff, but most of all I love how Luke is just a simple farmer, Han is a regular smuggler and there are so many ordinary characters and all of them interesting; and what interests me the most is - what's going on beside the stuff we know from the movies? Aaaaand there you go, play Republic Commando. It's Star Wars by all means but it also isn't. It's a great shooter and even without all the mods out there, it still stands tall these days. Looks good, plays great and the atmosphere of the brotherly love felt among the commandos despite all of them being so epic and tough is amazing. IMPORTANT NOTE: the game is difficult as hell and you'll die a lot. Meaning on the HARD difficulty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ordering your squad around is so fun and you have to or you'll just keep dying over and over again (trust me I know ) all in all I think this deserves all the credit it can get, this game is seriously underated but still fantastic I want a sequel!

												After the Jedi Knight/Dark Forces series started focusing more on Lightsaber battles and Force powers (which was eventually expanded even further in the Force Unleashed games) it was refreshing to play a good ol'-fashioned, Star Wars shooter again. The use of Star Wars assets isn't exactly done with the most accurate attention to detail, as the design of the droids and other baddies look very little like their saga counterparts, and the weapons would look very out of place in Lucas' universe, but the gameplay and level design more than make up for it. This is a short-but-sweet, fun, squad-based shooter, which doesn't try to be too clever or reinvent the wheel.It's incredible there was never a follow-up, considering the success of the game and the subsequent success of the Clone Wars TV series (which even featured a cameo by the Republic Commando squad), but who knows, maybe one day...

												In my own opinion, this game is probably one of the best, if not THE BEST Star Wars game out there. It puts you into the shoes of a leader of an elite squad of soldiers known as Delta squad. You can manuever and order your squad at will with multiple keys for oders. Telling them what formation to be in, or what foes to target. This game is just simply amazing, it has an AMAZING story and amazing gameplay. Star Wars fan, new or old, you definitely need this in your collection. Besides... Screw lightsabers when you have a good ol' blaster!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a first-person shooter about four deadly commandos, the Delta squad, helping the Republic's war effort. You take direct control of the squad's leader, Boss, while he guides his comrades, Sev, Scorch and Fixer, through their missions against the separatists forces.The main beef of the game is indeed to issue orders to your squad (set a demolition charge here, destroy that specific target, ...) in order to advance in the levels. Thankfully your mates' AI is quite handy and won't give you any serious problems, aside from some rare instances (it's worth mentioning that you and your clones aren't friendly fire-proof and your comrades have an annoying tendency to lock themselves into place if facing a mine field). The members of delta Squad can even revive each other if put down, which is rather fortunate.You can access a wide array of weapons (an assault and a sniper rifle, a bazooka of some kind, a pistol, ...) in order to battle several rather challenging enemies. The opponents in Republic Commando are indeed very hard to defeat and range from suicidal infantry units with little sense of survival to very sturdy and hard-hitting mini-bosses who can dish out a lot of damage towards your squad. You don't get to face any real boss, though.Republic Commando's rather short lenght is a well-known fact: it clocks around six or seven hours of gameplay. Many players tend to overlook this in favor of the game's great atmosphere, good soundtrack and solid gameplay, on top of providing a videogame about Star Wars without the usual Jedi and the Force angle and packed with a more gritty and edgier concept			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Get yourself a big glass of chocolate milk and prepare to feel like you're 14 again. Republic Commando is a shooter that plays like Painkiller and Brothers In Arms. It's fun, fast and doesn't take itself to seriously. However, it does have some pacing issues and the gun variety is somewhat lacking, but the charm of your squad makes up for it.If you're itching for Star Wars and FPS then Republic Commando will do.

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is quite possibly the most fun game I have ever played...no exaggeration.Republic Commando is a FPS that was released back in 2005 but stills holds up today as an extremely fun game. In the game, you play as RC-1138, AKA 'Boss', who is the...well...BOSS of an elite clone commando squad known as Delta Squad. You have 3 squadmates: Scorch, the munitions expert, Fixer, the computer slicer, and Sev, the sniper. The 4 of you go on many, many missions across the galaxy and basically destroy everyone in your path. The mechanics of the game are surprisingly smooth and it's easy to get the hang of. You know how to aim at things? You're all good. This game is so worth it for the price not only because of how fun it is, but because of the length of the campaign. I think we've all bought a game and had fun with it but were left short-handed because of how small the campaign was. No worrying about that with this game. You get a blaster rifle, a sniper, shotgun, pistol, grenades, and even a grenade launcher to blow your enemies to hell all while your squad mates are bantering with each other...which is probably one of the best parts of the game.TL;DR Here is a pros and cons listPROS-Good amount of content-Smooth mechanics-Squad banter-Good graphics for its release date-No extra BS. You shoot things.CONS-There isn't a sequel.......YET.(I don't have much play time on Steam at all because I mostly played it on my CD version.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thankfully your mates' AI is quite handy and won't give you any serious problems, aside from some rare instances (it's worth mentioning that you and your clones aren't friendly fire-proof and your comrades have an annoying tendency to lock themselves into place if facing a mine field). The members of delta Squad can even revive each other if put down, which is rather fortunate.You can access a wide array of weapons (an assault and a sniper rifle, a bazooka of some kind, a pistol, ...) in order to battle several rather challenging enemies. The opponents in Republic Commando are indeed very hard to defeat and range from suicidal infantry units with little sense of survival to very sturdy and hard-hitting mini-bosses who can dish out a lot of damage towards your squad. You don't get to face any real boss, though.Republic Commando's rather short lenght is a well-known fact: it clocks around six or seven hours of gameplay. Many players tend to overlook this in favor of the game's great atmosphere, good soundtrack and solid gameplay, on top of providing a videogame about Star Wars without the usual Jedi and the Force angle and packed with a more gritty and edgier concept			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars Republic Commando tells the story of The Clone Wars by the point of view of the leader of a elite commando squad from the Republic fighting against the army of droids and mercenaries of the Separatists. With you there are three other commandos that you give orders in field during each mission,such as slicing door,planting detonators etc. The graphics are nothing to boost about,they are what 2005 games looked like in the day,but the music is great seeing as it triggers only in the right moments. The gameplay is pretty satisfaying and it really makes this game the best FPS i ever played.  The only thing i didn't like about this game is how it has a range of 8-10 hours of campaign,which is pretty short. Even more if you consider that the game ends abruptly AND with a cliffhanger,with a sequel that may never be made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tons of fun to play. Not only was it great back when I was a kid, but it is still pretty good today. Its a shame that there was no sequel following this game but still, definitely worth getting if you haven't tried it. It was games like these that helped me to appreciate the greater Star Wars universe as a kid, and even today the Clone Wars era has a place in my heart. The story is actually pretty good for what seems to be a weird Star Wars title and it was pretty interesting how games like this and the series gave more and more development to these faceless hordes of troopers. The gameplay itself is also quite good and a tad more mature then some more typical Star Wars games of late. Overall, I'd recommend this title to anyone looking for a fun Star Wars games. 8/10			",6,1,0,3,2,0,3

												Star Wars Republic Commando is an fps game released in the star wars universe in 2005. In 2015 it still remains one of the best Star War games ever to be created and im trully sad to admit, i didnt appreciate it in its time of release. Back at the time i felt the game was really hard even on normal and i couldnt get accustomised with the various game mechanics. Now that im a bit older (but certaintly not wiser ^^), i came to appreciate this awesome title in all its grandeur.In this game you play the leader of a republic commando team, whose purpose is espionage,sabotage and advanced reconnaisssance. Obviously stealth is out of the question for like 95% of the game but the rest are yours for the making. Your team includes 3 more members each specializing in its own field. You get your sniper, your demo man and your enginneer as well. Throughout the game you are called to make tactical decisions and place your team8s around the field, in order to maximize your chances of survival and win your confrontations. Its sounds easy to do and at first it is, but as the game evolves your desicions must evolve as well.  All and all that was one aspect i enjoyed the most in this game. As with any good fps, you get to use a lot of different weapons and grenades and you can further enchance your own weapons to meet any kind of enemy. From the simple laser pistol to a full rocket launcher, this game has it all and more.In terms of gameplay difficulty, the game is not as hard as you might think, but its harder that most of todays standard measures. You dont get to do rambo stuff, cause you will be facing the ground and w8 for your m8s to revive you and that is really nervebreaking. All the levels have a linear design as well, so you wont miss your next objective. Maybe for most that is considered a down, but i think it works pretty well for this game.The graphics arent on par with todays standards, but you can modify the texture pack anyway you like and you can increase the games resolution as well. On the plus side even if you dont it still looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And as with any star wars game that respects itself, the audio is one of the best things in this game. Everything from the tiniest footstep to the biggest blast has been exceptional and thats something i cant say for most games these days.The dialogues are grimm and funny at the same time and the voices seem to match everyone and everything in this game.All and all i recommend this game to everyone. If you are a fan of fps you will love it, if you are a fan of star wars you will love it even more and even if you dont like fps try it. You will love it too!!!			",108,7,3,19,4,0,23

												Although at first glance this game seems like it is a waste of any money at all, especially coming out near the attack of the clone game, it is one of the best star wars games I have played. This is my second favorite star wars shooter, barley falling below BattleFront 2. The Story is amazing, the atmosphere makes you feel like a badass, while at the same time feeling so weak and fragile. (Especially when fighting Super Battle Droids) This game is a must with either friends or being alone, as the AI will follow orders and even in today's standards are smart and think well. The HUD idea is great, it gives the look as if you are the clone itself. The graphics hold well, and the combat is spectacular. After playing this, you will have a craving for a sequel, and want to have a higher standard in today's shooter games. 10 out of 10. I enjoyed getting this game while being on sale.

												This game is fantastic in almost everyway, particular emphasis on ALMOST, as there is one particular part about it that you should consider before getting this game.But before I do that, let us discuss what is great about this game, which is a lot. For starters, the gameplay in general is nothing short of amazing and gritty. The gunplay between the various different types of weapons (really attachments to one gun that all do different stuff but w/e) is satisfying. Most battles are often ripe with tension thanks to the more or less competant AI. The game also has a squad system. Wherever you go, you have about three other clones with you to help you out in battle. Like the enemy AI, they can hold their own fine. I especially like how they sometimes go into weird fighting animations with other enemies that they never lose. You can command these troopers to do certain stuff, like blow open doors, hack open doors, take up sniping positions, heal themselves, etc. This provides some level of strategy, though it's usually obvious what you want to do when you do it due to conveinient placement. Now, if any of your members (including yourself) ends up biting the dust, then you or another member can help them back up. Overall, the system works well enough, and  I reccommend you learn it fast.Normally, something like this would be good, but the game continues to impress with its characters and story. Just in case none of you know, this game takes place throughout the Clone Wars of the Prequel Films. It centers on Delta Squad, a four-man squad of elite clone troopers, who are genetically modified soldiers. Essentially ten-year trained badasses. However, the different types of personalities between the four all make sense. Boss, the clone you play as, is more or less uptight, but compassionate and caring for his men. Fixer is by-the-book, standard soldier guy. Sev is dark and overall creepy, but you grow to love the guy due to his wisecracking remarks with his fellow squadmates as well as his ruthless combat skills. Finally, there's Scorch, who is hilarious in every way. Throughout the story, you grow to care about them and what they go through, something you wouldn't normally expect from a game focusing on emotionless military badasses.The story itself is grand, if short (clocks in around 6-7 hours at most.) You get lead through planets like Kashyyk, an abandoned ship, and Geonosis.Overall, the game is amazing... except for one thing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is unstable as hell. I don't know what it is, but there is a possibilty your game will crash as soon as you make a new game and play the first mission. And when I say that, I mean as your guy literally lands on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground. Fixes have been made for this, but they don't work for me. So take that into consideration.9/10 ",74,4,0,3,4,0,2

Based during the early days of the clone wars just after the movie star wars ep. 2.Essentially a solid squad shooter with light  tactical elements, Republic commando creates the most gritty view of the star wars world ever seen.Top quality Star Wars game that should belong in any fans collection.

												Still a great game, very happy to pick it up on sale as I never completed it back in the day.It CAN be run at 1080p, but you'll need to use a hex editor to change the aspect ratio to 16:9 and open up a .ini file with notepad (or your text editor of choice) to incease the resolution to 1920x1080.  It's VERY VERY easy to do this, but if you don't understand these basic terms and plan to ♥♥♥♥♥ endlessly about not having native 1080p in a 2005 game, you've only got yourself to blame.

The gameplay is just great, modern developers should be inspired with this one. Plus it has probably the best soundtrack I ever heard in any game. Epic.			",128,31,1,11,3,0,11

												Star Wars: Republic CommandoThis is a Star Wars FPS that puts you in control of a squad of elite clones, better known as Delta Squad. Your squad members have different personalities. Funny, reckless, and serious. You have to complete campaigns, which can take quite a long time to complete. Your squad members have different abilities, one's good at explosives, one's good at computers, and one's good at sniping. You can assign them to do things. The shooting is like CoD, but the graphics are a bit outdated. I'd recommend this game, it's a good Star Wars FPS  game - possibly one of the best made. 9.5/10			",32,8,0,2,3,0,7

												Star Wars Republic Commando, Knights of the Old Republic, and Battlefront 1 are considered the Holy Trinity of Star Wars games.  You can put Rogue Squadron in there as well, but these three are always the ones everyone always talks about.  Republic Commando is an FPS set during the period of the Clone Wars where you command an elite clone unit called Delta Squad.  As you travel throughout the galaxy and undergo missions you will be faced with very difficult challenges, very immersive gameplay, and a cast of characters you will never forget.  This is a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game.  It's hard, it's fun, and it leaves you begging for more.  I remember this game came out during the time of Halo 1 and after playing both I thought Republic Commando just kicked way much more♥♥♥♥♥  This is a game you must play if you're a Star Wars fan or an FPS fan.  You will be hooked right as soon as you give your squad that first ""BREACH THAT DOOR"" command.I'm giving this game a strong 9.5/10.			",51,8,0,12,10,0,7

												This game. THIS GAME. This game, if I'm correct, is the reason I joined Steam. When I was younger, I used to watch videos of the campaign. I thought it was the coolest thing ever when they would knife a Geonosian and blood got over the screen, only to be taken away by a laser. I wanted it so bad, so when someone I know showed it to me on Steam, I ran straight home and installed Steam. I do not regret sitting there and watching the install screen for two hours. I really wish more people had known about the game in it's time, because then there would've been a sequel. The ending is just a huge cliffhanger, and I need to know what happens.This game deserves a 10/10. Hands-down.			",12,0,0,2,0,0,1

												Clear Space Hulks, blow up vital bridges, and play a vital (if now unrecognized) role in a war you were born to fight as a member of the elite Delta Squad! The game itself is quite old, and unfortunately has not aged as well as most. However, if you're a die-hard Star Wars fan, a classic FPS connoisseur, or a nostalgia junkie, this is well worth the now discounted price of admission. Multiplayer via Gamespy is dead (and has been for years, as most of you already know), but Multiplayer via direct-connect servers or Gameranger are available (If that's your thing). Regardless, If you're itching for something old, with maybe a little bit of mold attached, look no further!			",358,107,3,44,36,4,58

												One of the most fun and challenging Star Wars games to date.  Don't bother reading the negative reviews, they're all just Call Of Duty fanboys expecting a Star Wars version of their favorite game, which it is not. This game actually requires you to try and to think, not just run around  one shotting every enemy you see while you take a thousand hits and not die. Enemies take time to kill, and some require teamwork to take down. The characters are pretty awesome and as the game progresses, it gets more challenging and more interesting. It's always fun to stab a B1 Battle Droid and see its insides splatter on your hud, then see your teammate tackle a Droideka and smash its head in. Even seeing another teammate snap a Geonosians head. It's just an incredible game. Anybody who says otherwise, is an idiot and has no taste in games whatsoever. Buy this game.You think this is a joke?   Buy it already.    ",105,3,0,5,7,1,4

												Quite possibly the best Star Wars licenced game out there in my opinion. I have fond memories of playing this when I was 7 or 8 years old back in the day, and the game has not aged AT ALL. Smart squad commands, challenging enemies, a wide and interesting array of weapons and some of the best voicework in a game I have seen. Its not just a great star wars game, but its a great shooter as well. Highly RecommendedPros-Intuitive and innovative squad commands-Interesting weapons, like the Trandoshan projectile weapons and the DC15 system-Great AI, both enemy and teammates-Brutal difficulty even on normal-Wide array of enemy types, and you even get to see characters such as Yoda and General Grevious!Cons-Pretty short, clocked in about 6 hours-Buggy in some sections'-NO SEQUEL			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars Republic Commando (or as I like to call it also, Band of Clone Bros) is the forgotten and underrated Star Wars video game that everybody that loves the Star Wars franchise should play. The story of the game is based on the 2nd and 3rd movies of the prequel trilogy, where you play as the leader of a Spec Ops squad of 4 Clones of the Galactic Republic who are responsible for performing special missions that occure behind the scenes of the Clone Wars. This is a squad based game, where using your squad team seriously will be your road for victory. The fact that you play as a Clone, fighting along aside with a team of other Clones, breaks the monotony of the usual protagonists of a story of a Star Wars game, which tend to be Jedis, Siths or some random bounty hunter.I agree, like the vast majority of people who played it, that this is a good game - but not a perfect one. It has one problem that I felt frustrated about: while the enemy was agressive against you, your squad team will be very weak and will lack agressivness, unless you babysit them all the time. Sometimes, they will just get close to an enemy and try killing them by melee (it reminds me of the Warscape Engine BS that is now plaguing the Total War series...), instead of trying to get to cover by their own initiative. Another problem  that I have with the game is the lack of variety with the level designs: the game is divided only by 3 chapters, which are limited equally to 3 areas (first you fight in one planet, then inside a ship, and then again in another planet). A little bit of more effort from the producers of this videogame could have created more variety for you to be present in another scenarios/planets of the Clone Wars. But I believe this problem to be minor, when you compare to the much more positive aspects of the game.Still, I cannot recommend you buy it at full price (except if your are a Star Wars nerd :P), since it is an old game and it no longer has an active multiplayermode. Buy it only when it´s in promotion.Like many people claim, this game really needs a sequel - where you play as the same squad team, now part of the forces of the eeeeeeeevil Galactic Empire. It would have been a much better sequel to make instead of the disaster that was Star Wars ""BattleFront"" EA (THE GAME IS NOT WORTH OF DESERVING OF ""BATTELFRONT"" ON IT´S TITLE!!!). Unfortunatelly, this game appears to have been forgotten and I don´t think a sequel (or a reboot) will ever be created.7.5 out of 10 ",58,7,0,4,5,0,7

												Gritty, dark, and a heck of a lot of fun to play, Star Wars: Republic Commando is a first person tactial shooter that finds the perfect balance between strategy and action.Whereas most First-Person shooters take the action route there are still a few extreme tactical and strategy based military such as the Tom Clancy: Rainbow Six series. The Rainbow Six series takes a linear strategy and tactical based approach to military operations. The game focuses on the ""How to"" rather than the ""What to."" The problem with games like this is that they combine the complex strategy with a genre that most people prefer to stay focused on the ""What to."" First-Person Shooters. Therefore creating an issue. You have those who love it because it of it strict strategy focus and then you have those who hate it because it doesn't have enough action. Republic Commando solves this issue...It blends (and balances) the action with the strategy. Featuring a one key strategy system you can command your squad members directly and quickly. No sub-menus, no complicated explanation. Just push and play. One of the games main features is a excellent AI system. And boy is it good...You squad members know how to fight and how to do it efficiently. They automatically take cover and stay focused on the objective. They eliminate the primary targets first and take on the secondary ones later. The first time playing the game through, I found myself dying more than the AI! Now that is good...The gameplay is fast paced, frantic, and exciting. It perfectly balances strategy and action.The graphics are...meh...In their day they were probably amazing. But now a dated Quake engine remains. Don't get me wrong the graphics aren't bad, but by today's standards they are a little old, but acceptable. The sound is good and the soundtrack is perfect. The soundtrack by Jesse Harlin is a great blend of dark overtones, action sequences, and excellent buildup. The sound effects in game sound exactly like Star Wars.The campaign is extremely fun. It isn't even much of a campaign. It is just three big missions broken up into small parts. I have probably played the game's through about 7 times. My only complaint about the campaign is the rather abrupt ending. Now I won't spoil anything but it will leave you feeling like...""WHAT! THAT'S IT! THAT WASN'T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO END! THERE WAS SOOOOO MUCH BUILD UP! COME ON!""Then you will go frantically searching the web to try and find if there is a sequal. And you'll find this: CancelledAnd when your all done you can play the multiplayer! Which is fun, but pretty much dead...So in short this game is awesome. Go get it!Overall Rating: 7.5/10Presentation: 10/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 6.5/10Sound: 9/10Lasting Appeal: 7/10Overall Rating: 7.5/10Content Review:Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tough game to review in terms of content. While much of the game is dark, gritty, and permeated by death, on has tot take int the account the fact that...well...it's Star Wars. This is (so far) the most violent Star Wars Video Game to date. Thankfully, violence is the only category that scores high in this game, in terms of content.Positive Elements: You fight on the good side. You stand for morals such as teamwork, unity, and justice. Teamwork is essential to success in the game.6/10 (Moderate) Violence: The game is a First Person Shooter, so some violence is expected. What is different about this game game though in comparison to previous Star Wars games is that it features an extensive amount of blood, gore, and corpses. The Genossian bug enemy's you fight break into bits and pieces when killed. If you shoot an enemy up close blood will splatter on your visor only to be removed by a wiper blade seconds later. When shooting at an enemy you can see spurts of blood flying off. Combat is highlighted by screams, cries of pain, and yelling. In addition to all that, many bodies of human clones are found scattered throughout the game.3/10 (Infrequent/Mild) Language: D--n and Hell are used occasionally. Insults like, clankers, and scumbag are uttered with frequency.0/10 (None) Sexual Content: :)0/10 (None) Drugs/Alcohol: :)4/10 (Present) Negative Elements: Death permeates the environment. Much of the game is dark and has a bleak outlook on things. Frequently the Commandos quote from their fake rule book which says things like ""Rule Number 1: Kill them before they kill you.""Other Moral Issues: The weird mystical Force is mentioned (e.g.""May the force be with you."") but never elaborated on. The Commandos are cloned from another human being, as are many of the other soldiers you see in game. Final Content Rating: 5.5 (Acceptable)Key Elements- Violent - Gritty and Dark- Death permeates the environment- Infrequent Mild Language			",90,20,2,2,1,1,3

												Well, whatever people have to praise about in this game has already been posted, and as you can see I recommend this for pretty much the same reasons. Great gameplay, great soundtrack, great experience overall, but yet I really want to warn this to anyone reading this review. The ending is too abrupt, you're led to believe that things are only beggining, that the game is at it's crucial point with a plot twist incoming... and then it ends. I loved the story but I have to admit it was one of the WORST moments to ever end a game, specially one this good. So yeah, you've been warned. Still worth buying though.			",95,23,1,21,5,0,6

												Hard but awesome.You have to learn to work with your spaud. If you don't work together you will not succeed.But after mastering this the game turns into a very tactial shooter where sqaud positioning can be the difference between a glorious victory and defeat.			",33,2,0,5,0,0,2

												If any game in the Star Wars universe needs a sequel it is this game. As short and repetive as this game can get Republic Commando at least gave you exactly what you expected without any fluff or bullcrap. The game isn't perfect but it was the best at what it needed to do at the time. I dont care who or what i have to do in this world to get another of this game, but the idea of a strategic team of clones running around behind the scenes of war and doing things that you havent heard of for good reason is a brilliant way to add to the Star Wars universe without ever having to break Cannon or mold to the story. They can be anywhere doing anything and the story will always make sense as long as they dont fight or kill important characters to the rest of the universe. I love it.			",80,5,2,6,5,0,7

												Anyone who likes star wars should take the time to play this game, the fact that your able to experice the play of a commando brings a new perspective to star wars games instead of the standard 3rd person shooter (Such as the battlefront games, also good) i would highly recommened playing this game.Pro:- Good graphics considering when the game was made.- Good Gameplay- Good story- Good Story lengthCons:- No multiplayer any longer- No second game ( Was turned into a book instead due to funding or so i've heard)			",63,4,0,15,4,0,3

												One of the best star wars games I have EVER played. Delta squad is an amazing squad ofclones, I haven't got to far into the game yet, however I already know that this will be one of my favourie games of all time. The game is based in the clone wars where you are teh commader of a 4 man team who battle their way through waves of droids in relatable battles to the movie. This game is a must buy.

												STAR WARS: Republic Commando, a video game that takes place between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, is an ideal example for a STAR WARS game about ordinary soldiers.  Fun, humorous, and unique, its pros outway its cons, but the problems can still pop up.Plot:You are Delta 38, the leader of a group of elite clone commandos working for the republic.  You, along with your team, must do the jobs that are too big to know about and too extreme for a regular clone.  Your team is the greatest weapon you have.  Versatile, yet disfunctional, your squad consist of 07 AKA Sev, a vicious hunter who rarely ever misses, 62 AKA Scorch, the demolitions expert with the maturity of a teenager, and 40 AKA Fixer, your second-in-command and tech head who is serious, yet pure of heart.  They will either cheer for you or jeer at you.  Nevertheless, you four are family, and that's how it will always be.PROS: - Good characters you can invest in- Spectacular wepons- The squad moves and operates like real life soldiers- Very funny catchphrases and jeers- Unique locations- Distinctive weapons- Extras are interestingCONS:- Not a lot of locations- Gameplay takes some getting use to- No controller functionality			",17,1,0,0,0,2,0

												I remember the first time I put that disk, that artwork of Delta Squad giving me excitement, waiting for this game to finish installing so I could play as a Clone Commando. I was 15, perhaps, maybe 14. Being a Star Wars fan, spending hours playing Knights of the Old Republic, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.Got this on a discount a while ago, wanted to have my old games on Steam. - and still, this feels so damn good.Nostalgia isn't a reason to still hype over this game. Republic Commando did define the First Person Shooter genre, combining a Squad-based Gameplay with a Tactical Shooter. You play your cards right, you don't die. Still, many shooters can't reach this level, they can't make a fast gameplay combined with team management in the middle of the combat. This game gave us a choice to place our commandos in the right places, managing our resources between having more firepower and getting the job done. Not the best variety of weapons, sure; still leading a group of four in various scenarios is enough to get yourself in a challange.If anything, it's worth playing for the story itself. Being a ""Deluxe Model"" in a Clone Army, leading a squad of Clone Commandos with different characteristics. Listening to them trashing at each other, commenting on kills and reacting to your actions. Well-designed, well-thought.To this day, Republic Commando is still one of the most feature-rich First Person Shooters out there. Still looking good, still has a damn-good story, still enojyable, still challanging. - Do you like First Person Shooters? Then, this is a must have.			",80,16,1,12,1,0,9

												A not so long time ago in a country not far far away came a game so good we would ask for a sequel for ten years after release and still has not got one yet. This is star wars Republic Commandos. In the introduction you are shown the early years of a clone through quick clips of training introducing your squad. Your excellently written and acted squad is comprised of Fixer, the hacker and technical expert, Sev who is the hunter and sniper of the group who jokes around with Scorch, the demolitions expert who is always telling jokes at the worst of times. You and your squad fight on iconic planets from the movies such as Geonosis and Kashyyyk doing missons such as killing geonosian leaders, blowing up droid factories and saving wookie generals. The game is a first person shooter (obviously) with some strategy elements involved via squad commands such as ordering your troops to move to tactical positions, provide covering fire, attack targeted enemies and seize objectives. Certain actions will play to a commando's strengths like Sev is the best with a sniper and Scorch arms explosives faster and Fixer hacks quicker. This game looks good even though it came out about a decade ago and has really nice level design. The campaign is short lasting about 5-7 hours but it makes you eager for more and the story set up a sequel which we unfortunately never got but i hope that one day we will. All in all i give this game an 8/10, i would have rated if the campaign was slightly longer.			",69,3,0,8,1,1,5

												This game is fantastic in almost everyway, particular emphasis on ALMOST, as there is one particular part about it that you should consider before getting this game.But before I do that, let us discuss what is great about this game, which is a lot. For starters, the gameplay in general is nothing short of amazing and gritty. The gunplay between the various different types of weapons (really attachments to one gun that all do different stuff but w/e) is satisfying. Most battles are often ripe with tension thanks to the more or less competant AI. The game also has a squad system. Wherever you go, you have about three other clones with you to help you out in battle. Like the enemy AI, they can hold their own fine. I especially like how they sometimes go into weird fighting animations with other enemies that they never lose. You can command these troopers to do certain stuff, like blow open doors, hack open doors, take up sniping positions, heal themselves, etc. This provides some level of strategy, though it's usually obvious what you want to do when you do it due to conveinient placement. Now, if any of your members (including yourself) ends up biting the dust, then you or another member can help them back up. Overall, the system works well enough, and  I reccommend you learn it fast.Normally, something like this would be good, but the game continues to impress with its characters and story. Just in case none of you know, this game takes place throughout the Clone Wars of the Prequel Films. It centers on Delta Squad, a four-man squad of elite clone troopers, who are genetically modified soldiers. Essentially ten-year trained badasses. However, the different types of personalities between the four all make sense. Boss, the clone you play as, is more or less uptight, but compassionate and caring for his men. Fixer is by-the-book, standard soldier guy. Sev is dark and overall creepy, but you grow to love the guy due to his wisecracking remarks with his fellow squadmates as well as his ruthless combat skills. Finally, there's Scorch, who is hilarious in every way. Throughout the story, you grow to care about them and what they go through, something you wouldn't normally expect from a game focusing on emotionless military badasses.The story itself is grand, if short (clocks in around 6-7 hours at most.) You get lead through planets like Kashyyk, an abandoned ship, and Geonosis.Overall, the game is amazing... except for one thing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is unstable as hell. I don't know what it is, but there is a possibilty your game will crash as soon as you make a new game and play the first mission. And when I say that, I mean as your guy literally lands on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground. Fixes have been made for this, but they don't work for me. So take that into consideration.9/10 ",74,4,0,3,4,0,2

As a fan of the Clone Wars, I can see where a lot of inspiration for the characteristics and plot design are inspired by this game. It is also an extremely challenging game, and you need to latch on to exactly how to destroy enemies and their weaknesses. There are even times I played and just ragequit from how hard it became.

												Although at first glance this game seems like it is a waste of any money at all, especially coming out near the attack of the clone game, it is one of the best star wars games I have played. This is my second favorite star wars shooter, barley falling below BattleFront 2. The Story is amazing, the atmosphere makes you feel like a badass, while at the same time feeling so weak and fragile. (Especially when fighting Super Battle Droids) This game is a must with either friends or being alone, as the AI will follow orders and even in today's standards are smart and think well. The HUD idea is great, it gives the look as if you are the clone itself. The graphics hold well, and the combat is spectacular. After playing this, you will have a craving for a sequel, and want to have a higher standard in today's shooter games. 10 out of 10. I enjoyed getting this game while being on sale.

												First time I saw this, I played the demo of it on the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Xbox disc.  Original Xbox.  And I was blown away.  Fast forward nine years.  I see it on Steam, and just because I'd been wanting to play it since that day in 2006, I bought it.  I exxpected to find the game having aged like milk.  Was I wrong!  It still looked like that day that I played it on the original Xbox.  And, I tell you what; this game could hold its own against some of today's games.  No problem!  I'll admit, though, it DOES feel a bit odd, now, playing it with a mouse.  This game was a console game, and the aiming felt so good with a right stick.  Even with the Steam Controller and its trackpad, the aiming doesn't feel right, somehow.  But, I digress.  Regardless of the aiming issue, this is still oone of my favorite first person shooters, third only to UT2004, which is second only to DOOM (The original)			",135,9,13,23,13,0,11

												One of the few good things to come out of the Prequel Era.The gameplay revolves around properly managing your squad, and has interesting encounters. The scope is more focused than other, grand and epic Star Wars games, but by the end of the game, you've really connected with your squad. They may all be numbers to the Jedi, but you will remember each character's colour, number, nickname, and preferences.The only unfortunate thing is that the game's premise could have easily made this a 4-player-co-op shooter, but it isn't. The multiplayer is generic and mostly bland, but the single player campaign is definitely worth it. The least enjoyable parts of the game are when you are separated from your squad, working independently. Without the squad management, it becomes a generic shooter set in the Star Wars universe.

												I'd say this game is worth some of your time. I love the characters (mostly Sev and Scorch) and the gameplay is fun and challenging, yet can be a little repetitive before it's all over. It took me about 7 hours to beat the game on Normal difficulty, , but (MINOR SPOILER ALERT)                                                                                                                                                  when I was starting to get really pumped after the last mission thinking there  was going to be more to it, the game just ended causing my heart to skip several beats out of serious disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I do believe this game deserves a sequel yet I have a feeling that the developers might screw things up such as: making   Delta Squad as flat, generic, and emotionless protagonists or forget them at least. Overall I would give this game a 3.75/5 mostly because of length it has.			",35,0,0,3,2,0,2

												This game is a great first person shooter for not just Star Wars fans, anyone looking to just have fun. It may be a relatively short game, but its replay value is astounding and it doesn't suffer from Call of Duty Syndrome. The campaign's story is an amazing experience that leaves you wishing that a sequel had been made.Unfortunately, the multiplayer on this game is very lacking. For a great Star Wars multiplayer experience, I recommend getting Star Wars Battlefront.Also, the gore level in this game is limited to a small amount of green blood, so convincing parents to buy this game is easier than most other first person shooters.

												Spectacular game!!!! I highly recommend this FPS. The controls are still fun after all of these years (11 years later) and the graphics are well worth it too since you can pick this game up for less than $5 when it goes on sale. The campaign mode is pretty short but it's pretty challanging at times. There are a few glitches in this game though which only increases the difficulty. The glitches are all with your teammates though. The AI is challenging and your squad works their butt off too. I haven't attempted to play the multi-player but the campaign alone is worth the time.Best Star Wars game to immerse you in the universe since there's a lot more in this world than Jedi and the force.

												for a game made in 2005 I will always hold this game in my top 10 games of all time a memorable yet short story your squadmates likeable and not just ai's with weapons and without them the mix of a FPS and a tactical squad game wouldnt exist. The levels are beutiful and the enemies are difficult and fun to fight. The multiplayer was underpopulated and yet still enough to be fun. A clever and great way of seeing the militaristic world of the star wars universe. A star wars game with no jedi no force and ridiculous over powerd abilities. However some glitchy AI is prevelent and the lack of a co-op system holds the game back. If this game is ever remade and remade well I believe it could a game of the year award.			",148,9,0,7,6,1,10

												great game, really top class. The art work is amazing, the sound is phenom, and the game play is crisp. Story is out of this world. the only issue I had is that you see in the movies and in the show that clones could take down a droid in a shot or two, maybe a few more for the SBD but in this, you need to empty at least 2 mags in to an SBD with your blaster rifle before you scratch it. and also those bugs are hard to shoot. shoot in bursts.

												Star Wars Republic Commando may be old but it still is fairly impressive and creative.The game gives you a feeling of being this group of tactical units that are effective by themselves, but more effective together.  Republic Commando manages to do this without making you feel overpowered and still keeps you on edge with enemies that require extra attention along with spawning pods.  Though the campaign is short I recommend this game.  This is still in my opinion one of the BEST Star Wars games ever created!			",34,10,0,5,3,0,0

												How do I even explain this game. One word: Epicness. This game deserves a 8/10, a great game to play if you like FPS games and Star Wars.Yea the graphics are dated, but it's still a great game. If you want to buy this game, buy it when it goes on sale. If you don't, then at least rent it. I can guarantee you will like this game just as I do. Pros:-Fluid controls-Great Gameplay-Likeable Characters-Interesting Guns-Use Team MechanicCons:-Graphics (I don't care about graphics as long as the gameplay is good)-Hard to customize controls			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game for fans of simple, FPS shooters, but it is also a relatively hollow game, all things considered. -The gameplay is fun, and the ability to command your squad is a unique gameplay mechanic. -There are no upgrades, collectibles, or unlockables, and the levels are fairly linear. This can be good, bad, or a little of both, depending on your personal preference.-The story is minimal, but definitely there. The characters are likeable, but relatively static, and the narrative is pretty surface level. The ending is very sudden, and doesn't really give the player much resolution.-The game is very stable, with very few bugs, but the few bugs that can occur were, at least in my experience, very noticeable, though not game-breaking.-The game can be very nostalgic for fans of shooters from the mid 2000s (arguably the peak of shooter games), and the story may be quite interesting for Star Wars fans (I believe this game is still canon, in case you were wondering).-There is virtually no replayability, but considering the current price for this game, the 9-12 hours of gameply you'll get are well worth what you'll pay.-The graphics aren't bad at all, especially for its time.Overall review = 6/10 Not great, but for $9.99, certainly not bad			",55,11,1,4,13,0,0

												Ah, I love this game. I remember playing it when it was on the X-box, and was is great to play it again.It's a squad based action shooter, with rather intelligent AI companions (Although they can't use any weapons other than the main gun unless in special cover). You play through the game taking place during the Clone wars as a elite squad sent on special missions, and in my opinion it really nails that atmosphere of taking on the impossible odds, as your sent against increasingly difficult hoards of enemies. Keep it mind, it isn't an RPG, there are no real choices or decisions to be made, and there is no multiplayer scene, giving it unfortunately very little replayability other than for enjoyment. It is a fun game however, and offers some of what I feel is the best squad gameplay and teamwork mechanics even compared to newer games today.

												This game feels like it should have been made in the 90s, when memorable characters and good stories came to games without question.It's an FPS where you lead a squad of clone soldiers - all who manage to have a distinct and enjoyable personality - as you tear around behind the curtains of the Star Wars universe.  You won't jumping from any rooftops in flashy lightsaber fights, but your crack team of mighty mortals finds their own way to be awesome.Squad controls are simple, too.  It reminds me of a more involved Mass Effect.  You can give general orders like fall back or take cover, but all throughout the level are little hot spots that a squade mate (or yourself) can take advantage of.  Lot of enemies in a room?  Get someone on the turret.  Just make sure you cover him on the way over there so he doesn't get shot (or you do it, and have your guys cover you).It's a surprisingly great game with a fun concept, delightful characters, and solid mechanics.  It's aged, but not so much that it's not worth $20.			",312,56,0,39,13,2,39

												I wish there was a star rating for steam, because while Republic Commando is a good game, it has a lot of problems. Its singleplayer campaign is just too short, bordering the length of the original portal, and the finish is anticlimactic. You just start to connect with your AI squadmates when the campagin ends, and its kind of frustrating that they couldn't have added on another mission or two. On the positive side its a fun game with a lot of strategy and a decent enough plot, but I'd wait until it goes on sale before buying it. I also really enjoyed the mechanics for working with your AI squad mates, and I wish more FPSes did AI interaction as well as this title. All in all a good game, but with dated graphics and thats just too short.			",53,3,0,2,11,0,7

												This is truly an amazing game. Take a step into the life of a clone commando, where you are responsible for the lives of your squad mates. This is one of the greatest Star Wars games of all time! Immerse yourself into the awe inspiring Star Wars World to command a clone squad, as their leader you must be responsible for their strategic actions and welfare. With the use of in-game techniques based on real Special Ops techniques, set up your squad in the best way possible to take down the CIS! In this expansion of the Star Wars universe, wield new, unique weaponry designed to fit the aliens that conceived them! This game is one of my all-time top favorites and I rate it at 10 out of 10! I have never come across such a distinctive game as this, both in story and gameplay! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategic gameplay, first person shooters, Star Wars, or well written story lines! ""Enemy eliminated, proceeding to next sector!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First time I saw this, I played the demo of it on the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Xbox disc.  Original Xbox.  And I was blown away.  Fast forward nine years.  I see it on Steam, and just because I'd been wanting to play it since that day in 2006, I bought it.  I exxpected to find the game having aged like milk.  Was I wrong!  It still looked like that day that I played it on the original Xbox.  And, I tell you what; this game could hold its own against some of today's games.  No problem!  I'll admit, though, it DOES feel a bit odd, now, playing it with a mouse.  This game was a console game, and the aiming felt so good with a right stick.  Even with the Steam Controller and its trackpad, the aiming doesn't feel right, somehow.  But, I digress.  Regardless of the aiming issue, this is still oone of my favorite first person shooters, third only to UT2004, which is second only to DOOM (The original)			",135,9,13,23,13,0,11

												One of the few good things to come out of the Prequel Era.The gameplay revolves around properly managing your squad, and has interesting encounters. The scope is more focused than other, grand and epic Star Wars games, but by the end of the game, you've really connected with your squad. They may all be numbers to the Jedi, but you will remember each character's colour, number, nickname, and preferences.The only unfortunate thing is that the game's premise could have easily made this a 4-player-co-op shooter, but it isn't. The multiplayer is generic and mostly bland, but the single player campaign is definitely worth it. The least enjoyable parts of the game are when you are separated from your squad, working independently. Without the squad management, it becomes a generic shooter set in the Star Wars universe.

												I remember the first time I put that disk, that artwork of Delta Squad giving me excitement, waiting for this game to finish installing so I could play as a Clone Commando. I was 15, perhaps, maybe 14. Being a Star Wars fan, spending hours playing Knights of the Old Republic, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.Got this on a discount a while ago, wanted to have my old games on Steam. - and still, this feels so damn good.Nostalgia isn't a reason to still hype over this game. Republic Commando did define the First Person Shooter genre, combining a Squad-based Gameplay with a Tactical Shooter. You play your cards right, you don't die. Still, many shooters can't reach this level, they can't make a fast gameplay combined with team management in the middle of the combat. This game gave us a choice to place our commandos in the right places, managing our resources between having more firepower and getting the job done. Not the best variety of weapons, sure; still leading a group of four in various scenarios is enough to get yourself in a challange.If anything, it's worth playing for the story itself. Being a ""Deluxe Model"" in a Clone Army, leading a squad of Clone Commandos with different characteristics. Listening to them trashing at each other, commenting on kills and reacting to your actions. Well-designed, well-thought.To this day, Republic Commando is still one of the most feature-rich First Person Shooters out there. Still looking good, still has a damn-good story, still enojyable, still challanging. - Do you like First Person Shooters? Then, this is a must have.			",80,16,1,12,1,0,9

Posted: May 24, 2015
												One of the best Star Wars games I've ever played! Every aspect of this game feels really polished, creative, and researched (well, as much as you can for a sci-fi setting). It all comes together with the gameplay to make a really immersive and surprisingly original (since it's not just re-hashing something straight out of the movies) experience.First of all, the gameplay. After my first session of this game, I actually had a lot of complaints. The enemies feel like bullet sponges - often times taking entire clips just to down one. My squadmates stand out in the open in view of a strong enemy and stupidly march to their deaths without taking cover into consideration. The reticle for the main rifle is really wide and it doesn't feel ""precise"" like I would imagine a laser weapon would feel. Even when I have an enemy in the crosshairs a lot of shots go wide. However, after my second session these complaints disappeared as I got familiarity with the gameplay. You learn the importance of grenades for taking out the high-health enemies, the importance of ordering your troops around to specific ""maneuvers"", how to hit targets with all the different weapons, and how it doesn't matter that much if your squad does dumb stuff because you can still win encounters on your own. You start to understand the tactical tradeoffs of the different maneuvers and weapons. So, if you find yourself frustrated or a bit annoyed your first time playing, give it a rest for the day and come back tomorrow.You might notice the squad-based tactics and orders system. If you've played other games like that, you might be dreading having to deal with it, but I think that it's done very well in this game. It's really simple, and they do a great job of helping you keep track of what your squad is doing. There's a lot of subtle ways they achieve this and I won't describe them all. You won't really have to micro manage what everybody is doing using all sorts of different keys - you usually just press F2 so they follow you around, and then point at things in the environment and press ""f"" to tell a squad mate to perform a specific maneuver. Because it's implemented this way, it's pretty seamless as you switch between shooting and commanding your squad. Even if you go down, your squad can sometimes manage on their own and come revive you.Anyway, it's hard to be frustrated with this game because of the great quick save and quick load system. It's really fast and makes it so you never have to worry about replaying a section over and over. If you do find yourself at a  spot where you keep failing, there's usually a ""trick"" to the encounter to overcome that spot, accomplished by intelligently using the weapons and maneuvers available to you. It's a nice way to design a game like this - a lot of the encounters are kind of like puzzles, in a way.And all that is just about the gameplay. One of the best things about this game is the detail and the immersion it achieves. I highly recommend going into the sound settings and making sure you max them out if you can, and making sure to play with headphones with the volume high enough. There's all sorts of details in all the little sounds, the writing, the UI elements, the dialogue and one-off things the characters say that manages to not get too repetitive, and lots more that needs to be experienced to be understood.If you like Star Wars games, this is one of the best. Even without that, the game is a fun, squad-based sci-fi shooter. It's actually similar to Halo in a lot of ways, so if you like that game I bet you'd enjoy this.			",216,50,8,24,23,3,32

												Such an old game and such a good game. No matter how  far star wars universum will go this game will still be on top list. We need second part of this game, or oder fps game like this with campaign where u can feel like the real comando. This game showed u dont need to have lightsaber to make perfect star wars climate.

												Now, im not a professional reviewer, so Ill just give you what I think compared to games today. I think this game still holds its own. The graphics are dated but gunplay and gameplay is fun. Some small AI bugs and some funny glitches, I only found ONE game breaking which happened YEARS ago. It was when a Delta got stuck in a pit and refused to do anything. I could continue level, but I reloaded it cause I didnt want him in the hole. I never got to play multi so I dont have opinion on that. I found the game fun in general and I have played through it multiple times. I think this game still holds its own, but it would be REALLY NICE if this game got a sequel. I doubt it will happen, but battle front got one, right? (Even though from what I hear so far its not good). Well, if you stuck with me this far, then I recommend if you havent already, give it a try.			",137,8,0,13,8,1,19

												A fantastic game with excellent music and endearing squad humour. In my opinion it has also aged well.You are Delta 38, leader of the 4-man Delta Team who are clone troopers with advanced equipment and medical implants, as well as more personality to help with creative thinking.The gameplay mostly revolves around ordering your squad members into positions, which also tells them what weapons to use. Best of all your squad will actually do what you tell them to, even if it gets them taken out. Makes you wonder how Fallout 4 still can't fix companions standing in doorways!Know that the first area (Geonosis) is the least fun, so stick with it. As you progress the game (slowly) gives you more options, as in there will be more positions than you have squad members, so you will have to make quick decisions while under fire. The pacing gets faster as well, both from more dangerous enemies and more heavy weapons available, but also thanks to good storytelling and use of the loud, epic music this game has.There are good mods to fix common graphical issues/crashes and allow higher resolutions (I played it in 4K).Unfortunately it ends on a cliffhanger as it sets up for a sequel that never came.But yay, Wookie life-debts for everybody!

												Star Wars: Republic CommandoThis is a Star Wars FPS that puts you in control of a squad of elite clones, better known as Delta Squad. Your squad members have different personalities. Funny, reckless, and serious. You have to complete campaigns, which can take quite a long time to complete. Your squad members have different abilities, one's good at explosives, one's good at computers, and one's good at sniping. You can assign them to do things. The shooting is like CoD, but the graphics are a bit outdated. I'd recommend this game, it's a good Star Wars FPS  game - possibly one of the best made. 9.5/10			",32,8,0,2,3,0,7

												I have played so much of this game, it's fantastic. Like most Star Wars games it doesn't fail to please, not even nowadays the time it was built and released doesn't effect anything. I really felt something with the chracters I played with, it felt like I had a responsability to keep my team alive and making sure they're all ok. It's something different and i would higly recommend. It's got wookies in it. get it. Oh wait one more thing. This game screams, like just crazy loud in your face, 'co-operative'. They have multiplayer but no co-op :( only downfall. And no, theres only one mod that kinda works only on a few levels. Fav Star Wars game though :pThis would also be the greatest game ever to be remastered.			",93,24,0,9,2,0,2

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played.When I first played this game I didn't even like Star Wars that much,but this game made me a fan.I get goosebumps only when I hear the game's soundtrack.Gameplay-wise,the game is absolutely beautifully designed.It plays out like a regular shooter game,the guns feel good and you have a decent variety of weapons and enemies.What makes the game stand out,is the tactical element of it.You give orders to your fellow Delta Squad commandos during battle.Knowing where,when and how to control them can make the game easier or harder.Going through the campaign,I never got bored because the game offers enough variety.The storyline is the icing on the cake.It keeps you engaged and makes you love the characters and the universe that they are in.The personalities in the game are fun,interesting and exciting.Even the soundtrack is one of the best in any game that I played.In the end I'd like to express my regrets that we still don't have a sequel for the game...EA please...Sev,hang in there!

												Damn. I remeber when I was a kid and played this game on my crappy Dell 2000 computer. After finding it on Steam and playing it again its still as fun as when I was little. This type of Star Wars game is Rare. You're put in charge of Delta Squad an elite version on the clones (basically the Seal Team 6 of star wars) You are in charge of this squad. Tactics and fast thinking are  key. This game will bring you through many filled fire-fights and even some scary solo missions (Ghost ship scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me when I was 7) This game brings you to 3 awesome Locations and you will mostly get you immersed in their atmosphere.

												Star Wars Republic Commando (or as I like to call it also, Band of Clone Bros) is the forgotten and underrated Star Wars video game that everybody that loves the Star Wars franchise should play. The story of the game is based on the 2nd and 3rd movies of the prequel trilogy, where you play as the leader of a Spec Ops squad of 4 Clones of the Galactic Republic who are responsible for performing special missions that occure behind the scenes of the Clone Wars. This is a squad based game, where using your squad team seriously will be your road for victory. The fact that you play as a Clone, fighting along aside with a team of other Clones, breaks the monotony of the usual protagonists of a story of a Star Wars game, which tend to be Jedis, Siths or some random bounty hunter.I agree, like the vast majority of people who played it, that this is a good game - but not a perfect one. It has one problem that I felt frustrated about: while the enemy was agressive against you, your squad team will be very weak and will lack agressivness, unless you babysit them all the time. Sometimes, they will just get close to an enemy and try killing them by melee (it reminds me of the Warscape Engine BS that is now plaguing the Total War series...), instead of trying to get to cover by their own initiative. Another problem  that I have with the game is the lack of variety with the level designs: the game is divided only by 3 chapters, which are limited equally to 3 areas (first you fight in one planet, then inside a ship, and then again in another planet). A little bit of more effort from the producers of this videogame could have created more variety for you to be present in another scenarios/planets of the Clone Wars. But I believe this problem to be minor, when you compare to the much more positive aspects of the game.Still, I cannot recommend you buy it at full price (except if your are a Star Wars nerd :P), since it is an old game and it no longer has an active multiplayermode. Buy it only when it´s in promotion.Like many people claim, this game really needs a sequel - where you play as the same squad team, now part of the forces of the eeeeeeeevil Galactic Empire. It would have been a much better sequel to make instead of the disaster that was Star Wars ""BattleFront"" EA (THE GAME IS NOT WORTH OF DESERVING OF ""BATTELFRONT"" ON IT´S TITLE!!!). Unfortunatelly, this game appears to have been forgotten and I don´t think a sequel (or a reboot) will ever be created.7.5 out of 10 ",58,7,0,4,5,0,7

												Quite possibly the best Star Wars licenced game out there in my opinion. I have fond memories of playing this when I was 7 or 8 years old back in the day, and the game has not aged AT ALL. Smart squad commands, challenging enemies, a wide and interesting array of weapons and some of the best voicework in a game I have seen. Its not just a great star wars game, but its a great shooter as well. Highly RecommendedPros-Intuitive and innovative squad commands-Interesting weapons, like the Trandoshan projectile weapons and the DC15 system-Great AI, both enemy and teammates-Brutal difficulty even on normal-Wide array of enemy types, and you even get to see characters such as Yoda and General Grevious!Cons-Pretty short, clocked in about 6 hours-Buggy in some sections'-NO SEQUEL			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this game, you are playing as the leader of a special clone commando, you won't see a jedi a single time. Reasoning behind that is to see the military side of the clone wars, not just the ""OP Jedi destroys everyone without any losses"" one. You have to be tactical, giving commands to your 3 fellow clones, to have all of them survive through the story. The basic idea is fascinating, although I don't believe it to have been done completely right. Whilst you certainly aren't overpowered against the enemy, I don't really see how this game is portraying the bad side of war, as clones are still beeing shown as the good ones, while their enemies are the bad guys, and you won't ever build up any feelings for any of the characters out there.However, the gameplay feels solid, and the tactical part of the game was enjoyable as well.The graphics are OK to play now-a-days, while some textures, like the ones of your three clone companions, have very high resolutions, other parts, for example the skyboxes, often highly lack in quality.If it is on sale for less than 5€ /5$, I would recommend you buying it specially as a Star Wars fan.2005 this would've probably easily gotten 9/10 points, 2016 I would rather give it a solid 7/10.

												If any game in the Star Wars universe needs a sequel it is this game. As short and repetive as this game can get Republic Commando at least gave you exactly what you expected without any fluff or bullcrap. The game isn't perfect but it was the best at what it needed to do at the time. I dont care who or what i have to do in this world to get another of this game, but the idea of a strategic team of clones running around behind the scenes of war and doing things that you havent heard of for good reason is a brilliant way to add to the Star Wars universe without ever having to break Cannon or mold to the story. They can be anywhere doing anything and the story will always make sense as long as they dont fight or kill important characters to the rest of the universe. I love it.			",80,5,2,6,5,0,7

												If any game in the Star Wars universe needs a sequel it is this game. As short and repetive as this game can get Republic Commando at least gave you exactly what you expected without any fluff or bullcrap. The game isn't perfect but it was the best at what it needed to do at the time. I dont care who or what i have to do in this world to get another of this game, but the idea of a strategic team of clones running around behind the scenes of war and doing things that you havent heard of for good reason is a brilliant way to add to the Star Wars universe without ever having to break Cannon or mold to the story. They can be anywhere doing anything and the story will always make sense as long as they dont fight or kill important characters to the rest of the universe. I love it.			",80,5,2,6,5,0,7

												Star Wars Republic Commando, Knights of the Old Republic, and Battlefront 1 are considered the Holy Trinity of Star Wars games.  You can put Rogue Squadron in there as well, but these three are always the ones everyone always talks about.  Republic Commando is an FPS set during the period of the Clone Wars where you command an elite clone unit called Delta Squad.  As you travel throughout the galaxy and undergo missions you will be faced with very difficult challenges, very immersive gameplay, and a cast of characters you will never forget.  This is a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game.  It's hard, it's fun, and it leaves you begging for more.  I remember this game came out during the time of Halo 1 and after playing both I thought Republic Commando just kicked way much more♥♥♥♥♥  This is a game you must play if you're a Star Wars fan or an FPS fan.  You will be hooked right as soon as you give your squad that first ""BREACH THAT DOOR"" command.I'm giving this game a strong 9.5/10.			",51,8,0,12,10,0,7

												One of the best Star Wars games I've ever played! Every aspect of this game feels really polished, creative, and researched (well, as much as you can for a sci-fi setting). It all comes together with the gameplay to make a really immersive and surprisingly original (since it's not just re-hashing something straight out of the movies) experience.First of all, the gameplay. After my first session of this game, I actually had a lot of complaints. The enemies feel like bullet sponges - often times taking entire clips just to down one. My squadmates stand out in the open in view of a strong enemy and stupidly march to their deaths without taking cover into consideration. The reticle for the main rifle is really wide and it doesn't feel ""precise"" like I would imagine a laser weapon would feel. Even when I have an enemy in the crosshairs a lot of shots go wide. However, after my second session these complaints disappeared as I got familiarity with the gameplay. You learn the importance of grenades for taking out the high-health enemies, the importance of ordering your troops around to specific ""maneuvers"", how to hit targets with all the different weapons, and how it doesn't matter that much if your squad does dumb stuff because you can still win encounters on your own. You start to understand the tactical tradeoffs of the different maneuvers and weapons. So, if you find yourself frustrated or a bit annoyed your first time playing, give it a rest for the day and come back tomorrow.You might notice the squad-based tactics and orders system. If you've played other games like that, you might be dreading having to deal with it, but I think that it's done very well in this game. It's really simple, and they do a great job of helping you keep track of what your squad is doing. There's a lot of subtle ways they achieve this and I won't describe them all. You won't really have to micro manage what everybody is doing using all sorts of different keys - you usually just press F2 so they follow you around, and then point at things in the environment and press ""f"" to tell a squad mate to perform a specific maneuver. Because it's implemented this way, it's pretty seamless as you switch between shooting and commanding your squad. Even if you go down, your squad can sometimes manage on their own and come revive you.Anyway, it's hard to be frustrated with this game because of the great quick save and quick load system. It's really fast and makes it so you never have to worry about replaying a section over and over. If you do find yourself at a  spot where you keep failing, there's usually a ""trick"" to the encounter to overcome that spot, accomplished by intelligently using the weapons and maneuvers available to you. It's a nice way to design a game like this - a lot of the encounters are kind of like puzzles, in a way.And all that is just about the gameplay. One of the best things about this game is the detail and the immersion it achieves. I highly recommend going into the sound settings and making sure you max them out if you can, and making sure to play with headphones with the volume high enough. There's all sorts of details in all the little sounds, the writing, the UI elements, the dialogue and one-off things the characters say that manages to not get too repetitive, and lots more that needs to be experienced to be understood.If you like Star Wars games, this is one of the best. Even without that, the game is a fun, squad-based sci-fi shooter. It's actually similar to Halo in a lot of ways, so if you like that game I bet you'd enjoy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, I love this game. I remember playing it when it was on the X-box, and was is great to play it again.It's a squad based action shooter, with rather intelligent AI companions (Although they can't use any weapons other than the main gun unless in special cover). You play through the game taking place during the Clone wars as a elite squad sent on special missions, and in my opinion it really nails that atmosphere of taking on the impossible odds, as your sent against increasingly difficult hoards of enemies. Keep it mind, it isn't an RPG, there are no real choices or decisions to be made, and there is no multiplayer scene, giving it unfortunately very little replayability other than for enjoyment. It is a fun game however, and offers some of what I feel is the best squad gameplay and teamwork mechanics even compared to newer games today. Worth picking up if you just want to shoot some baddies and lead a commando team.			",33,15,0,11,6,1,7

This type of Star Wars game is Rare. You're put in charge of Delta Squad an elite version on the clones (basically the Seal Team 6 of star wars) You are in charge of this squad. Tactics and fast thinking are  key. This game will bring you through many filled fire-fights and even some scary solo missions (Ghost ship scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me when I was 7) This game brings you to 3 awesome Locations and you will mostly get you immersed in their atmosphere.

												So I first played this game way back on the original XBOX like some odd 8/9 years ago. I was (math is hard) 9 or 10 then, and I thought the game was cool, but it wasn't ground breaking or life fulfilling. So I played it, beat it, and really didn't think about it too much.Time passed and now I'm 18. I saw this was on sale and I said to myself, ""Hey, I totally remember this game from way back when! I've got some spare pre-Christmas dough, so lets give it a go!"" Best 3 bucks I've spent in a while.  PRO   Obviously, amazing price tag. 3 bucks is basically less than a half hour's work at minimum wage.  Solid core gameplay mechanics. The A.I. is reaaaaly good for this time of development, and squad commands and actions are smooth and natural.  Atmospheric environments. Cliche, I know, but this game hits it home on the atmosphere. As a commando, you really get a Halo ODST feel to your character (really bada** but not Master Chief-invincible) (BTW I'm not comparing ODST to this game bc I know a lot of people feel strongly about the game but w/e ok back to main points). For example, on a specific mission you go onto a derelict, abandoned Republic destroyer to investigate why it went missing. As you enter the ship, you get overwhelmed with just how big the ship is. Your squad splits up to cover as much ground as possible, so you go alone into your section of the ship. It's got a nice Death Troopers feel to it (GREAT BOOK BTW).  AMAZING CHARACTERIZATION. So this one is really important to me. I feel like lately I have played waaaaayyy too many games that just throw in characters somewhat relevant to the storyline without actually giving half a crap about establishing who they are, where they come from and how they act. Sev, Fixer, and Scorch (your squadmates) all come from the same clone production facility and program, but they have DISTINCTLY different and memorable personalities. Sev is your deep voiced, hunt-loving, bada** sniper. Fixer is your narcissistic and protocol following technician. Scorch is your curious, optomistic, reckless explosive specialist. Seriously good work put in here. Oh yeah and they don't just tell you who they are at the beginning of the game and then treat them as generic clone troopers the rest. Their character traits and facets stick with you throughout. Streamlined HUD and squad commands. They put in basic controls for your squad (Attack formation, defensive formation, defend area, regroup) that just about anyone with a cheese brain can conquer. They also designated certain cover positions to be used for lobbing grenades, sniping, or AT weaponry, which is a nice touch and a boon to locking down an area. Also, your hud is like actually looking through a trooper's helmet. So that's +1 for atmosphere again.Diverse yet comprehensive inventory. Your sniper rifle, rocket launcher, and machine gun are all variants of your blaster rifle; it creates a professional feel about your loadout. You also have your handy-dandy blaster pistol, which is a good backup. Lastly, you're kitted with 3 different grenades (Thermal detonator, flashbang, and anti-mech EMPs. You can also pick up alien grenades too.). Added on to your traditional inventory, you can pick up elite weapons from dead enemies if they drop them. The hardest enemies to kill drop the best weapons to use. Dope.There's more I could touch on, but those are the basics. Cons would be a slight lack of content and game-time, lack of multiplayer/other gamemode, and sometimes buggy AI but I'm forgiving on that. All in all a great game. I can appreciate the theatrics and core mechanics of the game now more than I could back then, and by heavens I hope that someone someday comes out with a worthwhile sequel to this. If you're a fan of Star Wars, I would ABSOLUTELY reccomend this. The storyline covers some aspects the movies don't, and the ending is very satisfying to the total storyline of SW. If you're not a huge fan, I still reccomend. This game can be really difficult at times, but it's still a worthwhile FP shooter that should be tried out. If you absolutlely hate it, it's still only just 3 bucks (at least right now). 9.5/10 ayy lmao			",108,6,1,7,9,3,17

												I remember when this game first came out and my dad purchased it on the original xbox. back then, I thought the game looked cool just because it was starwars. well fastfoward roughly 11 years into the future and during that timeframe, I had sadly forgotten about this gem. You see my console was a sony playstation 2 and this game was an xbox excusive when it came to home consoles. Well I caught a steam sale for the starwars collection and decided to purchase it because it had both 2 kotor games and battlefront 2. One day when I was scrolling through my library to find something to play, my mouse had landed on republic commando... The moment that main menu music started playing was like a flash of nostalgia. The memories of the cool starwars game were back but this time I was the one experiencing it firsthand.Few things about the game.The ai is fantastic, from having them man turrets to heal eachother and yourself (you'll need it) I found the ai to be some of the best i have ever experienced.Although this game is over a decade old, I still think it has some pretty fantastic graphics that definitly aged well (specially with settings maxed)The soundtrack is just amazing... that purfect pix of classic starwars tracks with remixes and new tracks made specifically for the game. no moment was ever a dull one.The difficulty is indeed harder then most other shooters (specially starwars ones). Dont go into this with a battlefront mindset at all or you will have a hard time.personally, I would drop current steam price on this game BUT if you find it on a sale, you owe it to yourself to add it to your library if you like starwars or good fps games.

												This game feels like it should have been made in the 90s, when memorable characters and good stories came to games without question.It's an FPS where you lead a squad of clone soldiers - all who manage to have a distinct and enjoyable personality - as you tear around behind the curtains of the Star Wars universe.  You won't jumping from any rooftops in flashy lightsaber fights, but your crack team of mighty mortals finds their own way to be awesome.Squad controls are simple, too.  It reminds me of a more involved Mass Effect.  You can give general orders like fall back or take cover, but all throughout the level are little hot spots that a squade mate (or yourself) can take advantage of.  Lot of enemies in a room?  Get someone on the turret.  Just make sure you cover him on the way over there so he doesn't get shot (or you do it, and have your guys cover you).It's a surprisingly great game with a fun concept, delightful characters, and solid mechanics.  It's aged, but not so much that it's not worth $20.			",312,56,0,39,13,2,39

												This is truly an amazing game. Take a step into the life of a clone commando, where you are responsible for the lives of your squad mates. This is one of the greatest Star Wars games of all time! Immerse yourself into the awe inspiring Star Wars World to command a clone squad, as their leader you must be responsible for their strategic actions and welfare. With the use of in-game techniques based on real Special Ops techniques, set up your squad in the best way possible to take down the CIS! In this expansion of the Star Wars universe, wield new, unique weaponry designed to fit the aliens that conceived them! This game is one of my all-time top favorites and I rate it at 10 out of 10! I have never come across such a distinctive game as this, both in story and gameplay! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategic gameplay, first person shooters, Star Wars, or well written story lines! ""Enemy eliminated, proceeding to next sector!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish there was a star rating for steam, because while Republic Commando is a good game, it has a lot of problems. Its singleplayer campaign is just too short, bordering the length of the original portal, and the finish is anticlimactic. You just start to connect with your AI squadmates when the campagin ends, and its kind of frustrating that they couldn't have added on another mission or two. On the positive side its a fun game with a lot of strategy and a decent enough plot, but I'd wait until it goes on sale before buying it. I also really enjoyed the mechanics for working with your AI squad mates, and I wish more FPSes did AI interaction as well as this title. All in all a good game, but with dated graphics and thats just too short.			",53,3,0,2,11,0,7

The first battle makes you see the Clone Wars from a diffrent perspective then we all thought was possible. I hope some day people will look back at this game and consider it a legend as i have. My final verdict for this game is a 10/10 and a must have in your game library. Pros: Clone Wars, Kick♥♥♥♥♥Clone Commandos, And one of the best action features a Star Wars game has ever had. Cons: None This game  is the Father of every other Clone Wars game...Even Battlefront series. I would deffinantly recomend this game to anyone who loves starwars and the Clone Wars in general.

												10 years ago, when this game originally was released, I got this game but the thing is... I never finished it. Why I don't know, can't really remember. Because of that, I was really happy to see ""Republic Commando"" as part of the 'Star Wars Humble Bundle' - I could finish what I started so long ago.Was it worth it? Both yes and no - mostly yes. The game is very simple in comparison of what we've got today, but it's still Star Wars and it has got some fun action throughout the game. It's a tactical first person shooter where the player is the commando of the Delta Squad and you have the ability to give the other three soldiers commands - ""Attack that enemy"", ""Snipe from that position"" and similar things.As I stated before, it got some good shooting but was pretty linear and monotone - the environments are pretty same-looking and the enemies are pretty much the same ones everywhere. I know, there's not much variety in the Star Wars movies either, but still... they could be somewhat creative.If you get a chance of getting this on the cheap, I'd say ""go for it""! Also, if you're a big Star Wars fan... go for it!			",488,140,8,67,38,6,70

												If you love Star Wars, and you love a First Person Shooters, with an Awesome Storyline then this game is for you.I fell in love with this game when it was released back in 2005, and still 10 years later I still jump on and play some Republic Commando. This game is still an awesome game, and I Highly recommend it. Its  a squad based FPS,but what I love is that each of your squad mates has there own personallity and great Dialogue. Set in the Clone wars, you are taking up the role of a Clone Commando, its a different look at the Star wars Universe, through the eyes of a soldier, instead of a Jedi, which is what makes this game interesting This game never gets old, and is, in my opinion one of the best Star wars games out there, along with the Star Wars Battlefront II.There is however no more Multiplayer which is a bit of a shame, but still this game is worth buying for just the singleplayer alone, although the storyline isnt long, it still got that great Star wars feel to it, and you will be begging for more. There are an array of weapons, which is what you should expect from an FPS, weapons range from ones that the Commandos use, and then there are ones you can pick up from different cultures, from all you enemies.So even though this game is 10 years old if you are still considering buying it don't think twice, you wont regret it.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing, It's has maybe textures of a game from 2005, but who cares.You play as a Clone Commander in the republic war and you have a squad of 3 other people.You don't simply walk around and shoot alien's and people, Like the: Follow-The-Objective and that's it like you would in MW2-3 or anything. but this make's you the bos of your squad, you can command them to go cover you/blow thing's up/hack consoles/snipe people down/stand clear/to follow you or to stay and more.and if you dislike commanding you squad to do it, you can also do it yourself.this game has basically a great story, somewhat funny dialoges, good gameplay, and amazing location's to go for mission, maybe it doesn't has a viarity of diffrent location's, but every map is a tough challange that you will enjoy playing.i played this game when i was a child, and even now i'm playing it. i reccomend this to every star war's lover or even if you just started liking Star Wars a bit.The sad part is this game is not so popular, but this game is damned amazing.1000/10Would keep this game for the rest of my life.

												One of my favorite Star Wars games and favorite First Person Shooters in general, an excellent example of what the universe of the prequel trilogy can be when placed in the right hands.  The campaign mission doesn't exactly tell a compelling story (its 3 narrative arcs broken into smaller missions) and the gameplay can be repetitive, but the whole experience is solid thanks to the squad based combat.  It really feels like you have control over your squad, each combat situation ends up feeling like a puzzle you need to carefully strategize with team placement to solve.  I've beaten this 3 times since the original came out on the Xbox and I will probably play through again at some point, highly recommended, even if it isn't perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Released in March 22, 2005 this first person Star Wars game is probably the best thing about the prequel films. In this game you are 1 of many clones being trained to be Commando's of the Republic on Kamino. Basically the Republic Commandos are the Navy Seals of the Star wars universe. The game takes place during Episode 2: The Clone Wars and is supposed to bridge the gap between Ep2 and Ep3. I always found this game awesome because of the perspective. What I mean by that is that most star wars games always focus on the Jedi or you are this master sith lord or something that gives you an advantage over the others. While in this game it gives you a soldiers perspective of the Clone Wars, which was greatly overlooked during the films. You play as the leader of Delta Squad; a 4 man expertly trained group each with special abilities and skill sets. Sev is the Sniper, Fixer is the hacker, Scorch is the demolitions expert and you... well you are simply the Boss. Although the game emphasizes that each has special ability sets, anyone of your group can do the task you tell them todo. The game is one of the first games that I know of that puts you in control of AI. For example if you see a vantage point you can call out one of the commandos to snipe over there, or if you notice one member is low on health you may send them off to heal. This mechanic brings a variety of ways to play the game but also makes you actually feel like the leader of this squad. Each of the characters in my opinion each have their own personality that doesnt make them dull or boring and makes you want to care for them. The game starts you off on an assassination mission on Geonosis but then leads to other planets like Kashyyyk and broken down space carriers. I personally loved the campaign because you are only a soldier so alot of the time you are just as curious of the mission as they are. The game has great combat with a variety of weapons and a fair difficulty level that you can change at any time. The grittiness that this game brings to the star wars universe is awesome and is defiantly  a must play for any Star Wars fan that can find a original Xbox copy or buys it for $10 off Steam.OVERALL:This game is a great first person shooter that takes place in the star wars universe and should be played by anyone who enjoys that. Also the game has team deathmatch multiplayer so if you are into that sort of thing you should play now before the servers shut down!9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First thing I can say about this game is that it is kinda hard playing it if you're used to call of duty or any other games that are like it because here your character is the leader of delta squad and you have to order your squad to tactical positions in order to eliminate the enemy. Although the AI is good ordering them to tactical positions makes killing the opponents easier. Other than that the game is awesome and the story line is great. THIS GAME ISN'T LIKE OTHER STAR WARS GAMES WHERE YOU'RE A JEDI OR CAN BE A JEDI. YOU'RE A CLONE COMMANDO NO FORCE POWERS OR LIGHT SABERS JUST GUNS GRENADES AND TACTICS. The graphics of this game is not that bad even though it was released a decade ago. I'd recommend this game for gamers who play FPS who want a bit more challenge and Star Wars fans.

												One of my favorite Star Wars games and favorite First Person Shooters in general, an excellent example of what the universe of the prequel trilogy can be when placed in the right hands.  The campaign mission doesn't exactly tell a compelling story (its 3 narrative arcs broken into smaller missions) and the gameplay can be repetitive, but the whole experience is solid thanks to the squad based combat.  It really feels like you have control over your squad, each combat situation ends up feeling like a puzzle you need to carefully strategize with team placement to solve.  I've beaten this 3 times since the original came out on the Xbox and I will probably play through again at some point, highly recommended, even if it isn't perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR: I love this game above all others, and when you're done with it several times, I'm confident you will too.Again, not really good at writing reviews. I will however state that I absolutely love this game.Don't let the few hours clocked on Steam fool you. I only bought it on Steam because it's more convenient than using 2 very worn CDs.I've played the campaign at least a dozen times over the years. Sadly, the campaign is short, but in no way does the campaign length negatively impact the absolute quality of this game.Best squad-shooter I've ever played. Excellent voice acting. Squadmate lines are witty and charming, and the squad is extremely affable. There is no way you will not like all of them, though it is very likely that you'll have a favourite. Mine is Scorch :)And you will experience true loneliness when you and your squad split up on several occasions to achieve independent objectives.Again, I love this game above all others and I would recommend this game to anyone, anyday and everyday, Star Wars fan or otherwise.If you value exellent gameplay, simple yet elegant squad mechanics, amazing voice acting, witty one-liners, affable teammates, dark and immersive atmosphere, brilliant music and everything else that makes an excellent game excellent, you would be severely amiss to let this game go unplayed. And when you're done with it, play it again. And again.One play through hardly does the game justice as it impossible to get take notice of all the gems it offers with just one play through.Infinity/10.""Clone Advisor: Delta Squad, clear that promenade!Scorch: Promenade, sir?Fixer: Shut it, Six-Two.""

												Very fun game. Dated enemy AI by 2015 standards, but the positives more than make up for it. The squad personality was in tune with the game's premise and along with the music and sound effects in general all added up into a great feeling for a Star Wars game.

I remember playing this when it first came out on the original xbox, i've played the campaign so many times and enjoyed every bit. I'm just happy i seen it's on PC so i could go back and enjoy every bit once again. If you have a chance to buy it i highly suggest it, it's worth every cent.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like Star Wars?Do you like squad based shooters?Do you like being challenged when it counts?Do you like epic battles, soundtracks, and intense moments?Do you like games that don't make you fail when you alone die, but your AI team is still up?Do you like working with a team that actually seems to have a brain?Are you tired of yelling at online players because they don't follow your orders?Are you REALLY into good Star Wars games?If the answer's yes, then I'd recommend this game.

												Games a classic in my books and one of my favorite games from the past that still holds up quite well. There are still some bugs where your teamate may fall of an edge of the world which can be a issue but will respawn after a checkpoint. I remember playing this game back on the original Xbox and it's just like I remember it. The controls are pretty smooth, no mouse issues, no screen tearing, and no game breaking bugs. ModDB has texture, mouse and ingame bug fixes which helps improve the experience as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's set in the prequel era, so that part sucks. Story is pretty much prequel stuff that noone cares about. Unless you're up against bullet sponge mechs without any sniper ammo, the campaign moves along pretty quickly. Five or six hours. Ten dollars is worth it. I paid sixty when it first came out and loved it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a First Person Shooter with a tactical twist, to control your squad! Not only does it deliver a solid and outstanding narrative, but it also proves that you can get a connection with characters through numbers. No pre-rendered cutscences needed!Shooting: The game can be tough, it really can. It is in no means easy and the guns have the right amount of star-wars and unique twist. There isn't the biggest array of weapons, and i often found myself sticking with the default commando weapon(s). Oddly enough, these space weapons also have a tiny bit of a recoil. No idea how that works, i just know that i enjoy shooting them.Controlling your squad: It's smooth, yes, but sometimes it doesn't really work because of the odd AI, your squadmates aren't always intelligent and they're often very slow. Luckily, it can be very useful to know where to put them, and once you've put them there, they'll stay there.(Unless you go down and they have to save you.). Overall, it needs a bit more depth, but it works a lot better than most games these days.Your squad: Delta are absolutely the coolest looking clone-commandos in the galaxy! They are familiar with each other and have some rather cool and talketive interactions. People like 07(Sev) is the badass sniper who's not very talketive with a gruff voice and well, a few twists. I don't remember the other characters that much, but that's because i haven't played the game in a while. The AI however isn't that well-developed and often clunky.Conclusion: Despite the lack of multiplayer (RIP gamespy), the weird AI and the short length of singleplayer. I encourage anyone to drop those 10 Euro's on this game. Because it really is worth it. Not only will you remember the game as something that ABSOLUTELY needs a sequel, but also one that needs to be more noticed. In short: The game is great. Seriously, if you haven't bought this game yet, i encourage you to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. I've been playing this game for many years now. Been trying to finish campaign for many years. Never got past Geonosis. There is a legit rumor that EA will have a 3 minute trailer to the sequal Imperial Commanods this year at E3. The game will be realesed in November 2017. This game will always be one of my favorite games to play. Pros:Everything. Cons: Nothing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This my friends ... This is a game. *note* I have played this game no doubt 500hrs off steam.  There's so much action, drama, and story. Let's see what we got! Gameplay - This game runs extremely well, given that I kept my old pc machine with windows xp lol. The gun fights are super fun and the melee isn't hard at all. Moving around is easy, and i've had no issues with it, hasn't crashed at all.Graphics - Back in the day ( dang i'm getting old ) this was amazing to gaming standards. The realistic blood and gore, bodies jiggled around if you shot them, etc. To todays standards it's not graphically "" amazing "" but it looks a lot better than some games that came out 5yrs after it. Other - The story is pretty interesting. You're a squad of elite commando's trained and bred to be a one man army. You have Scorch (Delta 62) The classic goof off and jokster that loves blowing stuff up. He's made me chuckle more than once and keeps the squad in good spirits. Fixer (Delta 40) is the brains of the team, he can hack anything and is a loyal soldier that follows orders perfectly, and does everything by the book. Sev (Delta 07) well ... Sev is Sev. Tick him off and he will kill you. Seriously, he will. He's the hot headed one that's just misunderstood, and will do anything for his brothers. He's a weapons expert and loves to kill anything that stands in the squads way. The squad AI is just perfect. I look at other stupid AI's in games, and think to myself, "" Why can't all AI be as good as my squad?! "" They follow your orders perfectly, warn you of enemies, and if you die they will fight tooth and nail to revive you. You really bond with your family. Yes, family. These are your brothers, and you feel close to them ... This story will make you laugh, grit your teeth, and cry. I wholly recommend this game. They just don't make 'em like this anymore ... EA is making Star Wars Imperial Commando 2 - DON'T screw it up EA. Or i'll have your heads on a plate. 10/10 easily.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as I've been able to play it, brilliant game!This game seems to be a lot better than I would've ever expected. It's great for Star Wars fans especially those whom love the Clone Wars. It's extremely fun to actually be commanding a squad rather than being the ""newest recruit"" in the squad. You're all brought up the same way and you all became part of a team together which really puts the equality between your team. The great thing about this is rather than viewing them by their rank, despite that they're all pretty much the same in this game anyway, you can view them by what they're specialized in.Another great thing about this game is that your character can actually talk! YES! You read this correctly! Unlike almost EVERY other FPS, your character can talk! And he talks as much as the rest of the squad which can lead to some really interesting conversations between the squad.However, as with every other game, there are some flaws. This game can be INCREDIBLY difficult which really puts people like me off of playing it. Because who wants to play the same mission 100 times just to move to the next, even harder, section of the mission. If you're someone who hates having to search up walkthroughs, good luck trying to complete this without going to YouTube. Another flaw that links in with this, normally games use hints for you to find out how to get around a certain enemy in this game. As much as I've focused on the surroundings, enemies AND dialogue, I haven't noticed any hints since Geonosis.To sum up, for someone who hates a lot of FPS games I really enjoy this and I will continue to play it... When I can be bothered to look up the walkthrough for the mission on the Acclamator-class Assualt ship.I rate this game:7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like first person shooters and Star Wars, then you will enjoy this game. Simple but intuitive squad commands add depth to the FPS gameplay. The campaign mode doesn't take very long to finish, but it's fun and the commandos are well done characters. Each of them has personality and adds to the squad in a meaningful way. The game does have a multiplayer aspect, but I don't know much about it because I've never played it. Some technical notes; this game runs well on medium to high settings with integrated graphics. I'm running it on an Acer Aspire XC- 603G (a cheap Walmart PC given to me by a family member) and haven't had any issues on medium settings. I played this on the original Xbox back in 2006 and it's a better experience even on a low-end PC. 10/10 did purchase again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is one outstanding game mechanic in SWRC, and that is that you can never really die. When you ""die"" you are really just incapacitated. And when you do, you have the ability to force the AI to come heal you or to make them follow current orders (btw, the menu looks awesome here).Republic Commando has another amazing game mechanic, and that is to be an utterly INANE, EXTREMELY GENERIC FIRST PERSON SHOOTER. There is absolutely nothing else in this game that makes RC stand out against other games. It's like the developers just gave up after making it Rainbow Six or any Tom Clancy game.That's not to say it's a terrible game...well..actually, come to think of it, it is pretty bad. The levels can be rather confusing and full of tedious objectives and enemies (many of which [I'm looking at you Super Battle Droid] have obscene amounts of health and take forever to die).See rest of review here: http://gamespotting.net/gameblog/review-star-wars-republic-commando/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game on release and for years since I've always wanted to go back and play it again, but I could never remember why until I bought it again. Despite having to jump through numerous hoops in order to get it optimised for a modern operating system, Republic Commando is a surprisingly wonderful game given that it is, in many ways, a rather standard corridor shooter.Whilst genre-wise it may play as a rather standard FPS shooter, the writing of the characters and the missions gives a much greater depth to the world than it otherwise ought to have. You play the commander of a crack team of Republic commandos, and your teammates all have distinct and consistent personalities, and are autonomous enough to make them seem genuinely intelligent. Yes, you will be giving orders for the most part - and their AI is programmed well enough so as to feel like they're an extension of yourself, as they should - but you won't need to tell them to heal themselves, or attack the bad guys if a threat looms, and should you be overcome and you need help, they will be promptly at your side healing you at the risk of their own lives. And this all helps to develop a genuine bond with your fellow squadmates, particularly as the game is much easier when you have their help, further emphasising the importance of your cumulative strength as a team. On top of this, the missions, whilst comprising of many parts, manage to consistently escalate the stakes until by the end of the mission you feel a genuine and frantic rush of adrenaline as you plunge headlong into the final stages of each operation. And it's the little things that make a difference - for example, whereas most games would have an alert announcement indicating that your vessel will self-destruct, in this case they're serious. And it's these little things that actually make you emote as a player, which is what any experience should do, whether it's a book or a movie or a video game.  And thus, Republic Commando manages to rise above it's state and hold up quite well as a challenging and compelling experience. I'd recommend it to Star Wars fans primarily, although I think it has a wider appeal because of the quality of the writing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a really fun game. It provides an awesome experience in the Star Wars universe. It is also hard as nails. It feels like quite a challenge, which makes it seem like a much more realistic outlook on the Clone Wars. I definitely reccomend it, and if you get stuck, you can press the '@' key which opens the console, and type in 'TheMatulaakLives' (This puts you in god mode.) My one wish would be that it was possible to play the campaign co-op.But yeah, it's great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Scavenger Drones"" (roughly translated to ""holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥why do I keep dying"") are hostile, and deadly, enemies encountered. They are about the size of a toaster, and hover 3 meters above the ground using AntGrav Hover™ technology. Upon seeing a Republic Commando, they will fire a constant beam at them. This beam has a 100% chance of hitting the commando, sometimes even if they are behind a wall. Once this beam is fired, the Commando has approximately 1.3 seconds to destroy the drone, or they will be killed. This is no easy task however, as the drones are small, fly incredibly fast, and have a 75% chance to dodge bullets. Also, they like to hunt in numbers, usually seeing about 3 or 4 of them in a pack. Why the man who designed these drones meant to siphon resources out of disabled ships thought it would be a good idea to make them kill people, I have no idea.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes, you will be giving orders for the most part - and their AI is programmed well enough so as to feel like they're an extension of yourself, as they should - but you won't need to tell them to heal themselves, or attack the bad guys if a threat looms, and should you be overcome and you need help, they will be promptly at your side healing you at the risk of their own lives. And this all helps to develop a genuine bond with your fellow squadmates, particularly as the game is much easier when you have their help, further emphasising the importance of your cumulative strength as a team. On top of this, the missions, whilst comprising of many parts, manage to consistently escalate the stakes until by the end of the mission you feel a genuine and frantic rush of adrenaline as you plunge headlong into the final stages of each operation. And it's the little things that make a difference - for example, whereas most games would have an alert announcement indicating that your vessel will self-destruct, in this case they're serious. And it's these little things that actually make you emote as a player, which is what any experience should do, whether it's a book or a movie or a video game.  And thus, Republic Commando manages to rise above it's state and hold up quite well as a challenging and compelling experience. I'd recommend it to Star Wars fans primarily, although I think it has a wider appeal because of the quality of the writing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best FPS games i have ever played, and dont let the pictures fool you, the game has been updated but the store page has not. if this isnt the best FPS game ive ever played, then it is definetly the best single player fps game i have ever played; amazing story, amazing gameplay, and missions that are difficult enough that you dont beat it the first time for every single one. the only downside to this game is that like most other star wars games, the multiplayer was removed, and because of that i give it an 8/10. also, i took a look at all of the negative reviews, and all of them are either a) negative because the game crashes if you change the resolution; this was fixed in a recent update. b) negative because of other gameplay and lighting issues; these have either been fixed or the person just didn't have a good enough computer. c) because the mouse sensetivity on the startup screen is insanley high. this one i actually agree with, but its really not a good reason to give the game a bad review.

												Very easily one of my favorite shooters. It has a pretty good story (honestly, most star wars games should, the universe is set up to tell stories), easy controls (watch the mouse sensitivity), and wonderful gameplay. You will die, you will be frustrated, but you won't give up on it. The sound in this game is absolutely incredible (the geonosians' weapon sounds really interesting). Enemies are pretty balanced, most of the game I went around with a pistol throwing grenades, but I used A LOT of cover. Good luck, and cry because Sev. Good god, they need to make a game about rescuing Sev. That'd be beautiful. I'd buy 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Republic Commando is a tactical first person shooter where you are the leader of a small squad called Delta Squad. The gameplay is much like any other shooter however instead of run and gun the player must order their squadmates to perform different functions such as slice a terminal, set a bomb and get behind cover and use various weapons including sniper, anti-armor and grenade. They will also target one enemy, form up on the player, go to a certain location or search and destroy. On top of that the player has a special weapon called the DC-17 which was interchangeable from assault rifle to sniper rifle to anti-armor launcher. The Player also had a full HUD that made it feel like the player was really in a clone trooper helmet.  One of the other cooler features is instead of dying you just go down and you can either call a squadmate over to revive you, maintain their orders and kill everything before getting you or just reload a save.  A lot of these features worked perfectly it isn’t like whoever could develop the sequel couldn’t just use all these features all over again. It begs the question where is the sequel if the gameplay mechanics are already there and ready to be used again. 	You are Delta RC-1138 or “Boss,” the leader of Delta squad who has in it RC-1262, “Scorch,” the comedic relief /explosives expert, RC-1140, “Fixer,” the by the book soldier that specializes in slicing and RC-1207, “Sev,” the hunter/sniper. You start out in your birthing tube on Kamino and it shows your training as you age. Eventually your squad meets up for the invasion of Geonosis during the beginning of the clone wars. There Delta Squad is tasked to infiltrate and assassinate Sun Fac, a Geonosian leader. Along with that they have several other objectives that they accomplish including destroying an underground droid factory and retrieving launch codes from a Trade Federation core ship. 	One year after the invasion of Geonosis Delta Squad is set to investigate their original ship the Prosecutor to find out why it has not responded in several weeks. During this they find out the Trandoshan Slaves and Mercenaries have taken over the ship with the help of the Separatists in order to capture and bring the ship back to a Separatist base. Delta Squad ends up destroying all of the Trandoshans and defends the ship from a Trade Federation Battleship that attacks shortly after. 	The final mission involves Delta Squad being the advance recon team on Kashyyyk and to help the Wookiees to fight back the Trandoshan Slavers and Separatists that have control of the planet. They end up rescuing General Tarfful and run into General Grievous themselves but only end up fighting those IG-100 Magna Guards that carry the Electrostaff. Eventually Delta Squad makes it to where the Separatist Battleship has linked itself the giant citadel tree and they destroy it. They end the game on a cliffhanger as Sev had been captured and the invasion of Kashyyyk by the main republic force had begun which once again begs the question, why not continue the story and have a sequel. 	Now the graphics aren’t anything to write home about but they are fairly impressive for when this game was made, 2005, but what really makes this game look impressive is the HUD for the clone troopers and the art assets they created for the game. Lucasarts did not separate themselves from canon too much in that the story of Delta Squad lines up perfectly with that of the actual Star Wars universe and Extended Universe. 	Republic Commando is actually the first Star Wars game that featured licensed music that included the song “Clones” by the band Ash which sounds awesome. On top of that they included all of the heavy battle music from John Williams you may have heard from any of the other Star Wars movies. The voice acting is also superb as for most of the clone troopers and Delta 38 was voiced by the original actor for Jango Fett, Temuera Morrison which I thought was a nice touch.  	Overall this game is actually one of my favorite Star Wars games of all time and is an absolute classic in terms of story and gameplay. With the disbandment of Lucasarts, in order to make a sequel some developer is going to have to get rights to both the Star Wars IP and the Republic Commando IP which could make it quite pricey. •	Story  - 4 out of 5•	Gameplay – 4 out of 5•	Graphics – 4 out of 5•	Sound  - 5 out of 5•	Fun – 5 out of 5Pros: -	Fun gameplay/squad commanding-	Great music and voice acting-	Star Wars UniverseCons:-	Can get annoyingly difficult with the lack of ammo at times-	Repetitive enemies I’m giving a Total score of 90% ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chaos has erupted throughout the galaxy. As leader of an elite squad of Republic Commandos, your mission is to infiltrate, dominate, and ultimately, annihilate the enemy.

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 83% YES / 17% NOGOODGreat clone wars commando troops and squadAll 3 squad mates have their own flavor, but aren't exclusive to their speciality (e.g. the demolitions guy isn't the only guy that can undergo demolitions tasks, but he's just faster at them I think)Guns are fun, with your main gun having 3 variations (rapid fire, sniper, anti armor) with a fifth slot for alien guns and a surprisingly superb melee attacklots of chances to use squad tactics and assess sitations to make better calls. you can direct which cover to use and enemies to focus on.squad functions feel fun to use (ordering squad mates around and changing tactics)NEUTRALGraphics are fine. Kind of plain and you fight the same enemies for large chunks of time, but they make good use of it.BADStory is fine overall and closes out at a steady pace, but ends abruptly at a point you feel like more came after.SUMMARYOverall they really nailed the tight squad combat and made the combat fun. I'd be very interested to see this get another entry.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me just start off with: if you LOVED Star Wars Battlefront II, then you will LOVE this game!The gameplay is almost exactly the same with the addition of command over 3 other commandos. You have a wide variety of orders to give.Pros--Gameplay--Story--ZERO bugsCons--Difficult at timesThe only things that were annoying were that your teammates died rather quickly, and there was an overpowered enemy called the Super Battle Droid. Those of you who are Star Wars fans know what this is. But if you're not a Star Wars fan, I have two words of advice:1. Become one.2. Try this game out for sure.Thanks for reading this review!

												-Reposting since 32 fanboys can't understand that MISSING SOFTWARE is an issue with a game and SHOULD BE TOLD TO THOSE THAT HAVEN'T BOUGHT THE GAME YET. Fun Fact: ""Yes"" that makes the review helpful, even if its not an issue for your preferences. It might be for people that are not you. That is a major reason to have reviews and read them. NOT THE ORIGINAL CONTROLLER COMPATIBLE!?! /RAGE QUIT. Understand, I Love This Game, it is a great game but they sell a crippled version of it. This was originally an (Microsoft) Xbox game and to not have an obvious (Microsoft) controller option is stupid. Yes; Xpadder.com provides a ""work around"" (you just have to build the button layout profile yourself)... But not everybody wants to buy a copy of the Xpadder program, or one like it. If these control setings are not an issue for you, do buy this FPS. (Fun Fact: Linking a patch to play a great game is helpful. You might even find someone that needs it one day.)Lore/TLDR = I bought this game on Xbox when it came out. It's 'like' the first Halo only you get great AI teammates and the gore is /shiver the first few times blood splatters your face. I loved it. I've even read all 5 of the Republic (and Imperial) Commando books by Karen Traviss. So this game was one of my first purchases (main reason I bought the complete Star Wars pack) and I was going to play this with a huge nostalgic grin. But my Xbox one controller is not an option, only mouse and keyboard. I had to calm down just to find a work around via google. Took about 15 mins to instal and learn how to use the Xpadder program. It works very well for a button jury-rig. I'll even be enjoying GW2 with it. Conclusion = For a gamer like me controls are everything; this controller issue only effects users like me and this obvious lazy move by the development team is the worst thing I can say about the game. (Or might just be more of Microsoft's quiet war against Steam. Illuminati confirmed.) Which means this is still one of my favorite games, but I'm going to leave this as a negative review as a warning to others that this is NOT THE ORIGINAL plug and play control settings.

												Listen to the others- This is a great game. I am about to finish the game right now even though it only says I have a few hours. (I had no wifi at one point so I played offline.) At school when I mentioned 'Star Wars' some of my friends questioned  me except one, (the one who showed me this game) and I explained that this isn't a six year old Jedi v. Darth Vader game. It has a very unique, fun play style. You play as a Commando of 'Delta Squad' with a funny, helpful team. I breezed through it because I'm not new to conserving ammo and first-person shooters. (It's helpful to use the pistol a lot.) Though, at some parts, especially when locking up the Republic ship, it was hard. But I'll have to give this game five stars because of the great gameplay and amount of fun put into a game that reminds me of my childhood.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												underrated underrated underrated, i feel bad for the guy who made this game it is a work of solid gold if you ask me. The sad thing is not many people know about its greatness or when they see it care about it. I feel if this game was repromoted and advertised it would become a hit game come back from the dead. It makes me sad to see this game but know its greatness is not appreciated by many. I wish lucasarts would try to advertise this game better or at least make a commandos 2 to say, ""hey look at the greatness you idiots missed, buy it and have a taste of this real star wars strategy fps hardcore fast paced scary as hell at points game!""

												This game is amazing. I've been playing it ever since it came out on the Original Xbox, and I maybe have 1000+ hours into it. My childhood summers were defined by this game. And not because it's a great tactical shooter, that has an amazing soldier atmosphere and command system, but because it's fun. The story is full of humor, darkness, and original Star Wars themes. The multiplayer is solid, with no problems I can think of. I remember shooting my neighbour off the multiplayer maps and absolutely breaking the game :) If you like Star Wars, or the Clones of Star Wars, this is an amazing game for you. If you like tactical shooters, this is also a game for you. Just freakin' buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's bloody, gritty and rather tricky. A Star Wars game for a more mature demographic with likable characters with, albeit cliched, personalities. You got your rough and tumble borderline serial killer 07 - SevYou got the fun and dumb but highly trained demolitionist 62 - ScorchYou got the bottom feeding, intellegent and downright square 40 - FixerThen there's you, the quick thinking leader of Delta Squad - 38 - BossThey may have differing personalities and prefernces but at the end of the day each sqaud member is very copy and paste in terms of usefulness and each one gets the job regardless of what they prefer to do which is good, why leave a Commando half cooked?The gameplay aspect was astounding. The Ai are intellegent (bar some hiccups) and follow orders very well. You say 'Search and Destory' they'll take point and peek around corners before engaging the enemy.Say 'Group Up' and, well, they come to you like a Jack Russel that heard a bag open.Give the order to 'Secure Location' and they actually dig in, taking cover behind objects and not leaving that spot unless you put them on a position but even if one goes the other two stay and keep digging in, its great if you need to heal at a bacta station under heaby fire.Lastly there's the 'Move On' command which ends whatever action the commando's are doing and will either fall back to a secured location if a marker was placed or come back to you.In battle you HAVE to be the leader. These guys wont do more than cover and shoot unless you point them towards a turret, sniper location or explosive ordinance spot. There's nothing finer than having all three squad mates on useful points as you go against a small army of droids. There are also non-combat meneuvers like Slicing a terminal, setting a detonator charge or Breaching and Clearing a room. Your surroundings are as much of a weapon as anything though, one part I liked was when I had my squad distract a heavily armoured spider droid while I snuck around the back, sliced a terminal and dropped a crate on its head.Droids also have this annoying habit of being extremely hard to kill. Maybe the battle droids are easy but Super Battle Droids, Destroyer Droids and Spider Droids are tough and require you to focus the entire squads fire on one at a time. There are other enemy types but I wont spoil it.All in all this is a fun game but with a sadly abrupt ending. It almost felt like they ran out of funding halfway through and ended it at the worst moment possible. I literally felt like someone came into my bedroom and pulled the blug on my PC, that was how abrupt the ending blackout was.All in all you can get some 15-16 hours out of it which isn't too bad. It's a good game with solid FPS mechanics and some great voice acting where it counts and despite its abruptness the ending was fairly good and will leave you wanting more.9/10 solid gameplay with very very few glitches but with an abrupt ending			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved and hated this game. It felt long because the gameplay felt repetitive and long after awhile. The gameplay is pretty much run and gun. The squad is frustrating at times because they aren't too smart and will stand there at times while people are shooting at them. The graphics are kind of old school. The game is good for Star Wars diehards but for the average FPS gamer its something that gets long to play as the game progresses. I felt myself wanting the game to end really early in the game because of how repetitive it got. The great thing about this game was the soundtrack, it was very well done. The online portion of the game is small but still active. The online portion is the thing to play if you want a fun experience with it. The story of the game was confusing and left you wondering. The really annoying thing about this game was the ammo and guns, if felt like you ran out of ammo too fast. Get it if you love Star Wars, but not if your looking for a good story and gameplay.

												There is alot of things this game does right and alot of things this game does wrong. The gameplay was done right, You really do have to instruct your team correctly and expirement with different methods of attack to win this game, run and gun alone will not cut it. the story was all over the place, it had some epic moments but there was alot of bland parts repeatitive tasks. the soundtrack was decent but it sounded like it was trying to hard to rip off halo. And your squad mates were majorly interchangable, they can all do the same tasks and don't have near enough dialogue to make you really feel differently or tell any real difference between them personality wise, but to be fair they are clones. the AI was was average,  most of the enemies just stood still and occasionally changed attacks that they used but ther were some mobile enemies that did chase and follow you, only to get knifed in the face. overall it's a good game, but i suggest playing it in segments/parts, dont play the whole thing at once or your gunna get real burnt out.

At school when I mentioned 'Star Wars' some of my friends questioned  me except one, (the one who showed me this game) and I explained that this isn't a six year old Jedi v. Darth Vader game. It has a very unique, fun play style. You play as a Commando of 'Delta Squad' with a funny, helpful team. I breezed through it because I'm not new to conserving ammo and first-person shooters. (It's helpful to use the pistol a lot.) Though, at some parts, especially when locking up the Republic ship, it was hard. But I'll have to give this game five stars because of the great gameplay and amount of fun put into a game that reminds me of my childhood.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												underrated underrated underrated, i feel bad for the guy who made this game it is a work of solid gold if you ask me. The sad thing is not many people know about its greatness or when they see it care about it. I feel if this game was repromoted and advertised it would become a hit game come back from the dead. It makes me sad to see this game but know its greatness is not appreciated by many. I wish lucasarts would try to advertise this game better or at least make a commandos 2 to say, ""hey look at the greatness you idiots missed, buy it and have a taste of this real star wars strategy fps hardcore fast paced scary as hell at points game!""

												This game is amazing. I've been playing it ever since it came out on the Original Xbox, and I maybe have 1000+ hours into it. My childhood summers were defined by this game. And not because it's a great tactical shooter, that has an amazing soldier atmosphere and command system, but because it's fun. The story is full of humor, darkness, and original Star Wars themes. The multiplayer is solid, with no problems I can think of. I remember shooting my neighbour off the multiplayer maps and absolutely breaking the game :) If you like Star Wars, or the Clones of Star Wars, this is an amazing game for you. If you like tactical shooters, this is also a game for you. Just freakin' buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah yes this game. A gritty Star Wars FPS playing the role of a Republic Commando taking control of a small squad to complete various tasks in the name of the Republic. This game was quite the blast to play.First off the combat is fun and engaging with various weapons and a few unique ones too. You also have a squad to command and you can order them to various tasks such as arming explosives, taking sniping positions and so forth. The music holy hell isn't it beautiful? Especially at the title screen. One of my favourite parts about this game is the amount of detail put into this. You can see your helmet on the wholeway through and when enemy blood splatters on it, it gets wiped away. There are some other cool little things I won't spoil. Not to mention the game looks good in general.I've played both the PC and Xbox version and I would recommend the PC version. It has better controls overall but the Xbox version is an impressive feat in itself. This was one of the last Star Wars games in the Golden Age of Star Wars games before there was silence but things are looking a little bright now. This game gets an 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I loved it, i have played Battlefront II since it came out, and now cant decide which i llike better.  i loved it, the guns, the squad sytem, the OP grenades,  the one-stab melee, and the virtually invincible Destroyer Droids (JUST DIE ALREADY DANGIT)!My only complaint is it needs to be continued.  At least go back and save your lost squadmate!  Please LucasArts, make a sequel!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Star Wars games ever. Very immersive, pretty good graphics for a 2005 game, excellent voice acting and levels, good story, squad tactics. I just can't find anything bad about this game. It's pretty hard too, which is a good thing. Sometimes you will litterally have to re-load your save like 10 times to finish a level, which is good for gamers who like a bit of challenge (hard FPS are so rare these days). Overall an excellent first person shooter set in the star wars universe. You should definitely play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's bloody, gritty and rather tricky. A Star Wars game for a more mature demographic with likable characters with, albeit cliched, personalities. You got your rough and tumble borderline serial killer 07 - SevYou got the fun and dumb but highly trained demolitionist 62 - ScorchYou got the bottom feeding, intellegent and downright square 40 - FixerThen there's you, the quick thinking leader of Delta Squad - 38 - BossThey may have differing personalities and prefernces but at the end of the day each sqaud member is very copy and paste in terms of usefulness and each one gets the job regardless of what they prefer to do which is good, why leave a Commando half cooked?The gameplay aspect was astounding. The Ai are intellegent (bar some hiccups) and follow orders very well. You say 'Search and Destory' they'll take point and peek around corners before engaging the enemy.Say 'Group Up' and, well, they come to you like a Jack Russel that heard a bag open.Give the order to 'Secure Location' and they actually dig in, taking cover behind objects and not leaving that spot unless you put them on a position but even if one goes the other two stay and keep digging in, its great if you need to heal at a bacta station under heaby fire.Lastly there's the 'Move On' command which ends whatever action the commando's are doing and will either fall back to a secured location if a marker was placed or come back to you.In battle you HAVE to be the leader. These guys wont do more than cover and shoot unless you point them towards a turret, sniper location or explosive ordinance spot. There's nothing finer than having all three squad mates on useful points as you go against a small army of droids. There are also non-combat meneuvers like Slicing a terminal, setting a detonator charge or Breaching and Clearing a room. Your surroundings are as much of a weapon as anything though, one part I liked was when I had my squad distract a heavily armoured spider droid while I snuck around the back, sliced a terminal and dropped a crate on its head.Droids also have this annoying habit of being extremely hard to kill. Maybe the battle droids are easy but Super Battle Droids, Destroyer Droids and Spider Droids are tough and require you to focus the entire squads fire on one at a time. There are other enemy types but I wont spoil it.All in all this is a fun game but with a sadly abrupt ending. It almost felt like they ran out of funding halfway through and ended it at the worst moment possible. I literally felt like someone came into my bedroom and pulled the blug on my PC, that was how abrupt the ending blackout was.All in all you can get some 15-16 hours out of it which isn't too bad. It's a good game with solid FPS mechanics and some great voice acting where it counts and despite its abruptness the ending was fairly good and will leave you wanting more.9/10 solid gameplay with very very few glitches but with an abrupt ending			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is up there with Metroid Prime and Unreal as being one of my favorite FPSes ever, plus one of my favorite Star Wars games. I just wish it was longer.Unlike most FPSes I've played, where the combat's attempt at a frantic pace just makes it an annoying mess of white noise, Republic Commando's squad-based gameplay forces you constantly calculate battlefield tactics as opposed to just trying not to get shot.The game's biggest weakness comes in a few brief segments where you're forced into a tactical situation by yourself, where one stray bullet can drop you; or when you're given a time limit, which in one case resulted in me finishing a level with literally a second or two left on the clock. The intensity of the firefights makes completing your objectives in time an incredible strain.Besides that, the game is only three missions: Geonosis, a deralict Republic battlecruiser, and Kashyyyk. Thankfully, each of these missions will last you a good three hours a piece, so I wasn't left feeling like I'd played an unfinished game. I was, however, left wanting a lot more. In particular, the notion of this game's encounters playing out organically, with nonlinear level design (and a lot more levels), sounds like the workings of one of the greatest FPSes ever.

												I have played 2 hours and 30 minutes of this game so far, and I AM LOVING IT. The game has you play as a Clone Commando, designated ""Delta 38"". Your squad (Also named ""Delta"") are also highly trained clone commandos. The graphics aren't terrible (in fact, I kinda like them) despite the fact that this game is pretty old. It took me a while to get used to the controls, as mouse 3 is Aim, not right click (which is grenade).  Gameplay is VERY solid, and FUN. Its starts out easy, but quickly gets DIFFICULT, even on the normal mode.  And in the beginning, when you dont know how to counter the enemies, it can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes to destroy new enemies, such as Super Battle Droids. But that is quickly remedied when you have the tools and experience.  The AI is actually REALLY good, as in, unlike games like Call of Duty, the friendly AI can actually shoot and kill things. This is really helful, especially when there is many or tough enemies. Also, since we're on friendly AI characters, I LOVE THEM. All your fellow Commandos, despite being clones, are very human so far. They have different personalities, and in the short time I knew them, I started caring about my ""brothers"".  Although there are some Friendly Fire incidents (both me and my squad's fault) I felt like this made them even more ""human"" (probably due to the ammount of friendly fire that happens in other games like Arma or Insurgency). You can also give your team orders, which I find to be promptly followed and well executed, which has been a huge assist. So in conclusion, I will list what Ive found;-Solid shooter gameplay-Nice, easy, and fun squad based mechanics-Many different enemies in the campaign-Human like characters (For me anyway)-ACTUALLY HELPFUL TEAM AI (very important)-Very Very Fun.-graphics are still alright (depending on your tolerance to old graphics)The few bad things I have found are:-Enemies sometimes bug and dont move or shoot-Allies sometimes get stuck on a position, making them take a while to execute the order.-old graphics			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Such old, much wow, many play!Though this game is old, it has a long story line in singleplayer mode.There is though not many servers left, since GameSpy removed support for this game.You might still be able to find servers either with or without programs like gameranger og tunngle.The community is still there, and it's not all dem 8 years old who uploads random **** on the community hub.The community is not expanding, but it's still there!I would highly recommend to buy this game, if you like le good ol' days of computer games, and if you want a community of people who is awesome!

												9/10Amazing first person shooter.Just picked this up recently after playing it many years ago and it is one of the few games which I feel was not made good by nostalgia but in fact one of the best star wars games made and with very good graphics for its time.Needs a sequel!

												pros: deep and narrow plot ties into the ep 2/ep 3 lore. plenty of shooting, developers made a solid attempt at interactive ai, I cant imagine how fun this would be in xbox co-opcons: kinda grindy, some levels are a breeze, a few are way too hard. definitely showing its age, due to competitors like BF4.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply amazing in every way <33 Thats how games should be, Im usually not even much into Star Wars but this game just feels amazing with Star Wars. I love it, I played it back then and I played it today again, I wish someone would make a sequel with HD graphics.IMPORTANT: The FOV might be way too close, to change that you need to look up a guide online which can be a bit confusing because you need to change stuff with a hex-editor (or whatever its called) its not too hard or anything but yeah.Edit: The same about the solution but its all not THAT hard just READ CLOSELY^^http://www.wsgf.org/dr/star-wars-republic-commandoDont forget the small details! (After changing solution make it read-only again + dont just change 1 hex fields, its more than 1)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I Personally love clones in the star wars movies. It turns out, I'm more prone to ""bad guys"", but this game changed my feeling of bad guys. This game puts you in a squad of clones unlike any other!Pros- Bots are quite useful- Able to control the bots into what you want to do (ex. heal, revive, kill, Ect.)- Wide range of weaponry- Many objectives that can possibly overwhelm you!!!Cons- The gameplay can get quite repetitive- You and bots can easily die very quickly- Bots take orders very slowly- Terrible multiplayer system (No-one plays that anymore!)This is my input in the game. It's your decision if you want the game. Hope this helped!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It`s a good and fun game, but it`s not a complex tactical shooter in the Star Wars universe I was hoping for. The gameplay is painfully linear and there`s very little tactial depth to it. You can`t give commands to individual soldiers, sniping positions are fixed and cannot be assigned by the player, and door breaching has no additional options (like throwing in grenades or something). Rainbow six - Vegas has actually more depth and tactics than this and that`s saying something :( The levels in this game are very restrictive (You follow a hallway with some rooms). Another giant weakness is setting the game within the prequel trilogy, so you`ll be killing a lot of droids in stead of strom troopers/rebels. The main protagonist uses a Codename outbreak style multi purpose rifle which can be adapted to many different weapon types, which is kind of a letdown. The guns in this game seem to be a little underpowered not doing as much damage as You would like them to do. Iwas generally dissatisfied with this title but for a sci-fi action fan, who likes tactical elements and doesn`t hate the SW prequels- it might be good shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a great game, It shows that LucasArts cares for his games, plus all the other companies that helped. From all the Starwars Games, I say this one is a great success I've played all the games. This is my top favorite it's got, okay graphics, and some basic game settings that make it better, but that's not the point it's about the campaign this has a great campaign and a great combat system. I've beaten this game 3 times. Though what is shameful about the game is that the campaign is not that long it's about a 4-6 Hour Campaign. Though at the end.... I would suggest getting this game. It is indeed a Classic!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I played this on Xbox as a kid, I thought it was the best star wars shooter I'd ever played. Clone troopers always intrigued me more than the Jedi. Now I realize that, even on hardest, this game is too easy and too short. However, the tactical gameplay is no joke, and I personally perfer the squad control in Republic Commando over most Tom Clancy offerings. Multiplayer is a joke, but only because it's tacked on. If you have any interest in playing an awsome scifi shooter (and don't mind the low difficulty), I recomend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:-The voice acting is good-The music is great-The story's decent-The game's challenging-Enemies are varied-The tactical portion of the gameplay is well executed, for the most part-The DC-17m(default primary weapon) is badassNitpicks:-Using bumpmapping on high will most likely cause issues(can be fixed with a mod, but installing it will render you unable to play online with anyone who doesn't have the mod)-No widescreen support(can be fixed)-Some enemies are really cheap -The graphics show their ageCons:-The DC-17m feels weak, in its base form-Multiplayer's an afterthought-The sights on the DC-17m are hard to use-The crosshair makes hipfiring awkward-The friendly AI isn't too great, and tends to fail against higher-tier enemiesThis game is pretty much Star Wars and Rainbow Six: Vegas crammed into one game.  It's fun, albeit annoying, sometimes.  The game doesn't look like much, by today's standards, but it's good for its time.  If you're a Star Wars fan, or are into shooters, I think you should check this out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game that was made after battlefront 2 its very pleasent to play. If you like commanding a squad but also want the taste of the action this games for you. with 3 clones helping you navigate through levels and wanting to tell them what to do. Multiplayer LAN is a bit of a pain because you cant command them because they want there fredom to kill that guy instead of taking a sniper bunker. however playing alone and since A.I. doesnt understand what fredom is, you can tell them to do whatever the game is possible and they are pretty obidient like they listen to all orders you give them.and since there A.I players they try make the player compitent because its youre game and there lazy to make A.I usfullthis game is why i trust robots. they do so with no questions asked and GAME SPY (oh god i still want to enjoy this game with friends but how can i if you decied to shut down and lucas didnt trust oh i dunno THEMSELVES TO MAKE SERVERS)this is daud and i would like alot of star wars games if theres a way to crank back the multiplayer but this game is perferd to be played alone with A.I players                                                                                                                        9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ce jeu a été une excellente surprise. - Les graphismes ne font pas trop vieux (l'univers visuel de Star Wars aide)- On gère une escoudade et ça c'est génial. On peut enfin donner des ordres à ses coéquipiers! C'est ce qui me manquait à Space Marines! Choisir le couvert (sniper, démolition, grenade), qui va poser la charge explosive, pirater le terminal. Tenir la position, avancer de façon agressive, rester en formation, prendre une tourelle etc.! Il faut gérer son personnage et les trois autres, et ça donne une dimension géniale au jeu! - L'histoire est courte mais très sympa. On voit comment la République ne repose pas QUE sur les jedis. Et la fin... manly tears, bro.A acheter. Je regrette de ne pas y avoir joué avant les votes Steam pour le jeu devant avoir une suite.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's very rare for a game to age as well as Republic Commando has. The graphics, though visibly dated, aren't distractingly bad, and rather more importantly the squad AI is still some of the best I've seen in a video game. Quite honestly I wouldn't mind exchanging most of the people I play vermintide with for fixer, scorch and sev.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is perhaps the greatest singleplayer FPS ever. Despite looking a bit aged, it runs well and is still as fun as ever. You play as Delta-38 (Boss), as the leader of Delta Squad, consisting of your explosives specialist and joker Delta-62 (Scorch), your levelheaded computer specialist Delta-40 (Fixer) and resident sniper/psychopath Delta-07 (Sev). You travel between three levels: the desert planet Geonosis, the start of the Clone Wars, the RAS Prosecutor, a derelict Republic Assault Ship (Ex Machina y u do dis to me) and Kashyyyk, home of the Wookies.The game is particularly notable for its advanced squad AI, which hasn't really been matched since. Your squadmates are easily capable of holding their own for a while, but the perfect balance is struck between the need for player input and AI competence. You also have the ability to command your troops to perform actions such as snipe enemies, hack terminals and man turrets.In conclusion, Republic Commando is a must-buy for any Star Wars or FPS fan.10/10 would use AT-TE again.

												A criminally overlooked and underrated Star Wars game.Though I do not quite like the gunplay of the iconical blasterrifle all that much in this game, it basically is the only flaw this game has.Republic Commando is a still good looking, great tactical shooter which makes you wonder why there never was a sequel to it.

												I love this game. It's just like Call of Duty, but the The Star Wars version. Anyone who enjoys Star Wars will absolutely love this game. The only thing I would like to see change is making each level a little bit easier or harder depending on how far you are into the game, not making each part the same difficulty as you advance through the game.

												One of the best Star Wars game around, you play a squad leader of a special clone trooper - Delta squad in a linear FPS while able to give command to your squad and even can determine the pace of the battles, this game got a great storyline ,enjoyable Squad banter, excellent music, also, although the characters are clones – each of them has unique personality and you can actually get attach to them  (eat your heart call of duty devs – this game manage to do everything you couldn't do right in your games)This game ends on a cliffhanger - too bad the sequel to this game was canceled  :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												really decent game. countless hourrs from my youth were spent playing it on disk when it first came out, way way way too many hours.in modern context the game holds its own, though its graphics have aged (gracefully and tastefully though might i add) and its Ai is not as polished as something from 2010 upwards your squad is always reliable and the hostiles always competent.that said, there are so many bullett sponges in the game it makes me mad, if there was a way to tweak the damage output for both hostiles and friendles (character included)  to far reater heaights then this game could rival many a modern shooter, and if story and atmosphere is taken into account it could probabley beat it too.

ONE OF THE BEST star wars games you will ever play. The graphics are wearing off, but the gameplay is still top notch. Better then COD, Or really any other high franchise shooters. This is, and will be one of my top ten game of all time. Its amazing, and even if its not on sale, i reccomend getting it. This will re-create/make your childhood. No need for a high end PC either.

												This is an FPS Star Wars game that puts you in the role of a clone commando soldier. It has a bit of a darker, more realistic tone but still keeps very faithful to the Star Wars licence. In this game teamwork is key and you develope a bond with your brothers/squadmates over time. It has just the right amount of challenge and you can even play co-op with your friends! This is an amazingly designed game that I can recommend to any Star Wars fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
