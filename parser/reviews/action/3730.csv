												Before Halo, Call of Duty, and other new-school shooters that currently saturate the FPS market, there was the old school. I’m talking about games that kept the same spirit as Wolfenstein 3D, like the Doom series, Duke Nukem 3D, Half-Life, the Quake series, and Unreal. If you lived through this time, you know what I’m talking about. These games are representative of a peak in shooters in that their challenge, length, and fun depended on gameplay alone—no cutscenes that pad the game time, no predictable plot elements, and no exploitative glitches that most new school gamers use in games today. Controls were fluid and customizable, combat was fast and furious, and the games were almost exclusively for PC. It took skill to play and if you were killed, you had only yourself to blame. This was when multiplayer was on the rise, before mods and cheating took hold to as great an extent as it does now, and before cheap tactics like quick-scoping were often the deciding factor in encounters.Aliens vs. Predator Classic 2000, as it’s currently known, in some ways represents one of the last examples of this FPS golden age. It was released in 1999 in the wake of the game-changing Quake (1996) and Half-Life (1998). Its main selling point, of course, is that you can play as each of the three different species, the Marine, Predator, and Alien. There are three different campaigns for each, and beating each on successively harder difficulties unlocks up to five bonus levels for each, which also bestow additional equipment to the predator and marine. Additionally, if you complete certain challenges, you can also unlock new options that may classify as “cheats” in single player. You won’t really see much of a storyline progression between levels because there isn’t really a story. As with most developers of old school shooters, Rebellion focused on gameplay more than anything and the result is excellent.Being a game now available on Steam, you’re probably thinking about multiplayer, and yes, that is one of the best reasons for this game’s existence. In fact, it seems almost designed as a tournament fighter, given the vast differences between species. If you were to never play the story missions at all, you would still have endless amounts of fun. Of course, I’m referring more to this game in its prime (early 2000’s) rather than now, because as you might expect, not many people still play this game. But when you find a game, you will see that the multiplayer is still very good and holds up today, even if it’s under-populated.The perfect word to describe this game is balanced. Each species has its own advantages and disadvantages such that you never really feel like one is significantly over- or under-powered. The alien is the fastest, can jump the farthest, and walk on walls, but it’s the weakest physically and only has close-range weapons. The marine is slow and relatively weak, but can resupply through medpacks and armor and has access to the motion tracker and the game’s strongest weapons. The predator is the physically toughest, has strong weapons and cloaking device, but is kind of clunky with its limited energy, limited speargun ammo, and species-specific vision modes. Now for the gameplay. This game is fast, incredibly fast. Like other old-school shooters, you have to react quickly and precisely or you’ll end up dead. Start spamming your weapons and you’ll just leave yourself open to attack and die. This game can feel relentless but never unfair. As stated above, it’s the product of a more refined and merciless age, before button-mashing, quick-scoping, and button-combinations became as prevalent as they are now. Like the alien itself, this game goes back to the roots of what makes a great shooter by stripping away all the hand-holding. Need I say more? If you’re a product of the nineties, then you were probably into either the Aliens or Predator series at one point or another. Even if you’re not, this is a great game solely for the gameplay value. And for $4.99 you can’t really go wrong. In my opinion it’s the best AvP game ever released (better than AVP2 and 2010). And honestly, I don’t have any gripes or complaints about it, which is pretty rare for me. For those of you interested in the more technical aspects, the Steam version is the 2000 update by Rebellion that allows for saving (yes, the original did not allow saves) and has two new weapons, the Skeeter missile launcher and the dual-wielding pistols, both for the marine. You can get graphical updates through what’s called the Redux mod, which you can get at moddb.com. You can also pick up extra multiplayer maps and other refinements for this game there as well. Happy hunting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is an example of how to do First-Person-Shooters right. The fast gameplay requires more skill and focus than most modern First-Person-Shooters. Instead of trying to level up your character to get OP weapons, most weapons have a legitimate purpose, and most of them don't feel too overpowered (except Disc, Pred Pistol, Skeeter, and Sadar. Not to forget Mines). Instead of grinding to get perks to power yourself up, Aliens versus Predator requires skill from the start.Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 allows the player to take control of three species, Aliens, Predators, or the human Marines. Each have their advantages and disadvantages.The Alien is a melee only species, a hurtful disadvantage, but because of their speed and wallcrawling ability the Aliens have, they're a worthy enemy. Aliens also can smell the scents of other beings, allowing it to see its victims in the dark. The Alien regains health by headbiting Predators and Humans, you can do this on both the living and the dead. Obviously headbiting live beings is harder than dead ones, but gains back more health.The Predator is a mix of Melee and ranged weapons. The majority of his weapons, Medicomp, and cloak are powered by 'Field Charge'. This will slowly recharge if you are not using anything that uses charge, or you can find field-charge items around the map which will automatically give you full energy. The only weapons that don't use energy are the Wristblades, and Disc (Unless you use the recall ability, this will use a small amount of energy), as well as the Speargun. But this uses ammo, which only replenishes upon death. The Predator can heal using his Medicomp, this will use a large amount of energy, but puts you back to full health everytime (TIP: The Medicomp's secondary fire can extinguish you if you're on fire). In some of the bonus levels the Predator gains a new gadget, the grappling hook, which can pull him to higher heights. The Predator also has three vision modes, which can help him spot enemies. The first vision mode can help spot humans, the second aliens, and the third other Predators and field-charges (Of course you also have the default normal vision).The Marine is a ranged only species. The marine uses weapons like the pulse rifle, smartgun, minigun, etc. The Marine replenishes health with medkits, found about through-out levels. The marine can use armor, which can protect against Alien acid and absorbs small amounts of damage. In some of the bonus levels the Marines get a jetpack! In multiplayer Marines can select a specialist sub-class, this will allow them to pick from any of the weapons in the game (unless game host restricted it), and you will always spawn with the selected weapon, but you can only use that weapon (and the pistol).Each species can unlock bonus missions after you complete the main game, (you will unlock more if you beat it on a higher difficulty) these levels are the levels from other species singleplayer, for example: You can unlock a backwards version of the Predator's first level as Marine if you beat the Marine SP on Director's cut [Hard].Not to forget, you can unlock cheat options in the game by completing certain objectives through-out the levels. These can be things like slow-mo whenever you are near enemies. Or unlimited speargun ammo and more spears per shot as Predator.The Multiplayer is where this game shines most. Fast gameplay and the different play-styles of each species make for very fun and memorable experience. This is one of the fastest games ever, you will die, fast, and a lot. While Alien and Marine gameplay is fairly balanced, their's no denying that the predator is too overpowered, but the multiplayer is fun, nonetheless. But, unfortunately, this game has a small player base, so at times you may not be able to find a game. Because of this the community doesn't play competitively [most of the time], anymore. Servers will also usually have a small amount of players. 8-player games are kinda rare, but when they happen, it's a lot of fun!Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is easily one of the best games ever made.""I admire its purity.""-MandatoryAlcatraz ",261,16,3,21,9,0,11

Old, but a supreme classic // A must buy for FPS & series fans+ Game boasts a second tier of bonus missions, available after completing a given campaign; these are fun and do well to increase replayability+ Each of the three species is completely unique in design and feel+ Sound effects are all ripped striaght from their respective films, and are sure to delight fans+ Runs astonishingly well on newer systems, and there are no compatibility issues that have made themselves apparent+ Everything in the game, from the weapons to the set designs, is faithful to the series+ Combat, item interaction, and movement are all crisp, simple, and polished+ The game absolutely drips with atmosphere, particularly during the Marine's campaign+ Allows one to connect to players playing the game through both Steam and GoG; this is excellent, and much needed, as the few players that still occasion the game's multiplayer seem to be doing so through GoG+ When available, multiplayer is fast-paced and ferocious; it's great fun, and has a vintage feel to it- Classes feel a bit unbalanced in multiplayer, though not crushingly so (Predator appears to have the advantage, followed by Alien and Marines, in that order)- No autosave function; while it's good that a save function has been added at all from the original, the saves are limited per mission, and if one forgets to save, this could lead to lots of frustrated backtracking from the level's beginning- Stock campaigns are painfully short; all 15 campaign missions (not including bonus levels) can be wrapped up in around 5 hours without a walkthrough- Visuals have certainly not aged well, in any way (though there are apparently some mods available that can remedy this to a certain extent)- No clear map or objective markers available; one can easily get turned aroundLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												Easily one of the best purchases! If, of course, you know the game and played it a long time ago. Why? Because it is still working and playing multipayer on modern PCs is feasible with this release! It certainly aged quite a lot but it is one of those gems we cannot avoid. You can now relive the experience you had a long time ago via Steam!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Rather than contrived and predictable scripting, the enemy can come at any time from any direction; giving the player a sense of the overwhelming as opposed to a theme park ride. Unlike the many inferior aliens titles that follow specifically designed for console in mind;  the xenomorphs (aliens) move at an incredibly fast pace, on the wall, the floor or ceiling that makes them difficult to hit.The levels themselves, rather than a mainstream simplistic A to B simplistic snooze fest are maze like, tight, dark and incredibly easy to get lost in.When you couple all of the  above with a vulnerable human player who can die within 1-2 hits; you get a game that successfully understands and implements what made the movies great. Not only does the game successfully capture the aspects of the aliens; it amazingly manages to capture the predator movies. With humans aimlessly wondering around having the player stalk and butcher them using very fun toys used exactly as they are in the movie franchise. Regardless of the♥♥♥♥♥♥Rebellion has done or how face down in the ground the aliens franchise of games have become, this is a classic.I haven't even mentioned the multiplayer, which is also for many a classic. Great game, stop being knob head and buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arguably the beginning of asymmetrical online FPS.Each class is varied and very different to play.The marine is a glass cannon, the Predator has to make smart choices about when and where to expend energy and is not as invulnerable as one would think and the Alien is nothing but a Tazmanian Devil of claws and teeth on speed.This game is hard...as it should be.  If a Xeno gets within 5 feet of you, you're done.  The way it should be.No meleeing the Predator or Alien...you just die quickly and pitifuly.The graphics do detract somewhat from the experience...but everything else was done very very well.Fans of the series...this is a no-brainer.Colonial Marines, are you listening?  This is how you do it.Now if only they'll put out AVP2 on Steam...			",93,9,1,2,8,0,11

The game has limited saves and is a decent challenge, though infinite saves can be enabled by typing -unlimitedsaves into the launch options of the games properties, though I recommend playing through using the saves the game gives you.Why are you looking at the reviews instead of playing it?

												AvP 2000 is a classic! This game is one of the scariest PC games ever made. You can play as any of the 3 races: Aliens, Predators, and human Space Marine. Each of the races plays completely different and each has their own strengths and weaknesses. The Predator is the most powerful of all, but is the slowest. If you want to make it scarier, play as a space marine or see how far you can last being an alien. I love sneaking around and eating people’s brains.The action is non-stop and when it does stop, it makes you nervous because usually that indicates that something is hiding or they are building up to come get you. This game is a pure adrenaline rush. You can play in 3 different difficulty settings, and each one is dramatically harder than the previous one. It’s so easy to die and that makes the game way challenging and in a good way!Overall verdict: Highly recommended!			",1959,695,76,191,209,15,283

												This is not the REAL Alien vs Predator 2000. This is a genitally mutilated version. They sensored some of the gore, making blood tiny on the floor instead of making big permanent spots. Also, it appears this is the ridiculous british version. The actors in the TV-screens are all different from the original American ones. There's a huge difference. The American ones for most part are good actors. The British ones act like they play dress up and are playing a kids game or something. It's extremely poorly made and acted out. Try to search torrent sites for the original uncut american version. That one is hardcore.This is pretty much one of my favorite games of all time and I notice huge difference. Here's a video that shows a lot of the differences:

												One of the best games of the late 90's and early 00's. AvP combines three unique playstyles in three full length campaigns.The missions will take you to different locations in the AvP universe, some of them taken from the films, some brand new. The general pacing and atmosphere is somewhat unique as enemy attacks and appearances are for the large part unscripted, and can change between playthroughs, which causes a sense of suspense as each play is a bit different. The level design is solid, item pickups are strategically placed so careful resoruce management is vital for survival. The combat is usually resolved at a break-neck speed, this combined with the dark design of the levels and a meager health supply can cause panic and a genuine sense of fear.Multiplayer is crazy fun, albeit somewhat unbalanced. While the campaigns are tailored to each race specifically the multiplayer just sort of mashes the three races together giving them some balance problems. Some weapons are too effective and essentially overpowered while some are useless completely. Fortunately weapons can be removed during the game setup eliminating some issues. Despite these objections, multiplayer is excellent in some aspects like, for example, some maps featuring destructible lighting as a tactical aid, wave style co-op mode and some interesting alternative play styles.The marine campaign and gameplay should be familiar to all FPS players, marines are the weakest and slowest of the trio but they make up for it with bristling firepower. Marine campaign is the most atmospheric and genuinely frightening of the three, walking around dark instalations, fending off waves of drones and facehuggers evading predators and generally surviving by the skin of your teeth.Predator campaign puts you in the shoes of a cold blooded space hunter, using a combination of melee weapons and high tech gadgets and devices to hunt your prey. Predators are the most beefy of the three able to shrug off alien claws and marine gunfire alike, however stealth and careful planning are paramount to a successful hunt. Predator campaign revolves around the hunt, from humans to exotic forms of the xenomorph.The alien is a terrifying killing machine. It can climb walls, cover 30 meters in a single pounce, smell its prey and destroy it with a combination of razor sharp claws, barbed tail or a powerful inner jaw. Since it posseses no ranged weapons the alien must stalk it's prey (not unlike the predator), isolate it and destroy it.			",77,1,1,10,7,0,40

												It's a really fun and authentic game that does a great job with the source material. I remember how excited I was when it first came. Playing as the Marine I was scared, playing as the Alien gave me motion sickness and playing as the Predator made me feel like a badass. Like all good old games from the 90ies should be, it's easily playable and cheap. If you're a fan of the Aliens or Predator films, this is a must buy.

												Alien versus Predator Classic 2000 is a first-person ""shooter"" made by Rebellion. As being both an Alien fan and a Predator fan, I bought this game having little to no knowledge about the game. My results... well let's take a look shall we:Pros:+Amazing Gameplay - Each character (Alien / Xenomorph, Colonial Marine, and Predator) has a different play style. Example: Xeno. = Stealth & Speed, Predator = Michael Bay everything, and Marine = Survival. This variety of gameplay makes the game more diverse gameplay-wise.+The Campaigns - The Campaigns are done very well. None of the Campaigns feel the same. It's almost like playing three games in one. Alien campaign = Alien: Isolation Xenomorph's point of view, 2. Marine campaign = What Aliens: Colonial Marines should've been, 3. Predator campaign = The perfect Predator game (Come on Terminator wheres your game)+Respect for the source material - The entire game respects the source material from both the Alien and Predator franchises. Locations like Fury 161 and LV-426 and weapons like the smart gun and the shoulder canon are faithfully recreated. +Facehuggers - Thats all I'm going to say...+Not made by Gearbox or Paul W.S. AndersonCons:- While playing as the Alien, the Alien's fast speed does cause the camera to go all over the place. This may cause motion sickness.-Level design may cause some confusion since there are no maps and some parts of some levels may look the same as other parts.-Objectives can be tedious as sometimes you may or may not know what to do / where to go. Objectives are given by messages that pop up on the top of the screen, but they can easily be missed.-Graphics have not aged that well, but their decent for the time. The graphics kind of look like Half-Life 1's graphics.Overall, (8.5/10) AVP Classic 2000 is a really good game. However, this game does have some flaws and is a bit challenging at times (but it can be completed if you have a lot of paitence). If your fine with the cons and are an Alien / Predator fan, then this game is for you.			",69,3,0,9,2,0,1

												This epic game is, in my opinion, the best game in the Alien and Predator series by a huge margin. Its single player storyline is nealy non-existent, but the levels are large and fun to play through, especially compared to modern hand holding ""corridor shooters"". Once the single player is completed, each species can unlock five bonus missions that enrich the single player experience by allowing that species to play on a level associated with one of the other two. On top of that, most of the single player missions (and bonus levels) have ""side missions"" that unlock single player cheat modes upon completion. These cheat modes allow you to alter your single player experience in various ways, such as setting your enemies on fire, turning the level upside down exc'.The cheat modes and bonus missions add a great deal of replayability to the game.Multiplayer wise, the game has a bunch of fun gaming options varying from the good old Deathmatch and Species Deathmatch to a Coop mode and even unique game types such as tag games and Last Man Standing.The multiplayer community for this game is still alive, but remains small and casual, which is a huge achievement in my opinion considering this game is 14 years old and managed to change 3 client softwares in that time.Most of the veteran players in this game know one another, and are generally open to newcomers, so the best way to get a game going is to join a community group and get to know some of the regulars.Due to the small amount of players, the scene is no longer competitive. However, the game does provide a high skill ceiling for those who seek a good challenge.Some of the weapons in this game are frowned upon by the community, such as the Predator Disc and Pistol, as well as the Marine Grenade Launcher and Skeeter Launcher, but they are also easy to disable when hosting games.To sum up, this game is definitely worth your 5$ (or less, if it is on sale), even if you are not an Alien/Predator fan. You will get your money's worth and more on the single player content alone.			",38,0,0,1,1,0,6

												I cant say much about this game but good things, in fact, the only bad things i can possibly say about this game are the sometimes confusing alien missions and maze like marine/pred missions, though with time, you get around that. This game isnt the best thing youll ever buy, but even by todays standards this is a really fun and good game, much better then aliens: colonial  Marines (total let down btw, never buy that game unless you have a lot of extra cash or are rich :/) Sure this game has its ups and downs, and it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics by the standards of today, but its still a kickass game which can be really fun if you join a MP(multyplayer) match. This game dosnt really have the best story line of all time either, as there is one person talking the whole game for all the missions (or two/three, i didnt pay attention to see if the dude on the monitors change ever, though i think its possible theres a diffrent guy on the monitor for the alien campain...). One thing this game does really well is set up atmisphere, especially for the marines who will offten be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ there pants on the campain (and sometimes even multyplayer) though rebellion seems to be able to do this in most its games anyway. Long review short this is a really fun game which you should buy, and with it being only 5 dollars, its cheap as hell, so even if you dont end up liking it, your not wasting a lot anyway.

												Yes this game is old, yes the graphics are dated, but that doesn't matter. This is an incredible game featuring an exquisite asymmetric gameplay. Being able to play as a space marine with an exorbitant amount of weapons, the ability to use a predator and their various armaments of destruction, and finally, the mighty alien. Each has different weapons and their own unique playstyle that'll acompany any player. And there is multiplayer, although it can be hard to find a game, if you simply start a game, players will trickle in over time. All in all, this is a game that deserves your time and is an oft-forgotten shooter that's legacy that has been muddled by two absurd movies, a disappointing game, and I do not have to say anything about Colonial Marines, do I?

												This has got to be one of the best value games on steam.  I'll make no bones about it, it hasn't aged well.  At all.  I mean it really feels like it's from 2000.  I played it when it first came out back in the day and loved it then.  I still love it now.  The campaign is where the aging is most noticable.  Instead of clear objectives given to you by actual NPCs and an over-arching story line, this is very much a series of ""levels"" where you have to ""get to the finish"", and objectives are, at best, given to you via some bloke on a wall-monitor (more typically just some text at the top of the screen).  For £3.00 though, multiplayer is where this game really shines.  Many different game modes provide lots of variation and the three-class system has been thoroughly explored.  While more hectic than AVP2, with a pace reminiscent of the original Unreal Tournament, there are moments of unbelievable atmoshpere which just come out of the woodwork.  For example ending up back to back with another marine at the bottom of a cave, neither of you speaks the other's language, yet you both play the most cooperative tactics you can dig out, because if you don't, you're ♥♥♥♥ing dead.  Or stalking another player as the alien, spotting them from across the map and closing in using cover, waiting 'til they're distracted by someone else and then ""boom!"" headbite.  It's a lot of fun and if you don't believe me, the price is low enough to not break the bank in finding out for yourself.			",115,10,16,17,25,1,17

PROS:+ awesome three campaigns+ great dark atmosphere+ good soundtrack+ cool gameplay+ intersecting storylines+ nice variety of weapons & attacksCONS:- outdated graphics- a couple of glitches- some minor AI bugs- not many people playing in mulitplayerComment:I played this game years ago and I really loved it. I was a fan of the Alien and Predator movies so this really liked the idea of an Alien vs. Predator game. The game itself is composed out of 3 campaigns for each species - humans, predators and aliens. Personally I would choose the colonial marines campaign as the best one. It is the longest one out of the three. Also it has that claustrophobic tensions and fear of what is going to happen when your motion sensor picks up something hurdling itself towards you while you look around looking for the spot where it will burst out of.  So while being the closest to the traditional FPS style it still is unique. The other 2 campaigns are excellent as well and play out totally differently. Predators have their gadgets and claw weapons. Aliens can walk on walls and claw/bite their way through everyone. Noteworthy for the alien campaign is that you get to go through the whole cycle - you start as an egg, hatch as a facehugger and continue until you are a full-grown alien. To this day I dare say there is not an Alien and/or Predator game better than this one (when it comes to single-player). The multiplayer was cool as well although nowadays not many people play it and the newer Alien/Predator titles have better MP in general. Overall a fantastic game worth recommending to anyone who like the genre or movies or just simply horror games.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Eight years ago, I played the living daylights out of AVP Gold Edition on my old (and still working) Windows 98. I remember playing alot of Skirmish mode and being terrified of Facehuggers (they still make me panic when I can't see them but still hear them). But that was in 2006. What's it like nowadays?Well it's still got that crappy low-budget 90s FPS feel and it's still better than AVP3 and A:CM.11/10 would get married to the Alien Queen again.			",22,1,0,0,1,0,0

												A classic in all regards. Not an easy game - but that just adds to its charm. It knows what it does well and plays to those strengths. It does look a little dated, but the gameplay is still top-notch.I still have my boxed copy of this game - and all the texture and sound mods I made for it back then. I dread to think of the amount of hours I lost in this one back in the day. This Steam ""restoration"" brings it all back and makes it playable again.Aliens are quick and deadly (as they should be), Predators are powerhouses and marines just try to survive. Scary, tense, difficult and simply great fun. The later AvP games (and Colonial Marines) simply couldn't capture the atmosphere that this game provided.Jimbo Rating: 9/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

AVP Classic 2000 = in order this is the first AvP game before 2 and 2010 (excluding the ones not on pc)REVIEW FOR NORMAL GAMEThis game was made a while ago, so dont expect much graphicly but if you enjoyed the AVP Movies or AVP 2010 you might like it, its a FPS that is like Counter-strike and also a bit like half life as well, you can play as the Marine, A predator and even an alien :)ENJOY!Alien - Underpowered (Has no weapons..just claws and tail, can climb too!)Predator - TOTALLY OP AS ♥♥♥♥! (has - wristblades, speargun, EXPLOSIVE PISTOL, Throwing disc Sholder-mounted cannon and medkit)Marine - Balenced but is op with mini-gun (Can equip - pistols, pulse rifle, smartgun, minigun, rpg, then a super rpg, i cant remember its name...)MINIGUN HAS AIMBOT!!!I'd give this about 6/10 for good gameplay but predator and marine are op, not to mention the multipayer is dead...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REDUX MODso this is a mod i got for it (one of the only ones too) it aims to improve the games graphics and has addons to do the same for other things like guns and skins, i do like the game but this mod makes it %1000000 times better graphicswise - get it for the best experiance (http://www.moddb.com/mods/aliens-versus-predator-classic-redux) | THE MODonly con with the redux mod is it makes your game crash more, being a conversion mod			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is an absolutely excellent game.This game (On normal mode) Is very challenging on all three species to play with. I personally enjoy the Marine missions the most, due to the terrifying atmosphere and fast, tight, and frantic First-Person-Shooter gameplay. This game doesn't rely on simple  jumpscares to be a scary game... it has real atmosphere. The Aliens are so smart and every time I hear one of their famous screeches... (nearby or far from me) I frantically spin around and search all over. (And believe me... when you turn around and unsuspectingly find an Alien behind you... it's a real treat. You'll fire your pulse rifle with such intensity... This game just really draws you in. If you (Like I was at first) are nervous about the game being too scary, just know that it still is a brilliant blend between an Action Packed First-Person-Shooter that even a real scaredy-cat like me can  enjoy this game thoroughly. The other campaigns are... you guessed it, GREAT. The Alien missions are all centered on some stealth and puzzle solving, and you will move at near BLINDING speeds, taking out anything that stands between you and the end of the level. I love being able to attack in a variety of ways, including lashing out your tail or slashing at your enemies with a swift scratch from your claws. The multiplayer with Aliens only is incredible. It gets really competitive as you dash toward your enemies... instincts set to kill. It feels awesome to overpower every marine (Or Predator for that matter) with the Xenomorph class.The third campaign, focused on the Predator is very focused on stealth (Turning invisible, sneaking up behind enemies, etc.) You have many ways to attack your enemies. This campaign is pretty great, you will feel very overpowered as you hack through your enemies. There are many fun to use gadgets to take out your enemies, and you can zoom in and snipe or just go all out close combat with your opponents. This class is really awesome to play with during multiplayer, always silent but deadly as the Predator class.This game really nails it's atmosphere, despite the somewhat dated graphics (Hey, it's from 1999-2000!) The sound is excellent and the dramatic music comes at just the right time to keep the game tense. This game was great for it's time... and still remains a classic that any fan of Aliens (Or any newcomers to the franchise) MUST pick up. At a very affordable price point of $4.99 this game offers so much, including Campaigns, Multiplayer, Survival Mode, and hours and hours of pure ALIEN FUN! I enthusiastically recommend this game. Now... I need to get back to work on fighting off hordes of Aliens...			",37,0,0,1,3,0,0

												Although a nice nostalgic feeling it's nothing compared to AvP2. Back in the day all I mostly played was Quake 3 Arena and Aliens Vs Predator 2 (Gold), two really great and fun to play FPS games (& yeah, my sister and I had already played Classic then). The new AvP looks nice but it lacks the finesse from the older game and AvP classic leaves a lot to be desired. Despite my feelings, Classic is still fun to play so I'll recommend it. Please consider putting AvP2 on Steam.			",67,16,0,9,14,0,7

												When i first purchased this game i sat down with the intention of playing it for 10-30 minutes max, 30 minutes passed and i found myseslf still playing, time passed and i found myself thinking i had perhaps just played the game for an hour or two. After checking my playtime i discovered i had just played Aliens versus Predator for 6 hours straight, i have yet to find another game that can make me sit for 6 hours without realising. Is the game good? Yes, the graphics are dated and there are a small number of glitches, however if you cant get past these problems then go and play more recent games, if you love the atmosphere of the aliens films and the predator films, you should definitely get this game. The multiplayer of this game is still great and although there are not many playing, those that do still play are a good bunch of gamers.I now plan to put in another 6 hours of gaming.

												This game is extremly fun, but playing on the harder difficulty is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. Imagine playing left for dead, and the zombies hordes constantly keep spawning and coming for you, and you have a snowballs chance in hell of actually killing a xenomorph without taking damage. Also in the alien campaign you can turn the corner AND IMMEDIATLY DIE. This is unacceptable. I think the game is worth a buy, and I'm not going to downvote it due to its unimaginable and incomprehisible difficulty on the later levels while on harder difficulties. I also want to point out that in order to unlock secret bonus missions, you need to win the game on varying difficuties. Meaning that whole sections of the game are unplayable unless you have no life and keep trying to win the hard missions over and over again, or you can use mods, if there are any out there.Also, just in case there is some smartass that has unlocked all the levels and claims it isn't hard, buy it and play it for yourself and you'll see that they are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'd like to point out the second to last marine mission, which even just on REALISTIC (the second hardest difficulty) hundreds of xenomorphs spawn. Don't get me wrong, the difficulty makes you feel that much better when you win the mission. I understand games are getting too easy, but I don't feel like I'm fighting xenomorph I feel like I'm fighting a bunch of heavy fisted sonic the hedgehogs dressed up as xenomorphs. Overall, it's worth a buy.One more thing though, I wouldn't recommend starting out with the alien mission, try playing marine missions or predator ones. Alien is a very hard campaign so it might not be the best to start there, even though when you first get the game it is oh so tempting to choose the path of the xeno. :) I hope this review was somewhat helpful			",58,5,0,20,3,0,3

												Although vintage, this extremely fun game allows you to be the hunter, or hunted. The alien playthrough is best if you wish to strike raw terror into the hearts of your helpless victims, and be a stealthy hunter. The predator playthrough is best if your desire is to completely rampage through your enemies, collecting skulls at you go. However, you can be stealthy with predator, all thanks to cloak. Predator is the best class for getting started, because of how strong he is. The marine playthrough is the most terrifying of all. You have no advantages and cannot sneak through your enemies. You only have some guns, flares, image intensifier, and, your head. Although a good game already, I wish they would do a graphics update. Also, you will need to look over all of the controls in order to figure out what does what. There is no cursor, but use the arrow keys(Or ASDW) to navigate between options while not in-game and enter to select them. Happy hunting, friends. Happy hunting...*evil laugh) >:)			",14,1,0,1,0,0,2

												Well, what to say about this classic? First off, it is really AWESOME to have been given the chance of playing as a Xenomorph (that is, the spooky Alien race). Beside that, there are two other factions to play with: the Predators and the Colonial Marines (it is the most uneasing for you are surrounded by extra-fast enemies who, evidently, want you dead). Excluding the dated graphics for clear reasons, it is close to other shooters of that time (say more a Quake than a Doom).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's been more than ten years since I last touched this game and I'm glad to notice it hasn't aged much; in fact, it's still clearly better than Colonial Marines. The game's map design seems bland at times in terms of details but the game relies so much on lighting and ambient sounds that often you don't even notice the blocky design. All three species are well represented: The Marine is a weakling facing overwhelming odds, the Predator a seasoned (but slow) veteran capable of one-hit killing Xenomorphs with his wristblades, and the Xenomorph (Alien) opens up routes beyond the reaches of humans & predators. The game's incredible speed may disorient at first but it really fits and makes the game more intense. One thing I particularly liked is how in those Marine & Predator maps where you face aliens you can never rely on being absolutely safe; waste too much time doing nothing and more aliens will spawn to come and get you. The game has its drawbacks such as its often confusing map layouts, especially in some of the Alien campaign maps, and the lack of a relevant story, but these are rather minor issues. Beaware; the game is harder on normal than the vast majority of games are on hard, and it's only made harder by the limited number of saves (four on normal) you get per level.			",136,9,4,8,3,0,11

												The old Aliens vs. Predator is one of games you remember. It was a game that broke the standard FPS mold and gave us a unique and innovative experience. The basic game is broken up into three unique campaigns, played from the different viewpoints of a Marine, a Xenomorph and a Predator. Each one with it's own unique perspective and abilities. The Marine plays much like your standard survival shooter. You walk down big empty corridors with your heart jumping out of your chest every time the motion sensor beeps. The Predator is like a beefed up marine with better weapons and the different vision modes we all remember from the movies. The alien gameplay however is where the game really shines. All of the sudden there is no up and down. No left and right. Everything is open when the maps become a myriad of ventilation shafts and shortcuts allowing you to sneak up on your unsuspecting prey. Nothing is linear when you can climb on the ceiling. A great game, even by today's standards.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												A great blast from the past with plenty of content to keep you busy for a while. Three whole campaigns from the three species, each with their own mechanics to master. And then, there's skirmish mode, pitting you up against infinite hordes of aliens to see how long you can survive. Plus, there's multiplayer.This game is worth far more than its listed price, you cannot go wrong with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 is one of my all-time favorite first person shooters. It does tremendous justice to the source material upon which it is based and is one of the finest examples of an excellent game based around movie licenses.The alien, predator, and marne campaigns all play very differently from one another. The strengths and weaknesses peculiar to each species really make the online multiplayer experience something special, although predators and marines do move absurdly fast during deathmatches. It seems like the developer was trying to balance movement between the species, but doing this by artificially speeding up marines and predators to move as quickly as aliens just seems wrong. Movement speeds are normal in skirmish matches, which I prefer to deathmatches.Although AVP's online netcode is peer-to-peer based, it is easily the best impementation of P2P netcode I have ever experienced. In fact, it consistently outperforms dedicated servers for other games - even when I play AVP with players from across the world while stationed in mainland China (which has some of the worst internet anywhere).There is still an online community for this game, and the regular players tend to be very down to earth and friendly. Unfortunately, you may encounter the odd cheater from time to time, but the Steam port allows you to set up private games with your friends. It would have been better if players were given tools to kick and ban cheaters from their games by way of vote, but considering how well native netcode was incorporated into a game this old, it's hard to complain about that (or the lack of native voicechat.)As great as the online experience is, it's hard for me to say enough positive things about the single player campaigns. While there is a very minimal sense of plot, you do feel like you have purpose to your actions and that all the carnage the unfolds does so for good reason.The atmosphere and tension in the game are incredible. When ambushed by aliens, you can easily die a sudden death. Aliens pose a very real threat to the player and do not strike exclusively during scripted sequences (like in the game's sequels). What that means is that you'll need to be on your toes at all times while playing this game. Its hard but fair, and that's the way I like it. AVP has treated me to some of the most startling moments I've ever experienced, and it's nice knowing that I can experience those kinds of moments again and again despite how much time I've spent enjoying the game.If you're going to play the alien campaign, be aware that the very first stage is probably the most difficult one you'll encounter. That's because is so easy to be nearly burned to death from the moment you encounter the first human carrying a molotov cocktail, and there are many of them throughout the stage. Not only are you very likely to be slowly incinerated by their concoctions if they are thrown anywhere in your general vacinity, but also if you kill a human who happens to be carrying one.As an alien, it's also very easy to get mowed down by stage 1's automated machine gun turrents unless you can find a way to sneak around them. A viable - but also very challenging - alternative to overcoming those obstacles is to crawl on ceilings and dart past the turrents at a 60 degree angle.It took me many, many replays before I was finally able to develop a good sense of how to overcome stage 1's cocktail-wielding humans and automated machine gun turrents. Had I known that you can enable unlimited saves by saving a command line in the game's launch options, I could have saved myself a lot of frustrating but strangely fun chalenge while trying to beat the first alien stage.While doing business abroad, I was able to play AVP perfectly with full settings on a friggin' netbook. Not even the original Doom or Heretic can run on that kind of hardware without occasional slowdown when launched with Zandronum or zDoom.In conclusion, AVP Classic 2000 is one of the very best puchases I have ever made, even though I owned the retail version of the game prior to buying the Steam port for convenient online multiplayer access. Get this game now, even if there is no discount at the time you are reading this review. The game is worth it, and then some. I tip my hat to Rebellion software for this great game.MY RATING FOR AVP CLASSIC 2000 (ACROSS VARIOUS KEY FACTORS):Graphics: 7.5 / 10. They were pretty good at the time of the game's release, and there are moments when the game's visuals still inspire awe, like the waterfall at the end of the predator's first stage.Sound: 10 / 10.Single-player content: 10 / 10.Online experience: 9.5 / 10. The native matchmaking system that was incorporated into the 'Classic 2000' port of the game is very good, and the game's netcode is - in my experience - unparalleled. Even though the netcode is P2P-based, it consistently outperformes many dedicated servers supporting other games. The main reason why the game doesn't get a perfect score in this category is because the absence of dedicated servers means that sometimes you have to wait a while until someone joins an online game that you host for lack of being able to find an online match to connect to. Other than incorporating native voice chat and giving players a voting system for banning cheaters / jerks / etc., there isn't much more that I could ask for from the game's excellent multiplayer component.Plot: 6 / 10. This is the game's weakest link. There really isn't much of a plot to the game, but there are videos that play on monitors as you progress through the single-player modes. You can ignore the videos if you like, but Rebellion deserves credit for incorporating these clips into the game without slowing it down for those who want to focus on action. To be fair, the game intended to showcase atmosphere over plot and really did a fine job in that regard. (It's like the original Quake, albeit with scripted FMV playback that gives purpose to new challenges you experience.)Gameplay: 10 / 10. Incredible! Play the game and experience the terror, the suspense, and the frantic action for yourself!Overall: 88 / 100			",108,11,2,1,4,1,0

Posted: December 15, 2015
												ooohhh the blissful childhood memories of this game. :)before going in depth I must say that this one even though it is a very old game with a grafic which most people would call ugly, then it is the one game installment who has caught the best atmosphere of the franchies and is the scariest one in the aliens versus predator series(especially playing as marine). And if you overlook the old grafic then you have a old gem right here :) but if you hate old grafic, then you will hate this game even though I would say it isn't that bad considered how old it is and the grafic isn't hurting your eyes which some old games tend to do XDAnd before reading more of this review, I haven't played the campaign all the way through so there might be some bits which I can't cover for you :)Aliens versus predator classic 2000 is a game which takes place in the aliens versus predator franchies, the mix of the best where in the middle humans(the marines) stands between aliens and the predators.In singleplayer you can choose to play one of either of these races - the alien who tries to kill and stop the invading humans - The predator who is trying to find his spaceship and hunting down the aliens and humans -  the marine who is trying to stop these species rampage on humans.Lets take the cons first - The grafic is old, yes noone can deny that. Will it hurt your eyes? no, but for many it would without any doubt be a turnoff.- The singleplayer game can be unfair, sometimes it doesn't really tell you directly what to do(especially in a few maps being the alien) therefore you sometime end up being frustrating and using a lot of time, but so far only a few maps.- This is both a con and a pro depended on which type of player you are, when you play a map, you can't save, so if you die, you have to redo the whole map.- Again this can be a con and a pro, the difficulty especially on director's cut, is hard, you can really sometimes die in a instant. - con and pro again: The game is really fast! If you look in the comment you will see comments about this game having a fast movement. you can as a marines run as fast backwards, from side to side as forward. This can confuse a lot of people but it create a really intense multiplayergame play XD- The texture of the maps, the walls, the floor and so on is quite repetitive, there isn't that many details of the texture in the maps themselves.Then there are the pros :)- This game is really true to the franchies with still some few ""artistic freedoms"" like in coop multiplayer as marines, they have created some ""red aliens"" which are much stronger than the normal black ones. So this is really for everyone who is a big sucker for aliens vs predator franchies:)- Even though it is old, the game engine for me has absolutely made no trouble for me.- Then there is the atmosphere. Even though I have played some of the later installments, I would say that they really didn't caught the horror/dark atmosphere which this franchies are, they seemed too ""bright"", too light. And I must say, it gives me the creeps being marines and walking around in the dark with your little bipping radar when suddenly there is movement on the screen moving closer towards you and the intens bipping :P- The multiplayer playing part is very very interesting, if you can find someone to play with. I would say it is very balanced and that none of the races really is stronger than the others because of the different weapons, different strategies and choices of play.- I also love that especially if you are playing the alien or predator, then you do in fact have different way of solving the map. You can go rampage and kill everything(which is damn hard on director's cut mode) or you can be stealthy, choose your prey wisely, and for the predator and marine save the ammo.- If you play all three of the singleplayer modes you will notice that some maps have parts you have played before as being another species, which gives a good feeling that the three singleplays do really take part in the same place.- Also I must praise the creators development of the aliens movements, it is really fluent, sometimes so fluent that you have no ♥♥♥♥ clue if you are crawling on the ceiling, the wall or the floor XD- As a first person shooting game I must say that it is really good with good variaties of weapons for both marines and the predator and strategies of the alien. Yeah the unrealistic high speed movement is something speciel for this game and which might turn people off, but I would just say that it is just a matter of time to accustom :) - And you can play as a predator XD for me thats a big pro XDSo yeah the conclusing is that if you love aliens vs predator franchies and you don't mind old grafic then you have a gem right here, not perfect but a good gem anyway :) but I would still say that if you have never really being in contact with the franchies both videogames, movies and comics, then you don't need some preknowledge to play this game :)			",141,41,5,7,18,1,25

												Like any good horror movie, you might be tempted to look, point and subsequently laugh at Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 whilst guffawing ""get a load of those rubbish special effects, who'd be scared of that?"". Well, if you do that, you are an ignorant fool. Notwithstanding this game introduced us to the first accurate representation of the Aliens genre, that being an experience that focused more on isolation, tension and near-blind encounters conducted at blinding speed, it was a step forward for games in general.Harken back to the year 2000, if you can. If you're 14 or under, this whole paragraph is probably pointless. Polygonal shooters are ugly and cartoonish, with true dynamic lighting rare. You've obviously (and rightfully) seen underage screenings of both the Aliens and Predator movies and you excitedly boot up a demo disc containing a sliver of gameplay from the much-anticipated Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 (back then it was just called Aliens versus Predator).You begin in a pitch-dark APC, the same one seen in the seminal 1986 movie, and instantly you feel a giddy sense of anticipation. You clutch the USCM's weapon of choice, an M41A Pulse Rifle. You scream to yourself, or aloud if feeling bold or just have no consideration for those in the next room, ""I am the ULTIMATE badass!"". It's dark outside the APC but you don't care. You stride out, eager to pump your enemy full of white lead (not a euphemism) and then it begins. Your motion sensor bleeps. You grin at the sound - it's just like in the movie!Then an alien shows up and you die.Now, bear in mind at this point realism in games was restricted to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six - which your childish mind was not prepared for in 1998 and the disc was subsequently left to reside somewhere under the bed - and you can understand the terror this Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 (Aliens versus Predator back then) demo generated. Aliens and Predators, unless played on the Training difficulty, are fast and deadly. Light is scarcer and arguably more valuable than ammo. Your armour may stop a few bullets but against razor-sharp claws and shoulder cannons? Might as well wear Kleenex, mate.The single-player campaign features six missions in three distinct flavours. The marine, despite having access to meaty weapons and a sharp haircut, is undoubtedly the most vulnerable of the three. Your xenomorph enemies move swiftly and often you've only got a couple of seconds to react - usually to a telltale hiss, scratch or bite to the head - before you become their food. Add to this the facehuggers, whose surprise one-hit kills have induced fear-comas in the stoutest gents, and you can see the developer's statement of intent. In this game, humans are the prey.As a Predator, you have access to deliciously effective weapons and equipment. Injured? No sweat. Just whip out your pointy healy-sticks and one agonised scream later, you're ready to go. Naturally, your human opponents are just flimsy, sweaty meatbags in the face of your cloaking-device enhanced magnificence. Properly ambushed, you can exploded them with your shoulder cannon, impale them with your spear gun or give them a good old Carl Weathers-style send off with your wrist blades. Xenomorphs prove a slightly tougher challenge but with your enhanced vision modes (which, like the Mass Effect 3 ending, come in red, green and blue flavours), superior endurance and aforementioned healy-sticks, your chances are a sight better than as a marine. Facehuggers are still cheap, insta-killing little ♥♥♥♥♥, though.The true beauty of the game, however comes in the shape of the late H.R Giger's chillingly graceful alien killing machines. Or rather, taking control of one. My personal favourite game mode and a real change to the pace of the campaign, the Alien can dismember humans with the flick of a wrist, walk on any surface and providing it's sitting in darkness, can become near-invisible to enemies. While this is disorienting at first, there's a true pleasure in carving up everyone you come across before they can so much as react, or stalking that particularly annoying marine from the ceiling before dropping on him unawares.Being from the year 2000 (the flashback to that year ended a few paragraphs ago), the game does look its age. Polygons are smooth but the textures are a little muddy, but the Steam version runs well on Windows 7 and at resolutions we'd never thought possible 14 years ago. There are even an additional 5 or 6 missions for each character to be unlocked after finishing the game on each difficulty. The sounds are all accurate and pertaining to their franchises, though for atmospheric purposes I'd recommend turning the music off altogether for the marine missions.The only truly inexcusable issue relates to the truly awful in-game cinematics. While the original release had a modestly-budgeted yet competently acted cut-scenes of a marine who was black yelling at you (or about you, in the case of the ETs), at some point they re-released the game with vids of fully costumed men who are white, with possibly the worst American accents this side of Gerard Butler. Yes, they look prettier but...well, just don't exit to desktop the first time you hear 'Lissen up Prahvat"".In summary, for anyone who knew and loved this game back in the days before bloom lighting and other graphical terms I can't be bothered to Google, pick it up and see for yourself how easy and forgiving modern games are. For everyone else, just pick it up and receive a masterclass in how an Aliens game should be done, i.e. with darkness, quick deaths and loud, piercing yelps of fear and shock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a classic. The graphics are a bit clunky but for the time that this game was released they were great. I am a die hard alien fan and I was not disappointed with the alien gameplay and levels. However, I did feel that the marine levels offered more entertainment as far as gameplay goes. There is just something about walking down a dark corridor and hearing that rythmic beep from your motion tracker. 4/5 stars for this gem!			",91,16,1,15,12,0,7

												????/10I gotta be honest with this one. Unless you played this game in the past, or just want to spend 5 bucks out of curiousity, I wouldn't recommend it. Older games can be very hit and miss with people, especally if its their first time playing one that they haven't played before. Im not saying this a bad game by any means, but the faster than hell ice skating gameplay combined with the late 90's type of graphics with the extremely cheesy voice acting, and the recycled enviroments kind of turned me off. It just got dull extremely fast. (Im not against older titles, i did play system shock 2 not to long ago for the first time and loved it, and the original unreal tournament has been one of my favorite games of all time since it came out. oh and half life 1 of course)  Also, Alien and Aliens are my 2 favorite movies of all time, but even that didn't help me to enjoy this. Again thats just my opinion, but if you don't mind spendin 5 bucks im sure it wont kill your bank account, I for one just didn't enjoy it, So with that all said i cant recommend a game that i personally did not enjoy.

												Aliens Versus Predator Classic 2000 was actually released in 1999 for the PC. You can play as one of three different campaigns, Predator, Alien, and the Colonial Marine.  Each has their own strengths and weaknesses and are all a lot of fun to play. Visually speaking, this game is showing it's age and can't really stand up graphically to the games coming out today; However, with that being said it is still a solid game. The Classic 2000 edition also comes with all the content of the original, as well as additional content added over the years both from the Gold Edition and the Millennium add-on pack. I spent many nights after work staying up until the wee hours of the morning, as I played through each of the three campaigns. From sniping enemies with the Predator, to crawling on ceilings and through ductwork as an alien, this game is still one of those titles I think about from time to time. I am glad to see it being rereleased to a new generation, whom I hope can appreciate it for the classic it is.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												So much more enjoyable than Colonial Marines and especially when it comes to fighting the Alien Queen, because for starters...you actually fight the Alien Queen, unlike CM where SPOILERS...you just moonwalk past her and pull a lever and she trips out the cargo door. SO INTENSE! The atmosphere, weapons, sound effects and alien AI is pretty good and respectful to the source. Not able to comment on all creature campaigns yet, but initially found the Alien one a bit tricky to get use to movement wise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is great, its like one massive nostalgia trip although its not as good as AVP2 its still a fun game (even better with redux mod). With 3 unique campaigns taking controll as a Predatior, Alien or my personal favorite Marine in a thilling experience to escape, hunt or survive. All the races have different playstyles that you have to master to become one of the greats. Graphic wise the game looks pretty dated (duh) with the having out of place cutscenes looking like they were shop with a buget of like $10 but the game makes up for it in the gameplay and bits of the sound department. The multiplayer is what you would expect with a bunch of maps and game modes with the best maps being LV426 and the Meat Factory and game modes being just the classic Spieces team deathmatch and the survival mode. Overall its pretty dated but still a fun ride, if you see it giv it a go. 70%			",93,4,0,11,3,1,10

												I am a fan of the Alien and Predator series, and I knew from previous experience I liked this game, its been out for a long time after all. Now Alien and Predator games more often than not are pretty terrible, its few and far between that we actually get a good one. I myself think this one is at least decent. It is old, and can be frustrating sometimes, but overall I feel it's worth it just to get to play a classic Aliens or Predator game that is not completely terrible. With three separate campaigns and multiple multiplayer modes, it makes for a game that I can enjoy. I even managed to find a game or two on this old sucker!			",374,144,14,85,57,11,89

												One of my favorite shooters of all time. I feel it holds up rather well.Be an Alien, a Human, or a Predator through the main game's Story Campaign, or Multiplayer.Each slice of the campaign gives you new reasons to fear, and it's a lot of fun. NOT FOR THE MOTION SICK. Playing an Alien, which allows you to crawl all over walls, might be too much.			",204,21,2,31,12,2,28

												I am a major fan of Alien vs Predator and it was great seeing an updated version on Steam that also works quite well on modern systems and Windows 10.Although I recommend this game, I have to admit that it felt really strange playing the game as it is incredibly fast paced and sometimes things do feel a bit clunky. Even though the game is fun, it is quite short too. You will spend a fair amount of time dying at first which lengthens the game, but once you get the hang of it levels end very quickly.Hoping AvP 2 will be released on Steam sometime as I consider that one to be my favourite.

												This is a fantastic game.  The single player Marine campaign on Director's Cut is very difficult but that's what I like.  It's intense.  Yes, I did play it when it was first realeased many years ago but it isn't just about the nostalgia. Apart from the new Alien : Isolation game, it is still much better than all the other Xenomorph games released. Such a bargain for 3 squid.   Multiplayer is great and has some interesting game modes.  People still play the multiplayer but just not enough for my liking.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Nothing makes me happier seen that this game is alive and well. I grew up on playing this game for years, especialy in a region where the games were very limited, expensive, and treasured. There is a widescreen resolution support for this and some people still duking it out in the multiplayer.If you are a sudden convert into the AVP franchise, don't even think. BUY IT NOW! The game is from 1999, it plays like a modern game with sufficient graphics and pretty beautiful lvl designs.One of the most stunning feature for me however, is this game changing difficulty system. You actually get more enemies the higher the difficulty is, and they are going to carry MUCH more powerful and different weaponry. +great sound design for ambience and the atmosphere.The only negative may perahps be that there is no clear-cut storyline like we are used to getting now. However, once you play it, you will understand that you don't really need it. This is not the point. It rather feels like the design is meant to simulate what it is like to be Alien, Predator, or Marine. And it sure makes you feel like a badass killing machine in all of them in completely different ways.			",161,8,2,10,8,0,27

												Played this game when I had an old desktop. It ran slow very slow and I never got to beat the game. Now I own a decent gaming laptop and it runs the game well. Playing it 1080p 60fps. The game has great horror elements especially the marine campaign pick that one first because it feels badass to kill an alien and a predator when you're just a regular human that is.. with big weapons			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the better games from this period. The three campaigns (marine, alien and predator) all have distinct playstyles and feels resulting for some interesting gameplay. The alien allows you to speed around and stealthily slice up your foes while the predator puts you in the position of a enormous tech-wielding badass, both of which are fun in their own way. Marine meanwhile plays almost like a horror game, the tense atmosphere and dark surroudings being peppered with aliens popping up out of every nook and cranny imaginable to terrifying effect. All three are highly enjoyable to run through, and may even be worth coming back to and going through again later on.			",175,50,0,13,5,1,16

												The gameplay feels surprisingly smooth for a game this old, maybe even more than the lastest AVP game, the game play feels way more balanced than the newer one, I can't really explain why. I really like the Tag games and I'm sad to see they didn't make it to the new one. It's a shame that nobody plays it online though, but the single player is still fun.If anyone wants to play this online, I'll happily join (unless I'm busy with something else of course).

												This is probably one of the best AVP games you'll find on the market. For 2-5 dollars it's really worth checking out if you can look over the outdated graphicsPros:*The game's atmosphere is terrifying and it reaches from dark corridors to open and dark temples*The Xenomorphs act very intelligent (Crawling up the ceiling,hiding in vents and corners etc.)*It's a rather challenging game that wants you to think of a strategy, just rushing through won't bring you far*3 campaigns in which you play as 1.)A Marine 2.)A ""Xenomorph"" 3.)A ""Predator""Cons:*Playing as a predator is a pain in the a**.(It's close combat but there's no way to be stealthy because the invisibility seems to work whenever it wants to)*The game's really dark, like it should be, but some areas really take it too far.*The game tells you what to do, finding your way and finding out how you're supposed to do that is up to you though, some people like it more if they give you more room to explore and to find stuff like that out but for me it was often too confusing.Overall it's an awesome experience and really worth checking out, Thanks for this cool game ""Rebellion""			",114,13,0,16,5,0,5

												AvP classic 2000 is an absolute masterpiece. A game that came out in 1999, got even better in 2000 with the Gold edition, featuring more multiplayer maps, and additional weapons. All of this can be yours for 5$. It's a steal for that price. The game is layered down in 3 campaigns, one for Alien, one for Marine and one for Predator. The game's graphics are dated, but in terms of atmosphere it surpasses a lot of current games, with smart use of lighting and some really nice environmental details. The game will keep you on your toes, specially if you play as marine. It's an oldie, but it will scare you and make you jump a few times. As an Alien, the campaign takes place at very high speeds, as you run through ceilings, floor and vents to ambush and kill your prey. Since it is a melee based specie, you have to rely on speed to survive. As a Predator you have access to a varied arsenal of weapons, some directly from the movies, and others never before seen, who are a real blast to use. As a Predator you have the possibilty to hunt your prey in close quarters, or from a distance, specially if you are hunting unaware humans. It is a lot of fun to play as the ultimate badass.If you are feeling brave, then by all means go through the Marine campaign. It is a tense, and really rewarding experience. Your weapons range from the classic Pulse Rifle, to double pistols to the Smartgun, plus a few other weapons. You really get the sense of isolation and dread when you play the Marine campaign. This game is a must buy to any self proclaimed Alien/Predator fan. It is fast, it is furious and it has no mercy. To those of you who think COD is the best competitive multiplayer experience out there (it isn't, it requires no skill), try this and cry as you realize how pathethic your skills are. This game won't hold your hand. It won't tell you what to do, or where to go. But what you get is an immensely gratifying experience you will likely never forget.

												Just a classic :) .By today's standards this game, of course, lacks something in graphics and, in my opinion at least, atmosphere.The balancing may seem a little non-existent but is kept realistic. Of course, a highly advanced alien race does more damage and more kills than a marine with a gun that still shoots metal projectiles. And in a world where everyone knows, you're there somewhere, and has nightvision or movement radar, obviously isn't that surprised or scared to be charged by an alien. You just have to teach them, that high-tech equipment and almost infinite healthpoint or infite torches to enlighten the entire room (and the room of the player with it), is not enough against cunning, patience and speed.The Predators do have the most easy game, but are still slow when it comes to changing or reloading weapons, they have to hit when they shoot. Just know what the other races can do and this game may still be balanced.The singleplayer lacks in ""good"" tasks, in my opinion. You always have to fight your way through some enemies, which can either kill with one shot (aliens need some tactics!) or not at all (predators are true tanks, aim well and own everything!). The alien campaign is the most fun one, because of this somewhat new feeling of being melee only in a world of ranged weapons.This game belonged to our top 5 LAN games some years ago and we played many hours scaring our friends with a suddenly dropped alien at the place where your partner was 2 seconds ago.

												AvP Classic, released in 1999 by Fox Interactive and developed by Rebellion, is a pinnacle of the first person shooter genre that even a decade and a half later still stands the test of time. This game marks the end of an age just prior to the new millenium console wars between Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. Before easter eggs and achievements and shiny objective markers guiding your way, you cursed a game as you first hugged the left wall of a level, and then right, all while furiously pressing 'e' and dodging enemies in the hopes of finding that last switch needed to progress to the next portion of the stage. What today's (dare I say 'spoiled'?) generation would call ""unfair"" was the standard for determining a gamer's true grit in times long past. Frustration wasn't just understandable, it was to be expected. Unfortunately times have changed, and more and more I find myself longing, and even romanticizing the memories of the new Title that caught my eye. Speaking of titles, AvP Classic is an excellent choice that tells you what you're getting. Aliens vs Predators (and yes, marines). But arguably most important, the game is a classic. Thanks to a re-release in 2000, and new age platforms such as Steam, we're able to relive these adventures on today's top of the line machines. I highly encourage anyone with a few spare bucks to give this critically acclaimed culmination the chance it deserves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Good-Three campaigns in one package; Alien, Predator and Marine-Terrifying Atmosphere-Amazing gameplay-Good selection of weapons as both the Predator and the Marine-Skirmish mode -MultiplayerThe Bad-Outdated visuals; Graphic junkies will likely pass on this masterpiece due to it's age-Small community for multiplayer games9/10			",178,3,6,3,4,0,2

												The classic old school Aliens vs Predator is back and now supports the gamepad (a.k.a. Wired Xbox 360 controller). There are 3 separate campaigns as you play the Alien, the Predator and the Marine. Skirmish mode where you kill waves and waves of Aliens kind of sucks considering it's only one map. However the campaigns are good and fun and after you beat them you unlock more bonus level depending on the difficulty when beating the game. So that is some replay value. Great game for a cheap price. Overall the game is good, but I feel Skirmish could of been WAY better if there was a map editor. I give this game a 7.5/10.			",1035,339,17,132,84,7,136

												One of the best ""Alien"" franchise games ever.  20 million times better than the travesty that was ""Colonial Marines"" *Shudders*I do have one complaint, however it is easily remedied.  There is a ""lean"" when you strafe left and right.  You can disable it through the console (you can google how to do that).  I have that disabled otherwise it leaves me nauseous LOL.  Also, when you use console commands it doesn't allow you to save so I recommend downloading a a completed profile here so you can choose which level to play individually.			",460,101,11,36,22,9,44

												Well, i'm not good at reviews (my first one), but still, I'll try to make you buy this game. It's cool, that it is on stem. It is mix of games types, for example Marine campaign is a horror game, where every noticed movement is makieng you to start being scared. I didn't played campiagn much, so i'll update this review with my feelings about campaign later.Multi in this game is alive, it's easy to find servers. Sometimes there aro no servers, but when you'll create one someone will definetly join soon. Multiplayer is hard. Some new players are easy to kill by experienced ones, but sometimes new player can be a hard opponent, killing really good players. I was such a player. I was really surprised when i was invited to join a tournament and even more surprised when i won it. But that wasn't easy. This game is really fast and you need to have good reflex. Ping may disturb a bit, but you don't need some cool internet to have chances. I have ~100 ping it's not too much toplay comfortable. Somehow this game has even elements of strategy. It's good to plan your movements, but you are not alway able to do it. Every character can be hard or easy to kill, all you need is just how to play with a specific character. For example i had 1 vs 1 with a player. I played as predator and he played as alien.  Score was something aroun 1200:150 for him. So the thing in multi is: skill, training and bit of a luck. Sometimes you can kill hard opponets, and sometimes die with easy ones. In multi you have few game types. Causual deatmatch all vs all, spieces deatmatch, where players that are playing with the same spiece should cooperate to destroy others, cooperative, where marines and predators are fighting together against aliens and some more. Every one will find something for yourself. This game contains a lot of fun, espacialy when you are playing with friends. I really recommend this game, it's worth to buy.			",34,1,0,2,1,0,3

												One of my all time favorite FPS games! The multiplayer used to be much more active than it is now, but the single player still makes this a worthy purchase. Very fun to play as the three different species. The alien and marine have the best single player gameplay. Playing as the hunter or the hunted has strong emotional differences in the way you react to the omnipresent danger.Do not expect jaw droping graphics. Do expect jaw dropping action!Watch one of my Let's Plays of this game here!

												If you consider buying this game you should know that the original game is from 1998 so this game is very old the graphics are outdated and this game also misses fetures from modern shooters of course, but this game haves some serios potential aniway the campaigns are fun but i consider them only a training where this game really shines is the multiplayer if you are lucky enough youll find a match if you have more luck you will find a big match and with even more luck you will find a match with awesome players that will help you get better and will tell you tips and tricks (im one of those persons) here some facts about the multiplayer- you should consider playing all the campaigns first to choose your favourite species before playing multiplayers as most of the players are very skilled-you need a game style ( in my opinion) if yoou want to be fast choose alien if you want to a challenge take marine or if you want to be badass take pred-the pred is a bit op in multiplayer because he haves almost only one hit weapons if you have a skilled pred player then you have some serios issues if you host a multiplayer game with the pred beeing avaiable you should lock the pred disc (for fairplay) and if you really hate it the pred pistol too-be friendly in the chat because there arent many players if you are unlucky the other player/s might leave and you are left alone and its hard to get some players if you are new into the game feel free to join my group its free for all and its called The new AVP GENERATION i or another one of us will be pleased to help you out and make you into a great challenge ingame we also make tournaments here is my opinion about the game if you are a fan of the avp series like chalenging multiplayer and dont have problems with the outdated graphics this is your game it is worth the money you pay for it and can be good funi give this game a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game thinking it was the same one as the gold edition that I kept seeing on youtube and stuff just you know...not the gold edition. However when I found out it wasn't I was kinda bummed out along with the fact that the Skirmish game mode is basically survival and you can't be a Xeno, but in the ennd it's still fun running through Hadley's hope doging jumping aliens as you slowly get your guts ripped out. Now the story mode I found is ok. I personally love seeing friendly NPC's get slaughtered but so far I have not seen a single friendly other then technically on the screens. In turn this might be a good thing seeing how some of the pathfinding for some things such as the aliens is not great at times (for instance when I was playing a skrimish match at least 6 aliens where on the floor above me but only one of the managed to actually get down to me which evetually gave me a new hole which more aliens could useas a hole for golf). All in all great original FPS game but the multiplayer option is there no one is ever on sadly so in my opinion unless you are a fan and like old FPS games I wouldn't not suggest this game.

However when I found out it wasn't I was kinda bummed out along with the fact that the Skirmish game mode is basically survival and you can't be a Xeno, but in the ennd it's still fun running through Hadley's hope doging jumping aliens as you slowly get your guts ripped out. Now the story mode I found is ok. I personally love seeing friendly NPC's get slaughtered but so far I have not seen a single friendly other then technically on the screens. In turn this might be a good thing seeing how some of the pathfinding for some things such as the aliens is not great at times (for instance when I was playing a skrimish match at least 6 aliens where on the floor above me but only one of the managed to actually get down to me which evetually gave me a new hole which more aliens could useas a hole for golf). All in all great original FPS game but the multiplayer option is there no one is ever on sadly so in my opinion unless you are a fan and like old FPS games I wouldn't not suggest this game.

												One of my all time favorite FPS games! The multiplayer used to be much more active than it is now, but the single player still makes this a worthy purchase. Very fun to play as the three different species. The alien and marine have the best single player gameplay. Playing as the hunter or the hunted has strong emotional differences in the way you react to the omnipresent danger.Do not expect jaw droping graphics. Do expect jaw dropping action!Watch one of my Let's Plays of this game here!

												Controlling the alien is as nausea inducing as my frequent moments of reflection on what it must be like to be a cat trapped in a washing machine. The predator does not often get chance to demonstrate his superior power and weaponry and the FPS shooting mechanics are so proverbially ancient that I have more fun playing  Unreal Tournament if I want to return to 1999 era muddy coloured VooDoo GFX powered shoot 'em ups.Either play AvP2 or the new AvP if you're desperate for your kicks.

												This is a *very* hesitant ""no"".AVP(1) is an old game, about half of which totally holds up, while the other half doesn't and in both cases it's for the same reason; it's designed based on somewhat antiquated principles. So, you have three campaigns; Alien/Xenomorph, Colonial Marine and Predator. The visuals were subpar even when the game came out in '99 and they're even worse now, but the atmosphere is top-notch. The game does a great job putting you into the shoes of each of its characters and properly making you feel like them. The marine is standard claustrophobic horror shooter where darkness is prevalent, the Predator is a proper killing machine pit against lesser species and the Xenomorph is rightly fast and stealthy and, well, alien. That's the half that works. The half that doesn't is that difficulty isn't balanced. There are handicaps against the player in all three campaigns; the Xenomorph may as well have the campaign renamed to ""Motion Sickness: The Game"", the Predator is a powerhouse, but its weapons suck (except for the shoulder-cannon; respect the shoulder cannon) and the Marine is a weaklink whose weapons feel like nerf pistols. The level design is often a confusing mess and the save system is a pain. When the game launched, there was no save system; they later implemented one, but it offers limited saves based on difficulty (8 for easy, 3 for normal, none for hard). On top of that, because of its age the game is prone to glitches, bugs and crashes. Let me tell you; there are few things more frustrating in this world than spending fifteen minutes gunning down Xenomorphs, only to be sent back to the last save (or the beginning of the level), because a sliding door accidentally killed you.See, despite all that, the game is still very enjoyable so many years later, but what tips the scale toward a moderate ""no"" is that the multiplayer is dead. The game doesn't support dedicated servers and unless you already know of people that play the game, you're out of luck. Ironically, considering this was launched with a campaign and the multiplayer was added later, it actually feels like a multiplayer game with a campaign tacked on as an afterthought. Part of this is that the campaigns are actually short (just hard to beat), but also simply the system that pits three different species with different strengths and weaknesses against one another. It's the Starcraft principle; it makes for balanced online play. So, here's the thing; if you have played the game before and you're a fan, this is still recommended. It's so cheap (especially during sales) that the nostalgia alone will keep you entertained. But if you're a newcomer looking for rich content, spend your money elsewhere, be it in its most recent sequel or the thematically-similar (but mechanically completely different) Natural Selection 2. Alternatively, get 5 copies on sale and share with friends for parties. That should work.Either way, do yourselves two favours: 1) Download mods for the thing. There are at least a couple that do wonders for the visuals and are worth your time. 2) If you do tackle the campaign(s), go to Launch Options and add ""-unlimitedsaves"" (without the brackets). You can imagine what that does.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you consider buying this game you should know that the original game is from 1998 so this game is very old the graphics are outdated and this game also misses fetures from modern shooters of course, but this game haves some serios potential aniway the campaigns are fun but i consider them only a training where this game really shines is the multiplayer if you are lucky enough youll find a match if you have more luck you will find a big match and with even more luck you will find a match with awesome players that will help you get better and will tell you tips and tricks (im one of those persons) here some facts about the multiplayer- you should consider playing all the campaigns first to choose your favourite species before playing multiplayers as most of the players are very skilled-you need a game style ( in my opinion) if yoou want to be fast choose alien if you want to a challenge take marine or if you want to be badass take pred-the pred is a bit op in multiplayer because he haves almost only one hit weapons if you have a skilled pred player then you have some serios issues if you host a multiplayer game with the pred beeing avaiable you should lock the pred disc (for fairplay) and if you really hate it the pred pistol too-be friendly in the chat because there arent many players if you are unlucky the other player/s might leave and you are left alone and its hard to get some players if you are new into the game feel free to join my group its free for all and its called The new AVP GENERATION i or another one of us will be pleased to help you out and make you into a great challenge ingame we also make tournaments here is my opinion about the game if you are a fan of the avp series like chalenging multiplayer and dont have problems with the outdated graphics this is your game it is worth the money you pay for it and can be good funi give this game a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A true classic that has a great single player campaign despite being an old game. The multiplayer is on the brink of exctinction but that is not surprising for a 15+ years old game, even though, its admirable that it is still being played by a handful of veterans every now and then. Highly recommended.			",437,97,29,58,44,7,64

												Ahh aliens vs pedators one of the most hardest games youll ever play, in this review i will be going over all 3 species in the game we will first start with the one that will actually win, The Predator the ""story"" is nonexistane but bassically you start out in an mountain? i havent readthe comics, anyways you brutally murder everyone or they brutally murder you the Predator has 3 weapons, The Wristblade for stealth, Spergun fun for hooking guys heads to the walls yes hooking men's heads to walls this game is brutal,the iconic Arm Cannon used to blow the entire top half of the body. The alien the campaign starts out with you in a temple? AGAIN i havent seen the movie The alien is fast and pretty snazzy it can stab people with its bladed tail bit heads off and scratch limbs off with your claws. The marines are basically a horror mode, The marines have a massive arsanel like machineguns miniguns rockt launchers bassically everything but they still get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>VERDICT: i have a lot of fun with this game and you should buy it its violent,vulgar and awsome			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While this game could once have been considered a fine title in the FPS genre with it's storyline and replay value with respect to being able to play as Marine, Predator or Alien; it unfortunately does not translate well to a modern computing platform.The low polygon and texture models will be rendered on moden hardware with alarming speed and in some instances make it difficult to interact with mission objects in the environment. We have moved on in terms of 3D rendered environments and I found the AvP 2000 world hard to interact with and become immersed in.However, there is still a charm to replaying this title but it won't last and you will find yourself losing interest rapidly.

												Having played the 2010 Alien vs. Predator game only and being a big fan of both series' (yes, even Resurrection, yes even Predator 2 and HELL yes even Alien 3 AND Prometheus, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it) I thought why not AVP Classic 2000. It's cheap, it's retro, and you know what? It's good too.I was surprised how similar the mechanics were to the enjoyable 2010 version, and the reason is, I believe, this game hit the nail right on the head with gameplay. You can choose from 3 campaigns: Marine, Xenomorph and Predator and each one is very very different. And what's more, it's challenging, which is great. With each character you play as you must adopt different strategies based on their strengths and weaknesses to successfully hunt each character you fight based on THEIR strengths and weaknesses. For example, as Predator, while you can tear through Marines, they can easily overwhelm you so you adopt stealth. But then, stealth won't work on a Xenomorph because they always know where you are. So you end up having to deploy about seven or eight different strategies across the game to beat your opponents. This is much more in-depth than I expected this game to be.Having said that, it still holds that arcade feel to it, you can pick it up and put it down whenever because the game knows what it is. Gruesome, stabby, shooty, sneaky, face-munching action. For a bit of meaningless fun for you movie-lovers, look no further.			",163,49,2,19,8,0,28

												Unique classic. The Alien and Predator campaigns are really fun, both give you the feeling of being both hunter and hunted while playing completely different. The Colonial Marine campaign is my favorite though because it is effectively scary; watch Alien and Aliens and then play this in the dark! The story, unfortunately, is mostly inferred, but it's there if you look hard enough. I definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises and don't mind dated graphics; I doubly recommend the Marine campaign if you're looking for a scary game.

												AVP Classic is quite a primitive game, even for FPS' of its time - you have some weapons and some poorly-lit hallways, and you must traverse said hallways using said weapons to kill your attackers, completing some minor objectives to open the path to the end. Simple as that. Half-Life came out a year or so before this, and unlike many games that then followed, AVP aschews almost all pretence of a narrative. In this way it feels like a darker, scarier Doom. It is a literal run-and-gun game, and incomparible to almost anything contemporary, even to it's own sequel, which is a vastly different experience.AVP is also brutally difficult, and requires the player to have fast reflexes while also keep their wits about them as the blaze through the corridors. Kill anything that moves, and kill it quick. This makes for a tense and frenetic game, and facehuggers whipping out of no-where to one-hit-kill me always makes me jump. This won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're migrating backwards from AVP2, hoping for more of the same. But with the few tools at its disposal, playing AVP is a uniquely exhilirating experience and rewards a skillful (and lucky) player with the few minutes of well-earned rest at the end of each level before the next one begins. I recommend this if you have a few bucks to spare and you're after a fast, simple, challenging FPS.			",286,54,2,37,37,0,28

												Highly recommended. Fast pace twitch arena shooter in the style of Quake of the original Doom games. The species are amazingly well balanced while retaining authenticity to their respective franchises. Each species has their unique play style and abilities. Aliens can climb any where and are very fast. It is best to strike out of the shadows. Predators has advanced weapons(very strong spear gun, and autolock shoulder canon) but their vision modes can only identify one species of the time unless using regular vision which does not support autolock. Marines can upgrade their arsenal a lot and are the closest to traditional FPS. Aliens can recuperate health by eating species they kill and Predators have a health inject but Predators cloaking, health, and shoulder canon operate on a battery supply. Definitely get it if you're a fan of either franchise. The campaigns are all unique and fun as well but it shines in multiplayer.			",106,95,0,19,2,0,4

												The game itself isn't terrible in the least. It's got good controls and an almost QUAKE style of movement where you can almost outrun the aliens without any serious impact on accuracy. This is very much an early 2000's shooter, and still retains the charm of games of the era while still being appreciable for the modern times.The problems come about when it comes to the story mode, primarily. The Marine is probably the best character with a wide array of weapons to choose from, very little platforming necessary, and with probably the minimal amount of save scumming required. The predator come second, because again, diverse weapons and limited platforming, but with the bonus of being able to cloak and use genuine stealth tactics appropriate for the early 2000s. But then comes the Alien. The xenomorph is undoubtedly one of the most unplayable characters, and this seems to be a trend among games featuring the Alien because platforming is a huge deal, which can be a problem. When you're a marine or a predator, you can find your way around because you're only limited to the floor. The alien, meanwhile, can go everywhere there's a surface, which means you'll spend a bunch of time crawling on walls and ceilings and ultimately end up lost without a walkthrough. While all the characters necessitate a walkthrough, because this did come from the age when video games hated telling the player things, it gets even worse when you can literally end up lost in the vents for a good thirty minutes going in circles at about 100 miles per hour.The combat is pretty solid for all characters. Enemies become easily detatched from their limbs, flames and explosions are catastrophic, and when you hit some dude with lazer forged wristblades he's not gonna have a good time. The marine is exclusively ranged, the alien is exclusively melee, and the predator contains a mix of the two.The graphics are actually pretty nice for a game made in 2000. Imagine Oblivion or Fallout 3 but with super primitive articulation. The textures can be a bit of a problem, as they never seem to mask when a wall or a floor is outright flat, making it especially hard to find a switch that just blends into the graphic. All in all, I'd recommend checking a playthrough of the game played in Skirmish mode before actually buying it. It'd be good to get on sale to try out, as it stands on the combat alone, but if you're going to do any of the stories make sure to have a walkthrough available because one can not be faulted for getting stuck in the story.

Kill anything that moves, and kill it quick. This makes for a tense and frenetic game, and facehuggers whipping out of no-where to one-hit-kill me always makes me jump. This won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're migrating backwards from AVP2, hoping for more of the same. But with the few tools at its disposal, playing AVP is a uniquely exhilirating experience and rewards a skillful (and lucky) player with the few minutes of well-earned rest at the end of each level before the next one begins. I recommend this if you have a few bucks to spare and you're after a fast, simple, challenging FPS.			",286,54,2,37,37,0,28

												Highly recommended. Fast pace twitch arena shooter in the style of Quake of the original Doom games. The species are amazingly well balanced while retaining authenticity to their respective franchises. Each species has their unique play style and abilities. Aliens can climb any where and are very fast. It is best to strike out of the shadows. Predators has advanced weapons(very strong spear gun, and autolock shoulder canon) but their vision modes can only identify one species of the time unless using regular vision which does not support autolock. Marines can upgrade their arsenal a lot and are the closest to traditional FPS. Aliens can recuperate health by eating species they kill and Predators have a health inject but Predators cloaking, health, and shoulder canon operate on a battery supply. Definitely get it if you're a fan of either franchise. The campaigns are all unique and fun as well but it shines in multiplayer.			",106,95,0,19,2,0,4

												AVP Classic is quite a primitive game, even for FPS' of its time - you have some weapons and some poorly-lit hallways, and you must traverse said hallways using said weapons to kill your attackers, completing some minor objectives to open the path to the end. Simple as that. Half-Life came out a year or so before this, and unlike many games that then followed, AVP aschews almost all pretence of a narrative. In this way it feels like a darker, scarier Doom. It is a literal run-and-gun game, and incomparible to almost anything contemporary, even to it's own sequel, which is a vastly different experience.AVP is also brutally difficult, and requires the player to have fast reflexes while also keep their wits about them as the blaze through the corridors.

												The game itself isn't terrible in the least. It's got good controls and an almost QUAKE style of movement where you can almost outrun the aliens without any serious impact on accuracy. This is very much an early 2000's shooter, and still retains the charm of games of the era while still being appreciable for the modern times.The problems come about when it comes to the story mode, primarily. The Marine is probably the best character with a wide array of weapons to choose from, very little platforming necessary, and with probably the minimal amount of save scumming required. The predator come second, because again, diverse weapons and limited platforming, but with the bonus of being able to cloak and use genuine stealth tactics appropriate for the early 2000s. But then comes the Alien. The xenomorph is undoubtedly one of the most unplayable characters, and this seems to be a trend among games featuring the Alien because platforming is a huge deal, which can be a problem. When you're a marine or a predator, you can find your way around because you're only limited to the floor. The alien, meanwhile, can go everywhere there's a surface, which means you'll spend a bunch of time crawling on walls and ceilings and ultimately end up lost without a walkthrough. While all the characters necessitate a walkthrough, because this did come from the age when video games hated telling the player things, it gets even worse when you can literally end up lost in the vents for a good thirty minutes going in circles at about 100 miles per hour.The combat is pretty solid for all characters. Enemies become easily detatched from their limbs, flames and explosions are catastrophic, and when you hit some dude with lazer forged wristblades he's not gonna have a good time. The marine is exclusively ranged, the alien is exclusively melee, and the predator contains a mix of the two.The graphics are actually pretty nice for a game made in 2000. Imagine Oblivion or Fallout 3 but with super primitive articulation. The textures can be a bit of a problem, as they never seem to mask when a wall or a floor is outright flat, making it especially hard to find a switch that just blends into the graphic. All in all, I'd recommend checking a playthrough of the game played in Skirmish mode before actually buying it. It'd be good to get on sale to try out, as it stands on the combat alone, but if you're going to do any of the stories make sure to have a walkthrough available because one can not be faulted for getting stuck in the story.

												This is the only game which captures the atmosphere of the Aliens and the Predator films. The graphics have dated. The sound effects are still good - very faithful SFX. Gameplay wise, it is still a genuinely scary experience to play this game. You feel vulnerable and weak as a Marine even with a pulse rifle. When an Alien you have little to fear except the portable sentry guns and can eat folks. Playing as the predator is best. Locking on to an enemy with the shoulder cannon is most fab -> boop... boop... boop... Fwap! Typically your foe explodes. Beware the acid blood.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unique classic. The Alien and Predator campaigns are really fun, both give you the feeling of being both hunter and hunted while playing completely different. The Colonial Marine campaign is my favorite though because it is effectively scary; watch Alien and Aliens and then play this in the dark! The story, unfortunately, is mostly inferred, but it's there if you look hard enough. I definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises and don't mind dated graphics; I doubly recommend the Marine campaign if you're looking for a scary game.

												You ever come across something once in your life where you feel you need to play, watch, listen to, or read but find something along those same lines which is absolutely better than what you found in the first place? This has happened to me several times. Meshuggah with their Obzen album and then finding their Destroy Erase Improve album, deep and engrossing anime with Neon Genesis Evangelion and then Serial Experiments Lain, the Rainbow Six series with Lockdown & Critical Hour and then Rogue Spear and Raven Shield, things like that.The biggest example would be the Alien Vs. Predator movie, and then exploring both series' previous movies because I loved the creature design so much. As a kid in 5th grade, I watched the original Predator movie (GET TO THE CHOPPAH!!!!) and it absolutely blew me away. I had never seen anything like it and it really blew AVP out of the water. Then I watched the original Alien movie on VHS (It was at a yard sale for god's sake!) and again I was blown away. It was a good thrill and I found out why people hated AVP and AVPR so much.But alas, AVP would soon get a second chance. I found out that there was a video game coming out called Aliens Vs. Predator and that it would be coming out on a bunch of platforms. Xbox 360, PS3, and this new thing called OnLive. I tried it out for the first time at my sister's house, my nephews owned the game, and I was blown away again (Okay I'm easy to please when it comes to Sci-Fi. :P)! I finally got to play as these deadly creatures, and a human soldier, and I would be playing through a story which is played out through three separate campaigns. I had to own this game immediately!Then...time passed. I never got to own the game. Hell, I still don't own it. What I DID stumble upon though was that there were already quite a few AVP games that were released throughout the years. Knowing I had already stumbled upon a bunch of awesome classic shooters before, I decided to try this AVP game out. Holy...f***ing...sh*t. This game right here makes the 2010 AVP look like Call Of Duty. This game is a freaking blast. I'm not even joking when I say that this game needs to be in everyone's collection. It's THAT good. Now I know what you're asking, why do you think this game is so good when the other AVP game you checked out before was more recent. Well, let me tell you why.Alright so story...uh...well...I'm not really sure what the story is. It does have three campaigns though, so I will tell you all I really know. As the Colonial Marine, I guess there's a Xenomorph embryo inside you, so I guess you're looking for some way to get it out of you I never really beat the game, which I will get to in a moment, but guessing by the whole embryo thing, Weyland-Yutani is probably going to use it for research. With the Alien, I guess your location has been violated by the Marines, not really surprising, and you gotta get them out. Predator...I'm not sure what he's doing there. Okay sure I'll be honest. The story is garbage, but whatever. Who plays these kinds of games for the story, anyway?Okay so as I've said, the game contains three separate campaigns, one for each creature, so how do they play? Exactly how they do in the movies. With the Colonial Marine, you pretty much go around shooting the crap out of the Xenomorphs, which literally come out of the god damn walls, and also shooting up Predators, which have no time to bleed. With the Xenos, it's all about causing as much mayhem as possible. You not only have his claws, but also the signature tail. Not only that, but you can use the infamous bite when sneaking up on foes. With the Predator, it's just like in the movies. You HAVE to use stealth. Luckily, you have all of the Predator's weapons at your disposal. From the shoulder cannons to the wrist blades, you are sure to have a good time.There are a few problems I have with the game though. One of my biggest complaints is...it's a little too dark. Like yeah, I can understand going for suspense, but because the game is supposed to be a classic shooter like Quake or Doom, this really doesn't fit. I know there are vision modes for both the Xenos and the Marines, but, at least in the Marine's case, there are moments where in the dark the lights are pretty dim, but they are blinding in night-vision mode. Another problem I have is the difficulty. There are some REALLY cheap deaths on the higher difficulties. I can barely get through a level without swearing at least once. Luckily, however, there is an unlimited save feature exclusive to Classic 2000, albiet via command, that makes this game a bit easier. If you are a fan of a challenge like this, buy it.My other problem with this is the multiplayer. Well it's not really the game's fault, but it's really...empty. There's no excuse for it being this empty either. Rebellion made sure that in this re-release that this game would be compatible with not only Steam players, but GOG players! Why is nobody playing? Come on! This game is amazing! I know it's a nearly 20-year-old game, but it's no excuse. Quake III and Unreal Tournament still have people playing, so there's no reason as to why this game doesn't!But overall, the reason you should get this game, even with its small annoyances, is how well this game really emulates the feeling the movies have with the three species you play as. With the marine, you really do need to kill or you will be killed. With the Xenomorph, you need to stay in the shadows while at the same time making humans your prey. With the Predator, you need to stay invisible and kill the humans stealthily or you will be shot. This game is amazing. If you are a fan of either the Alien franchise, the Predator franchise, or even both, you need to add this game to your collection.And please, play some multiplayer. This game needs some love.

												A game straight from my childhood. Even my avatar has ties to this game, which used a community called MPlayer for multiplayer. That's not important though.AVP, AVP Gold, AVP Classic, whatever you call it, this game is what started the AVP multiplayer franchise. It is the original and the best. The single player campaign is not dissimilar to other shooters from the era, where you were given an objective at the beginning of the game and no true waypoints. You are left to explore the area and kill everything that moves. It has several references to the films, including the pilot ship from the original Alien/Aliens movie.Multiplayer is a different beast. The multiplayer consumed my life for years and began my path to become a gamer. Super fast-paced action across dozens of maps ranging from Species Death Match and Death Match to Cooperative. Each species had its own perks, strengths to overpower your opponents and weaknesses you needed to minimize in order to not die. The whole game was fantastic, with brilliant maps from the Subway mimicing the Predator 2 movie, to the LV-426 complex and the Nostromo from the Alien franchise. Sounds ripped straight from the movies were used in the game making it feel more like the creatures from the movies.Pros:Fast-paced actionSimple game modesGreat map designsEaster eggs which reference the movies from both franchisesEasily played even on old machinesCan disable certain weapons if you don't want them used in MultiplayerCons:Dated game, few players will be present for multiplayer if any at allMay be too fast for modern gamersDated graphics (This game was from 2000 after all, not really a true con, but may be a turn off to players)Almost no storyDepends on local hosts, no servers ",179,10,0,21,20,0,7

												The game really needs a checkpoint system, and a menu to refer to for the mission perameters that you probably won't remember because they get flashed through too quickly. It also needs some mele action,to combat those aliens that move impossibly too fast, and can come from any angle . Why are you only allowed seven or eight saves for the whole game ??? Why do you expect players to speed read off the screen ??? Why do the aliens move quicker than they do in the movie ??? I often wonder if the companies that hire people to test games only hire ""YES MEN"" .  But for $5, it's O.K. ...			",161,13,4,29,4,0,19

												This game is a lot of fun. There are three classes and each class has different abilities that can be used in each campaign respectively. In the marine campaign, however, you'll die from facehuggers over and over again. The multiplayer is probably the best feature in the game, if you can find a match.			",161,32,1,13,10,4,15

												A first person shooter. Designers and fans call this game ""classic"", but the truth is that, in his days and long before, there was many better games of this genre. Has a ugly and poor ambientation, bad lighting effects, and graphics have an excessive speed by a wrong adaptation from original, and all can be seen very quickly. Alien Trilogy, published 3 or 4 years before, are better in many ways. Maybe is fun on multiplayer, but only recomended for nostalgic fans that hate reviews like this one.			",308,48,0,52,30,1,96

If you have ever seen Alien you will know the motion sensor radar really creates some of the most tense moments and the way the aliens move and attack is spine shilling alone.

												Aliens versus predator classic 2000 is a great game for anyone who is a fan of the alien and predator franchise. You get to play 3 campaign modes: The Alien, the predator and the colonial marine. The campaign mode has a somewhat hard difficulty so prepare to be mercilessly slaughtered over and over again. The game fails to provide the player with any checkpoints throughout the levels in the campaigns resulting in you having to replay levels from the start if you dieApart from the campaign mode there is also a skirmish gamemode in which you can fight off infinite  hordes of aliens playing as either a Colonial marine or a predator in iconic maps such as Hadley's hope and the derelict ship.Unlike Aliens vs predator 3 there are no brightness issues with this game and when you do come across a dark corridor or room you have an unlimited amount of flares at your disposal as well as night vision.There are a some bugs present such as the water spazzing out but considering this game game out in 2000 the graphics hold up for the time and you won't be disappointed (hopefully!) There is also a multiplayer mode however  there are very few servers up and running but when there is a server with a substantial number of people playing it can be a very fun and intense experience. In the game you can find a good variety of weapons including the iconic Pulse rifle, Smart gun and flamethrower as well as duel wield pistols and rocket launchers.Being a big fan of the Alien and Predator franchise I enjoyed this game and recommend it to other fans of the films			",152,26,1,5,8,1,6

												Perfect marriage of fast based shooter combat with actual horror. Only problem is how ridicuously frustrating finding any damn thing is. Seriously, look up some of the levels on YouTube, they take like four minutes when you know where to go. Levels are such unintuitive mazes. Luckily the skirmish mode doesn't have that problem, and is hours of alien blasting fun.			",87,9,2,2,1,0,2

												Does this game hold up? You bet your ugly dogface. I think in many ways this is a better game than the sequel. Interesting and effective lighting, authentic sound from the films, faithful weapons, gear and abilities provide three very different and intense action experiences. Sure, it won't win any Oscars, but it puts me into the role better than the very solid sequel from Monolith. I think it's the fact that it doesn't assign too much importance to the story, but instead concentrates on incredible tension and action sequences.			",961,222,15,134,84,5,161

												A game that does very well what it promises: 3 different campaign, where gameplay is very tense and suits each character, specially as the marine (as it should). But just no more than that.BTW, you can't reload your weapons. And you can destroy your items by accident if you're not careful with explosives. Can be very hostile, but I wouldn't change that.

												Review changed on 9th January 2017:My review is positive, but it regards AvP Classic as a retro release, thus what speaks for the benefit is nostalgia. The game plays fine, especially on multiplayer. Singleplayer has some decent innovations for the time AvP Classic was released, but on the longer run it fails to keep ones sentiment up with any capturing narrative. It is just a jumpscary science-fiction horror with very dynamic first person shooting combat. Once you get it done, you forget about it. Nothing else really to hold the attraction, especially when market competition is fierce. Therefore, if you play it, you love it, if it is over - unless you have a special inclination towards the Classic, for example due to being a top notch multiplayer participant, having drowned hundreds of hours into the play - you are likely to never return to it again.All in all, the game is a mediocre release nowadays in the category of retro shooters, just an inexpensive buy-and-try, then move on. Score is 6/10 wHATs grade. Solid piece of gaming history which has only partially stood the test of time, but also a classic of the Aliens franchise. It has a small but dedicated STEAM community, nevertheless online matches - even and especially if they gather a higher number of players - are considered luxury.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aliens vs Predator...Loved the 2010 version so i thought the 2000 one had to be good as well right? Right? Well... No just no i have bearly played two missions in the Marine campaign between little to no indication where to go or what to do and the Xenos that spawn right infront of you scaring the daylights out of you dark enclosed areas oh and did i forget to mention you dont run in this game you ice skate cant tell you how many times i have accidently jumped off of a part becuase my character wanted to be a ballerina. The elevators look pretty much the same as any other part of the level and all these twist and turns hard to even figure which way to go. I understand if others like this game no idea how but its just no for me havent even tried the Predator or Alien campaign to save myself the embarrassment. Oh and did i forget to mention? One mess up one screw up and you die...You have to start the entire level all over again.			",79,1,0,3,9,0,15

If this was your jam, then you'll definitely want to get the 3GB ""Redux"" mod that enhances all the graphics and other elements drastically. No downside to it.

												Bought this game after playing the Alien campaign on Aliens Vs Predators and honestly I don't know what to say. I've never played this around the time it was released so I don't have fond memories of nostalgia to excuse this, it certainly would have been a good play around the time but if you're going into it new I can't recommend. Graphics have certainly not aged well, sounds are laughable and interface is clunky. Don't get me wrong it has a charm to it and for the time I'm sure it was excellent but uh... if you haven't played an aliens game before this isn't really the place to start.Still it's only five dollars or even less if you get it on sale, I'd give this more of a neutral review rather then negative. It's not a bad game really, I just personally can't stand it.			",60,21,0,7,11,0,3

												I really tried to like this game and i do respect it more than the 2010 AVP because its a longer game, the marine gets more weapons, the predator gets more weapons and vision modes and the level design for the alien campaign was more organic but the controls are slippy and i shouldnt need to sheck a walkthrough every two secends to find my way out of every room. The controles of AVP 3 combined with the more ambition intention of this would make for a lot of fun but as it stands i can't really reccomend.			",33,10,0,10,6,0,5

												now before everyone disregards this review just because it is negative than let me just explain one thing. This review is going to apeal to blind people who have never even heard of this game before and maby just had played the remake and that is just as far as the knowledge level will go, if this was a review based on if I think this game is good overall than this would defiently be a positive review. to sum it up, this review is based off the impression it gives new players who don't have nostalgia and only played five minutes of it so the complaints are going to seem very newbish.good+you can't say the graphics exactly look bad because lets be honest try to go into3d design back then and make it look good.+story, enough said.+all three species seem very balanced and feellike the devs have really though about how to makethe marine not totally useless or over powered, excepttwo very over powered weapons.+the setting is awesome, enough said.+smart gun, oh yeagh.The bad:-the controls need alot of getting used to.-not comparing the predator to the spy fromTF2, but how the cloak only works when it wants toeven if that blue thing on the left is as full as itwill go.-the alien's night vision looks like crap no matterhow nick picky that may seem.-that one lovely sound and screen effect that playswhile you're on fire.-molotovs and flamethrowers. one molotov/flamethrowerblast = %50 to %60 health gone when playing the alienassuming you had full health.-pacing seems to happen very abruptly.-I know there are such things as steam groups in thecommunity but other than that the multiplayer is dead,game-over man game-over.-even if the multiplayer was not dead than good luckfinding a server you like to specifically go on, thatsright no server list.

												After buying this game and playing it for an while. I can confim that this game is bad.You right now: ""Oh Skinny! What/How do you mean by ""bad""? It's an great game!""First off, Yes, this is an ♥♥♥♥ing great game. I ♥♥♥♥ing love aliens to death. I remember watching all most all of the movies with my father when I was 5 years old, but there comes an time when an game you  THINK is great and all is just not what you think. You get me?When I started it up, I was happy that I got it for an low price.  I also brought Spore and FNAF for my sister so she can fu- I mean stop bugging me about it  The game sadly had no training, nothing saying what does this and that. I was able to choose what to play as: Predator, Ailen, and don't forget: Marines [ A.k.a Humans ]. So when I got on one of the campains I didn't know what to do. I tried to look around and find an way/path that can lead me to my goal. Nothing. Then all of an sudden, the game crashed. It started flashing my desktop backround and then into an black screen. I thought that it was just something that was an tiny problem so I turned my computer off and then turned it back on. More then about 3 times it did that same problem. I tried all 3 campains and it ran into the same problem each time. I do recommend this game, but if you have an bad computer or system then don't buy it.			",19,2,0,2,4,0,1

												Yeeaaaaahhh..... I want to like it. I really do. I love the movies (well, the first ones anyhow), and I got this for free from selling cards, so maybe I shouldn't complain, but I feel like it was a waste even then. Lemme talk it through:There are three characters to play. Yeah, so far that's the only cool part of this for me. There's the Alien, the Predator, and the human Soldier. The soldier was the easiest to play. He was the only one that didn't have a bunch of weird and confusing controls and HUD. Not necessarily that he didn't have any work put into him. Actually I think it's good they left him so simple, otherwise he would be just as confusing and/or difficult to play as the others. He's just the basic soldier-y character, and was fun to play for a few minutes. The Alien is the one you want to immediately jump to playing, naturally. What cooler character to be than an all-powerful alien crawling on ceilings and ripping apart humans. Except he can't. The crawling is hard because of his super-weird, eye-throbbing x-ray but not-x-ray vision. AND, no matter how hard I try, as soon as I'm seen by humans, they start shooting, and I have five seconds to panic, try to fight, and then die. I don't get it. He's more annoying to play than anything.The Predator. I really, really thought I was going to enjoy being a super-strong, armored alien. But... he's really, really confusing, and hard to play. Now, there's the expected problems, because of the game being a tiny bit older. Jumping can be tricky, and turning and discriminating a black alien from a low-res brown wall can be a pain, but manageable. But then add a weird hieroglyphic power system, a slew of different weird weapons, and did I mention the power system?, all together makes for a mess of a hard-to-play extra-terrestrial. So yeah, there's the problems with it being a bit old. But it's not that, it's the weird gameplay mechanics, poor design choices, and over-use of things that older games have obvious problems with anyways that really makes this a hard game to enjoy. I think they put more time into making it about three characters than making each character a good one. If it had JUST been the Alien to play, and they put all the effort on the one rather than three different characters, it would've been way better. I actually do kind of like it, but there's just poor choices here. 6/10, 'cause I wanna like it, but still, not Recommended			",146,18,2,3,4,0,3

												Overall 2/5I have a lot of fond memories of this game. The first time I ever upgraded a computer, it was to play this game. There’s a lot of nostalgia that goes along with this game for me. There isn’t much to the game itself, a straight forward shooter for the most part. The levels tend to be somewhat bland, and undecorated (tunnel after tunnel). There are a lot of fun weapons, and abilities throughout the game, as well as “exploit” unlocks after you finish the game under certain conditions. Really, the only reason to buy this is if you played it during original release, or are a massive fan of the genre.			",104,7,1,5,0,2,0

The controls are awful, over-sensetive and cannot be throttled back, the menus don't even allow for mouse navigation, changing options is itself more time consuming than the actual gameplay...

												RATING: 6/10Aliens Versus Predator: Classic 2000 is exactly how it sounds. It's a reenvisioned version of the first AVP game with an enhanced engine and intuitive combat. The xenomorph and predator designs are beautiful despite the aged graphics.THE GOOD:The game does a stellar job of showing off the ferocity of the iconic xenomorphs. However, they don't seem as threateningly intelligent as those in the movies. Most of the time, they simply rush at you heedlessly and are little more than average cannon fodder for those weilding a pulse rifle. Combat controls are responsive and easy to handle, and a wide range of weaponry and attacks are available to each class.THE BAD:The bad part is the story, which truly killed it. Although the level design is good, the storyline in itself is horrendous. In fact, I didn't even know what the story was for any of the campaigns. All I know is that some fat guy on the televisions was telling me where to go and what to do, which was basically kill this, kill that, get here and complete the level. Another demoralizng part is the fact that each campaign starts and ends with a beautifully detailed CGI cutscene, but then immediatey transitions into the hideous textures of the actual game. The lack of direction as to what you should do forces players to save constantly, as you will inevitably see many cheap deaths in each campaign. Not even the extra levels beyond the main campaign are very good, as they have little to no dialogue and just give you an extra gun or a jetpack to shoot more xenomorphs. As no one ever plays the multiplayer, I can't say anything for that, and every time I try to play the other game modes, it doesn't load, which is odd considering that I have a very good computer. The part that annoyed me the most, however, was the terrible musical score, which was just annoying and nonsensical.VERDICT:If you're a fan of the xenomorphs or the predators, then you may enjoy this game. But if you like story, prepare for frustration, because this game has none. Graphics are hideous in comparison to other games made in this era and the enemy AI are simply stupid and kill you in cheap ways. Overall, you aren't missing anything by not playing this game.

BUT!!!! the marine campaign is frustrating as all get up.You know somthing is wrong when your motion tracker picks up every little moving thing, this includes things like stationary fans, lifts, and dead alien bodies that arent moving? (they havent finshed their dying animation TT_TT) its almost pointless to look at the motion tracker, cause by the time you look down at it an alien will already be hacking at yo shins. OH! and did I mention this game is fast.. like rocket rollerskates on your feet fast. This isnt a bad thing in the slightest but it definitly favors the alien and predator with thier strong melee attacks.And if your looking for story (like me) I swear there isnt one. as marine you're just dumped in a map and a guy tells you to go push buttons just because. as for alien and predator your objective is to just smash and kill the hell outa things.most nostaligia people will hate me but, srry! i was spoiled with AVP 2 and AVP 2 Primal hunt which imo is still the top AVP game of all time. So with a sad heart I would honestly say i wouldnt recommend this game. :(VERDICT: Fun but lacking 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though I think this game is amazing I wouldn't recommend getting only because with all the other games that are out now you'll probably find that you won't end up playing it unless you have specificly planned to play it.Pros- Get to be Marine or Predator!- Loads of weapon options to kill aliens- Fun survival mode- MultiplayerCons- Graphics are not that great (not that it bothers me)- Multiplayer is only viable if you have friends that also have the game- You'll probably find a lot of problems with the game as it's oldEven so if you are a fan of this game I would still get it, you just have to bear in mind that it's an old game so obviously you more than lightly aren't going to get the same old experiance you once got when you first played the game.

												Pour quelqu'un qui n'est pas spécialement un ""gamer"", ce jeu est juste IN-JOU-ABLE!!! Il n""est pas mauvais dans ses idées ( jouer un Alien, un marines colonial ou un predator!) mais dans sa prise en main, c'est juste galère... :-o Je n'ai jamais vue ça dans un jeu... D'où les sauvegardes sont limitées??? ce qui rend le jeu encore plus frustrant!!! Et c'est quoi cette Alien en mousse??? C'est censé être l'une des créatures les plus terrifiantes de l'univers et vous vous trouvez à jouer un monstre qui se fait OS en 20 secondes chronos si vous ne faites pas attention (Les humains vous repèrent à 15 bornes!!! o_O)... La difficulté ( suivant le niveau!!) n'est pas absolument pas adaptée...Dégoûté dés le premier niveau... Je n'ai rien contre du challenge mais quand même, je me fais une idée de la progression et du gameplay, pour moi ce jeu est foiré! Les graphismes sont d'époque, ce qui ne me dérange pas... Mauvaise expérience... :-/  ",111,15,0,24,2,2,4

It kept crashing on me and when I finally got it to work it was a huge disapointment (I know I spelled that wrong) I guess I can't complain about the graphics because of when it was made but the gameplay is stiff, the controls are all messed up, and all three of the storylines are not only boring they have very cheap voice work and sevirly underpower the player.

												Aliens vs Predator Classic 2000 is a first person shooter with a unique gimmick. There are 3 campaigns starring drastically different characters. You can play as a Marine, Predator, or Alien. Each has their own playstyle  and weaponry.The game is from 2000, so the graphics are quite dated. People, enemies and environments all look very blocky. Thankfully, the devs have increased the resolution for the rerelease, so everything appears a bit sharper than I imagine it did in the original. Still, the graphics are rough and that's something you will have to deal with if you want to enjoy this game.Each species has a unique control style, and luckily in this update gamepad support was added. That's my preferred method, although I found the aiming to be quite difficult, and probably much easier to handle with a mouse. There are some areas with generally frustrating platforming which you will have to navigate. You are also just thrown into the campaign without a tutorial, so prepare to learn the controls yourself through trial and error. Most games these days at least let you know quickly how to get around the controls, so this game shows its age in that way.The sound and general atmosphere is pretty well done. There is voice acting, and as a marine you will get your orders from the recording of a live actor. There are some general scary moments, especially playing as a marine in the dark while Xenomorphs are hunting you.Overall, while I feel this may have been an enjoyable game in its time, that time has passed. Many of the FPS and 3D games from that era feel dated, and it really shows here. From the controls, to the graphics, to the general gameplay, the genre has improved leaps and bounds since 2000. While there's some enjoyment to be had for big time Alien fans or those that played this in the past and are feeling nostalgic, I'd recommend most people to stay away.Grade: C-			",776,367,21,112,93,8,122

												If you want 3 words to describe this game from a long-time gamer's perspective, ""been too long.""3 words from someone who just happens to find the game on steam? Mine were ""dude,"" ""lolwut,"" and ""dude.""The graphics certainly bring back memory of how games were back around good ol' '99, it's been almost that entire stretch of time since I played anything with these kinda graphics and sounds. Last I can remember, relatively speaking, was in 2003. Fun times.A lot of these other reviews aren't wrong, though. You won't get a ton of enjoyment out of this if you're not already very familiar with it.I'm writing this after only playing a chunk of the first predator stage, but I'm not gonna bash the game, either. Though I DID snipe a lady whose face instantaneously went from something casual to a very... bothered face.. like she was giving childbirth. Looked like she was in a lot of pain. Well, her head dangling from an arrow stuck into the wall. I did enjoy every second I was playing, that's for sure (other than finding my way to different things in the area that weren't obvious). I shouldn't even score this, though, because I'm not as big a fan of games any older than 2001, mostly (and there's only one game from 2001, anyway).			",67,11,7,3,12,0,0

												Play as the marine, predator or alien either in single or multiplayer. Single player is as tough as first person shooters get and multiplayer is super fast.A lot of stealth is required when you're an alien or predator in single player and as a marine it becomes more of a survival horror even though you're tooled up to the eyeballs.Multiplayer is a lot of fun. I particularly like last man standing. In this mode its marines versus one alien or predator. Every time it kills a marine they come back as the same race that killed them. They then join the original predator or alien in killing the other marines, this pattern is repeated right down to the last marine. There are several modes and maps and it's all super fast gameplay. Seriously the aliens in particular run faster than The Flash. Try playing marines only at the office, it's the best fun me and a mate had in multiplayer.Being an old game this is not for shallow gamers who for them graphics are everything. This is a game for those up for a challenge. It's very tough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even after all of these years, Rebellion has yet to make a superior follow-up to this 1999 classic. ((I'm looking at you Aliens versus Predator (2010)) Sure the graphics engine is showing its age, but this can easily be remedied by downloading mods. The soundtrack, lighting and mood still hold up quite well, and the level desgin is nothing to shake a stick at either. (Combi or otherwise.)  If you're on the fence about whether to purchase this game or the 2010 reboot, go with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sure the graphics are abit old but that only gives the game more nostalgia. If you can spare £2.99, I highly recomend buying this, you will not be dissapointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												YAY! Sitting in a corner as a marine pooping myself, running up a wall and hissing at people as an alien and generally being mean as a predator again! Best of all I can bump up the graphics to their highest settings for the first time in ever! Beautiful. Apart from the standard vertigo stricken Alien refusing to go over certain ledges this game improves on all of the features of the most recent AvP game in the following ways: 1, is fun to play; 2, all of the playable characters have their own series of maps; 3, the marine is not a super powered killing machine that can take down 75 billion Aliens with a pistol and a sharpened toothbrush; 4, lets face it everything.... EVERYTHING about this game is better than most of the recent Alien games. If they screw up this new one in a few months then bye bye Alien franchise. It saddens me that it's taken me this long to find again. Hello old friend. Lets suit up as the predator with the disc and skirmish on a wide open map again like we did all those years ago.

												This game is a must buy for AvP fans (like me). In AvP Classic 2000 there are 3 species to choose from there is , the Alien, Marine, lastly my favorite one in this game the Predator. Basicly the Alien is all about mayhem&chaos were the Marine is all about surviving and the Predator is all about stealth. The gameplay is so good it kinda feels like your are apart of the movies being a total badass.The story is very istresting the deeper you go in to the later levels.Even though its uncommon now a days to find a game but when you do find one, join because the multiplayer in this game is very good compared to most games you see today.Overall i give this game a 11/10 witch means it broke my scale.Even though this game is the first one in the series to me It still is the best.

												This game if ♥♥♥♥ing AWESOME and INTENSE, 3€ definetly worth spending.graphics are outdated but not that much, but man the gameplay, can't get those eyes off the screen for a sec.unless you like being eaten by xenomorphs.Or predators.or marines.if you want a suggestion, rush through the game as fast as you can, there is a constant spawn of enemies in certain points(like the 2nd level outsides as marine).As in every Alien vs Predator game you can play both as marine, alien or predator.No allies, you wake up in a structure of the company weyland yutani with an allarm and a guy telling you two things.then it's up to you, outside your room there is a damn mess, many enemies and not a single ally.can you make it out?

												A vastly underrated game in its time, Aliens versus Predator succeeded in doing what two sequels would attempt and fail at: creating the feeling of being three different creatures in this rather dangerous universe.  The Alien gameplay was fast and savage, with a fragile player who had to use stealth and speed to tack down vastly superior targets.  The Predator was a superpowered murder god of technology.  The Marine was a slow, underpowered, well armed, tasty treat who ran like hell.While it is closest to the traditional FPS, the Marine gameplay is my favorite, as each level was a struggle to survive against an enemy that came at you.  No trigger, no prespawned xenos, just a spawn point and the hunt.  That was the first revelation that actually made me pause when playing, that I wasn't in a war, or pursuing a target, but I was the one being hunted.Grab a rifle, throw a flare, and run.

												It's really three somewhat short games in one package. The Marine campaign is a frantic, high-octane rollercoaster that offers paranoia and jump scares as Xenos hunt you through an abandoned colony and spaceship. The Alien campaign is the exact opposite: a methodical stealth game in which you are better aided by your ability to learn the labyrinthian level layouts and strike quickly and unseen than charging headlong into the fray like the Marine. The Predator campaign is a fun, even relaxing romp through a jungle and military base in which you enjoy all of the perks of being the Ultimate Hunter: a variety of unique weapons and gadgets, free healing every 30 seconds, different vision modes for tracking all types of prey, and so much health that you can melee a small army of Xenos dead before dropping yourself. In addition to the levels offered by the vanilla campaigns you can also unlock a second campaign for each of the three main characters by completing their respective campaigns on the hardest difficulty (Director's Cut). These new campaigns allow you to play through certain Alien levels as the Marine or Predator, certain Predator levels as the Marine or Alien, etc. New items also appear such as the jetpack for the Marine, which might leave you briefly wondering if you aren't playing Tribes.

												I find it super satisfying to play a classic Sci-Fi horror game. It's also super-satisfying to play as the Predator. Being able to go around slashing♥♥♥♥♥♥with your wrist blades or stalk some marines while cycling through your vision modes is a really immersive expierience even if the game's graphics are dated. The sound effects are great with the Predator targeting system or the marine Pulse Rifle firing off. It'd definatley a game for FPS fans, AVP fans, and even survival horror fans. Be aware of the Marine campaign though. That♥♥♥♥♥♥is freaking terrifying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK, I wrote a negative review yesterday, than I played it more. The controls are clunky at first but that's just because of the new FPS's we've gotten used to. You can remap them so don't worry. The graphics have not aged well whatsoever but you can get immersed into the game and feel like an actual predator/xenomorph/marine. The marine campaign is action with some horror (Tip: F throws a flare. You'll thank me later.). The Xeno's campaign is stealth oriented that will have you climbing on walls and dropping down to quickly kill enemies and cause confusion. The predator can be played either stealthily or action oriented. Even a mix of both if you want. I can not tell you how satisfing(?) to headbite as a xeno, stealth kill a marine as a predator, or use the smartgun!Oh yeah, the voice acting is terrible and there is an abundance of it.7.56894567034/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. 15 years, and this thing still has charm and oodles of enjoyment waiting to be discovered.The multiplayer is still supported, and that impresses and pleases me, and to be quite honest, that's where the real value of the game rests; in the multiplayer. The singleplayer had no real value or hook to it, and the levels are confusing as hell to navigate through. Good if you're one of those gamers that enjoys plenty of puzzles and searching, but a real pain for those who are fans of Aliens vs. Predator, and the high-speed combat that the games offer.Gameplay wise, this thing does sort of leave a lot to be desired, principally through Marine gameplay. Granted, recent Aliens games have kind of buffed up the Colonial Marines, but in this game, there is one critical feature that is noticably absent: the ability to reload. Couple that with gun jams (which I would actually enjoy a lot if the reload mechanic wasn't a fantasy in this game) and a fairly weakened Marine starting rifle, and you have a species whose only real option is to either spam pulse rifle grenades or power weapons (and there are copious amounts of power weapons in this, going far beyond the film arsenals). The Aliens and Predators, like the Marines, pretty much surf through the maps at ludicrous speed, which is literally where the high-speed combat statement comes from. The Predator does sort of suffer from Marine damage issues - their main weapons, the wristblades, are as weak as the Alien's light attacks, so as a result you'll probably encounted a lot of players either sprinting around firing spearguns or poising their tails to lash out and instakill you.If you're a fanatic for fast-paced, hyperactive games that will bring you up on your feet and have you laughing for hours, this is a must. It's fairly affordable, and while it is by no means the best Aliens game, it's where it belongs and will give you tons of enjoyment, laughs and jump-scares.			",61,2,0,5,5,0,11

												A true classic, and arguably the best game involving Xenomorphs, Predators, or both. You can't beat the price, and there are very few licensed games that can evoke the precise same mood as the films it is based on, as this game does flawlessly. One note, however: Playing the Alien takes some getting used to. Bind the crouch/wall-climb key to left-ALT, as it's easier to hold while running than the default left-Ctrl key. Also: Play with the lights off, wearing headphones, with the volume up. Trust me :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is indeed interesting, the story is somewhat weird as its not really actually showing much of the plot. More like doing objectives, but regardless its still fun as it is. Its also challenging if you play it on highest difficulty. While i havent really tried out multiplayer at this moment (if i were ever, i'll update my review). The story mode does kill quite some time, and it has some challenges.Even though its a classic game, you can modernize the controls in game. Unlike the game in the 90s unless you have the port of it.			",284,30,0,7,2,0,3

												I bought this game back in 2003. I bought the physical copy of Aliens Versus Predator: Gold Edition and played it religiously for 8 years. In 2010 my PC died and I bought a Macbook pro. In 2011, I bought the MacPlay port of the game again and finally completed the game on the hardest difficulty and unlocked all cheats. In 2012, I bought the game again on Steam and was amazed at the online as it was the first time I was able to play it since the game's release. And after buying three different versions of the game I still hold it in my mind as the BEST ♥♥♥♥ING GAME I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. EVER. BUY THIS GAME			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first and so far, the second most authentic video game tie-in with the Alien and Predator franchises. The as of yet anavailable Aliens Vs. Predator 2 is the first, but AVP classic outclasses the 2010 remake in terms of content. The level designs are still limited by walls and confined settings, but the thrill of hunting humans, as both the alien and Predator, or fighting either of these entities, is excellently paced. The weapons are true to the films and the sound effects are nicely recreated. AVP Classic was one of the first games to allow players to manipulate the timeframe and spawn enemy models into the game at will. The atmopshere is tense and the lighting adds a brooding sense of menace that the aliens and predators make even more startling when they appear. In terms of multiplayer, this game will offer a nice look into what evolved into the modern COD games. Rebellion did very well by cinema goers and even sixteen years down the line, AVP Classic is a great reminder of how film studios can recreate their works in video games pleasingly.

												I've only played this game for a few hours, but from what i've played, its a super fun old school fps. I for one am a huge AVP fan so this was even better for me. The single player was a little boring to me, but I'm not really a singleplayer type of person. Most of the time I've spent on this game is on the game's multiplayer. Its very rare to find a lobby, but when you do, its amazing. You can play as the Marine, Predator, and the alien. All three are balanced and can easily be taken out if you know what your doing. But the multiplayer is fairly simple to pick up. I just started pc gaming and its been easy and overall a fun experience. If you like the Aliens versus Predator series and like fun old school fps, I would definetly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put: this is one of the best first person Horror/Sci-Fi shooters of all time (in my opinion). The atmosphere created by Rebellion here is a much more effective effort than their later 2008 attempt at another AVP game. This game really puts you in the shoes of your characters, whether it be a rookie Colonial Marine, a twisted Xenomorph or a deadly Predator. As previously stated, the atmosphere in this game is incredible, it really sends chills up your spine and keeps you on the edge of your seat and your keyboard! Personally, I love every campaign in this game aside from the Xenomorph one, but each to their own. The Skirmish mode is fun to play and the extra missions that this version of the game includes provides more hours of entertainment in the AVP universe. The inclusion of the save option is a positive one, but old-school AVP gamers may choose to up the ante and try not rely on this feature as much. Overall, this still remains one of my favourite Horror/Sci-Fi games as well as FPS games of all time, it's up there with the likes of Half-Life, DOOM, Deus Ex and System Shock 2 for me.

												AvP 2000 is the first game I purchased on steam, andv the reason I got on steam to begin with! It's an amazing classic, and the first game in the Aliens Vs Predator franchise that we know today. The game seems to have some glitches that prevents me from advancing to the next level, but there are work arounds, and I am fairly certain I am one of the few people affected by this glitch. Other than that, it's a classic FPS that runs great on todays rigs!It has three different campaigns, allowing you to play as either Alien, Predator or Lunch..errr..I mean Marine.

												Yeah I know this game is pretty old. But oh well here goes another good reveiw for a under rated game. If you haven't heard of AVP Classic 2000 than you may want to reconsider how bad the new AVP games are. This might be the only AVP, besides another one on PC that's actually good. I know what you might be thinking. (How good can this AVP game be, compared to the crap new realses?) Well to sum it up in a nutshell if this games controls were only a little bit better. I would even put it at better than COD games. You might be confused. Well you should be. The gameplay is some of the best ive seen and had in a good classic FPS style. If you don't know, well you shoulden't. AVP Classic 2000 is a very under rated game. The game style is dark fast paced and everything that should be good about a AVP game IS HERE!!! For about 5 bucks its worth the buy. I hope they put all the other classic AVP games on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Better than CoD. Mind you, these days what isn't? But still, in the short time I've played this I know this is one of the golden age shooters like Quake or Unreal. Two of my favourite games from the golden age of gaming (as such with wolfenstein: because who doesn't like killing a mechatronic Nazi boss?) and this is definitely added to that list! This is one of the few games as to why I should have gotten a PC when I was younger instead of only recently getting into it. Sure, I played games like this with my mates on their PC (which is where i played Quake and Unreal) but I would have loved to play this every day when I younger. You don't just ""Run in guns a blazin'"" or any of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You do that and ""It's game over, man! Game over!"" Enter with a plan, go slow, and attack.Oh, and a heads up for the marine campaign: If you have a weak heart then don't play it. I don't have one at all, I jumped more than in most modern - crappy - horrors. This campaign is terrorfiying and suspensful. Stay on your toes, soldier, and watch your tracker!11/10 - Would reccomend to all friends and strangers on the street! Even those that aren't gamers, or don't even have a PC!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic fps. The story is minimal (but sufficient), but it is one of the most fast paced fps games ever. If you like really fast paced fps, like running through Doom 1-2 or playing with Unreal Tournament / Quake 3 Arena, this is the game you want.The three classes (Alien, Predator, Marine) have very different mechanics and require completely different playstyle approach. Also, when completing the main story, you mainly have the opportunity to replay the levels with the other species too, in a different time. Beware though that to unlock all alternative levels, you need to finish the game on director's cut difficulty, which can be difficult.The program supports widescreen resolutions (up to 720p) and it actually has Surround/Eyefinity support (at 3840x720). The GUI is not concentrated on the main screen, which is a bit of a drawback, but otherwise it runs great. This is quite nice for a 15 year old game. The textures are a bit ugly, but the lightning effects and the ambience still works as intended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Originally played this back in the day on my Voodoo3 gfx card. Marine on Realistic must have been one of the most brutal challenges I ever played. Now I'm reliving it thanks to Steam at a glorious 250 frames per second. The blisteringly fast aliens here make the Colonial Marines ones feel absolutely sloth-like. 15-years old, Aliens versus Predator still has the tension no other alien game has managed to acheive until Isolation. I actually feel guilty getting this for 74p, lol.Buy this and find out what games used to be like before they became over-produced dumbed-down interactive flicks.

												A true classic, and arguably the best game involving Xenomorphs, Predators, or both. You can't beat the price, and there are very few licensed games that can evoke the precise same mood as the films it is based on, as this game does flawlessly. One note, however: Playing the Alien takes some getting used to. Bind the crouch/wall-climb key to left-ALT, as it's easier to hold while running than the default left-Ctrl key. Also: Play with the lights off, wearing headphones, with the volume up. Trust me :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic. a throwback to proper shooters. everything controls as you want it to, it's fast, unforgiving and brutally volent. Multiplayer is still fun to this day. Playing as an alien is absolute perfection, they nailed it. Scary as hell as a marine in the pitch black throwing flareshunting as a predator is pretty much a game of impaling marine heads against the wall while flipping through the visor modes with THOSE NOISES!!Craps all over colonic marines and is sure to bring a grin to your face even after dying a few hundred times.Aliens (1986) + Predator (1987) / 10 - MUST OWN.

												i understand this game is not new but it definately has that classic approach to alien games and if more people played this it would only get better, singleplayer has had me on the edge of my seat and often jumpscares me when i get killed by an alien becuase you never see it coming unlike the newer games its very instantaneous thats why i love it the game also has a deathtrap feeling when you go into a room to acomplish a task the execution of the story and graphics are a bit cheezy but its no big deal as its the gameplay that is most rewarding in how difficult it is as it should be with all classic games. This game is amazing rate it 4/5 stars (there are a few minor glitches thats about it)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a gem. The game is past it's prime, it has crude graphics, the difficulty might be a bit harsh. But it's just great. The atmosphere is simply superb. It connects best of both worlds, as a colonial marine for example you will both experience hectic skirmishes with hordes of xenomorphs, akin to Aliens movie and more horror-like moments of exploration, with unnerving beeps of your motion tracker breaking the silence. For those who haven't played this: it might be a nice oldschool game to taste. For those who did play AVP and enjoyed it, it's a must buy. The price is affordable and compability and multiplayer are taken care of. Playing the game for the first time in ten years was a nostalgic moment of joy for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is indeed interesting, the story is somewhat weird as its not really actually showing much of the plot. More like doing objectives, but regardless its still fun as it is. Its also challenging if you play it on highest difficulty. While i havent really tried out multiplayer at this moment (if i were ever, i'll update my review). The story mode does kill quite some time, and it has some challenges.Even though its a classic game, you can modernize the controls in game. Unlike the game in the 90s unless you have the port of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game !! This is really one of the best games I have ever played. I mean the atmosphere is fantastic. When you play as a marine you really feel worried and are constantly waiting for an alien to pop out of a dark corner and kill you. Thing is it happens at the most unexpected times which makes for a good scare. There is al lot of content in this game. 3 campaigns There is alien,Marine, Predator. Each campaign has its unique storyline and each character has an unique set of weapons and skills. Really fun game overall and at 5 bucks there really isnt a reason not to buy it. Especially if you are a diehard fan of the series. Rating:8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic fps. The story is minimal (but sufficient), but it is one of the most fast paced fps games ever. If you like really fast paced fps, like running through Doom 1-2 or playing with Unreal Tournament / Quake 3 Arena, this is the game you want.The three classes (Alien, Predator, Marine) have very different mechanics and require completely different playstyle approach. Also, when completing the main story, you mainly have the opportunity to replay the levels with the other species too, in a different time. Beware though that to unlock all alternative levels, you need to finish the game on director's cut difficulty, which can be difficult.The program supports widescreen resolutions (up to 720p) and it actually has Surround/Eyefinity support (at 3840x720). The GUI is not concentrated on the main screen, which is a bit of a drawback, but otherwise it runs great. This is quite nice for a 15 year old game. The textures are a bit ugly, but the lightning effects and the ambience still works as intended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is how horror should beFirst of all,  I'm aware that this game is not a horror game in it's entirety, it's a gut wrenching, adrenaline pumping fast action game where standing still gets you killed. Always need to be moving.I've played this game on the colonial marines campaign, and by god it takes me back to the days of Alien Trilogy for the PSX, very dark environments, eerie soundtrack, dead atmosphere and I have no shame in saying I slowly edge my way around corners like a scared mouse about to run out of his hole. The xenomorphs are by god the scariest and brain frying enemies I've ever faced in a game, the sheer speed and appearance (I'm aware the graphics are dated by hey ho), and the sounds they make as they lunge at you can only take me back to the Alien and Aliens film, specifically the second one when the marines get ambushed.The game cooks up the perfect flavour, the smart gun, the pulse rifle are instantly given a place in my heart, and the little things like acid spray from aliens and elevators moving up and down that make the motion tracker plip are just downright evil and fantastic. The motion tracker is one of those things you don't want to have but you need it, the eerie plip makes your trigger finger stiff and ready to shoot, then you find that it was just an elevator going up and down, but what was making it do that? To anyone who loved the Alien franchise, definitely give the colonial marines campaign a go, it's by far one of the scariest you'll ever play, the deathmatches are so fun, who knew the predator was so hard to kill...

												is it fun? yes.is it worth 5 bucks? do you like old school shooters?is it better that the new one (2010) debatable, but i liked the newer one much better simply because its smoother and the animations are awesome.this game is great if you like good old school shooters. its campaigns are meh though, and since the multi is dead, skirmish is the way to go.class breakdown:alien: melee only and Incredibly fast (almost two fast for you to track properly when playing) like in the new one you have speed and stealth on your side.thats about it though, you are very squishy and if caught in a group you will die. also playing alien campaign feels like a maze more than your a killer alien. seriously its like impossible to find your way, since THERE IS NO MAP OR GUIDE SYSTEM. which is too bad, becuase alien is my favorite class, at least in the 2010 version.predator: the middle class which gives you strong melee, good firepower, decent move speed, and cloak and different vision modes. did i mention he can heal himself and put out those ♥♥♥♥IN ANNOYING FIRES? yeah he basically the op class, but thats to be expected cause theres only ONE of you.marine: the range class, was a ton of different weapons and gives the more your the victim approach of the game. but they got some pretty good guns and you can do pretty good with them, the only thing with all the explosives you usually end up killing yourself some how (in skirmish/multi at least) due to the small courters. but this class is my favorite in this version or avp simply becuase the alien campaign is almost broken feelingin conclusion buy it if you want to see how long you can last in skirmish not for multi or if your an alien fan			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in the early 2000 aliens and predator were both films that excell in any way watsoever, the atmospehere and the horror were perfect and ambiguos creating something truly unique and special that would give us a legacy present until today.This beign said a lot of the merchandise that come from both movies usually tended to be empty and souless representing the ""sellout"" of the product as well as the souls of the creators, i have to say though this is not the case.Aliens vs. Predator begins with three campaigns straigh foward, a menu that could've gotten some worked done and graphics that haven't aged well to say the least, however in tends to be the atmosphere and gameplay that truly makes this game something worth playing, it represents perfectly what it tries to do in the first place, the alien campaign is a fast, dark, and greedy campaign having the most special moments all together, the predator campaign however tends to have violence, stealth, and complexity to give and share.The marine campaign it's probrably the best campaign of any ""Aliens vs Predator game"" up to this date, it's scary, it's dark in quite a literal way, and most of all it's calm and flows with your own sense of immersion having a tendency to touch sore and taboo subjects that would surprise any triple aaa game developer in this day and age.

												Play as the marine, predator or alien either in single or multiplayer. Single player is as tough as first person shooters get and multiplayer is super fast.A lot of stealth is required when you're an alien or predator in single player and as a marine it becomes more of a survival horror even though you're tooled up to the eyeballs.Multiplayer is a lot of fun. I particularly like last man standing. In this mode its marines versus one alien or predator. Every time it kills a marine they come back as the same race that killed them. They then join the original predator or alien in killing the other marines, this pattern is repeated right down to the last marine. There are several modes and maps and it's all super fast gameplay. Seriously the aliens in particular run faster than The Flash. Try playing marines only at the office, it's the best fun me and a mate had in multiplayer.Being an old game this is not for shallow gamers who for them graphics are everything. This is a game for those up for a challenge. It's very tough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

((I'm looking at you Aliens versus Predator (2010)) Sure the graphics engine is showing its age, but this can easily be remedied by downloading mods. The soundtrack, lighting and mood still hold up quite well, and the level desgin is nothing to shake a stick at either. (Combi or otherwise.)

												#1: You have to be aware that the characters move and act EXTREMELY fast (lightning speed). (Skip this if you already know) Today's game are much ""slower"" than this. For example, we'll usually have a realistic walk/jogging speed (Halo, Rainbow Six Vegas 2) and also have a sprint speed (Halo Reach/Halo 4, or games like Rainbow Six Vegas2)Point being, there's very fast sprinting speed, if you press SHIFT you have a slower but still fast speed. Other than that the game is awesome.  recommend it to anyone who loves the Alien VS Predator series. Just keep in mind that you nee to reajust to the very fast rythm of the old games, cause today's games have turtle speed compared to this game, which is like a permanent Olympic sprint.     #2: Other than that, I love playing as a predator. I'll have to get a hold on the marine, cause I feel like he's too fast to play with. Alien is also overly fast, but I think I'll handle them.Very worth it for it's price, my very crappy laptop runs it very smoothly (probably the smoothest game I've played so far, only comparable to few 2d games like FTL)I say 8/10 cause of the speed, otherwise 10/10. Plus take a look at the price, it's more than worth it.    #3: I'm still in the Predator campaign (cause hey you have three story modes, Alien, Marine, Predator). I think I felt there was a lack in scenario/story, but I just started so I'm not sure. Just got 2 new weapons, now I'm going back to play and I'll edit this part when I'm done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a must buy for AvP fans (like me). In AvP Classic 2000 there are 3 species to choose from there is , the Alien, Marine, lastly my favorite one in this game the Predator. Basicly the Alien is all about mayhem&chaos were the Marine is all about surviving and the Predator is all about stealth. The gameplay is so good it kinda feels like your are apart of the movies being a total badass.The story is very istresting the deeper you go in to the later levels.Even though its uncommon now a days to find a game but when you do find one, join because the multiplayer in this game is very good compared to most games you see today.Overall i give this game a 11/10 witch means it broke my scale.Even though this game is the first one in the series to me It still is the best.

												YAY! Sitting in a corner as a marine pooping myself, running up a wall and hissing at people as an alien and generally being mean as a predator again! Best of all I can bump up the graphics to their highest settings for the first time in ever! Beautiful. Apart from the standard vertigo stricken Alien refusing to go over certain ledges this game improves on all of the features of the most recent AvP game in the following ways: 1, is fun to play; 2, all of the playable characters have their own series of maps; 3, the marine is not a super powered killing machine that can take down 75 billion Aliens with a pistol and a sharpened toothbrush; 4, lets face it everything.... EVERYTHING about this game is better than most of the recent Alien games. If they screw up this new one in a few months then bye bye Alien franchise. It saddens me that it's taken me this long to find again. Hello old friend. Lets suit up as the predator with the disc and skirmish on a wide open map again like we did all those years ago.

												AvP 2000 is the first game I purchased on steam, andv the reason I got on steam to begin with! It's an amazing classic, and the first game in the Aliens Vs Predator franchise that we know today. The game seems to have some glitches that prevents me from advancing to the next level, but there are work arounds, and I am fairly certain I am one of the few people affected by this glitch. Other than that, it's a classic FPS that runs great on todays rigs!It has three different campaigns, allowing you to play as either Alien, Predator or Lunch..errr..I mean Marine. My only complaint is that Steam doesn't have AvP2!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yeah I know this game is pretty old. But oh well here goes another good reveiw for a under rated game. If you haven't heard of AVP Classic 2000 than you may want to reconsider how bad the new AVP games are. This might be the only AVP, besides another one on PC that's actually good. I know what you might be thinking. (How good can this AVP game be, compared to the crap new realses?) Well to sum it up in a nutshell if this games controls were only a little bit better. I would even put it at better than COD games. You might be confused. Well you should be. The gameplay is some of the best ive seen and had in a good classic FPS style. If you don't know, well you shoulden't. AVP Classic 2000 is a very under rated game. The game style is dark fast paced and everything that should be good about a AVP game IS HERE!!! For about 5 bucks its worth the buy. I hope they put all the other classic AVP games on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It brings back many memories and i wish they had Alien versus Predator 2 on steam. I almost like how there is no tutorial it just throws you in the game. It is very well made and can be played for a long time, with three campaigns and unlocking more levels on harder difficulties which are from my viewpoint impossible on the hardest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thoroughly enjoyed playing this, a real throw-back to fast gaming, where reflexes are everything. If you're hesitant because the game is quite dated, there are very, very detailed HD texture mods that completely update the graphics. Grab it if you're a fan of the original doom, and PROPER aliens games, unlike...*Cough cough*Aliens: Colonial marines*Cough Cough*.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though this game may not be the original Americanversion, the british version is still as gory and fun.Graphics: The game is pretty good looking for a 90s game, compared to Ocarina of Time and Turok. Its like the halo 4 of xbox 360 games. Also its really frickin gory, especially the alien campaign.Gameplay: ITS AS HARD AS GETTING TO THE CHOPPA IN PREDATOR. Yeah this game can be very very hard. I recommend first playthrough on easy difficulty to get to know how it works. Marine campaign can be really scary at times, the predator campaign is supposed to be ultimate killer mode, and the alien is supposed to be stealthy mode, but you can manage by killing everything in 2 seconds by leaping at them... also a pro tip, make sure when you kill something as the alien, you go over dah body and bite its head off... it gives you health :P also mutilating it. Story: Standard, but who needs story in a game based on a movie cross over? Its actually ok for a 90s game.Cons: Sometimes the hit detection can really suck, and some puzzles took me about 2 hours to figure out. Like you have to flip a switch on the floor, flip it again, go underground, flip a second and shoot it, then on your way back up click it quickly, and go into a pod... to kill the queen... also tread slowly, as you will walk into rooms and instantly be killed by something. Also facehuggers are instant kills. Instant. Kills. Verdict: 9.4/10 Beats the CRAP out of Black ops 3 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played too much of this game yet, but it's great. If you can get past the graphics, which really are more cool and retro-y than annoying, then it's as good as a game that would come out today. It's practically three games as well, there's a shooter part of it, a stealth part of it, and an action part of it. Plus the skirmish mode keeps you going a lot more than you would think it would, it's fun. And god is it satisfying to shoot aliens limbs off and even blow them to pieces. There's just something about it, the way the peices fly everywhere, the acid blood that has a chance of hurting you and the sound. Sometimes they even keep coming at you with a missing arm or leg! It's a very neat game and at a good price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My hours played are a fraction of reality, as I've put days and days into AvP solo and multiplayer over the years and it's still as terrifying as it ever was. The spartan engine may take a couple of levels to adjust to, but the sheer tension infused by the space, lighting and speed of the game push all other concerns well into the background. The delicious asymmetry of the species mean there are three entirely different approaches to the game, and nothing beats the chaos of a species deathmatch held in an abandoned star freighter as sentry guns are flanked by invisible predators, aliens are frantically tracked by smart guns and explosions billow throughout the corridors as marines fire heavy ordnance into the darkest corners, trying vainly to flush out the creeping death that surrounds them.

												It's really three somewhat short games in one package. The Marine campaign is a frantic, high-octane rollercoaster that offers paranoia and jump scares as Xenos hunt you through an abandoned colony and spaceship. The Alien campaign is the exact opposite: a methodical stealth game in which you are better aided by your ability to learn the labyrinthian level layouts and strike quickly and unseen than charging headlong into the fray like the Marine. The Predator campaign is a fun, even relaxing romp through a jungle and military base in which you enjoy all of the perks of being the Ultimate Hunter: a variety of unique weapons and gadgets, free healing every 30 seconds, different vision modes for tracking all types of prey, and so much health that you can melee a small army of Xenos dead before dropping yourself. In addition to the levels offered by the vanilla campaigns you can also unlock a second campaign for each of the three main characters by completing their respective campaigns on the hardest difficulty (Director's Cut). These new campaigns allow you to play through certain Alien levels as the Marine or Predator, certain Predator levels as the Marine or Alien, etc. New items also appear such as the jetpack for the Marine, which might leave you briefly wondering if you aren't playing Tribes.

												I'm an old school PC gamer, I remembered to play DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D in an old 386 DX with 4Mb of RAM, no mouse and just the keyboard to play games, those games were charged from a 5/2"" disk!!!Progressing with hardware as well as software, with the old Win 95 of 32 bits a new generation of videogames arouse, one of those was Alien versus Predator, if not the very first deliver of the saga, it was new talking about graphics and gameplay.It was sad to me that my old CD-ROM games were no longer supported by Windows XP and later so I kept them as memories. However, it was a very good surprise to find AVS with STEAM playable in Windows 7!!!The story is amazing, how the three characters in a point cross roads!!!It is also a nice surprise that my XBOX 360 controller is supported and I can play it as in a game console.You won't regret to have this great old classic of the AVS franchise.

												A vastly underrated game in its time, Aliens versus Predator succeeded in doing what two sequels would attempt and fail at: creating the feeling of being three different creatures in this rather dangerous universe.  The Alien gameplay was fast and savage, with a fragile player who had to use stealth and speed to tack down vastly superior targets.  The Predator was a superpowered murder god of technology.  The Marine was a slow, underpowered, well armed, tasty treat who ran like hell.While it is closest to the traditional FPS, the Marine gameplay is my favorite, as each level was a struggle to survive against an enemy that came at you.  No trigger, no prespawned xenos, just a spawn point and the hunt.  That was the first revelation that actually made me pause when playing, that I wasn't in a war, or pursuing a target, but I was the one being hunted.Grab a rifle, throw a flare, and run.

												This is a good game despite it's age. Why? Because it has something to offer that not a single game that not even the sequels got right. Three distinctive characters to play as with different play styles that are done particularly well in their own aspects. Levels that are short yet sweet like a mission from Metal Slug and not feeling bloated like Skyrim where most of the content is crap. Let's start off with the marine campaign. You play as a Colonial Marine who wakes up from a bad dream and finds out Xenomorphs are loose aboard the research station on LV-426. The story is you do menial tasks to get rid of those pesky xenos. But the story isn't the attraction to this game anyway. The game mechanics are the attraction. Each level was designed with speed running and fast paced game action in mind. Your character moves very fast (all three of them do). Your weapon arsenal is powerful for the Marine and Predator. The combat is sudden because enemies are procedurally generated in different positions throughout levels and infinitely to encourage you to keep going and not bringing the game to a halt. This means you'll never find this game to be a slog in it's pacing. There's no story sequences that bring the game to halt whatsoever. The means of telling the story is completely optional for you to listen to. While playing as the marine you'll realize you can't manually reload your weapons. This actually doesn't hinder the game as one would think it would. As your weapons contain so much firepower and reload time is so quick it will be after an engagement. Not during. If it is during one you can use your agility to avoid attacks. Still keeping the pacing up. The levels themselves are open to exploration. But the drawback to them is they can be very maze like sometimes. An obvious flaw to a good game.But the sequences themselves are so cool you'll keep wanting to play. In Episode III in the marine campaign, I found myself encountering regular Xenomorphs and face huggers. The face huggers themselves are quite the surprise. I was torching 4 Xenos that cornered me in a hall with my flamethrower. All of them popping like water balloons filled with acid as it rains all over the steel corridors. But I see I have one more enemy near me on my radar. I toss a flare and the hall lights up. And out a facehugger pounces around the corner and cling to my face! The neat thing about this was it wasn't scripted at all. Scenarios like these provide replay value beyond the speed running to play. Something that the sequels sorely missed.The predator himself plays like a pseudo stealth action game character at speed running with powerful weapons and a focus on melee attacks too. The first levels you'll find yourself uppercutting marines with your claws while cloaked as they dim wittily walk around in dark areas filled with more than just Xenos and bunny hopping around corridors and over cliffs. Against Xenos you'll find yourself popping off their body limbs with your claws, accurately predicting their movements do you pin them against walls with your spear gun, or just blasting them away your shoulder cannon in a super cool vision mode just like the movies! Thing is about killing the Xenos as either Marine or   Predator. You have to be somewhat tactical about killing them. They'll still spray acid fluids about after death. As a marine it will chew away your armor and health like you wouldn't believe. It'll kill you as fast as you can kill them when you get cornered and blast them away with your minigun. Killing Xenos with your claws as a predator has to be quick and efficient. You charge up, let them come to you, and let it loose and step away.Playing as the Xenomorph reduces you to melee attacks and being able to climb anything. Simple as it is. It really works. The FOV is bigger so you can see well. Sticking to walls and wall jumping is easy as hit the CTRL button when landing. Holding it if you want to stay on that surface. You can move just as easy when holding it too! You are reduced to claws, biting enemy heads which does a lot of damage and gives you health, and a tail charge attack. You must use stealth and hit and run tactics to take out enemies. You'll be crawling on ceilings, leaping fifty feet, and delivering a timed tail attack to stab right through some jarhead's skull. It's the weakest of the three. But still manages to be good fun.Despite all this. This game has a serious flaw that needs to be brought up. The level design is highly unintuitive. It will be very maze like for first time players and very hard to spot important mission progressions in the dark environments. Some parts of the levels are copy pasted too much. You'll see the same room and halls like five times. But thankfully the linearity keeps from being like Doom 2's crap levels yet still providing opportunities for exploration. But despite that flaw. Once you get the levels down you'll get fast paced action with dynamic events and seriously immersive characters to play as. This game is easily a 4/5 game back then and now. Still worth playing even if you aren't a Alien (or Predator) fan. Becuse you won't experience anything in its entirety again or as good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A dated game with strong qualities. The solid multiplayer experience is very rawly balanced between the 3 species, dumbed down by the very fast pace of movement speed and high attack damage. You'll need quick reaction times to survive(if you can find anyone online). The 3 singleplayer campaigns each have a unique attitude, yet share similar themes of loneliness and menace. It's a challenging game with an undertone of dread, best not played with the lights off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aliens versus Predator...the one that started it all.  Aliens...Predators...Colonial Marines, oh my.The Good:  Albeit an old, ""Classic"" game, it's got good, solid controls.  The storyline is decently thought out for the 3 types of campaigns (one for each race), although sadly, they're a bit on the short side.  Where this game shines, though, is the multiplayer.  Aliens are quick and fragile (although they can heal themselves), but are primarily melee fighters.  Predators are big, hulking brutes (that go invisible...actually more of a drawback, though) with a few big guns.  Colonial Marines...they're...well...Humans...but man do they have a LOT of guns.The Bad:  The campaigns are short, as previously mentioned.  Graphics, if that matters to you, are...well, dated.  And the Aliens' vision...what, at the time, was called Fishbowl Vision, can be...disconcerting (120 view, versus the normal 90 view).  And finally, and sadly, although multiplayer is where the game shines, it's sorely lacking in maps...and since it's such an old game, there's little to no chance of any fan-made content for it.The Ugly:  The user interface is...weird.  Although you can use a mouse to look around...there is no actual mouse use on the menues.  That's really it...and even then, that's more of a personal inconvenience instead of a really bad feature.Overall...I think this game rates a 4.5 out of 5.  A great game, a great multiplayer experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
