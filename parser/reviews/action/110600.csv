												An incredible game. Astro Tripper is the graphical upgrade to one of my all time favourite games Space Tripper. On the surface it seems like a simple Defender/Uridium clone, but give it time and you will find the great depth in gameplay it has to offer. The intensity levels that are required to beat the game on Hardest using the keyboard is something I have not found in any other game. The added Challenges that weren't present in Space Tripper are excellent for short spells of blasting action. Both Space Tripper and Astro Tripper are superb examples of the sidescrolling space shooter. A must have.			",1920,829,74,198,246,21,315

												Let me start with saying that this game has frustrated me to no end at times with its difficulty and insta-death scenarios. Its a shoot'em'up kind of game in limited arenas of sorts and you beat the level once all enemies are dead and cleared out which you have to do under a fairly strict time limit. A lot of its design choices feel like the are taken or at least inspired by old arcade games since if you die and game over on the third out of four levels in a zone you will need to beat the first two again to retry that area....something that will infuriate you on the harder levels.The game has a challenging mix of achievements for doing various specific tasks on specific levels or bosses making the game even harder then just playing it normally. Some of these will only take a try or two while others (specially ""Sneeky Incursion"" that took me 20+ tries) will test your patience and skill quite a bit.Time to 100%: 2-5 hours (depending on skill and luck)			",942,372,36,86,96,14,164

												I bought the original Space Tripper back in 2001 and it's still holds up well today. Astro Tripper updates and extends it to take advantage of better graphics and higher resolution screens without losing the core look & feel and is well worth the money. It's quick to get into and is one of those games that when you get killed, you say ""that was my fault, I'll do better next time!"".If you like classics such as ""Uridium"" and ""Defender"" this is probably right up your street and I fully recommend it.There's also a free demo so that you can try it before committing. This is always a good sign from a developer and I wish more would do it.			",29,5,2,1,2,0,2

												Horizontal shoot-em-up with about a dozen platform levels spanning four stages plus unlockable difficulties and challenges. You have a single-target beam and a multi-target arc beam at your disposal, can choose which to power up with drops and switch between them, and the direction you're facing, with the press of a button. The only problem with the game is that the maneuverability and inertia are quite poor and really affect your performance. A decent game otherwise, with learning to use both beam types at the right time being essential to progress and survive. Leaderboards for pretty much everything and the game looks great. Doubt I would buy it again if given the chance though due to the terrible piloting.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												It's a brilliant arcade game. Loads of fun, flashy graphics, and although it's quite short I've replayed it many many times. For some reason this Steam re-release is optimized much more poorly than the Windows XP original and the framerate degrades pretty badly in some levels. The game is still playable and I highly recommend giving this one a try if you enjoy Defender-style arcade shmups.			",419,152,10,65,45,5,46

												A very original arena shmup. Not easy and a bit frustrating at first because if you're hit, you'll have to redo the level (they are short though). You need to learn the design of each levels but the game is much more skill-based than memory-based.A very interesting shmup despite some problems.			",729,226,36,111,97,7,203

												Seeing as there are hardly any reviews for this and Steam is reporting that reaction is ""mixed"", I thought I'd ought to throw my opinion in here.I bought it because I have memories of playing the demo for the original (Space Tripper) way back, and not ever being able to finish it beause it was so damn difficult. Guess what- it still is. And that's good.Some people have given it negative reviews saying that its frustrating and too difficult; I can't count that aginst it because that is exactly what I was expecting, and I think that due to the genre of game that it is, it should be expected. This is a hardcore arcade style game where you have to get through all in one go, theres no autosaves or any saftey net other than three lives- and if you lose a life you start that level over again, every time. Its pretty brutal like that. In Hard mode, there's not even barriers to the play area; if you stray too far away accidentally you'll die.Apart from the style differences between this and Space Tripper, there is one change that I've noticed that does make a big difference. In Astro Tripper, you can switch between two weapons- the blue one which fires a shot straight forward, and the red that shoots left and right of the direction you're facing. In the original, that red weapon also shot straight ahead as well, but at a weaker power (so that it would take two hits from the red gun to kill a standard enemy, but only one from the blue). The upshot of this is that at the frantic pace you have to play the game, not being able to accuratly fire ahead of you with the red weapon will cost you dearly, so you might not ever want to use anything other than the blue; the weapon switching becomes useless. This might just be me, but I think it's a valid point. Due to my experience playing the original demo for Space Tripper, I feel that's the only real criticism I can make in comparison (I should mention that I've not had any technical problems with it thus far), and also overall. Some people have mentioned inertia to be a problem stopping them from moving accuratly around the levels, but all I can say to that is that I have had that difficulty playing any Mario or Sonic games; it's nothing you shouldn't be able to get used to as a playstyle. Every level proceeds in a pattern, with important audio cues that let you know about changes in enemy spawns or imminent dangers. Once you've failed enough times to learn the levels, you'll progress and develop your skill and I find it a process that rewards your frustration in a cathartic manner. As far as I can see it's a perfectly decent arcade shoot-em-up that rewards perseverance. Summary: If you're someone with skill and experience who wants to beat a real challenge, this is a great game. People who aren't willing to give 100% effort to and endure a lot of trial-and-error, look elsewhere.			",193,30,0,8,6,2,14

												Generic and technically flawed twitch shooter that has the irritating gimmick of confining the player to a small and oddly shaped space.  It's underwhelming in all ways, and a shoddy console port to boot.  If this game was a piece of classical music, it would be performed in the tempo of garbaggio.  Avoid like the plague.  Avoid like a loan shark.   Avoid like a psycho ex-girlfriend.  Pretend you never saw it and buy Jamestown instead.			",1244,471,58,133,136,15,228

												This game had very little music if any so it was just an okay game... until I played a few Rush albums while playing then I felt Godly. The inspiriation to do that was from a Futurama episode where Fry had to play Space Invaders.This game has also killed my thumb from button mashing the fire button since I played with a controller and the thingy fires slower if I hold down to fire.

												I'm not sure why I got this again on Steam when I was pretty meh on it on PS3. Never beat it before, and finally beat it on easy. The sheer fact that you're required to just jam the fire button as fast as possible to have a chance to beat the levels within the time limit makes the game not fun. My entire forearm is sore, and that was with taking breaks between levels. It's short, ridiculously hard, and it's hard to tell enemies from powerups, and enemy spawns are sometimes hard to see as well. I'd avoid this one.			",649,249,15,63,40,7,63

												A complete wasteEven at $5.00.The game is merciless, the first level - the easiest difficulty.I have died so often that I am dying more than I'm playing.I understand some challenge, a game that teases you.This game takes that to unrealistic levels.It's based on ""perfection"", one wrong move, accidently standing on a random spawn, and you've lost - you get no checkpoint, you have to restart the whole level.I haven't even survived 1:00 minute.I don't even want to play it anymore, the game had amazing potential, but with the difficulty level, its not possible to enjoy.

												I consider Alien Zombie Megadeath, the other game from developer PomPom, one of the best arcade games of the latest years. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for Astro Tripper. Presentation aside (it's even more basic than AZM) the game is basically a defender inspired shooter but it's extremely difficult and frustrating. There are three difficulty levels, easy, hard and extremely hard. I've played at hard difficulty (never played a game in easy mode in my life) and I haven't been able to finish the first training level after a dozen game overs. Enemies spawn everywhere, they shoot a lot, some of them collide with each other suddenly changing trajectory, the play area is extremely narrow and, just to add some frustration, you can fall over the play area so you must be extremely careful while maneuvering your ship. Being a defender clone you also have to press a button to flip the ship direction, easier said than done given the overall difficulty. In the end it's not a bad game, it's just badly calibrated and for this reason I could only recommend it to hardcore space shooter lovers. Go play Alien Zombie Megadeath instead.
