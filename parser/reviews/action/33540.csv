												Despite all the hateful reviews, I bought this game. ( I also played Dawn of magic 1) While I didn't expect much from this, for some reason I got hooked. Some people say that the Story and Combat are garbage in  this game. Well, the story makes no sense unless you've played the first one. And the combat is focused around magic, It's literarly impossible to play a Warrior or a Rougue in this game. It's revolved around magic. A Cool feature that is VERY rare is that the more magic you learn, the more pimped your character becomes. I just bought a tornado spell and my character grew wings. At first i was like wtf but then , when you think about it, it's a really cool adition. IMO it's worth the money, especially when it's on sale. Too bad nobody gives this a chance. =( My rating is 7/10 - good but definately needs some polish to get people's attention.			",53,0,2,7,1,0,0

												A short and old but still a good clasic RPG game where you magic to defeat your enemies even if you dont prefer magic you will have to use it and with a several schools of magic you can choose your playstyle. It could be giving yourself boosts and weakening enemies or go full offensive with damage dealing spells and summons. The story is bland and hard to understand and the voice acting is horrible (Even if its a old game it doesnt excuse it, just look at dungeon keeper 2) Also any toaster can run this and enjoy it at the same time if you are into RPG's and like mostly fighting enemies and doing quests rather than looking for a good story. You mostly do the main quests and optional quests are just a way to earn money and XPThis game could've also been more longer for example adding multiple worlds where to travel and do quests but even so you will notice time goes a lot faster playing this since you murder every monster in sights since almost everything is hostile to you.

												I see very few reviews here, all very different, so think my report could be useful. This is my first review.I've played non-Steam Dawn of Magic for a long time few years ago, and now bought a Steam version to play again on 64-bit OS (Retail version protection cannot run under 64 bit).(IMPPORTANT) This game is basically an addon to an original Dawn of Magic and is actually the same game, just modified and with a different and quite short storyline set in a much smaller world. About an original game (WARNING: Original game (story, some monsters, most of maps) is not included in this Steam version):It says that it's an ARPG, but it's only partially true. The ""Magical killing sandbox"" is much closer to the truth, I think. There are hordes of monsters everywhere, and on most locations you will take a bloodshower just trying to run from A to B. The monster killing is the core of the game, but unlike many other games, this one makes this process a real art. 12 (!) BALANCED (!!!) schools of magic and the ability to make crazy spell combinations make these poor hordes of monsters your specimen. Saying about spells variety, it's the only game I know where you can effectively ""eat"" enemy corpses, explode them with bones or fire, make them a source of plague or resurrect them in 3(!) possible ways.Killing is no more routine - it's an experiment. Knowledge and skill give you more power than just upgrading spell levels - even on first spell levels some not-at-all-obvious combinations of seemingly useless spells create an extremely powerful weapon. Also, leveling up some spells changes their effective behaviour (difference in numerical values sometimes makes qualitative change).And i'm just speaking about the spell system itself, without influence from other systems!The real treasure of this game is its art. It alone costs multiple times this funny steam price. This pretty much unique dreamy horror style, beauty and harmony in common human figures, beauty even in dreadful monsters and locations, beauty in strange city architecture (I really have no idea how designers made these), wonderful atmospheric music... Really, in such an atmosphere monsters are just a part of a harmonic gorgeous nature, life and death cycle. The graphics can seem technically dated, but the art itself is a masterpiece, and the concept behind is very deep. You will probably never see something like this anywhere else. Long story short, let's make some lists:ORIGINAL DAWN OF MAGIC (again, NOT included in this Steam version)pros and contras++++Amazing artwork and atmosphere, elaborated to the smallest details. All or almost all dialogues and random npc strings vary depending on your character and moral alignment. Dialogues themselves are often quite unusual.+++ Complex and entertaining spellsystem.+++ Ability to be really EVIL! (and to be verbally and not verbally kicked and abused in an incredible variety of ways by NPCs), have a really evil campaign, kill innocent people and so on.++ multiple equipment and character upgrade systems (many upgrades are not trivial): 1) Alchemy2) Material adding3) Incredibly wide range of runes 4) Runic spells on items (most with unusual effects)5) Tatoos (not removable of course)6) Perks from learning magic7) Item sets, some of which change spell behaviour++ Non-standard in details storyline. You know like remakes of old tales in an unexpected manner.++ Non-linear in details campaign.+Large enough world with many things to look at.+Challenging (usually) boss fights.+Crazy mob fights (mobs use magic ALOT including resurrection and so on)+ Many consequent difficulty levels (very escalating) and an ability to make a new game with an old character (with all exp and items). Adds much of replayability (also some things are not supposed to be done on first dif. levels)+Short range through-walls teleportation skill to feel like a mage :)+ On slow machines or in very heavy scenes the game itself slows down instead of skipping frames. Very good neuron-saving feature.+Ability to play as Mortal. Death is irreversible in this mode, you'll need to start over. For maniacs.(neutral) mobs generally do not respawn. Oh, don't worry, they won't deplete completely unless you're a maniacal inquisitor. They're just too many. You can still try...(PURGE!!!) but I guess, that'll ruin ecological balance.- Monsters are a bit too dense sometimes. If the map is big and you need to cross it, better use teleporting skill and try to survive in the air boiling with mob spells between jumps.-Minor bugs like very rare inactive mobs, rare incorrect resurrection and strange npc walking routes when in a very limited space.-Monster population could be a bit less homogenous on most maps... Maybe a bit more monster types (even more)...-The main outline of a plot could be less generic.DAWN OF MAGIC 2 (please remember that it's only an addon) Differences:+Sweet movie scenes.+more comfortable UI (not much changed, but still).+New feature: element parts that can be collected and make an item to give you a concentrated power of one school including Skill.+Different starts for different characters (4). The campaign details also differ a bit, but only a bit.+Seemingly improved campaign rewarding system.+In retail versions often original modified(inc. new UI and element parts) game is also included.(neutral) Fewer difficulty levels. (only 3)(neutral) Monster continously respawn on some maps during some campaign events.-Shorter storyline.---------Much(!!!) smaller world. (You cannot visit most of cities and places).-No more Alchemists' guild.-No more bards. (funny guys)---Much less quests.--------No evil campaign or passive hatred from citizens (you can still kill them though)---- Very linear campaign. (In original one you could, for example, alternatively kill some characters or even kill key figures not obviously supposed to be killed.)-Fewer tatoos.NON-RUSSIAN VERSIONDifferences:---- Less fantastic voice acting. No voice acting for citizens. (Atmosphere changes a bit. Less warm.)--The translation is... Well, they tried to conserve an original style. They tried.STEAM VERSION Differences:+++ low price, esp. on sale.+Feels more ironed out.----(-) (IMPORTANT) No original modified Dawn of Magic included!- No russian version (really, if you understand Russian, get a russian version of this, otherwise you miss a chunk of an atmosphere).-The advertisment and screenshots are just awful :) They should fire people for such a thing.SUMMARY:If you're new to Dawn of Magic, buy this, but not a Steam version (beware of Starforce, do not work on 64 bit!). Choose one with an original game included and have fun. Or you can buy this if you just want to see a bit of DOM for a very low price, but remember that this is just an addon.If you played the original game, you can buy this, especially on sale, at least to feel some nostalgia.If you understand Russian, get a Russian version, really. It's a bit more atmospheric, but beware of Starforce.Notes:Multiplayer is seemingly working, but there's no people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most beloved RPG since Diablo 2. I know that game as ""BLOOD MAGIC""I still have the magazine, where i've read about it, it looked so awesome, and when i got a chance of buying it on CD, that day was one of the greatest, like when i got the CD with ""Space Clash - final frontier"".(Обожаю эту игру, для меня она новый вздох после Дьябло 2 т.к еще очень давно была приобретена мною в дисковом варианте. Знаю её как ""Магия Крови"" - звучит?=)1) THE ATMOSHPERE IN TOWNS / VILLAGES.I've lacked it in Diablo 2, sometimes i wanted those ppl in town being much more alive, fighting the creatures from outside, invading their village, more so speaking with each other and of course reacting on my character and his/her actions - all that you can see here, in Dawn of Magic.-  ( Атмосфера в городах )То, чего мне так не хватало в Дьябло 2, когда было грустно ;'( Так хотелось, чтобы, например, во 2-ом акте на город в пустыне - Лут-Голейн -  нападали монстры и жители сражались и умирали. Чтобы реагировали на игрока и его действия. Чтобы с ними можно было взаимодествовать. В Магии Крови подобное тут и там, города большие, бывает остановишься, уйдешь на кухню, возвращаешься, а вокруг народ стоит, ходит, общается.. живет в общем. Атмосферно.2) THE CHANGING of day / night.Yeah, for me that means everything. (Смена дня и ночи говорит сама за себя)3) THE   -   M I N I O N S. Summons. Creatures who fights for you. Call it whatever you like.I live for the ""Family"" only. For my minions. The adventures are much more interesting when you pass them with your summons. Here are the - Demon, Avenger, Earth golem. (Семьёй я дышу, семьёй я живу. Големы, демоны, духи, зомби, скелеты, - то ещё представление устраивают на поле боя)4) THE MORPHING.Yeah, any spell you learn can affect on your appearance. You dont need to find some epic helmet or else to make your face, your head look like a scary skull. Or maybe you want to get wings? - then head to learn Alchemy. Wanna change your legs for being Zerg-like? Each spell from the each School of magic, that you've learned, affects on each piece of your body, like hands, legs, chest and etc. So the final version of your char may look like whatever YOU want. Besides, through game you collect the pieces of some special SETs, which grant you full skin of one of  the Magic Schools. If equipped, they replace your current appearance. (Изменение внешнего вида на любителя, мне нравится, не всё конечно. Тем более что потом можно собирать камни школ магии, они будут заменять внешний вид персонажа на скин последователя одной из школ, скажем, целиком школа Земли. Прям друид какой-то)These are the main things, which i love in that game. <3			",90,9,0,8,1,1,13

												Sheesh, this goes back all the way to my childhood. I have played, and finished, Dawn of Magic 1. DoM2 is exactly the same as DoM1 when it comes to playstyle, character animation, spell/abilities. Heck, they remade the same game and added a 2 after it. The storyline aspect is lacking in this game. Do not play it if you are into games with a good story. This game is however recommended to people loving high customizability and patience (especially waiting for level ups so you can spend your scrolls). The playability in this game on modern PCs are also smooth, as long as you don't alt+tab, because getting back into the game has some known issues to cause a hell of a lot of FPS lag.My review is somewhat objective as I have finished the first installment. Give it time. Try the combat, you will find yourself mentally wrecked coming up with a good build - there are so many to choose from (my personal favourite is one of 3 builds: Water, focus on Ice Blast, Poison, focus on plague (which is superb for AoE fights but lacking in single-target fights due to high Global Cooldown,  and finally earth magic) and blessing + fire + earth, play this as a melee strength/energy-stat characterTips for new guys:-Try out builds by making a network Free-for-all game, and play it solo. you won't be using your story character for this.-Stay the heck away from the spell ""Infidel"" unless you have high strength/energy -REDUCE enemy resistance, or Croud Control the heck out of them - will make your life easier. Some examples are the ""Thick Blood"" spell which works fantastically with Poison.-WATER BUBBLE! it negates Blessings/Curses-Dark path, Dark path, Dark path. Not only does it teleport you, it HEALS you.-Melt is also a fantastic option to have - pair it up with any less-frequently-used spell. If your life/ life potions are low, just highlight that spell on your action bar - helps a ton with HP regeneration			",36,13,0,25,7,0,1

												This is to all of those people who couldn't give a damn about the fancy graphics and other pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game has a solid story line and gameplay but on the other hand does have horrible dialogue but who cares right? Maybe the best combat system I've seen in a while for a an 3rd Person RPG, sweet magic academies which go from alchemy magic for those who want to look like an insect like thing to air magic to those of you who want to be an over powered bad♥♥♥♥♥runnin' around zapping people into meatballs. The rest you should find out without me talkin' about this. Solid game, get it !			",141,10,1,21,6,0,8

												This game will break on a  dual monitor setup and has natsy load times every time you alt tab out of it.The gameplay itself is a mess with wide areas in which enemies will spawn randomly and pick fights withNPCS. Even important ones like merhcants will jsut run off into the wilderness chasing blindly after enemies, dayingsomehwere in the widlerness. This erratic NPC and enemy behaviour will turn into chaotic mass brawls whenever a questspawns opponents in a city. Not that it would become any better out in the wilderness, as the randomly spawning enemieswill make sure that even then every single encounter is a mess.The one stand out gimmick that magic you learn affecting the stats and the looks of your character is  a neat idea, but ultimately pointless. The bonusses are sometimes utterly pointless-like having a reduced death penalty. In a  game that has a hardcore mode. Let that sink in- and come coupled with heavy dosnwides that usually ahve a higher impact than any advantage you might gain. Spells are on a global cooldown so you will usually see yourself spamming your standard attack spell over and over again until your enemies keel over. I can not recommend going into melee comabt at any point. While there is also a slight element of spell customization by adding secondary effects to your primary spells, but you're generally best off by using the respective 'mastery' of the element for amximum effect.TL;DR;This game is a mess. Avoid it.			",152,19,1,40,6,0,21

It was extremly boring in some parts.In this one they upgraded story - its quite interesting - and added cutscenes. This made the game much more interesting but the shortened the game a lot. Adventages:Magic has influence on our character, each skill changes different part of our character's body. this was the only interesting part of this game...			",218,44,7,53,3,4,24
