												I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game. Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them.-------------------------------IntroYou know how when you are on vacation and say, ""I am so glad it isn't winter right now.""? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about.-------------------------------Summary:This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programed-to-be ""idiot"" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play. -------------------------------Multi-PlayerThen there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totaly worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/loadouts into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/meatal abilities.-------------------------------Other important thingsThe many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the storyline, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.To dumb it down:-------------------------------Pros+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful gameplay. +Wonderful audio and music for a great experience. +Well-designed maps and challenges. +Unlimited maps (user-created). +Fantastic story-line. +Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials). +Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable.+Gender neutral.++Helps with cognitive brain activity.-------------------------------Cons-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1). -Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here to me.)-Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.) -Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.)-------------------------------My opinionated reviewI would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves.-------------------------------RatingOut of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing ""Portal transportation"" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definately get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a 97/100 after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating.-------------------------------FinallyThanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!~thedubmark(I write reviews now :))			",50,2,1,3,6,0,1

												Portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company. That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.　STILL ALIVE?　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.　ENDLESS TESTS　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.　Multiplayer:　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺　　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.　　　　VALVe made another good　　game. With good intelligent humor,　　charismatic characters and unusual　　interesting gameplay.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10]. ",258,35,11,25,32,2,34

												Portal is back and better than ever! The tests are as mind bending as ever, and they've added new elements, like light bridges and emancipation gates. The graphics are smooth and attractive, but nothing that's going to make your jaw drop. The controls are as simple and effective as the first game. But then, none of that was what worried me. I had no doubt that they would be able to recreate and expand upon the technical aspects of the first game. My concern was whether or not they would manage to capture and continue the personality and sense of humor of the first game. I am very pleased to report that the sequel does not disappoint. The sequel pics up right where the first game left off, and GLaDOS holds a grudge. Her insults, passive aggressive comments, and general malice will have you chuckling throughout the game. Your new companion and guide robot also adds to the character of the game, though he can be a bit heavy handed at times. If you enjoyed the first game, you will love the sequel, both for its expanded challenges, and its unique personality. As long as you enjoy a good puzzle and have a sense of humor, you will never regret this purchase.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

												Take everything you love about Portal, then times it by five. This game has so many good aspects to it, it's hard to know where to start.Sound? Witty dialouge, excellent voice work, a really cool soundtrack, and even something as simple as the sounds that the portal gun makes sound awesome!Gameplay? Addictive.Story? Really good. There are some parts to the story where I genuinely felt threatened and isolated. Graphics? Nothing to complain about.Although Portal 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games I've played in a while, there are two errors that I find with it:#1 There are parts in the game where you have to use the ""zoom"" key to find almost unfindable portable surfaces. I thought this gameplay mechanic was rather silly and annoying.#2 There are parts in the game where the events that happen don't make much sense, and you wonder why you have to do certain things or why you're in certain places.Overall this game is one of the best games of our generation, and it's loads of fun. It's good aspects overwhelmingly outweighs my tiny nit-picked errors.			",55,1,0,5,1,0,1

												Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun.At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1591,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Portal 2 is the follow on to the extremely successful first person original. The game retains all of the game play elements from Portal 1 and adds lots of new features such as bridges made from light beams, and splashing paint gel which accelerate your speed or make you jump higher. In the single player campaign, you play as Chell. As with the original Portal, your character can take a small amount of damage before they die, thankfully like the original you don't take fall damage still.  The aim of the story mode is to explorer the Aperture Science Lab, which is filled of complex puzzles that have a clear exit point, but there are also other parts of the game which are not so clear leaving the objects less clear.The tutorial at the start of the game explains all of the game play elements very well and gets you well prepared for the on coming puzzles; and whenever there is a new element introduced, the game does a very good job of making you aware what it does without shoving a tutorial screen in your face every time.Portal 2 is powered by the Source engine, like all of Valve's more recent releases (Half Life 2, Left 4 Dead, TF2), and it looks stunning. You will find it hard nowadays to find a game that looks as well polished as Portal 2, all of the colours, textures and visual effects are done perfectly. Story-wise is the feature in Portal 1 that I thought it fell down on, however in Portal 2 they knocked it out of the park. It follows on from the story line set in the original and goes beyond the level of detail and complexity that you would expect. I needed to find out how it ended once I started playing, and the ending is just beautifully crafted. The difficulty is like most puzzle games, if you are good at them, it will just come naturally. It definitely has a better difficulty curve when compared to the original, but even still at times I had to revert to a walkthrough to pass through some puzzles (shame on me eh?) but there is nothing here that can't be solved if you sit and think for a couple of minutes each time.The single player story mode took me about seven hours to complete, this to me is a perfect length for a game of this type, the game ends at a high point and I was 100% satisfied with the outcome. There is also a co-op campaign included which will also add a good number of hours. On top of both of these, we also have Steam Workshop support, meaning endless hours of mods and different chambers to try and master. I have yet to try any out yet but some of the maps and rooms I have seen on the workshop page just look amazing. I wouldn't be surprised to see people being able to get fifty plus hours in this game. In conclusion, Portal 2 is a must play for any gamer out there. It is an absolute classic that should certainly be in your library. It goes on Sale every few months so most people will already have it, but you need to play it. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Portal 2 Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Innovative; Puzzle; Sci-Fi; Action; Funny My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-6 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional and Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEWPortal 2 takes everything that was done right in the first game and injects it with steroids. It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.In the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.After that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.And to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.With the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, Portal 2 rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.

												One of the best games in my library? Certainly.One of the best games available on Steam? Most definitely.This game requires you to think out-of-the-box, and will have you solving puzzles constantly.The dark humour in this game is hilarious aswell, and that only adds to the great experience.The singleplayer is great, but solving puzzles with a friend is possibly even greater, and allows for much more complex contraptions. Even after you finish the story, you can download heaps of custom-made community maps, which allows for tons of extra hours. I highly recommend it ;)			",118,22,3,6,10,2,12

												Possibly THE worst game in the L4D franchise. Gordon Freeman is a girl now and is being bossed around by some transgender Gman in a spooky eye thing, who is also british. There is no sign of Coach, Bill, Tyrone or the infamous Pillman, who we discovered after playing the first installment of the Minecraft franchise. For a JRPG the combat is pretty weak, the loot system is awful and you can't even speak. (no rhyme intenderino). Overall this game is pretty solid, i'd give it a strong 10/5			",186,16,2,29,18,0,8

												Wheatley says he has to drop from the rails several feet above me. He's nervous about it. I promised I'll catch him.... I lied. I watch as he thunks and rolls on the ground. He asks me to pick him up. I refuse. I watch as he entices, begs and cajoles me to pick him up. Several minutes later I do. Then he asks me to plug him into the wall. I decide to dance around the room with him instead. The cycle of begging and wheedling begins again. After several minutes he gives up and falls silent. I plug him into the wall. 10/10 Would torture Wheatley again.			",147,57,1,24,18,1,20

												It goes without saying this is exceptionally one of the greatest first-person shooter games that doesn't require real bullets, competitive teamwork, accurate aiming, targets and most other common mechanics that are found in that specific genre to make such a fantastic and charming game. This title demonstrates what it always had shown in the prequel; perfect gameplay and immersive story-telling. Thus, this sequel opens the gateway to the remarkable Portal series.Now, imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game, and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one. From what I could honestly tell you, this game took the first games mechanics, and widened the story much more bigger and exceptionally better. Portal 2 is by far, worthy of the 'Game of the Year 2011' awards.			",111,8,0,6,5,1,3

												If you played Portal 1 and liked it, you are going to love Portal 2, it has everything that the previous game had to offer and much more!The campaign is much larger than the previous one, with a bunch of new mechanics as well. What really shines here though is the fantastic voice acting from the antagonists, Wheatley is hilarious with his british accent and GLaDOS just being cynical and awesome as always!It has a lot more challenges as well and the multiplayer works perfectly. The game is a masterpiece indeed!			",532,183,35,76,85,10,146

												Honestly I'm still baffled and I'm clueless how to start this review. I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.I highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play.			",34,6,0,9,8,0,6

												Portal 2 takes elements of adventure, puzzle, platform and first-person action games and blends them into a unique genre mix. It builds on the foundation of its acclaimed predecessor, takes all the gameplay elements that made it great and vastly improves them in every aspect. With that said, I strongly recommend to play Portal first. If you don't you will still play through the sequel without any confusion, Portals plot was minimal (even though exceptionally well-written) and the basic puzzle design is picked up in Portal 2. But you would miss out on a great game and why would you want to do that?Once again you take over Chell, Portals female protagonist, who finds herself rudely awakened from a cryogenic sleep and imprisoned in a small chamber inside the Aperture Science testing facility, an environment vaguely familiar from Portal - vaguely because a lot seems to have changed since your first time around. Some of the structures at the beginning of the game are indeed places you have already seen during your first escape but this time they are clearly aged, in a state of decay, overgrown with plants and seemingly abandoned. But soon you will have to make your way through unknown terrain and new test chambers that turn out to be anything but abandoned. Fans of Portal will be pleased to learn that GLaDOS makes its reappearance. Something else is different right from the start: You are now accompanied by a british-accented robot named Wheatley, who insists that an escape can only be accomplished together.Portal 2 really shines in the writing department, the story is much more developed compared to the first installment. Many unanswered questions are revealed, such as bits and pieces of Aperture Sciences history and the origin of GLaDOS personality. Where GLaDOS was Portals only speaking character you now get to hear your goofy sidekick Wheatley and, through pre-recorded messages, Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson. All voice actors did an outstanding job and manage to really bring all three speaking characters to life.If you played first-person shooters before you will be instantly familiar with the controls, mouse for camera movement, WASD to move, space to jump and left & right mouse buttons to shoot your portal gun. All game mechanics from Portal like pressure buttons, disintegration fields and of course the eponymous blue and orange portals, that are surprisingly simple in theory but make for surprisingly diverse and challenging puzzles, made it into the sequel and in addition many more are added: different sorts of gel that let you jump higher or run faster, catapults, light bridges, air tubes and lasers. Each element of its own already makes for complex puzzles but once the game starts to combine several of them you're in for a real challenge.Compared to its predecessor, the game provides a lot more content. Not only is the single player campaign about twice as long, it even adds an extensive second co-op campaign. Two players open a lot more puzzle opportunities and the devs managed to use them to their fullest. But don't worry, you are given various means of communication. It's recommended to simply plugin your headset and make use of Steams voice chat feature but even if you don't you can still highlight spots by simply pressing a key, start countdowns to synchronize your actions, open a small screen that lets you look through the eyes of your co-op partner and perform small gestures to communicate non-verbally. Or you could just utilize the ingame chat to write.But it doesn't end here. Thanks to user generated content the replayability is almost unlimited. When you mastered both campaigns, just tap into the huge library of player generated chambers, even whole campaigns are available to download, and keep playing with ever new challenges.When you compare the visuals to Portal you cannot help but appreciate the excellent graphic design. While Portals test chambers looked bland and lifeless, they're now impoved with many small details. You have moving, transforming environments, plants growing through cracks in the walls and especially the vast, subterranean areas later in the game are a stunning sight.Long story short: Portal 2 takes the premise of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. A game for the books.			",852,352,51,147,135,14,240

												""Daddy, I want a portal gun"".  My 6 year old tells me one afternoon.  ""Um, sure, okay"" I say.  The idea never enters my mind that he is talking about a video game.  A few days later, I notice something while he is playing Scribblenauts.  Right there in his inventory of scribbly things is a portal gun.  THE PORTAL GUN. ""OHHHH!"" I say.  Now it hits me.  Where on earth did he see that?  I must be a terrible parent.  Okay.  ""Daddy can play for you"" , I say with a gleam in my eye.  We proceed to install Portal 1. Right when I start the game, he grabs the keyboard and takes over.  Before I know it, he's blazing right through the levels.  Then, he says, ""Let's play Portal 2!""""Portal 2?""""YES! I want to play Portal 2!""   Well.  I actually do own Portal 2, so fair enough.  It's been on my backlog for too long.  We proceed to install Portal 2.  And on to the beginning...it's as if we are transported to a movie.  He's a little scared.  I ask him if he wants to stop it's okay - it may be too scary.  He squirms around, but as soon as the puzzles start he is ALL OVER IT.  Wow, this little guy really knows how to play.  Physics in a hole - WHATEVER - a 6 year old is blazing through this.  He gets stuck on level 15.  I GET STUCK ON LEVEL 15 TOO.  This puzzle is wrecking my brain, but then I realize I simply did not notice something.  Solved and on to the next.  The both of us play through the game off and on for a few months, he turns 7, and we put in a good chunk of puzzle solving together along with a fair amount of co-op play.  I even bought a controller adapter for a PS controller so we could play side by side.  A week ago we both finished it ( on the really scary parts I let him leave the room ).  I can't remember the last time I had so much fun completing a game with a partner.  My own little guy.  Thanks Valve for making a great game that is a also a wonderful father-son game to play together.  He proudly wears an Aperture Laboratories t-shirt now. ",1011,387,22,98,38,6,71

Posted: July 15, 2016
												Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.Portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.The dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.  Conclusion  Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it. Rating: 8.5/10  Pros  	- The simple story that ends with an excellent climax.	- Excellent voice acting.	- Very good dialogue. 	- The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles.	- Length.  Cons  	- Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing. If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

The plot twists genuinely aren't expected, unlike most games where you know what will happen around every corner. I'm a huge fan of greek mythology so when I found the oracle turret, my mind was blown! Cave Johnson was definitely a great character to introduce and to help us find out more about Aperture.

												Because I'm a Potato.....Valve's Portal 2 is the award-winning sequel to the hit game, Portal. I do recommend that you play the first one in order to fully understand the whole story and for you to be familiar with the concept of Portals ^_^You play as Chell, a mute girl that just does what she does :/ I seriously don't know what's going on in her head xD anyways, you wake up in a room years and years after the events of Portal and the adventure starts there.... Let the testing begin >:) Story is well-driven and easy to follow. Although the game features more/less 5 characters (including Cave Johnson and Caroline). They're so lively and have their own iconic personalities, Wheatley is awesome :D You'll never get bored of the dark humor continuously thrown at you xD I have to say that the story is a bit short compared to their flagship game, Half-Life.The Source engine is by far my favorite. I'm playing this game at a consistent 100fps set to High/Very High.... no crashes in-game, and absolutely looks delightful (especially the lighting). It can also run very well on older systems, which is always a plus for me ^_^ Music is what you'd expect from Valve....... just pure awesomeness, nuff said xD Gameplay is the same as the first game. It's not a generic shoot-everything-that-moves FPS but a puzzle-solving FPS that involves Portals and require you to have a keen observation on your surroundings and lots of thinking. I honestly was stuck on a puzzle for a good 20-mins. until I went ""Ohhhhh, now I get it"" and proceed to finish the test chamber xD It stands out because of its one-of-a-kind gameplay and does it extremely well ;)Overall Experience: I have yet to try out the co-op mode, but the single-player campaign left me wanting more. That feeling you get after solving a test chamber is quite awesome ^_^ and doing it again, but faster, feels even more rewarding. Although I have problems launching the game (It just might be my Steam client) the game itself runs incredibly smooth. I give this game two-thumbs up ;)			",205,35,8,24,19,1,21

Portal 2 is even better than PortalPortal 2 is another game on my ""must play"" list. Portal was already incredible, yet somehow Valve managed to make the sequel exquisite. Positive:- Fluid, responsive controls.- Amazing puzzles, both for single player and co-op.- Great difficulty curve.- This time there is actually a story. We finally get to learn more about Aperture Science.- Wheatley joins the party. In combination with GLaDOS, their unique personalities and humour just make Portal 2 incredible. Basically fantastic script and voice-acting.- This is not just a remake of Portal. This time gels are added to put a unique touch on puzzles. Basically an upgrade in gameplay and difficulty.- Co-op mode! Like single-player, the co-op mode is brilliantly designed, and addictively fun. - Community-made maps (basically endless fun and challenges).- Companion cube still loves you <3Negative:- Still no cake.- You require a competent buddy for co-op.Conclusion:Valve really outdid themselves this time. There really isn't much else to say. The praise I gave in my Portal review is just as valid here, although it must be said that Portal 2 deserves even more praise.  You would be a fool not to play Portal and Portal 2. ",191,40,3,20,12,2,11

												Portal 2 is the phenomenal sequal to Valve's award-winning Portal. Many were dubious about Portal 2, prior to the release, due to how amazing Portal was, feeling that nothing could live up to it, unless the game were truly amazing. Valve managed to pull that off by miles.Portal 2 is hugely fun, with a remarkable and hilarious storyline which blends so perfectly from the first game it's almost seamless, with Stephen Merchant bringing an extra layer of awesome as the memorable character, ""Wheatley"". On top of the great story, you have the map maker, which provides hours and hours of enjoyment on top of the original packaged challenges. Get it.Nilesy			",312,139,3,47,47,5,46

Portal 2						* 10/10Sequels often suck. NOT THIS TIME!!!!Portal 2, as a direct sequel, doesn' change much in the base formula, so the game is still based on a more polished version of the Source Engine, is still a First Person Puzzle game but adds a lot of innovations and elements that grant this sequel the status of ""Epic"".After the end of the first Portal we're once again in the Aperture Science Labs, but we're in a different section of the facility and the first thing that can be noticed is that the structures decay and some vocal messages hint that an indefinite but consistent amount of years have passed, and thanks to a Personality Core named Wheatley we try to escape the falling facility. Unfortunately We'll have to pass through the remains of GLaDos, causing her awakening and forcing us to become again Her Guinea Pig. You think this is a spoiler? FOOLS! From here the game will show it's improvement as there actually is a HUGE story plot, with plot twists and revelations that will amaze you room by room making you eager to finish the game to see the end and forgetting I've ever revealed you that (predictable) detail.The innovations won't stop with just a (GREAT) plot, but the gameplay is incredibly improved as well. You won't have to deal with just portal related riddles, but you will face gels and funnels, where blue gel will make you bounce high, orange will accelerate your walking speed, white will allow you to spawn portal on every tainted surface and funnels are transport streams that will make you float in their direction the moment you cross them. You can't even imagine the combinations of all these elements, no to mention the events in the story.Level design is improved far beyond the first chapter's standards. There will always be minimalistic design test chambers, but we'll have to walk beyond interspaces, factories, dismantled rooms, and immense areas that will make you wonder how big is this Aperture Science supposed to be. You will end up digging so much that you will end up in one of the very first sections of Aperture Science realized at the time of its founder Cave Johnson.And here comes another aspect of Portal 2. They went so far with the game that hired English (obviously) Writer and actor Stephen Merchant to voice Wheatley and American (obviously) Actor J.K. Simmons to Voice the 'Murican Cave Johnson... And their accent and characterization is definitely great.Soundtrack is a greatly appreciated news this time because even though it is subtle and thin during most of the gameplay it has some dynamics so you'll hear little flashes of melody when you're solving parts of puzzles, but most importantly there are more studied melodies especially during scenes or scripts.The last improvement is the other section of the game... Because portal 2 has a single player campaign... AND a Cooperative campaign. We can invite a friend to play via internet and solve 6 sets of chambers precisely studied for cooperative gameplay.+++PROs+++ STORY.  Unbelievable, but portal 2 has a great story showing you the origins of the Aperture Science Labs, GLADos and more, and it somehow has little links to Half-Life 2 as well! Great Final, totally love it. CHARACTERS.  This time there are more characters, besides GLADos. All her sarcasm always makes me laugh as well as Wheatley's stupidity, and Cave Johnson's 'murican attitude. GAMEPLAY.  In Portal you use portals. In portal 2 you have Gels, Funnels and the hallucinating combination of these 3. COOP CAMPAIGN.  Great Coop campaign, perfect game to play with a friend. SOUNDTRACK.  Seriously this game has a very nice electronic soundtrack, this was unexpected.---CONs--- LENGTH.  This time the Single player campaign lasts significantly more compared to Portal and the Cooperative campaign is quite consistent as well, but I still believe they could have lasted a bit more... MOAR!! SEQUEL.  I've completely lost hope for a third chapter for Both Portal And Half-Life... ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

 About Portal 2Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it. Release Date: 19 Apr, 2011 The GameplayPortal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.The GamemodeThe dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.All in All  Portal 2 is a nice Koop Game!9/10 From MeSweep	 ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												Very Impressive. Because this message is pre-recorded, any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments. – GLaDOSThere is so much to be impressed about in Portal 2. From the amazingly developed and memorable characters to the brilliantly balanced puzzles, Portal 2 may well be the best puzzle game ever created.I purchased Portal 2 about 11 months after it was released. I didn’t even know who Valve was back then, I didn’t know what Source was and I didn’t have a clue about anything to do with the Portal story, but after playing it, Valve quickly became my favourite game developers. Back then, I was only interested in 2 things. Gameplay, and graphics. We had only recently upgraded to an Xbox 360 from a very old, original PlayStation, so the games I’d bought for the Xbox were, as you can imagine, amazing, but Portal 2 had better graphics than any other game I’d been playing. I was also interested in the gameplay, and Portal 2 nailed it with its hilarious characters and difficult puzzles. As I grew up and played the game over and over again, I noticed things I hadn’t noticed before, like secret rooms and signs on the walls, which got me into researching the story. Trust me, the story is deep… but, this review is spoiler free, so I’d encourage you to do it yourself!Portal 2 is a brilliant combination of puzzles, well developed characters, and an RPG element, which makes the game amazing, and better than any other puzzle game I’ve played before. To start off with, you wake up in a strange room, and you meet a funny little “ball” robot named Wheatly. He guides you over to the old testing tracks, but on your way to escape the facility, he accidently turns on the main core robot, who controls everything, GLaDOS! She “forgives” you (play the oringinal portal) and instead of killing you, she spares your life and instead makes you test, as she indicates “for the rest of your life”. I’m not going to say any more, because it would be a shame to spoil it for anyone, but I highly recommend you play this game. This is one of the few games I would say to buy at full price if you have enough, because it’s totally worth it. There is also a co-op campaign that has a completely different story, it's great to play with a friend. Thanks for reading!			",481,149,14,40,47,10,76

A simply ingenious puzzle game. I can't even imagine how much time it took for the creators to make this game. Portal 2 is a unique puzzle game where the player must follow a stupidly humorous robot to escape the lab that they are stuck in. Overall, the game was complex and intriguing, with many laughs along the way. This game is very frustrating, so if you don't enjoy getting stuck while playing a game then this game is probably not for you. Otherwise, Portal 2 is a fun game that is interesting to all types of gamers. There is a co-op  gamemode, but it's only available for local gameplay (don't quote me). There is also a steam workshop for this game so you can play community made maps.Portal 2 is not really worth $20, because the story mode gives you around 10 hours of gameplay. However, the game regularly goes on sale. Buy it at its cheapest price ($3.99).Definitely a must buy for all clever gamers 10/10  Portal 3 confirmed  ",13,3,0,1,5,0,1

												Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun.At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10			",24,13,0,3,1,0,1

												Few sequels face as daunting a legacy to live up to as Portal 2. The original stands as one of the cleverest and most revered games ever made and so the pressure is on for the return visit to Aperture Laboratories.As before, you play a human lab rat subjected to the experimental challenges dreamt up by the evil computer GLaDOS. The goal is to exit ever more puzzling rooms with the aid of a Portal Gun that lets you shoot up to two virtual doorways onto walls coated with a special substance. Once you've got two portals in place you can walk through one and come out of the other.Initially the challenges thrown at you are straightforward: zap one portal onto the wall next to you, put the other onto the wall next to the inaccessible exit and then simply walk through the portal. But after a few gentle introductory tests to familiarise you with the concept, Portal 2 starts presenting you with brain-aching challenge after brain-aching challenge.You might need to open an exit by placing a block on a pressure pad, but the block is located on an inaccessible ledge high above you with no obvious route up. To reach it might involve using portals to reach a high walkway before firing a portal into the floor below and the other into the wall opposite the ledge with the block, so that when you jump down into the portal on the floor you are sent flying out of the other portal and onto the ledge with the block.And soon the complexity is cranked up with the addition of other elements to the puzzles such as tractor beams, gels that alter the properties of surfaces and bridges made out of light.Like many puzzle games the description often sounds more intimidating than the reality, but Portal 2's environmental conundrums are truly challenging: requiring lateral thinking and dissolving notions of up, down, left, right, forward and back. But while the challenges can be bewildering, the sense of achievement you get from solving a challenge that had you stumped is immense with confusion melting away into a thrilling Eureka! moment.Portal 2's fiendish puzzles would make a great game on their own, but the game doesn't compromise on setting either, moulding a captivating story out of its puzzling action. The script and voice acting is nothing short of fantastic: the acidic wit of superb*tch GLaDOS balanced by the bumbling Bristolian tones of Stephen Merchant, who plays an equally amusing rival AI.Beyond the single-player mode there's a set of co-operative two-player challenges that can be played in split screen or online. The two-player challenges are even tougher than the single player so the need to discuss with each other how to tackle each puzzle is paramount. While this means it works best when players are in the same room, Valve have done a sterling job of providing players with tools to indicate their ideas to other players so that the online mode works almost as well.The only possible criticism you could level at the game is that once a room is solved, there's little reason to go back. But when a game delivers as many moments of joy and satisfaction as Portal 2, you'll need to be a rather sour soul to make such a charge.Ingenious, engrossing puzzler and a worthy sequel to one of the greatest games ever!

												The original Portal was a success I don't think anyone anticipated. Arguably the best part of The Orange Box, it was a remarkably clever and original puzzle game, with an absurd amount of character. But to everyone's disappointment, it was all over too soon. But we were not forsaken; quite the contrary. With Portal 2, a direct sequel (by which I mean to say you should play the original first, as well as before reading this review which will inevitably spoil it), Valve has not only given us a bigger and better game, but one of the greatest pieces of interactive entertainment ever. I mean no hyperbole when I say Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece on a grand scale, and a game absolutely everyone should get the chance to play!Fair warning, there is no way to talk about Portal 2 without spoiling everything that occurs in the first game, so keep that in mind if you have yet to play it (by which I have to ask, why the heck not?). Disclaimers out of the way, Portal 2 once again places you inside Aperture Science, an expansive underground scientific research and testing facility with fewer ethics than living test subjects. Which is to say just you, Chell, reimprisoned and put to sleep for who knows how long, only awakened when the entire facility is on the verge absolute destruction. Unlike before however you aren't alone, now joined by a naive little robot named Wheatly. With GLaDOS in pieces, escape seems like a simple objective. That is until someone flips a switch to turn her back on...The original Portal is still one of the best written, and most hilarious games I've played, and yet its sequel is miles ahead of it in every possible way. With only a handful of characters, it's amazing how charming and witty every line is. Hilarious, clever, and maybe even a little touching, I can't think of a game that even comes close to matching how perfectly timed and expertly written every moment of Portal 2 is. It's minimal cast does an amazing job of breathing life into the decrepit facility, and makes the simple aspect of walking from one door to the next and immensely enjoyable activity. And it isn't just the writing that deserves remark, but how Valve has implemented it to seamlessly interact with your actions. Characters respond to what you're doing in such a realistic manner that it's hard to believe they are simply programs setup to do so. With so many games relying on traditional, uninteresting storytelling mechanics, Portal 2 moves the medium forward in ways developers need to take note of.However smartly written the dialog may be, it's in the portal puzzles themselves that Valve's intelligence really shines. Not content to simply reiterate the same mechanic we saw in the first game, new elements such as propulsion gel and laser maneuvering cubes are added regularly and consistently expand on the basic portal mechanic in unexpected and interesting ways. Every time I thought I'd seen all the ways a mechanic could be used, Valve expanded the spectrum and again astounded my expectations with the outwardly simple variances in usage that never would have occurred to me. Even on my second playthrough the puzzles never stopped being incredibly rewarding to solve, and giving me just enough of a challenge to consistently test my intellect in a wholly unique fashion.For how old the Source engine is at this point, you'd never know Portal 2 was built on it based on how it looks. To this day I am utterly astonished at what Valve manages to pull off with the engine, and this is easily its most impressive usage to date. The once sterile Aperture Science is now presented in a gorgeous display of disrepair. Walls crumbly around you, lights flicker and cast dazzlingly shadows, plants grow through into the facility, and it all looks absolutely amazing! Even with it's makeover, Aperture is still an eminently memorable and distinct place to inhabit, and the increased variety in locations does an impressive job of realizing the sheer size of the facility which we've only scratch the surface of.I always forget to mention the soundtrack, not because it isn't a fantastic accompaniment to your journey through Aperture, but because it blends so well with the rest of the game that I almost forget it's there. That's not a slight against it however, it's a complement to how suited it is for the game that I can't separate one from another. It's a brilliant score with so many layers I couldn't begin to pick it apart to describe it to you (but thankfully I don't need to, as even if for some reason you don't play the game the soundtrack is freely downloadable). As for the ending, well let's just say Jonathan Coulton is a genius and leave it at that.And then there is the coop mode; yet another brilliant way Valve has surprised me, turning the solitary campaign into a multiplayer experience that demands cooperation. This is what impresses me the most about the mode; it isn't just two players going through a game designed for one, but an entirely new set of levels purposely designed to force you to work with your partner to complete them. It's amazing what can be accomplished with two sets of portals, and this is fully taken advantage of in what are perhaps the best designed puzzles in the entire game. If you don't have a friend to play with, go make one for this game. It's something you shouldn't miss out on.I can't get over it. I've been impressed by Valve numerous times in the past, love Portal to death, and thought I knew what I was getting with it's successor. But Portal 2 is so much more than that. It's an incredible achievement in everything it attempts, from it's outstanding script to the bewildering puzzles and spectacular presentation. It's the best game Valve has ever made, one of my all time favorites, and without a doubt one of the medium's greatest accomplishments!Now if you'll excuse me, there's testing to do.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												This game was absolutely fantastic! It really blows the first game away in terms of looks and story. The game is much much longer and you really get to see behind-the-scenes of the Aperture Science Facility and its backstory, which is really interesting. The banter of Wheatley and the frenemy vibe between Chell and GLADoS is amazing and hilarious. I did not have any of the motion sickness problems that I had in Portal.  Also, you get to put a portal ON THE MOON. Epic, just epic. Why are you reading reviews for this? Just buy it. You may be the last one to.			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

I've beat this game 5 times and I've speedrunned it. If I can't stress how much I love this game, I want to state that I really love this game. Ughh until I do a proper review, WHICH I WILL. I can only say that this is truly a masterpeice, and I have no complain about this game. This is in my opinion the example of a perfect game. I've gifted this game nearly 10 times now.  I've made it my tradition to gift Portal 2 to any friend I introduce to steam to,  and let me tell you know, each one of them ends up being an loving portal fan. Buy this game, no questions. It's meta critic of 96 and the most positively review steam game for a reason!  ",176,33,6,21,14,2,17

												This game is priceless, not only it has more problem solving test chambers, a longer storyline and more maps, but it contains some good Human Relations humour from the British Bot, Wheatley. You can also play as Co-op with your friends and solve more portal problem solving.If you are keen on Science or a Sci-Fi fan then this is the game for you. The solving ideas aren't that hard as the key parts are for looking at flat white surfaces, as portals only work in there, working out the gravity, pitch and yaw when jumping from portal to portal. The clues aren't that cryptic for trying to work your way to journey on in the game. But this game also comes with new features like light bridges, suction rays, replusion gels and many more.Well what are you waiting for? Buy this awesome game!			",240,43,10,20,27,2,27

Posted: August 15, 2016
 In Short - Portal 2 is one of Valve's most recent titles, and is very well made, I think we can all agree. It is the sequel to the critically aclaimed game 'Portal'. Now, Portal has become so popular that I don't believe I need to explain the game's mechanics; it is such a simple concept and yet has been parodied and explained 100s of times across the Internet. Portal 2 expands on why we all loved Portal, with new mechanics, new story, new characters and new settings. The game keeps it's original mix of difficulty and ease to make a title that you can play in almost every mood. Portal 2 has so much replay-ability, that I've played the game 77 hours; beating the single player campaign three times and the Co-Op campaign twice, gaining every achievement. And not once did I get bored of playing, not once did I think 'this is getting boring', as quite a few games would make you feel after 77 hours.  More In Depth - Portal 2 starts out waking the player up an unknown amount of time since the last game. The announcer even breaks, from saying so many '9's, of time that you've been there. After a fairly slow start, you get thrown into testing almost immedietly. Although I'd like to ignore the story for the sake of the review, it helps keep the flow of the game. The story puts together reasons to add new mechanics, instead of just slapping them in and hoping fans overlook it. The game makes sure to keep its ties to Half-Life in secrets hidden around too, which I find really interesting. Portal 2 does even better than the original game at keeping it puzzle centered. It keeps itself faithful to what Portal built, and made tests that require quick thinking like an action game, as well as thought out and intricate thinking like a puzzle game. Not once does the game hand the player a weapon, which I feel is a good thing. Portal is like Half-Life's puzzle counterpart. You go to HL for action, and Portal for puzzles, which I really like. Singleplayer Portal 2's Singleplayer mode carries on the story from Portal, as I said. We are given a ton of new tests, with new mechanics such as mobility gels, light surfaces, excursion funnels, but keeping Portal's mechanics such as flinging, momentum and turrets, occasionally mixing them together to make a game worth the label 'created by Valve'. Our original only characters, Chell, GLaDOS  and the Companion Cube  are brought back in Portal 2, each as main characters, still, while bringing on a new main character, Wheatly. His character was made very well, with the perfect voice actor for his lines, the perfect lines for his voice actor, a hilarious personality and more. He was even added into Team Fortress 2 as the Ap-Sap (my favourite sapper). All in all, Portal 2's singleplayer is definitely fun to experience. It's something you can sit down and play in the evening and feel relaxed. A mug of tea, a warm blanket, and some puzzles.  Co-Op Now, I think I should probably preface this with a disclaimer; I don't dislike Portal 2's Co-Op. I've played it with three friends, and gotten every achievement for it (thank you Ambiticus, Roger and Sammy for helping me with all the achievements :3)I felt, personally, that Co-Op was very shoved in your face and rushed, unfortunately. After how much I enjoyed Portal, when I bought Portal 2 I was hoping for something very similar; more story, more challenges and more of my favourite characters. And, although there are those things, there could be more if it wasn't for Co-Op. We are given two, barely distinguishable robots with 'personalities' that are really just a couple forced quirks given to them. The puzzle aspect is good, they use the two players to make puzzles impossible without teamwork, and, obviously, four portals, getting you across new distances otherwise impossible with one portal gun. However, this is just brought down by the rest of it. GLaDOS is written completely different to how she usually is. Instead of a passive-agressive AI, she is clearly just agressive, which really makes no sense. One of the best things about GLaDOS is that she is terribly passive-agressive, and for whatever reason, in Co-Op that is all just flung off the table, and instead we have a new GLaDOS; one that is just plain agressive, messing with the robots' friendship by saying different things to eachother, exploding them at the end of each course, and generally just being mean. This doesn't fit her at all, and it makes me almost sad to see how they did this. PROs 'n' CONs PROs -  Both single player and two player gameplay. A level creator, connected to the Steam Workshop, so you can make your own puzzles. Many achievements, to leave an achievement hunter with a lot of work to do. These achievements span across single and multiplayer. Gameplay faithful to the original Portal. Although the above statement is true, they still seamlessly add in new mechanics to enhance the gameplay. A fairly big game. Playing through singleplayer and multiplayer without achievement hunting was probably almost half of my time in this game. Fun, lovable characters, that are easy to get used to.CONs -  Co-Op, although the gameplay is fine, is very rushed in nearly every other aspect. The characters don't have personalities, although Valve obviously meant for them to, GLaDOS isn't normal, there is very little continuity, and- Honestly, I could go on, but a rant isn't what I'm here for. I have to say, honestly, that Portal 2's ending song, Want you Gone, will NEVER be as good as Portal's, Still Alive. I like to have subtitles on, in case I miss a line of dialog, and there were multiple times in which the words and subtitles did not match at all. Words, even sentences would be off. The developer commentary just wasn't that great, compared to Half-Life 2 or Portal. Final words Portal 2 definitely has good and bad aspects. It is a fun game in many ways, yet I believe it just wasn't finished. It had potential, and while most of it was met, it just isn't all there. I'd recommend the game, but I hope that Portal 3, whatever form it takes, will be better. Enjoy this review? Did it help you choose whether to buy the game or not?Join my group, Cipher's Take On for more reviews, and share your own too!~ _BillCipher   ",97,13,0,5,7,0,9

												I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and PORTALS thing seemed weird to me even though I like science fiction.BOY WAS I WRONG. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad.BTW I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel. So it's that amazing.What are you doing in this game? It's actually the sequel to the first Portal game like I said. But basically, you are trapped inside a training facility. A training for puzzle solving. The thing is, the facility is offline, and nothing is working. It's derelict. And the show runner is nowhere to be seen. Then you are woken up in the middle of all this, by your only friend. Together you try leaving it while solving puzzles that concern teleportation and portals. Then things happen. And everything turns weird.Like I said, there is a lot more to it than this, but this is all one can reveal without spoiling it. This game would be a solid 10/10 which I wouldn't rate for the 90% of other games in my library.+ There is online CO-OP and a mod for local CO-OP+ Challenge mode+ Download community-made levels+ Hilarious voice acting and jokes+ Seriously intriguing story+ I never thought robots' personalities would be so awesome. oh wait+ Time travel+ Ripping your hair off during puzzles+ Resist temptation for walkthrough videos+ Co op is amazing (laughed a bit too much)+ Single player is amazing+ Teleportation makes sense and no sense at all at the same time+ Nice music+ Nice graphics10/10 would love Glados to the death again			",47,18,2,7,13,0,2

												You know, I only write serious reviews for games I feel that are precious to me, Portal 2, obviously is one of those games. I started this game knowing nothing about the main story from Portal 1, but just playing the game normally perfectly explained it all, everything about this game; exemplary. From the soundtrack, to the puzzles, hell, even the robot characters have colorful personalities. And finishing the game brought a tear to my eye, while saying ""Man, what an adventure that was."" Definitely one of the most unforgettable games of all time, so do I recommend this? HELL YES.			",47,6,0,8,3,2,1

												This game was well worth the wait and This game is highly addictive, and there's plenty of new content to satisfy any Portal fan.There's always many alternative ways for game makers to go with the story, and quite a few are not what we expect. Portal 2, while keeping the ""oh my god I did not expect that!"" factor, did a perfect job in taking both the game and the story to a whole new level in the Valve universe (talking about Half-Life & Portal since they're both in the same era)Overall: It's amazing and refreshing to see, and play, all the new and fresh ideas Valve has come up with this sequel.If you are a Portal fan, You should already have bought this game. If you have played Portal but are not deep into it like many people are, you should still Play this game.what a ride, from start to finish, Valve took the high road and only made one cake reference.10/10, Valve.

												What's not to love about this game? Such a cool storyline, amazing level design, and memorable characters. Not forgetting to mention the crisp soundtrack of the game. Valve, you've outdone yourself with this masterpiece. I know you probably see this kind of review all the time, but I sincerely thank you for creating such a great game.			",198,25,12,25,32,5,27

												Great game, but still no cakeKudos to the guys at Valve for bettering an original yet again. Portal was a masterly work of originality and ingenuity and PORTAL 2 takes the principles laid down in the first game and develops them even further. The puzzles are even more creative and there’s a much wider variety of environments to work your way through. And these environments are often quite breathtaking to behold, which is in itself impressive given the age of the Source engine. Graphically it’s huge, expansive, and immersive. And then there’s the writing of course. Valve have always been at the head of the pack when it comes to the quality of the writing behind their games and P2 is no exception. The script is sharp, dry, and delivered to perfection by the cast. To top it all there is  now the option to play community-created maps and coop games with others. What more could you want? 5/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												Portal 2 takes place in the distant future, after the events of Portal, and was released in 2011. Like the original Portal, Portal 2 is a First Person Puzzle game created by Valve. Again  you play as Chell, the survivor of Portal, who must once again use Aperture technology to escape. With the help of Wheatley, a personality bot, you have to overcome various obstacles in an attempt to escape through the delapitated testing chambers.  Portal 2 has a more indepth storyline than the original, and gives a little back story into Aperture Science and it's founder; Additionally, aside from Single player mode, Portal 2 also has a cooperative campaign mode. Portal 2 is as much of a fun puzzle game as the original, so if you enjoyed Portal, you should buy Portal 2, because it has better challenges and more story.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Welcome to the Portal 2 store page. You are about to purchase one of the most the best games that has, and probably will be made. Yes, the game is that good. Why, you ask? Well;The story is well written and feels solid.  The pacing is perfect and manages to balance that fine line between delivering a consistently pleasing experience to you as the player but without leaving you feeling pressured or overloaded. The puzzles are challenging, but not mind-numbingly so; you will likely not be destroying your expensive hardware out of frustration at least.  The graphics are quite good and even though the game will be turning four years a few month's from now, Portal 2 is testament that Valve's source engine (which itself is growing quite long in the tooth) is still a force to be reckoned with. The sound design in this game, from the AI's comments to the  environmental sounds manage to create an atmosphere that feels truly amazing.And Finally, what makes Portal 2... 'PORTAL 2!'  the enigma known  as GLaDOS. There really is nothing that could be said about this entity that hasn't been already; except for the simple fact that GLaDOS is a lot more human than AI. It's uncanny. And also, depending on how much you've heard/read about the game, creepy. And sad. Damn.The only real downside to Portal 2 is that given Valve's history with the number 3, another masterpiece like this is unlikely to happen in the near future. It's a shame really.Would I recommend this game to anyone? No. I would recommend it to everyone.			",483,110,20,40,23,4,49

												Throughout the single-player campaign I was constantly surprised how clever you could use this ""simple"" formula of two portals, and I admit, I had to look one or two times in a walkthrough - still, it's manageable for others like me who don't solve puzzles often and I really liked the feeling of accompishment after solving a puzzle and the reward of getting a new piece of the story (told in an unusually silly and amusing way; ""lemonades"").And the coop-campaign: I don't know any other game where you solve puzzles this way. Really, it's a lot of fun and shouldn't be missed out either (if you have someone to play with). It was also one of the first games on Steam with Splitscreen support. Although it's made only for two players only, I'm pretty sure that it also would be funny with three or four people locally, when everyone's trying to figure a puzzle out together and the gamepads get handed around.Lastly, there's the Workshop integration, and boy oh boy, are there a lot of puzzles. There are very complex ones with custom terrain and more simpler ones, created with the later released simpler editor, and there's an endless supply of new ones. I acctually recommend trying the simpler editor out yourself, just to see how hard it is to come up with puzzles.Anyways, this is a game that everyone should play, even if it's not your genre. Because this is one of those defining games others will draw inspirations from and have to be measured by for years to come.			",275,101,5,30,11,1,20

												This review assumes you already own and have completed the first Portal, my review of which can be read here.Game: Portal 2Developer and publisher: Valve SoftwareReleased: 19 April, 2011Genre: First-Person Puzzler with ComedySetting: ""At least 50,000 years"" after Portal 1, Aperture Science Enrichment Centre, Upper Michigan, U.S.A., EarthSpoiler-free plot summary: After the events of the Portal 1, you, Chell, find yourself awakening in the mysterious science facility once again. However, at least 50,000 years have passed since you were last conscious, and the facility is now in ruins. Your only hope of escaping it once and for all is to put all of your faith in one of the incompetent robots built to maintain the facility, Wheatley, who also wants to escape.Full review: Portal 2 is a far superior game than its predecessor. Being a fully fledged game with a unique story, unique humour, new game mechanics, and new environments, Portal 2 makes Portal 1 look like a tech demo.Portal 2 can take several hours to complete; not just because the game is longer in general, but because the tests are far more varied than Portal 1's, and require longer thought and planning. There are several new mechanics introduced in Portal 2, such as the Thermal Discouragement Beam which replaces the High Energy Pellet seen in Portal 1, but shares the same basic concept of directing the projectile into its respective ""catcher"", and Mobility Gels which can either make you jump higher or run faster. When all mixed together, these can make several of the later test chambers far more difficult than the previous ones, which means having to think outside the box (sometimes almost literally). At first, these chambers might seem too hard or impossible to complete, but once you've worked out the solution, the ""Aaaaah!"" moment makes the struggle (and perhaps frustration) very much worth it.Unlike Portal 1, Portal 2 doesn't have any advanced or challenge map packs; instead, Portal 2 has a challenge mode, which is a combination of the least portals created and least time taken challenges in the Portal 1 challenge map pack. Also, instead of having just six chambers to be challenged on, you have every single chamber in the main campaign to be challenged on! An online leaderboard is also included in this game mode for those who want to compete with friends.A new game mode introduced in Portal 2 is the map maker. In a parallel universe, founder and CEO of Aperture Science, Cave Johnson, has developed a multiverse device which can send test subjects into other parallel universes, who can test, and steal, that parallel universe's test chambers. These test chambers are the player-made ones you can download and play from the Steam Workshop. With the right know-how, you can make your own test chambers and upload them onto the Workshop for others to download and play.Another new game mode introduced is the co-op campaign. Set a few weeks after the events of the single-player campaign, two robots GLaDOS has created (you and a buddy) are tasked with solving tests which are used to train you for upcoming missions GLaDOS has planned. This game mode also includes its own online leaderboard and can also have maps made and uploaded to the Steam Workshop.As said before, the story and humour of Portal 2 are unique. There are several twists that make you sit on the edge of your seat, and the humour, being incredibly dark, can make you laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off, and make you feel uneasy, or even guilty about it. There are several new environments introduced that weren't seen in Portal 1, such as the behind-the-scenes areas of the test chambers, and the ruins of 20th Century Aperture. And although there is less of a mystery aspect to Portal 2 compared to Portal 1, those with a good eye (and ears) can still find some things you'd find out-of-place, even in Aperture Science.This game is, no doubt, one of the best games ever made. Do I recommend buying Portal 2? Of course I do! Especially if you like puzzles, or humour, or video-games, or not breathing neurotoxin. For NZD$23.99, I'd wait for a sale for when this game is $17 - $20 before buying it.			",169,15,3,28,10,3,26

What I liked about the game 	Funny and entertaining characters; like Cave Johnson, Wheatley and Glados. 	New items added into the puzzles.   	Plenty of mysterious things to find throughout the game; like Rat man hideouts. 	Portal 2 is twice as long, with plenty of areas to explore. I really liked exploring the old part of Aperture. 	Puzzles get gradually harder, and things change a little when you're in the old part of Aperture.	Steam achievements and extra content. 	Interesting story that takes unexpected turns. What I disliked or was disappointed with 	Still too short. 	Wasn't as keen on the soundtrack this time round. Conclusion Outstanding game; Value managed to pull it off again. Everything I loved about the first game is still there. If you liked the first portal game then I highly recommend you buy this. 94/100 ",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

												The single player did something I thought i would have never witness. It made the robots feel utterly alive and deep with emotional expressions. It is at least a 5 hour speedrun from what I have heard but a very great ride indeed.For those who enjoyed Portal 1 and are afraid that this game isn't that much of a improvement. Fear not for this game delievers tons of new elements within their puzzles. Like gravity rays and cubes that reflect lazors. Along with tons of other neat additions. The co-op in this game takes place after you beat the game in single player. Which is well thought out and creative addition to the game. That makes partners relay on each other in order to reach their goal. Overall I would say Portal 2 did something that is not really done well before. Made creative and innovative designs to their game which allow partners relay on each other to navigate through the maps and the story itself.			",608,187,12,74,51,9,81

The multiplayer is incredibly fun and I honestly wish Valve would make a full multiplayer Portal game (we need Portal 3 first). All in all a perfect game.			",18,5,0,2,4,0,0

												I want to make this really clear, Portal 2 is amazing. I am disappointed with the number of people who have complained because A) they think the game is to short and B) they bought DLC obviously selling 'trivial' content and C) they believe the visuals are poor.Before I discuss those two points I want to say why I think this is game is incredible, firstly it succeeds in being a great sequel, it's added loads of new gameplay mechanics to freshen up the puzzles and gameplay and hasn't tainted the original essence of its predecessor. The production values are astounding there are huge set pieces, stunning effects and some of the best voice acting i've ever heard in a game from the cast, particularly Stephen Merchant for his excellent performance as the babbling Wheatley and Ellen McLain returns scary as ever as everyones favourite AI baddy GLADOS.Now to comment on the three main criticisms i've seen. The singleplayer took many hours for me to play (at least 7 hours) and I haven't even touched the cooperative mode either which is sure to take several hours as well. The day 1 dlc is quite obviously not meant to ""extend play"" and is instead meant for novelty, also you can buy all the dlc in a bundle for about a quarter of the price than if you bought each item separately (if you still bought it and feel cheated then your too stupid to be playing this game). Finally, while the source engine is indeed quite old, even on my PC the game certainly looked impressive and those of you with more powerful computers and the people who will buy the console versions will enjoy the game looking even better.In conclusion, Portal 2 is a must buy, a certain contender for game of the year, the game is smart, clever, well designed and a joy to play and I highly recommend picking it up but please if you haven't already please play the first game because it makes the experience that much better.P.S. The ending is a great one, I can't believe some people didn't like it, It will leave you wanting more is all i'm going to say			",185,20,6,16,16,2,16

												Well, well, well... we are in the presence of a game that exploded with the boundaries of FPS capability.Portal 2 is one, if not the best, bulletless FPS of all time.Mindblowing and addictive puzzles will keep you until the very end.10/10 - ""Great work!

												This game is just one of the best games Valve has to offer.Hiring the team from Tag: The Power of Paint and having Wheatley, Chell, GLaDOS, and the adorable turrets combined in one game about physics and portals, this game has to be the best puzzle game ever out there.If you haven't bought this yet, you have missed out on a very good experience. Trust me, its a great game, and worth your money.			",198,18,7,19,8,1,6

												A wonderfully-crafted sequel to an already original FPS game! This is, in a nutshell, Portal 2.Released 4 years after its predecessor Portal 2 offers the following new features:--- While the core mechanics return some new elements are present and needed for puzzle solving. My favourite was the gel machine. These machines release gel and the gel-filled surfaces can be used to accelerate the protagonist in order to reach a much higher ground. Also, surfaces can be made available for the use of portals with the gel.--- Again, we have an extremely funny, relatively long and story-based single-player campaign. We have new voice actors (such as Stephen Merchant who usually works with Ricky Gervais - those of you familiar with Gervais's comedies will probably grow to like Stephen immediately) and the usual dark sense of humour is present throughout the single-player adventure.--- Co-op campaign is now available and demands that the two of you closely work together. Some of the stages can be tough (in both campaigns) but they are still heaps of fun.--- Graphics have also been improved. As we are in the same facility but after the events of the first episode, many of the chambers have walls that show aging and / or deterioration. This immediately allows players to immerse themselves in the story and realise that many years have been passed since the previous adventure.The game has numerous mods available and just recently a paint gun mode has been released. As the gel-mechanics was based on a game called Tag: The Power of Paint, it was only natural to see the gun incorporated into the world of Portal. In fact, the creators of that game were hired by Valve and worked on Portal 2.Portal 2 is an excellent sequel and is worth every penny spent on it! This is a highly recommended game along with its predecessor.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												There is no game like this one. Portal 2 manages to soar far above the original Portal and add yet another level of intricate artistic enrichment and dazzling gameplay. I sometimes feel like I shouldn't be allowed to play this game because it is so fun, and should go back to playing other games that get dwarfed in comparison to this one.When a novel gives me a strong emotional response to its contents, I applaud it for being superior to many others. When a game does this, I know I'm playing Portal 2. Some of the dialogue is the funniest I've ever heard; some of it deeply bothers me and drives me, in true anger and passion, to beat the game and prove myself... to a character in a video game. I actually feel like I am the main character in this game. At the very least, I empathize with them 100%.And the gameplay... like I said, there is nothing like it. Riding the learning curve of Portal 2 and realizing that no, some of the levels really aren't impossible, are incredible experiences. The achievement and satisfaction of solving a difficult and very intellectual 3-D puzzle feels wonderful.You may have heard people speak well of this game, and I'd like to speak greatly of it. But if all that hasn't convinced you to get it, then maybe this will: it's just fun. It's an FPS with no gun, a purely intellectual flourish of discovery, mystery, immersive gameplay, and, if you stay with it, the greatest victories you can find on Steam. Please get Portal 2 (after you get Portal). Please do it. I would be happy for anyone that decided to pick up and play Portal 2, because I would be absolutly confident that they will have as much fun in it as I did.			",106,13,0,2,4,1,6

												Portal 2 is an amazing game, and it's obvious the team at Valve have worked hard to deliver a whole new experience better than the first game! The voice actors are great, giving personality to the characters of Portal and Portal 2, and the storyline really catches my attention, making me want to keep on playing and find out more! Portal 2 introduces many new gameplay elements, such as puzzle building and gels, and the co-op mode delivers endless hours of fun! I would recommend Portal 2 to anyone just wanting a great game they can experience countless times without getting bored!			",35,7,0,2,6,1,5

												Portal 2 is the amazingly imersive and fun sequel to the amazingly imersive and fun videogame known as portal. It isn't however one of those sequels where they give you the same product with prettier graphics and do nothing to improve on it; the game contains many great new innovations. At its core, portal is a puzzle platformer game, and this aspect is combined with the story in a way that forces you to think of outside-the-box solutions. The characters are all compelling; even the silent protagonist gets some characterization during the game. She's smart, good at jumping, and is able to jump over both emotional and physical obstacles with ease. When things get tough, and she has a murderous AI tryng to kill her at every turn, she just keeps testing.The game has essentially three modes. There's the story, co-op, and community made maps. The community for this game  is amazing. They take all the resources Valve has lent them, and they make games barely recognizable as part of portal. It could also go in the opposite direction, and you get a game that feels like it should be a part of the main story. One major downside is that you cann't play co-op, or in  community maps, if you lack an internet connection. There are many great maps that make you think and analyze the tools you're given in different ways; It's a shame that you can't just download and play one of them while on the go. If you're not into puzzle platforming, in-depth and imersive storytelling doesn't impress you, and you don't like any of your friends enough to play this with them without committing murder, this isn't the game for you.10/10			",75,11,0,9,2,0,2

												Great sequel to the inarguably best puzzle game ever. Portal 2 expands the story of its predecessor and gives a lot, new elements to add to the game challenge. It also has better graphics and longer gameplay.One thing that I love in this game that didn't exist in Portal(1) is the Co-op mode. Nothing beats the fun of you and your friend strategizing their way through the chambers.Summary, I think this game is a must have for almost everyone. If you have Portal(1), you must buy it. If you haven't both, I recommend you to buy the portal bundle. It is a pity living your life skipping this masterpiece.10/10			",410,126,15,77,52,5,66

												The game Portal 2 contains one of the most interesting stories I have ever seen. It's catchy from the start to the end. This game makes you think, not only about the story, but also in the gameplay. You need to logically find out what to do, and sometimes it's very difficult. You gotta love Glados' sarcasm, Wheatley's madness and of course Cave Johnson's ideas. 10/10			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												This is my first review so please don't judge me if I fail to follow the form. Few years ago my brother and I played this game. When he saw it on winter holiday sale he ""made me"" buy it for both of us.I finished single player first and I just love quotes, both Wheatley's and GladOS's. Single player felt longer then first game's and that sudden fall and change of surrounding is great. Cherry on cake is credit song which I only saw on Portal games and  make these games so special.I also like fun that doing these achievements brings, from throwing yourself into pit to breaking screens that results with some funny Wheatley's quotes.I think many people will agree with me when I say that co op is equaly good but even more fun the single player.That is the element of game that I spent most of my in-game time on. Playing standard co op levels seperated into 5 groups of courses (not counting bonus courses) is great way to first learn game basics (in case you didn't play single player) but also to realize how good is your partner (how good reflexes he/she has, how much time is he/she willing to spend thinking, is he/she too stubborn to be played with, can you two understand eachother and how good host he/she is). I can say I played with at least 10 different partners I met online and finding few that I really enjoy playing with was not easy task.I also love the fact it has option to design your own test chamber and publish it on Steam Workshop pretty easily. Thanks to that you can, while in game, browse for the test chamber that is on your level (to be honest probably everyone after playing standard co op or/and single player for few times gets better on understanding game rules so he/she can solve harder tests more easily), subscribe and play it. There are whole collections of tests, some even with custom graphics and voices used to tell you original story through testing. You can choose from racing test to very complex one that require thinking. Playing this game you can very easily catch yourself asking how did time pass by so quickly. One of my co op partners and I spent over and hour playing just one test, but I don't regret a second because it was so much fun :).I am going to finish this with conclusion that this game connects different people which all have one thing in common- they are ready to do some testing :)I really hope I didn't fail form and this review helped someone decide to buy this game and be satisfied with it like I am.

 Basic Information:Genre: Action, Adventure, First-Person.Developer: Valve.Publisher: Valve.Release Date: 19 Apr, 2011.Story:The storyline of this game is great. The story isn't short it's a great length story, with very mind blowing test chambers that take time to complete. Portal 2's single-player campaign returns to the labyrinthine Aperture Science facility, an underground complex lorded over by an insane A.I. named GLaDOS. The main character, Chell, is perhaps the only surviving human in the facility. Multiplayer:When you've completed the singleplayer campaign, you're not even halfway through the game, there are tons of levels yet to explore. together with a friend, you will face many new challenges requirering teamwork and good timing.Gameplay:While the base foundation of Portal 2 is still the portal puzzling system acquired from the original, many elements have been added that breathe new life into the mechanic. These fresh aspects include lasers which destroy obstacles or energize power outlets in order to help you progress, gels which can be used to coat surfaces and allow you to either speed run, super jump, or portal your way to otherwise unreachable platforms, several different ways to traverse gaps with new bridge types, and much, much more. I noted in my review of the original Portal that I enjoyed the way you could use momentum to launch yourself through portals, and Portal 2 furthers this feature by kicking it up a notch. Prepare to use Portal 2's flawless physics system in some truly awesome ways. The last great aspect of Portal 2's gameplay is of course the puzzling, which is much more complicated (thus more rewarding) and skill taxing than the originals. The only con I can think of as far as gameplay goes is that it can often break up the flow of the narrative if you get confused on a puzzle, and you will. Besides this small grievance, I absolutely believe that Portal 2's gameplay is superb and a great improvement from the original.Design & Graphics:The game looks great, it runs well on any modern pc, and the specifications match the performance and graphical output. Really great Graphics for  year 2011.Audio/Music:The game sounds great. the OST is nothing special, but it gets the job done in the game. All explosions and sound effects are fine. The voice acting in this game is also great, and the dialogue can be quite funny. Controls:The game uses your standard FPS WASD and mouse controls, but also supports a special razer controller, and Xbox gamepads.Difficulty:The game's difficulty depends on your puzzle solving skills. There is no difficulty or hints, should you get stuck and not be able to proceed, then you will need to turn to the internet. I can understand how one would get stumped in this game, with some of the testing chambers being massive. Workshop  Support:thanks to Portal 2's workshop support, everyone who owns the game can make levels very easily and upload them to the workshop for others to play. so if you like the concept of the game but already finished the story, you should definitely check out the workshop.Pros Amazing story. Great Co-op campaign. Steam Workshop Support for a ton of maps. Very nice electronic soundtrack. Consistently clever and challenging puzzles. Great graphics.ConsNone.  Score Rating  9.5/10 ",129,40,2,11,8,2,7

												Portal 2, the sequel to the original masterpiece that the whole Valve community loved. This one is better.I am going to give it some Pros and Cons:Pros:-Longer story than the original Portal-Jump height increased a little-Better graphics-The Cooperative Testing Initiative-Replaying the tests from the original Portal-New designs for the Cores, GLaDOS, The Turrets and more-Fun stuff in the game (Serious injuries may occur -GLaDOS)-Great Easter EggsCons:-Defective Turrets-A line for Caroline being unused-""Don't Say Goodbye"" being unusedI really really really REALLY love this game and I highly recommend playing it! :)Thank you for reading,-MetalEDIT: I've come back to this review that I made on Portal 2 and I just wanted to put a note. Yes, nine people found the review helpful but I'm just putting in here just in case.As some of you may know, the Defective Turrets are in the Cons section. This was only because I had a terrible opinion on them. Now I like them.Also, the unused Caro-lines (hehe). I made a mistake that it's not just one unused line, there were plenty more, obviously.Thanks for reading,Robbie Rotten, The Number One Pyrocynical Fan			",4,1,0,1,2,0,0

												Simply the best Valve game. It took the brilliance and innovation of Portal and formed it into an actual full fledged title. Proof that Valve still dominates PC gaming and knows how to bring the public high quality titles.Try it. Ignore the childish naysayers on here and just bloody try it. You will love every second of it, especially if you loved the first Portal. And if you've not played the first Portal, don't let that deter you. The game stands up on its own perfectly well, and I'm sure it'll be seen from now on as the benchmark for all games that fall within its genre.Game : 9.0/10Graphic : 9.5/10			",244,94,11,24,16,0,27

												Very fun game to play if you feel like sitting back and playing something more casual. Puzzles are fun and challenging, and the graphics are nice. The farther you get, the more you have to use your head. Some puzzles can seem pretty impossible at a first look, but it really makes you think. My favorite thing about this game was any conversation with Wheatley (The robot who accompanies you throughout most of the game). I liked him very much. Definitely recommend if you like to play something snatchy.P.S. I'm in space. :D			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												Portal 2 isn't just a sequel to a physics-based puzzle game, it is the triumphant return to Aperture Science; what lacked the first Portal was a stronger narrative, Valve fixed this issue and delivered a story driven puzzle game, adding new elements to the award winning formula made back in 2007, a better soundtrack, highly improved graphics and varied testing chambers. Although the game may seem short, it will still be one of the best times you will have in your life.+Portal gun strikes again+Improved graphics+Amazing narrative +Attractive soundtrack+New testing elements+Fun Co-op98/100 Masterpiece ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now I've already played this game to death as well as the first one, but my feelings for both haven't changed. Portal 2 still remains to be one of my favourite games of all time. The gameplay mechanics are spot-on and the challenges never feel too frustrating or out of place.But I believe the writing is this game's greatest achievement. The dialogue conversations between Chell and GlaDOS have never been funnier, and the chemistry between each of the characters is marvelous. I always had a laugh when playing through this game, and it's rare that a game does that for me.Buy this game. I assure you that you shan't be disappointed!			",109,13,1,14,5,0,2

This article analyzes the tone and design of the excellent single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, eventually concluding that the original Portal is the stronger title.[. . .] I think it’s appropriate to close by reiterating that Portal 2 is a wonderful game. It’s fun and highly polished; its co-op campaign is one of the best co-op experiences ever devised; and its level editor and accompanying Steam workshop integration are practically endless sources of new content.

												Portal 2 improves on what Valve did in Portal. This time around story is a major focus, alongside improved gameplay and new mechanics to help you solve the puzzles and make it out alive. There's also co-op, it's fun and community created test rooms to extend your playtime!The cake is still a lie, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ortal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it.Release Date: 19 Apr, 2011The GameplayPortal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.The GamemodeThe dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.All in All Portal 2 is a nice Koop Game!

												I Played through most of this on my Xbox that's why my gametime is low!This has to be one of the best games ever made! It has the funnest gameplay ever, it's about the gameplay.. and the story, and the writing and the characters. Easily the best game by Valve.  The story is just great, I don't wanna spoil anything but you will love it! You see 2 people in the whole game and you would learn to hate/love them (Specifically Love/hate the first, Hate/love the second), their dialog is so funny and the voice acting is amazing. Remember the 1hour really fun game with Portals? Well, Portal 2 is here with a great length, hugely improved over Portal 1 and more creative puzzles that make you stop and think sometimes unlike the firsts easy puzzles.You have a portal gun, that creates Portals, you use these potals to go through test chambers and from the start you just ""solve puzzles"" (No, actually just that) until the whole story turns around! They even added a seperate Co-op campaign with a whole new story and a new campaign that is just as amazing!I would easily give this a 10/10!			",173,40,2,21,13,2,32

												In a way this game want to teach you something...the cruelty of the humans? the corruption of the power? the importance of the cooperation? the devastating effects due to the abuse of the experimentation? And so on...play to find your point of view about it....But back to business!This game is really really really cool! Based on interactive puzzles this game will make your hours flying away like an airplane directed to the other side of the planet.As the name suggest you have to use portals to move yourself from a point to another, or redirect laser beams, or to move objects...or to throw them....or even to throw yourself!The gameplay is fun, but it will easily put a sad face on you in some parts...and vice versa. The co-op mode is indeed the best one I've ever seen. In this game the co-op mode is FINALLY a true co-op mode (and I will say ""co-op mode"" another time just because I like to say ""co-op mode"" today). If you don't talk with your partner, if you don't plan to do stuff at the right time, if you go ahead alone....forget this game...is not for you; if you don't cooperate you will be unable to pass the first co-op level.The fact that this game is even multiplatform compatible means that you can even play it with friend that have this game on PS3. This is a very interesting and good thing.The graphic is indeed good, mostly based on HL2 engine (well...is a Valve game...lol) and the sounds are pretty nice too (funny the music based/created on the laser beams or in other puzzles you have to solve); and the support of the contoller will put a smile on the console's enthusiast.The story is related to the first portal and as I said in the beginning the single player mode is more deeper than a simple game; a very good observer and listener will easy understand what this game wants to tell you...probably in its own way but still it is a message.Overall:Graphics 8/10Sounds 8/10Gameplay 9/10Co-Op Gameplay 10/10Longevity 9/10			",339,51,13,34,21,1,32

												This game is so much fun! The puzzles are not only harder than the ones in Portal 1, but they have a fun aesthetic and are not just made to torture your brain. The co-op mode is awesome, and honestly the only thing about this game that could be better is co-op Course 5, Test Chamber 08 because it's way too hard! Anyway, great humor, hard puzzles, fun puzzles, great story, I'd definitely give this game a 10/10.			",10,3,0,1,1,0,0

												This game, like others I've played and enjoyed, thoroughly execute a weirdly-strewn-together story that just makes sense once you implement the later parts of the game (before re-arriving at the top of the center). The boss battle was a bit more dissapointing than I'd like to anticipate, but I appreciated it nonetheless, and it's earlier stages before the boss foreshadowed the ending boss battle.

												""Portal 2"" is a masterpiece.Its amazing work in puzzles and enigmas surely would dazzle anyone, but the big step-up regarding the first game, ""Portal"", was definitely the plot, which evolved and was more prioritized. Not only that, it also delivers something else: a dark, black-humor-ish atmosphere that bestows upon the game a deeper sensation, thus envolving more thoroughly the player.It should also be mentioned that the soundtrack of this game is truly remarkable and original to its core. It really was a breath of fresh air to me.Valve, once again, has not disappointed.			",57,22,0,0,4,0,14

												A great sequel to the already popular older game ""Portal"".A creepy setting with more of a backstory than the first, you meet a ""friend"" named Wheaty as you both try to escape.After activating (because ""turned on"" is sexual and strange to say when starting a computer) GladOS or that ♥♥♥♥♥ from the first game, you are literaly flung into testing chambers again as Wheaty tries to break you out. Only to later find out that he is crazy and ends up nearly killing you and GladOS. Through playing this game you learn the secrets behind the company and its founder as you travel into the older parts of the labs.I feel that this Portal has more of a story, while the first game focused more on helplessness and not being in control while being watched. I also feel more connected to this game, getting into this universe and being surprised with the shocking turn of events that take place. Sure, I'm not good with puzzel games, so I had to cheat a little and no clip to get to other parts of the game. (I am special. OK?) I am happy with the end results and the ending (no, I am not telling).Stuff:Sounds: 9/10 - Wheaty and GladOS are amazing in this game, and the sounds help too, the voice acting is great!Soundtrack: 10/10 - Here is a fact, and just youtube it if you don't belive me, aparently the soundtrack is so large and it   changes with the gameplay, it will take years for one song to repeat itself.Graphics: 8/10- Ok, Ok, its getting up there with age, but it is still good. I now feel like I am in some Sci-Fi Lab where crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥happens.ConTROLLS: 8/10 - Same from last game, left mouse for one portal, right mouse for the other.Story: 10/10 - Some secrets are spilled.Overall: 98/100This was a great game, but a game where I will only play once, because it is so linear. There is no choice. Sure, I may go back a try some puzzels without cheating.Maybe a Portal 3? Please? :)			",26,1,6,1,11,0,9

												Portal 2 is far more refined than its predecessor.Better graphics.  Granted the game did came out 4 years after.Better humor.  81 min into the game I must have chuckled 4-5 times at GlaDOS's remarks.Better physics.  The cube and various objects **feel like** they bear actual weight this time.Better puzzles.  I no longer get disoriented solving them.I actually care about Chell, that flying bot with blue eye and of course GlaDOS----this didn't happen while I was playing Portal.While I'd gave Portal a borderline 6 / 10, I'm inclined to rate Porta 2 at least a 8.5 / 10.

Go make a brand new test chamber(s) and publish it/them on the Steam workshop! Huh what did you just say to me!? You got bored with making test chambers!? Well, by this time you will want to play the main story line again, and then the Co-op missions, and then make some more test chambers!!!

												Portal 2 is a really good comibnation of FPS / Puzzle Game.Second part of a really nice series of puzzle games.And yes the Portal gun is back again only with a lot of new challanges to beat.It's not a basic and boring puzzle game when you go to stage one until you clear the game.Portal manage to add a really nice story mode to it so the game is fun big adventure to play.Only between stages things happen that makes it challaging and fun to play this game and let you keep on playing.I cleared the game / story mode around the 9 hours so it's not a really big game.What makes it fun you can now play with your buddy co-op to do all the extra missions that complete the main sotry mode.Portal 2 is a really good game and you need to try if you love this genre.I give this game a 9/10.

Welcome back to Aperture Science(Now with 10% more potato)TL;DR:While singleplayer is a simple and straightforward sequel to Portal, the second installment has a good replay value of its own as it features a variety of extra content, such as a co-op player campaign, plenty of user-generated puzzles as it allows the player some creative freedom in making their own challenges via the ingame puzzlemaker, and there are at least two available story-driven campaign addons on Steam. Portal 2 carries forth the the core likable elements from the predecessor in a charning, quirky sequel.OverviewPortal 2 is a sci-fi physics FPS-puzzle game taking place in a chronologically-ambiguous position in the Half-Life universe. Following the events unfolded in Portal, the sequel brings the faces old and new to the player between the continuity of the experiment courses. It has an entertaining cooperative mode to enjoy with a friend, and user-generated content from the ""Perpetual Testing Initiative"" that brings the inner mad scientist of the user to life with the ingame Puzzlemaker.PlotTaking the place of the test subject ""Chell"" once more, the player accompanies her journey through the now-ruined Aperture Science facilities, meeting an old enemy and new faces along the way while solving the various puzzle challenges through the Enrichment Center's remains. The game also features some exploration of the past of Aperture Science, solving some possible loose ends and letting them know about the past of the lab complex. A dark humor-packed character development is noticeable between the messages left behind, and the new quirky characters introduced into the game.The co-op mode also reveals some details of Aperture through the portal experiment course between the two players.Singleplayer ModeThe singleplayer mode is considerably similar to the first game's mechanics, though with a number of twists. New testing elements and various new puzzle-solving techniques make the player think, move and portal their way through the tests with trial and error, either involving the classic testing elements such as moving platforms, turrets and acid pits, or new elements such as lasers and redirection cubes, crusher plates, catapult plates, among others.Cooperative ModeWithout some cooperation the players won't advance in this mode. (Literally. You really can't even get past the level selection if the players don't cooperate and play in such manner.) More advanced puzzle techniques such as timing and advanced portal placement are introduced with a fair amount of trust being in the hands of the partner player. The incompetence (or mischievousness) of either of the parts might end in hilarious failure results.GraphicsUsing an upgraded Source Engine, the game is able to render great-looking environments at relatively low performance cost. Highly detailed testing environments, from the ruins of Old Aperture to the production lines of the upper facilities, you'll see yourself stopping for a few moments to admire the scenery on the areas with more visible attention to detail.Music and SoundThe soundtrack of Portal 2 and its iconic eeriness, generally accompanied by the 'robotic' sounds inserted into the music tracks make Mike Morasky's work fit perfectly into the game.The sound effects of the game, not unlike the soundtrack, are highly detailed. From the slight noises of the testing elements to the rampaging avalanche brought by things like crusher plates in the game, every sound aspect has a high level of detail.The voice acting is priceless, the character dialogue (or, in most part, monologue) is now fitting to each character's personalities and role. Including names such as J. K. Simmons, Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain, Portal 2's VA cast is noteworthy in that regard.Content CreationAperture Science's Perpetual Testing Initiative -better known as the Ingame Puzzlemaker- is a tool both simple and intuictive to use. Simple controls and a range of elements available, the player can build test chambers to his heart's content with the tool. You can even export your maps to edit with the Portal 2 SDK, for further detailings like custom assets and elements.ConclusionPortal 2 is worth picking up if you're a fan of puzzle games, sci-fi or some quirky humor. The co-op mode warrants some hours of fun with friends, and the puzzlemaker and user-generated content will assure you some extra replay value.			",76,9,5,12,13,0,10

												Portal 2 is a truely unique puzzle action game which makes great use of a portal gun that can form two seperate portals which would allow the player to traverse the levels.A great sequel to the original Portal game, Portal 2 is a much longer game which features much more complex puzzles and introduces lovable new characters. The voice acting and dialogue in this game is amazingly entertaining and funny, I found myself chuckling multiple time during the game due to the character dialogues! The level design in this game is also great as there were some levels which left me stumped for quite awhile and it took me quite alot of brain power to solve them and that gave me a great feeling after doing so!This game features a co-operative mode which allows players to play with people in your friend list or complete strangers through match-making. There are some form of customization options such as hats in the co-operative mode that can be unlocked through completing the game. There was supposed to be more customization options available in a shop but it has since been discontinued. Trading is also unavailable which is pretty unfortunate as it would be great for players to exchange or sell cosmetics.There is also a level creation tool in this game which allow players to create their own Portal 2 levels and share it online with others by uploading it to the workshop! Several interesting extra content includes a portal 2 comic which serves as a prequel to the game and a super 8 (a pretty old movie by now) interactive game demo.Overall, Portal 2 is a very entertaining game with great puzzles, characters and voice acting. I would give it a 9/10! A must buy if you enjoy action puzzle games!			",189,45,10,23,14,6,18

												I could play the various tests again, and again, forever.  You know, if you recommend such a game to someone else they might devote their existence to creating science.  Aperture Science.  From scratch!Oh GLaDOS (and other personality constructs), how you inspire me...What drew me into this game is that this is no real shooter.  In fact, turrets and bombs are the only combat elements in this game.  Your goal: to escape to the surface, i.e. to think your way out of all those tests in the hope that someday the system will let you go.A masterpiece:Puzzles: 10/10.  Workshop items vary, but the core puzzles (Over 60 of them for Single player and co-op modes) are well-made.  Not so hard that you feel like giving up, but not so easy that you feel like you did nothing.  At some point in the game, you'll have to ""test on your own recognizance,"" with almost no visual hints, but by then you should be well-trained in the ""science"" of Thinking With Portals.Art: 10/10.  On some of the new testing elements, the blue/orange theme is kept.  Additionally, the various test chamber themes seen as the story progresses are memorable.  Fairly visceral, but not to the point where it distracts from the puzzle solving.Sound: 10/10.  The music is incredible, as are the ambient sound/scapes.Storyline: 8/10, although I must say that the behind-the-scenes stuff for Aperture Science is very impressive!Dialog: 10/10.  Memorable lines by all the characters, with humor to match....Physics: 9/10.  You can't be 100% perfect when portals are involved (visually and otherwise), but the algorithms are much improved from the original.Commentary: 9/10.  I miss hearing Ellen McLain's voice when she wasn't GLaDOS (a similar thing goes for all the other voice actors).  Other than that, the developers have truly insightful stuff!Other details depend on what system you're running, as well as the settings you have.And finally, this awesome game as an awesome in-game editor, in addition to being a Source Engine game, so you can create your own puzzles.  Be sure to check out the Portal 2 Authoring Tools (not for the faint of mind, though).Recommended gameplay (but I recommend playing the original Portal first): Start with Single-player mode.  Then move on to co-op and the developer commentary (for continuity of the story line).  Finally, when you feel tired of the 112 standard maps contained within the game, take a look into the workshop, where you'll find hundreds and hundreds of tests.Overall rating, with some generous rounding: 10/10.  These are also the same odds that you should enjoy this game.Update for Thanksgiving 2016: get nominated for the Test of Time award.  5 years and counting and this game is still one of the best games in the history of great games.

												Easily in my top 10 of best PC games of all time, Portal 2 has everything that made the first game popular and expanded it:Great story that leaves you wanting to know more, well thought puzzles with new mechanics, local or online multiplayer (!), atmospheric music (I'm talking big bucket movie quality here)... It also has new characters and a good voice acting with funny dialog lines.Packed with secrets/easter eggs and beautiful environments, this game will catch you more than a space core shaped pokéball.

												Portal 2 is an amazing game. If you are considering getting the game, the only problem is that you don't own it yet. The story is completely unforgetable, the gameplay is completely unique, and the puzzles are addicting. The Coop campaign is amazing and really makes you and your friend work together in a way that no other game can require. After you have played the singleplayer and/or multiplayer campaigns, there are an infinite amount of custom chambers you can play, and you can also get carried away with creating your own custom chambers. The game has a really simple level designer, where you can create puzzles almost as complecated as you want for either one or two players. I have played over 2 and a half thousand hours of this game, and I am still enjoying creating and playing custom chambers almost every week.			",78,6,1,13,2,0,9

												Portal 2 is a very, VERY excellent game. Being the sequel to the GOTY Portal, I was expecting it to not be as good. But, upon starting and playing the game, I realized I was immensly wrong. The setting is immersive the moment you see it, and it still has the fun, portal-based puzzle style to it. With the addition of many more mechanics (gels, lightbridges, etc.) this game provides many hours of fun and thinking. The ever present GLaDOS is much more cold-hearted, but with the addition of Wheatly, Portal 2 still has the wit and charm of the first game. If you have played the first game, this is a MUST-HAVE. If you are new to the series, get it, and see how you like it. Adding together the awesome story, and a multiplayer option that makes both you and a friend of your choice either succeed or argue together, this game definitley worth more than the $20 it is being sold for. 10/10.

												This game is a masterpiece. It's story and puzzles are out of the park. If you only buy one game, ever, it should be this.Story:This game takes place in a run-down version of the aperture labs seen in the first game. But, unlike it's predecessor, you are helped along by a sphere named wheatley. As you try to escape, you end up waking GLaDoS, the antagonist from the first game, and you are thrown back into full testing. It's now up to you alone to escape.This game's story is very deep and intricate, with nods to the Borealis in some easter eggs, and even the direct mention of black mesa. It has characters with immensly deep and suprisingly dark backstories, and is a game I contemplate still to this day.Puzzles:The puzzles are much more difficult than the first game, and less hand-holding than before. It introduces some nice new testing elements, as well as makes new use of the old ones. The puzzles never end, either, thanks to the ""Perpetual Testing Initiative"" (Level editor + Custom levels on the workshop). The co-op puzzles double the fun, and difficulty, resulting in a massive need for teamwork. Graphics:The game is suprisingly beautiful, for running on a game engine from the turn of the century. It's lighting and shadows outmatch other popular games, and they don't kill your system. My computer can run this game at medium settings, and my graphics card is an Intel Integrated Graphics HD 4000 (Planning on building a PC soon, using a laptop). It's still a good looking game, and will probably hold up for a while.Audio:This game's music is always there, whether ambiently in the background, or boosting your pulse as you run through broken halls, death on your tail. The music is actually availiable free on their website, 3 full albums with all of the music included in the game.Multiplayer:This game's co-op is brilliant, with customization of the two robots ""Atlas"" and ""P-Body"". Using the ping system to coordinate, you don't even need a microphone to communicate with someone random you meet. It even has a bit of story to the game, with the last level group revealing a large secret. The custom levels recentley updated to allow multiplayer, so this dosen't end for a while.In conclusion, the game has a ton of nice features, content, and is really worth the $20 USD, if you are a first time player. I'm planning on getting a few more copies when it goes on sale to hand out to my friends that don't already own it, and play through with them. I love this game, and it's what got me back into PC gaming.			",140,48,0,16,36,0,34

												The game is really awesome, coz there are level you need to control/timing to catch up a certain object, it gave me time to think much to enable to go to the next level and also felt the challege of the game.Sometimes I asked myself ""should I give up in this level and watch some walkthrough of this?"" . Then I think it over again until I found the way to success. Because what's the point of buying a puzzle game if you're gonna spoil yourself to it?. Just keep calm and never give up, if Plan A didn't work, the alphabet has 25 more letters! Check every corner that you can use your portal.sorry if my english is bad ",203,64,6,29,13,7,19

												What can i say about this game?? It's just amazing! It's so unique has the first one of the series was. I liked Portal but this one is just way more, everything! The co-op was hell of fun! I just regret not have played it before! It has really funny momments, a really good interacting system, a nice gameplay. And some puzzles are actually hard! Me and my friend has some pain in the a** solving some of the later puzzles in the co-op history. But it was just a great experience, we had a lot of fun and i recommend 100% this game to everyone! And to get a friend to play it with you! This game really disearves the 95 ms that it has. It's a masterpiece!!			",117,7,2,12,4,0,11

												Well,there is probably nothing to say about this game,because there are no words existing that could describe this truly amazing franchise.In my opinion there will be no Portal 3,because i think that Chell's story will continue in Half-Life 3 (if it will come out of course).Shortly,if you have completed this game before,but a lot of time has passed you should definetly play this game again for some nostalgia.

												Just get it. Thats all I have to say. It has a great story line and some great mods that are out now and are being made. The game could be played over and over and challenge your friends with challenge mode recording your time and portals for indivual levels. There are some great easter eggs and funny moments. You should play Portal:Staying alive before you play this game, but is not required. Some of the story makes no sense because you havent played the first game. This game has community levels which makes it fun after you have played the whole game over and over. I would defiently get this game in a bundle but Ive got both Portal and Portal 2 on xbox360. It is currently $8.74 for a bundle which is totally worth it.			",54,5,2,3,9,4,4

												By far and away, the best game in existence.  Portal was one of the best games of all time, then came Portal 2, the perfect follow up.  I’ve logged in about 2100 hours playing portal 2 and I have no intention of stopping.Pro:- Richly detailed world- Unique puzzle elements- Lengthily game play- Engaging storyline- Plot twist- And many, MANY puzzlesCons:- (I’ll let you know if I ever come up with any)Once finished with the original game you can see your own creations come to life by building your own chambers.  The editor is a bit limited so if you really want to make a truly custom chamber, I suggest that you learn how to program in Hammer.At the time of this review, Portal 2 was selling for $19.99.  Well worth it.  Don’t wait for a sale, buy it now.			",24,40,0,1,0,0,3

												The way I found this game was through people playing it on Youtube, this may have spoiled the main plot points, but it gives different opinions on the game, and those opinions were good ones, as when I played the game myself, I loved every moment of it.Chapter 1 handled the introduction of 2 characters (the player themselves and the personality core/sphere Wheatley) well, and was a good tutorial for players who haven't seen/played the previous game. As well as this, the (re)introduction of GLaDOS was done well, and sets the players the tone for how the next segment will go.Chapter 2 was a good introduction back into GLaDOS' test chambers, and had lower difficulty as it was still near the start of the game. It gives introductions on how the Emancipation Grills/'Fizzlers' work and can be used as testing elements. It also introduces brand new testing elements to this game: Lasers/Laser Redirection Cubes and Aerial Faith Plates. These elements are given equal introductions, and are simple to pick up on.Chapter 3 introduces a third testing element: (after some advanced tests using Aerial Faith Plates) Hard Light Bridges. The way that they are used in its introductory chamber is to cross a large pit that is full of toxic goo. Later on, they are used to block Turret fire, which is a creative way to use them. Speaking of Turret fire, this chapter also re-introduces us to the adorable things known as Turrets. They act just like in the first game, and are still as innocent as they used to be. Chapter 4 continues using mixtures of Lasers/Redirection Cubes, Aerial Faith Plates and Hard Light Bridges in it's test chambers. Then, during Chamber 21, the Personality Core 'Wheatley' finds you and helps you escape from the chamber. With the best-worst imitation of an accent I've heard.During this segment, GLaDOS gives you the 'final' test chamber. (Including a heart on the wall! I mean, how could you say no to that!)Chapter 5 sees you go behind the scenes of Aperture, as you sabotage the only weapons that GLaDOS can use against you: Turrets and 'Deadly' Neurotoxin. I liked this part especially because it shows the inner workings of the facility, and how big Aperture really is. It also has some good dialogue too.[THE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE MAIN PLOT/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME]At the end of Chapter 5, the plot (and Wheatley) decides that the game isn't over yet, and brings you (literally) falling down to Chapter 6.Chapter 6 and 7 are interesting chambers, because you not only have to use portals and puzzle elements in the chambers themselves, but to get from chamber-to-chamber. The new testing elements of the three Gels was interesting, but I feel like Conversion Gel (White) is 'broken' when you use it in the PeTI (Chamber Building) because when you put it into a chamber you know that people will over use it.Story-wise, these chapters give a backstory to GLaDOS, and how she was made. Which was a nice addition. The puzzles, I feel, had a difficulty spike here, mostly in between chambers, when you have to get to the next Testing Sphere.Chapter 8... Chapter 8. Back in 'modern' Aperture and Wheatley's sheer idiocy has basically sent the facility into meltdown. The chapter shows just how the mainframe has changed him, and most of his dialogue is humorous. He's still evil though. The chapter introduces Excursion Funnels, which are used to move vertically, across gaps (in this case, bottomless pits) and to push buttons that are on the walls and ceilings. Oh, and Frankenturrets: two Turrets fused to a Storage Cube, which are the basic cube for this chapter instead of the regular Storage Cubes. (They're admittedly cute, and I wouldn't mind having a real one.)Chapter 9: 'The Part Where He Kills You'. Dragged the title out, a little bit (GLaDOS and Wheatley's dialogue,  the achievement and the soundtrack title all variants of the title) but it was funny the first time. This Chapter is the final one, and is basically an escape sequence where Wheatley throws EVERYTHING at you. There are two parts where you have to be quick with portals, which the game switches round if you shoot the wrong one, which is very kind. Also introduces Bombs. They'll be useful later.Also contains my favourite quote of the gameFinally, the Boss Fight and Credits: The boss fight was done well, using some of the elements from earlier in the game. And bombs. (Told you they'd be useful)I was fine with the difficulty of the boss fight, but it only uses the Gels, and nothing else. I would have liked to see some other testing elements in there, like Hard Light Bridges or Excursion Funnels, but the Gels were worked well into this part, so I'll let it slide for now.The credits were courtesy, once again, of Ellen McLain, and her wonderful singing. Nothing more to add than, in short, this game deserves the awards it's won, and is one of the best games I've played in a while.Oh, and the Co-Op mode is fun to play after the main game.It's own small campaigns are unique and add some information as to what GLaDOS did after Chell left. Nice touch Valve.			",6,0,0,2,1,0,1

												The perfect sequel. My only complaint for the first game was that it was too short. This game expands heavily on the story making you laugh out loud many times. I was worried the new gels and such might make the puzzles less interesting and more annoying, but Valve did a great job balancing new and old mechanics to create the perfect challenges. Plus they've added a hugely entertaining co-op mode. Another part that I never expected to work so well. If you have Steam you need to have this game series.			",2089,802,68,235,220,26,317

This game offers good graphics, very good voices and sound effects, and for shooter fans even some opportunities to destroy machine gun turrets with laser beams and blue goo. What fun - 8/10!

												You want a break from most of the mainstream FPS games that plague the gaming market? This is the game for you! This game will make you feel stupid and genius at the same time (you`ll understand why when you play it). The gameplay has no cons, except maybe getting glitched in portals (which is a very rare occurance). The story is deep and you`ll need to play the game through a few times, so that you understand it.

												Portal 2, 'nuff said. I do not think that any more needs to be said, this is one of the most brilliant puzzle/logic games ever to see the light of day on Steam - it mixes the dark/satirical humor that we all know and love from Portal 1, with even more shenanigans and evil twists from both previous and new characters, and if you're one for Portal ""lore"", so to speak, then this will shed some light on a lot of questions that were left from Portal 1.

												I finally got around to beating Portal 2. It was a great one. Once more Valve manages to provide flawless and fun gameplay with great narrative and storytelling, I admire the fact that in most of their games the main character doesn't speak. It still looks and feels great, even after almost 3 years after its release. It is fun both in single player and cooperative online multiplayer. There's tons of mods and user made maps out there so there's alot to play. If you're looking for a casual game to play with a friend or just by yourself there's no way in the world that you will go wrong with Portal 2, it's the sequel to one of the greatest first person puzzle games of all time.

Desafiante a más no poder y que además goza con una comudidad enorme para que podáis seguir disfrutando con más niveles.Pocos son los juegos que consiguen engancharme, pero Portal es uno de ellos y en mi opinión uno de los mejores que hay.En definitiva, ¡tenéis que jugarlo!

												It may be short, but boy is it sweet. Portal 2 is again one of those rare, perfect games.Playing through Portal, you'll be treated to delightfully subversive dark humor, which slowly gives way to a creepy, sinister atmosphere. The gameplay is rock-solid, too - challenging, but not unfair to the player. And without spoiling anything I can tell you that Portal has one of the best video game characters this side of 2000.Long after you've finished it, this game will stick with you.			",103,6,2,1,0,0,2

Se você for uma pessoa muito ousada, pegue todas as conquistas  e mostre o quão bem você domina sobre  gravidade, transferência de matéria e criação de energia. Brinque mesmo! São um bom número de horas que valem a pena cada segundo. Seja paciente e observe bem, não há nada acima de sua capacidade. Definitivamente, 10/10.			",263,65,11,24,12,7,20

												I finally got around to beating Portal 2. It was a great one. Once more Valve manages to provide flawless and fun gameplay with great narrative and storytelling, I admire the fact that in most of their games the main character doesn't speak. It still looks and feels great, even after almost 3 years after its release. It is fun both in single player and cooperative online multiplayer. There's tons of mods and user made maps out there so there's alot to play. If you're looking for a casual game to play with a friend or just by yourself there's no way in the world that you will go wrong with Portal 2, it's the sequel to one of the greatest first person puzzle games of all time.

												Maravilloso juego que te tiene pegado a el hasta que seas capaz de resolver todos sus puzzles. Si estás cansado de jugar siempre a lo mismo y queréis un reto, Portal (tanto ésta como su primera entrega) es vuestro juego. Desafiante a más no poder y que además goza con una comudidad enorme para que podáis seguir disfrutando con más niveles.Pocos son los juegos que consiguen engancharme, pero Portal es uno de ellos y en mi opinión uno de los mejores que hay.En definitiva, ¡tenéis que jugarlo!

There are some moments you do not really know what to do, it takes me 15 minutes to find you need but is ok. And worth the money and deserves this review.			",186,45,7,13,17,3,13

												Great game, but get it when it's on sale. I no longer feel it's worth $20. I found myself quite burned out after playing the single player. This game introduces new elements and has a very fun coop mode. Also has lots of mods, so you're getting a lot of content for a single game. I'd still wait until it's on sale, though.

												Thanks to the steam workshop (and the great geniuses contributing creating challenging and intelligent chambers) this could be considered in my opinion as a completely innovative game where the goal of each chamber is to make you think. The huge diversity of chambers created each week by community makes this game an infinite and ever new fun. If I had to choose only one game to play the rest of my life, it would definitely be the Portal 2, a true masterpiece of the valve and his beautiful source engine.			",305,59,5,59,36,2,37

												Portal 2 is a unique game with an amazing story, great characters and marvelous voice-acting! The idea is pretty simple, you put portals and walk trough them, but the way it's made is the thing that makes that game perfect - the puzzles, the interactions, everything is just perfectly done.  It also has co-op, workshop, level editor and many achievements, which is amazing, because you can continue playing for hours and hours, facing new levels and mods, after you complete the main story. In conclusion:Story: 10/10Characters: 10/10Voice-acting: 10/10Graphics: 10/10 -Masterpiece!-Also, try Portal 1. You'll understand the story better, if you play it before its sequel.

This is a very unique experience which you almost can't compare to other games. I cannot say its the best game I have played but it is most certainly one of the most memorable games I've played. So far, the best story I have seen in a game as well. Truly a title you will never regret playing!			",156,32,7,14,10,1,11

												What a delightful game to play, that's how I define Portal 2. The first had been very good, but the second can be even better, the gameplay is unique, the puzzles are interesting and warrant a good deal of satisfaction when solved, especially those that you have more trouble passing. Enjoyed the development a lot, the idea of the 2 robots and how you interact with them, brilliant, and the ending is very good and comforting too. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds, perfect, I can not imagine any defect to assign to it, perhaps it could be longer. Now I want to try cooperative with a friend.9/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

 Portal 2 ReviewWhat kind of game is this? How do you play? What do you do? Portal 2 is a FPS puzzle game. It is a direct sequel of Portal 1, and has many similarities to it. However, portal 2 is not the kind of game to sit there and copy what its predecessor did. Absolutely not, it’s here to improve on its past and give you an even better experience then last timeControlsThe game uses your standard FPS WASD and mouse controls, but also supports a special razer controller, and Xbox gamepads 10/10SoundThe game sounds great. the OST is nothing special, but it gets the job done in the game. All explosions and sound effects are fine. The voice acting in this game is also great, and the dialogue can be quite funny. 10/10GraphicsThe game looks great, it runs well on any modern pc, and the specs match the performance and graphical output. 10/10DifficultyThe game's difficulty depends on your puzzle solving skills. Personally, I got through fine without a walkthrough, but I know others who have gotten stuck at points. There is no difficulty or hints, should you get stuck and not be able to proceed, then you will need to turn to the internet. I can understand how one would get stumped in this game, with some of the testing chambers being massive. and i wish valve would have put in a hint button for new or younger players. But in my experience, i got through just fine. 8/10StoryThe story picks up right after portal. X amount of years have passed and Chell must once again be tested. There are several new characters to the series, which it needed. It also manages the bridge the gap between the Half-life and Portal series. I had no issues with the story, and was impressed to see how clever valve was at linking things, and giving background. 9/10 Multiplayer A new feature in Portal 2 is the ability to play 2player co-op testing chambers together. This has no real story to it, but takes place directly after the single player campaign. It's very enjoyable to play portal with a friend, and because of the emote commands, you won’t need a mic, or even a chat box really.  10/10 Length Both the single and multiplayer game modes can be completed in about 10hours total. That’s too short to make this game worth buying unless it’s on sale, Luckily, valve has opened the community to map making, which means, now the game is basically endless. There will always be another community level to play, but not all of them are good. 8/10 Overall Portal 2 is a must have for every steam library. Delivering 2 decent story modes, and endless community levels, you’re in for a good time. You will get to build on the half-life universe, and have a few good laughs while you’re at it. 9/10 - Near Perfect ",160,26,4,27,12,2,13

												I enjoy this game on the fact it is a fps, puzzle, and comedic game. Very interesting maps and creative scenes. The games graphics are beautiful. But, on the other hand is that i have to go to a loading screen everytime i beat a map, I understand that its so people cant keep a portal there and when they go down the elevator, into the next map they can't make another portal and glitch the game by going back levels, but all the game had to do is reset the portals. They could have just made a loading screen ever 5 or so levels to give a short break. But a little time doesn't change the game to much :). 9/10 game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not only is it the essentail co-op game, Portal 2 is a must own for not only every Portal fan but anyone in general and if you don't have it your missing out.			",116,11,2,7,3,3,3

												If you like doing puzzles, and/or building puzzles, then this game has you covered. The editor is also very simple to use.Just...if you make a workshop item, I'd appreciate tests that have had some love and effort put into them.Also, the storyline is good. Very good. And I can't really dislike anyone in the game. I won't say anything more though, because spoilers.			",91,14,0,7,9,1,8

												Portal 2 is alike the first Portal game retaining all the mechanics and aspects of the game you already liked and adds more content into every single possible aspect. More levels, more story, more humour, more puzzle mechanics, more atmosphere, more achievements and more campaign modes to play in (AKA the new co-op mode). The singeplayer campaign is a blast to go through with the intriguing story, witty dialogue and puzzles thats are tons of fun and the co-op is just as fun as you use the things you learnt in singeplayer for co-op but expanding on much more possibilites on level design with the use of four portals as apposed to two. What I love about this game so much is how even when I'm stuck in the game I still have fun using my brain to figure the level out and there's no other game that comes to mind that is so consistently fun even in situations when confused on what to do. If you do not have this game I really, really, really, really, really recommend you do, it's my second favourite game of all time and my absolute favourite game on my Steam library.

												In my opinion this is the greatest franchise Valve has ever come out with.This game in its entirety is genius to me; the whole concept is just amazing. It has mind boggling puzzles that are extremely creative (which now you can make your own with steamworks), and an amazing plotline with a real cinematic feeling to it when it comes to the cut scenes. There’s one scene that gives me a chill every time, and that in itself is amazing.For a puzzle game it sure does feel like there is a lot of action in this game. It can be very fast paced at times, and slow paced at others. Which I like, it’s nice to be stood there for ages thinking so hard at one point and running around franticly trying not to die at another.There’s an amazing set of characters which are so perfectly done in terms of voice acting. I really couldn’t think of any better match for the characters they came up with. It has awesome little secrets and things to find that really expand your curiosity even further and make you really want to know more about the goings on at Aperture Science Laboratories. The humour in this game is wonderful, and there was more than a few times I had a real chuckle to myself, I was pretty impressed with how well it was done.There is a lot to this game, and it really is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had.You are a test subject, and you are once again trying to find your way out. But a lot stands in your way.I was pretty sad when I finished this game, as I’m not sure there’s anything to go on to turn into a future game. If there is, bring it on. I would love to once again be thrown into this world, but sadly I doubt there will be. It’s an amazing franchise, definitely one I can see myself playing again in future.There is also a comic online on the Portal website for anyone that would like to see a beautifully constructed comic with some wonderful art that fills in some gaps and shows you how Aperture Science got to be how it is today.

												I got Portal 2 the week it came out on the xbox, and beat the campaign, and co-op (Including co-op dlc) many times. Once I got a coupon for the pc version, I knew I had to get it. I am so glad I did.Graphics: 9.2Gameplay: 10Story/Lore: 9.5Controls (Keyboard) 10Controls (Controller) 10BONUS: Secrets: 10Total: 9.78In Portal 2, you play as the mute, Chell, as you try to escape from the testing labs of Aperture Science. But not everything goes according to plan.Graphics: Being a game from '11, this game looks absoultely beautiful. It's stunning. It looks like a 2013 game, really.Gameplay: The gameplay is like no other game. The puzzles, although a tad bit confusing at points, is a ton of fun. The addition of the gels make for a great time.Story/Lore: Now I'm going to do this one without spoilers, Going to be hard. In this game, you discover the truth of Aperture Science, the truth about Glados, and (if you look closely) some truth about why you are there. They dont just slap you in the face about it, they make you think about it.Controls (Keyboard): The keyboard controls are great. Nothing else to say.Controls (Controller): If you have a Xbox360 controller, and can connect it, do it. This game becomes 200% better with a controller.Secrets: This game has some of the greatest hidden secrets in the game, ranging from crossing into other games, to more information behind characters, to going back and jumping to your death.

												I totally recommend this game for you to buy.This is a FPS puzzle game with a lot of physics in it.I love the challenging puzzles and It's really a hell lot of fun when I played this game co-op with my friend.The single player also has an interesting story and it will keep you playing for hours trying to solve the puzzles.The Co-Op mode is epic.The people who designed the level are true geniuses.I'm surprised how demanding the puzzles is to work together with your ""Partner in Science"".For example,you have to help open portals from the other side of the map,activate a button in the same time,help your friend gain momentum to jump to your portal,pass boxes to open doors,etc.If you have a friend that shares the same love of solving puzzles and physics,you'll get a really fun experience from this game,even though you WILL get bored after a couple of hours of gameplay since the game has no replay value.But the experience you get during the progress wil totally worth it.Best puzzle game ever 10/10.Buy it.

Time to Think Outside the CubeThis is a great puzzle game that makes you think outside of the cube. The tutorial gives you the foundations of how to play the game but after that you are left to your own devices to figure out how to reach the exit. The visuals are somewhat simplistic but they do however look great as they suit the setting that the game is in. If the single-player experience wasn't already anough to buy this game then the co-op experience definitely is. Playing with a friend to solve puzzles can be great fun but also very frustrating but enjoyable at times. However there isn't much replayability in terms of the single-player and multi-player puzzles because once you have done them you have the solution to do it again without thinking. Definitely get this game if you are into puzzles!			",559,133,27,50,58,15,66

												Where do I start? From the moment I started playing this game, I was intrigued as to what was going to happen. Portal 2 has a much bigger and fleshed-out story than the first Portal, and is much more intersting. You're not just a test subject for a breakthrough in science anymore: you're a test subject who just wants to get out of GladOS's reach and be free.Wheatley, the robot who helps you through the some of the game, adds a fun, light-hearted element to the story, and fills in those awkward silences you had when looking for escape in the first Portal. The introduction of co-op was nice aswell, as I always enjoy yelling at my frineds if they do something wrong.I also like the workshop compatibilty, as it adds a lot of extra content to the game, as what I found with Portal 1 was that you completed the story and advanced chambers, and then you had nothing else to do. It also allows the community to show how they think with portals.Overall, a huge improvement on the first game, wiht a lot more content to immerse yourself in. The story is bigger and better, the co-op is huge fun and the workshop compatibility is a great addition.9/10 would think with portals again - I would give it 10 if we got Half Life 3, or Portal 3, or maybe even a second Orange Box with HL3 AND Portal 3? COME ON VALVE, LISTEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY!!!			",51,2,0,3,4,0,1

Does Portal 2 live up to my expectations?Well, the first Portal was a challenging logic puzzle game, with lotsa sarcasm and irony on top. I enjoyed the game very much, but personally didn't (in general) like some of the faster paced reaction bits or having to place Portals while upside down and backwards (though they weren't going to hard on that). Portal had about 70% logic and 30% reaction puzzles aka Test Chambers. Only downturn was, that the (intentionally) grey and sterile environment kept the girls away from playing.So, this game adds some Cockney speaking companion, has the old fun bits, remains solid in the core and adds really wonderful new gimmicks. All of them are lovely, but the Gels ""stick"" out for me, because they open up incredible possibilities. Apart from the gels, the game is in general more colourful than its predecessor since the story after the end of Portal allows that. Now it is about 80-90% logic puzzles which are not just recycled old ideas. To the contrary, the game hasn't really maxed out the sheer endless options and this is there the community comes in.This is about one of the biggest games ever, since there are hundreds of free community test chambers to download and easily to integrate which makes the game extremely valuable - not only on sale!Sadly, there are more of these factory/outdoor debris maps, where most effort remains simply looking for the portable surface. The icing on the cake is the Co-Op Multiplayer, which should be really part of any good workplace team building effort. This hypes the game to a complete new level. Portal 2 reassures the community that Valve stands for witty quality games.Highly recommend this game; don't see anything worse compared to Portal and most of it better. You don't need to play the first part, but it helps to enjoy some comments even the better.			",45,2,0,0,0,0,1

												One of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing! The Portal series is perfectly thematic, makes you want to stay in the game to end. The portal characters are a hit piece, you who played the first Portal, and not like the Glados? And you're going to play Portal 2 now, can not help but fall in love with Wheatley, for me is one of the best video game characters of all time. In short, want to play the best game that Valve already produced and one of the best games ever made? Buy Portal 2!This game is Amazing!			",714,218,49,73,75,12,115

												This Is my favorite game of all time! Portal 2 and its testing facilities looks so beautiful and real you forget you are even in a video game. The plot is genius and most of all the puzzles make you want to send your hand through your computer (in a good way). The idea of the game is amazing and the execution is brilliant. I didn't think it could get any better from the original portal, but valve proved me wrong again. The big things are great and the attention to detail really sells the mood. All around 10/10. I have zero complaints.			",28,2,0,0,5,0,4

												It baffles me as to why I haven't reviewed this yet. I've owned it for almost two years, and I've even created maps for it, albiet terrible ones. It's an amazing first-person puzzle game which offers players a chance to push their brains to the limits. And that's only the Singleplayer. For even more excitement, you can do the Co-Operative campaign, which offers an even tougher experience, as you need both players'... cooperation. Both stories are as amazing as the puzzles, so even if you find the puzzles easy, you can at least enjoy the story. And, again, even if you don't enjoy the story, there are literally thousands of community created levels from you to choose from, each with a certain theme. While most offer the 'Into the Multiverse' theme, narrated by the Aperture founder and CEO himself, others can have their own complex storyline and theme. I'd give this game a 10/10 rating. If you buy it, you'll likely get one of the best games on the market.			",40,5,0,1,8,1,0

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Portal 2 

			Views: 78		

			Portal 2 is a puzzle physic games available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Portal 2 is a first person puzzle game with excellent physics challenges.It is a second part of the story from the first Portal game.  The narratoris dry and sarcastic, and very funny, and the story is well done; it helpsyou propel through the game even when you are stumped by whatever puzzleyou may be working on.The game performs smoothly, with will done level design.  The puzzlesare based off of manipulating the levels with a portal gun, as well asusing gravity and physics when necessary.  The difficulty and level designprogress in a balanced way, and does a great job of leading you in a linearfashion, but leaving you to solve the puzzles on your own.  Awareness ofthe details of the map is key.For someone who likes puzzle games, this is an easy recommend.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video I am a YT'er not a blogger.Thanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho ",268,110,1,57,17,0,44

Portal 2 Review By DignifiedPeachThis is the kind of game that you buy if you want to think. Consult your doctor before purchasing to see if you can handle it.Just kidding, but seriously, after you get past the first 6 or 7 chapters, which takes about an hour for some, maybe a couple for most, you actually have to think outside of your companion cube. later you end up going to the restricted testing facility, which is almost completely destroyed. with only a portal gun to aid you, it may get extremely difficult. I haven't played through the whole game but I do have 13 hours logged. This is a fantastic game, expecially the fact that I got it and portal 1 for 6 bucks.Good game.Oh, and there's co-op.

												Portal 2 is a masterpiece, a work of art that you will love for its ingenious story pop-culture, references to logical puzzles and co-op multiplayer. Definitely a candidate for game of the year.Sporting some of the best writing and voice work in years (as well as some deviously designed puzzles), Portal 2's single-player campaign is superior to its predecessor in every way. It makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games.Impatience aside, Portal 2 is an exceptionally well-crafted, intelligent, entertaining, humorous game. You will laugh. You will feel like a freaking genius. You will want more. And yes, you will probably be hearing quotes from Portal 2 for the next three years.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												This is, quite simply, the most unique game in the world. Everyone should play it.And there is so much to it: an exciting singleplayer campaign; interesting co-op campaign for 2 players with an intriguing ending; then there are ""least portals placed"" challenges to really make you think and speed challenges to test your skills (the challenges are especially good if you do them with a friend); and, of course, the most comfortable level editor ever, which allows people to make thousands of test chambers (which can be rated, so you can pick the best ones), so you can't say the game is repetitive...I didn't say much about the gameplay itself, because a video can tell much more.★★★★★★★★★★			",494,155,6,13,31,6,55

												A worthy sequel to one of the best games of all time. Not quite as good as the original, but that is a very hard act to follow.The plot is hilarious and greatly expanded. This is great on your first playthrough but the plot comes at the cost of frequent unskippable animations and rail sequences between puzzles, which make replays a bit tedius.The best fun to be had here is in co-op mode, so if you can find a friend who hasn't played it yet, buy two copies and play it together.

Also, I'm on the Internet so you can trust me.Portal 2 is a very addicting puzzle game where you play as a red shell named Chell. I'm kidding, she's human. Theres also an amazing coop and you never expect what is gonna happen next, in the campaign or the coop.A game that I played for a lot of hours on the PS3 and the PC. Buy it. Now. Do it.

I really love this game it tests the mind and it's fun at the same time. It has a story and puzzles. Singleplayer: This game is full of twist and turns, puzzles, adventure, science, friends and bad guys. But who is good and who is bad? Is GLaDOS dead or will she have a little juice left? You'll have to buy the game to find out.Co-op: You can play with your friends as many times as you like. The puzzles get harder and harder and there are Turrets to top it all off. Do you think you can beat the game? Both you and your friend have to have portal in order to do co-op. But if you want to do co-op with out buying two copies and just one copy and use split screen. Have fun! #WhoLikesPortal make it a trend <3I give this game a rateing of 10/10 :D ",16,23,0,1,5,0,0

												This game is easily one of the best, if not THE best, puzzle games out there. The puzzles are hard and challenging, but not so hard, that you would rage quit. And the fact, that this game has a level editor and a workshop makes it now bazillion times better. There are some great Community-created levels. But the best part (or parts, rather) is the humour and the best villian of all times- GlaDOS. You will just love to hate her and yet love her at the same time. But if you played the previous one, you already know all of this. So what are you sitting here for ?! Put your Companion Cube on the 'Buy' button and of to Aperture Labs!			",210,36,1,19,10,3,26

												A masterpiece. One of the best games I've ever played. Takes the brilliance and innovation of the original Portal and expands on it into a fully-fledged title. Maintains an extremely high standard of writing from start to finish. Characters are hilarious. Gameplay is original. Fantastic atmosphere. Puzzles are challenging but not frustatingly so. Valve never fails to impress and Portal 2 is no exception.			",52,1,0,6,1,0,2

												Portal 2 is the revolutionary game of the logical games. Also sits on the throne of Cooperative games in my honest opinion.The cooperative mode gives you the opportunity to have a good time only by using your brain, whether you play with strangers, friends or family!Compared to the first, the singleplayer is much more developed, just as the gameplay and design.It's worth the price!

-Quick Review-Portal2 is a first person puzzle game developed by Valve and released 2011. This game was greatly anticipated when it was announced and we all waited in anticipation for the release.The game was not a disappointment, the developers brought us back to Aperture Laboratories and put us to work on new and innovative puzzles, Portal1 and 2 will always be one of my most favorite puzzle games, period.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You wake up in a strange hotel-looking room, after awakening you discover you're actually still inside Aperture Laboratories and the whole place is falling apart! You need to find a way out and escape before the whole lab falls down around your ears!Gameplay: The whole game is based on the core concepts of two portals (an Orange/red and Blue Portal), be it moving objects through these portals, moving yourself between these portals, or jumping off high objects to reach hard to reach places, the game is a brainteaser in such a wonderful way. As the catchphrase goes “prepare to think with portals”.There are a number of features in Portal2, there are Single player, Co-op, Community Test Chambers/Workshop, Steam Achievements, and challenge modes where you can compete against your friends for fastest times, least portals used, steps, and more. Achievements: There are 51 Achievements for Portal2, Most of the single player achievements are straightforward fun and challenging to get... There are also Co-op achievements, so it would be best to make or get a friend to help you out.Price: Portal2 is priced at $19.99 that will be the best 20 dollars you spend. But if you're on a tight budget like me you might want to wait for a 75% off sale, since the game was released in 2011 there's a very good chance that there will be sale for it.Conclusion: I really can't sum up how great Portal2 is without saying “look, if you're even remotely interested in trying it out, you don't grasp just what an outstanding puzzle game it is. I highly recommend Portal2 to everyone and anyone.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update September 13, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for  Portal ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Let me start off by saying I don't like playing puzzle games. I'm not great at them to begin with, and they frustrate me sometimes.Portal pretty much changed my outlook on that. I'd known about the Portal games for quite a long time before actually playing them. The first game was a great start, but I did wish there could have been more substance.Portal 2 is the embodiment of the perfect sequel. The gameplay improves greatly from the first; the chambers feature more factors, like the gels, hard light bridges, etc., and feel much more challenging. And, if you somehow get bored of the main Portal 2 campaign, there's also co-op!Storyline-wise, it exceeded my already high expectations. The dialogue was usually witty (GLaDOS), hilarious (Wheatley), or both. While there were very few characters in this game, it did a good job of making them complex and interesting. Of course, there are still some loose ends in the plot that were purposely left out, but I feel like it was better off being vague.Portal 2 definitely lives up to its reputation. After all, it takes a lot to be featured in hundreds of easter eggs across the video gaming universe.			",24,7,0,11,2,0,0

												Compelling single player campaign set in an extensive and seemingly limitless universe. Co-op is fun and interactive, and the Perpetual Testing Initiative (Workshop) adds even more.If you think you'll like the story, start with Portal, and if you're also into first person shooters, take on the Half-Life series, set in the same universe.

												This one of the best games I have ever played it was well textured had a great storyOnly down sides are the puzzle maker is getting old valve needs to add update packs to it although ben vlodgi has done a great job on that partOther downside is small but should be noted but valve should finish the paint gun and adhesion gelOther than that I love the game Upsides very well thought out puzzles Loved the way Wheatley guides you through parts of apertureLoved the behind the scenes and underground mapsOne thing I would love if there was is the unused content to be added even as an update for itHappy portaling everybody			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played the original Portal before playing this and Portal 2 was a must buy for me. And it didn't disappoint.Likes:- 100% player and camera control from game start to game end except for the ending scene. Zero cutscenes. This is what an ideal PC game should be. This point might seem very weird but it is a very big and important point in PC gaming- Not too easy, not too hard either. Lots of 'aha' moments. For those who don't know, the 'aha' moment is the defining characteristic of this game. If you don't get that feeling you can't appreciate the gameplay- Great use of sound- Music rhymes with gameplay- Great writing and entertaining story- Great voice acting- Co-op doesnt feel like it was added, it was made- Great FREE DLC. Usually free doesn't mean great. But Portal 2's DLC was surprisingly great.- Community made maps and mods- Can be played by all age groups- PolishedDislikes :- Source Engine is getting oldVerdict : 94/100Don't let the genre stop you from playing this game			",98,14,0,5,3,0,5

												Portal 2 is the revolutionary game of the logical games. Also sits on the throne of Cooperative games in my honest opinion.The cooperative mode gives you the opportunity to have a good time only by using your brain, whether you play with strangers, friends or family!Compared to the first, the singleplayer is much more developed, just as the gameplay and design.It's worth the price!

												Let me say first-hand that this is one of the best games I have ever played.Not only does the game offer a completely unique gameplay style, not only are the graphics bold and fresh, not only is the plot captivating and heartfelt, not only does the game incorporate crude humor (and who doesn't love crude humor, am I right?), not only is the game filled with more action than one would expect from a puzzle game, but it is also full of unforgettable, unimaginable, inmeasurably intense moments of incredible euphoria at knowing that you have beaten a puzzle and that the world is at your fingertips.The introduction serves well to show this - I personally have never heard so many satiric comments in one place in my life. The graphics are absolutely AMAZING, and unlike many other games (Ride to Hell: Retribution anyone?), the storyline actually makes sense. The intensity wrapping grows fairly slowly throughout the game, but that's just a personal opinion.			",108,12,4,27,10,0,3

												I have pre-ordered the game for 50 euros, and I would still pay this amount of money to buy it again. The campaign is cool, the story takes unexpected turns, and it even tells you the backstory of Chell without even referring to her!To really get the story, it is also suggested to play the first Portal game and to read the comic, as this gives you the complete experiene. And boy, do I love it!The gameplay is great, the game deviates from the many CoD and WoW-clones by giving you a gun that fires two linked portals. You will learn to use these portals through the game, and how to fight with it using other elements from the test chambers.When the campaign is done, don't worry, there still is an unlimited amount of test chambers to complete. Thanks to the Perpetual Testing Initiative (PeTI), players can create and submit their own chambers for other players to test!If you think you are ready to tackle the responsibilities of making your own chambers and releasing them into the wild, then the PeTI is something you'll love aswel. It's easy to use, and with it you can create stunning chambers from Aperture's glory time.Are you more into complex chamber designing? Don't worry, the PeTI is mod-friendly, and countless mods have been made to expand the elements to be used in the creator. My favorite mod is Ben and August's Extended Editor, where you get the full access to all Portal and Portal 2 testing elements plus custom made elements that almost all work without the player needing to install mods for themselves.Or if you are more into 3D design and making a chamber just like the developers did, Valve has made a special entry of Hammer for Portal 2, which is free to download and use when you get Portal 2. It certainly is the most difficult to work with, but it also gives you the most freedom. You can even create outside levels with it!			",73,13,7,10,15,1,6

												This game is my favorite of all time. It encompasses all that I enjoy about video games. Many other people like Portal, but I prefer Portal 2. While this game may not have the most impressive visuals, it more than makes up in a great story. From the well-written humor and sarcasm of Wheatley, to the lore behind Rat Man, this game has a beautifallly well-crafted narrative. The puzzle mechanics are great as well. However, I didn't enjoy the co-op mode quite as much as the singleplayer. Overall, I think this game is the best game of all time.Pros-Excellent story & puzzle mechanics-Great atmosphere-Easy to run (I can run it on my $100 Dell laptop)-Best sequel-Great level editor-PS3 integration (No longer available)-Great priceCons-Multiplayer could have been improved-Visuals can be better (can be seen as a pro and a con)			",96,7,0,3,6,0,2

												After the surprising success of Portal, here comes the sequel. The game opens with Chell back in Apature Science after being freed by a bumbling core named Wheatly. After accidentally rebooting GLaDOS, Chell is back with the Portal Gun and going through another round of tests until Wheatly comes in to save her again. Will they be able to stop GLaDOS again? Or is there another core that is more destructive then her? The gameplay is like before, lots of puzzle solving while relying on your Portal Gun to help out, the puzzles are more challenging this time. While ya havethe portal gun and the companion cube, you also have Gels that come in handy. The Blue Gel lets you jump higher, the Orange Gel makes you run faster, and the White Gel makes you put portals anywhere. There are also light bridges, lasers and tunnes that help out with the puzzles, while ocasionaly outsmarting Turrets. Instaed of one character talking to you, you have 2 that do most of the talking in this game. GLaDOS is still the GLaDOS we know and love while Wheatly is the hilarious clumsy Core who clearly states that he's not a moron. There's also a 2 player Co-op mode where 2 robots from Apature take in on GLaDOS's tests, I've only played the PS3 version of this and it's fun toplay when you have a buddy helping out. So if you liked the first game, then your goingto love the sequel, full of surprises, complicated puzzles, and whitty dailouge. The game is a fitting ending to Portal that it makes you wonder how can they top it off with a Portal 3? Well then again Valve can't count to 3. lol			",74,16,1,2,3,2,1

Portal 2 — блистательная, остроумная, исполненная с удивительным чувством вкуса и меры игра.Парадоксальным образом большая часть хвалебных возгласов отведена критике. Но это критика восторженных, бесконечно влюбленных в Portal людей. Это критика тех, кто прошел Portal не как запойный алкоголик, за уик-энд, а растягивал удовольствие неделями. Это критика тех, кто летом 2010-го по три раза ходил на одну и ту же E3-презентацию, а затем пересказывал ее коллегам в баре. Portal 2 — это, безусловно, ПОБЕДА. Несмотря на все голливудские ужимки, безупречный юмор и возмужавший геймплей, Portal 2 остался герметичным набором пазлов, театральной научно-фантастической пьесой от первого лица.

												Portal 2 is a good game worth playing. Let me say that first and foremost. Yes, if you have the money and are considering getting it, you should.However, if you haven't played Portal 1, play that instead. While Portal 2 has more puzzles and better graphics, I don't think it's a better game. The average puzzle in Portal 1 has 4-8 solutions, and the tutorial puzzles show enough that you learn how to use the mechanics, without making you feel like you're being told how to play. Portal 2 takes the subtle parts that made the first game a masterpiece and sort of hamhandles them. The average puzzle in Portal 2 has 1-3 solutions. The introduction of new mechanics, such as the goop, initially makes for more interesting puzzles, but ultimately creates a need to make the puzzles more restrictive and less intuitive. I didn't finish the game. I am an avid puzzle gamer, but one puzzle near the end of the game required such precision, timing, and execution that I couldn't manage it with the level of awareness I had. Of course, being a very social gamer, a friend and I flew through the multiplayer maps with no difficulty. I think I will attribute that to the lack of goop.TL:DR good game, the first one was better			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 is by far my favorite Valve game made so far, it takes a different approach than other games. If you haven't played Portal 2 I really recommened you start with Portal 1 to understand the story and also look at the changes from the first and second. Pretty much, heres my breakdown:Story: 10/10Multiplayer: 9/10 - Multiplayer is very fun. I would prefer playing it with a friend instead of a random strangerSteam Workshop: 10/10 - By far my favorite part of Portal 2 is that you can download test chambers created by the communityGraphics: 8/10 - Who plays for the graphics?Needless to say, this game is very fun.

												i WOULD LIKE TO Say that Mudkip is the most beautiful pokemon in existance. Mudkip is an accurate representation of how I would describe this game. Sexy, WET, and not even the final form of perfection. It has a bit of room to grow. There are some lag issues at timeS (mostly when my dumb brother is on the wi-fi), yet I still blame steam. There are many alternate endings to this game, and I find that very exciting. I would recommend this game to 2 of my 5 friends in real life. 3 of my friends don't really play video games, therefore I cannot reccomend this to them. However, if they did play vidga games, I would recommend this game with flying colours. I would then get them to play pokemon with me so I can CATCH 'EM ALL!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although the mechanics are the same as the first title with only a few additions, Portal 2 still feels like a completely different sort of game than the first Portal.The first Portal was short lived and very focused. Although there were some secrets and deviations the formula for Portal remained only compartmentalized puzzle solving, in a very controlled environment.Although this is still a puzzle game, it feels far less structured and controlled, allowing more room for experimentation and giving you less direction on how you are to complete certain objectives.It's also far longer than the first game, and with a much bigger focus on story.The story in the first Portal was excellent, and a big reason why it was so popular, but regardless, it wasn't the story that was driving the game forward, rather the sense of progression.This game, however, is entirely story driven. Levels are introduced along with the charactes that direct you in those levels, and the atmosphere of each area is unique to the narrative of the characters who are with you in each section.You want to complete puzzles in this game in order to learn more about the world, rather than you learning more about the world as you complete the puzzles.While I love this change, many people might miss the hyper-focused nature of the first game.If you're into the lore of the series Portal 2 is an absolutely wonderful game.If you're more focused on the gameplay, Portal 2 is still a wonderful game, although you may be disappointed by the amount of ""fluff"" that's present this time around.

												Although the mechanics are the same as the first title with only a few additions, Portal 2 still feels like a completely different sort of game than the first Portal.The first Portal was short lived and very focused. Although there were some secrets and deviations the formula for Portal remained only compartmentalized puzzle solving, in a very controlled environment.Although this is still a puzzle game, it feels far less structured and controlled, allowing more room for experimentation and giving you less direction on how you are to complete certain objectives.It's also far longer than the first game, and with a much bigger focus on story.The story in the first Portal was excellent, and a big reason why it was so popular, but regardless, it wasn't the story that was driving the game forward, rather the sense of progression.This game, however, is entirely story driven. Levels are introduced along with the charactes that direct you in those levels, and the atmosphere of each area is unique to the narrative of the characters who are with you in each section.You want to complete puzzles in this game in order to learn more about the world, rather than you learning more about the world as you complete the puzzles.While I love this change, many people might miss the hyper-focused nature of the first game.If you're into the lore of the series Portal 2 is an absolutely wonderful game.If you're more focused on the gameplay, Portal 2 is still a wonderful game, although you may be disappointed by the amount of ""fluff"" that's present this time around.

												Portal 2 is by far my favorite Valve game made so far, it takes a different approach than other games. If you haven't played Portal 2 I really recommened you start with Portal 1 to understand the story and also look at the changes from the first and second. Pretty much, heres my breakdown:Story: 10/10Multiplayer: 9/10 - Multiplayer is very fun. I would prefer playing it with a friend instead of a random strangerSteam Workshop: 10/10 - By far my favorite part of Portal 2 is that you can download test chambers created by the communityGraphics: 8/10 - Who plays for the graphics?Needless to say, this game is very fun.

												>plays co-op with sister>i do all thinking work and tell her where to put portals>GLaDOS tells us that im smart and did all the work and that my sister didn't do anything10/10 would laugh at my sister getting roasted by GLaDOS againBut seriously now:OMFG I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I SHOULD WRITE THIS ------------------------------------------------------------------Most games bore me, frankly. But this game, a very repetitive game where you just use portals over portals, kept me addicted the whole way through. This probably is the second Steam game I was interested in enough to beat. Some areas were a bit harder to solve (probably because my brain can't function well at 4am), so I just went to bed, and the next day I'd try again, and beat it. The game's puzzles are perfectly balanced in difficulty, and the story itself is a big reason to play this game. Trust me, the ending is well worth it. REALLY...really...worth it.And please, for your sake, do NOT look up walkthroughs. It will completely ruin your gaming experience.P.S.: Take off a few hours, and that's how long it took me to beat story mode. (Play time was 11.7 hours when I wrote this)P.P.S.: This was my first ever review, so yes, it probably isn't in-depth enough, but I hope I got my main points across.TL;DRThis game's ending is worth the play, not to say all the puzzles and...dem feelz.

												After the surprising success of Portal, here comes the sequel. The game opens with Chell back in Apature Science after being freed by a bumbling core named Wheatly. After accidentally rebooting GLaDOS, Chell is back with the Portal Gun and going through another round of tests until Wheatly comes in to save her again. Will they be able to stop GLaDOS again? Or is there another core that is more destructive then her? The gameplay is like before, lots of puzzle solving while relying on your Portal Gun to help out, the puzzles are more challenging this time. While ya havethe portal gun and the companion cube, you also have Gels that come in handy. The Blue Gel lets you jump higher, the Orange Gel makes you run faster, and the White Gel makes you put portals anywhere. There are also light bridges, lasers and tunnes that help out with the puzzles, while ocasionaly outsmarting Turrets. Instaed of one character talking to you, you have 2 that do most of the talking in this game. GLaDOS is still the GLaDOS we know and love while Wheatly is the hilarious clumsy Core who clearly states that he's not a moron. There's also a 2 player Co-op mode where 2 robots from Apature take in on GLaDOS's tests, I've only played the PS3 version of this and it's fun toplay when you have a buddy helping out. So if you liked the first game, then your goingto love the sequel, full of surprises, complicated puzzles, and whitty dailouge. The game is a fitting ending to Portal that it makes you wonder how can they top it off with a Portal 3? Well then again Valve can't count to 3. lol			",74,16,1,2,3,2,1

												For my opinion, this game should be the Game Of The Year. Totally excellent. The best game from Valve ever made. It is better than the Half-Life series of games, but I think Valve should make another game that will unite the two stories, the two worlds - events of Portal and Half-Life because the story in Portal takes place in Half-Life universe. I think Portal 2 with its allusions to the events of Half-Life can be a bridge to the large super-game. This may be a Half-Life 3 or something like that.			",342,136,3,41,17,2,21

												Portal 2 is an awesome game. Put a portal on the wall, another on the floor and you start spinning round like a maniac! Seeing through the portals was a very cool feature, as Valve could've easily made the portals white/black and made it so they will teleport you back and forth. It also adds a lot of possibilities you wished you could try on games. You can create your own levels and also there is multiplayer! I think this game is a big improvement from Portal.10/10 Now your thinking with p0rtals!			",75,11,0,4,9,1,2

 Portal 2	 Pros: + Longer game+ More changeling puzzles that are at a good difficultly level+ More dialogue+ Better story compared to the first one+ Better ending compared to the first one+ Get on sale for a great price+ Learn more lore of the Portal world Cons: -  Still no cake	- Some puzzles will make you dumb- Middle drags on for sometime without any dialogue Review Portal 2 brings back what you love from the first Portal and improves on many other areas. After playing the first Portal relatively quickly, I started up Portal 2 and sat down thinking it would be as short as the first one. I was wrong, this game has much more meat than the first Portal. It was fun to shoot portals across large areas and teleport across them. What I loved about Portal 1 and Portal 2 is that it all can be done without a walkthrough, but it's not easy either. It has an interesting start and a legendary ending. The middle part wasn't that amazing, but it wasn't bad either. All in all, I am happy that I finally played the two Portal games, and even though I am not a huge fan of puzzle games it was still enjoyable. It is a great buy when it's on sale.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

Portal 2 — блистательная, остроумная, исполненная с удивительным чувством вкуса и меры игра.Парадоксальным образом большая часть хвалебных возгласов отведена критике. Но это критика восторженных, бесконечно влюбленных в Portal людей. Это критика тех, кто прошел Portal не как запойный алкоголик, за уик-энд, а растягивал удовольствие неделями. Это критика тех, кто летом 2010-го по три раза ходил на одну и ту же E3-презентацию, а затем пересказывал ее коллегам в баре. Portal 2 — это, безусловно, ПОБЕДА. Несмотря на все голливудские ужимки, безупречный юмор и возмужавший геймплей, Portal 2 остался герметичным набором пазлов, театральной научно-фантастической пьесой от первого лица. Но любим мы его от этого ничуть не меньше.+ ОТЛИЧНЫЙ СЮЖЕТ+ ПРЕЖНЯЯ МЕХАНИКА ДОПОЛНЕНАЯ НОВЫМИ КРАСКАМИ+ ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНЫЙ ТЕАТРАЛЬНЫЙ ЮМОР+ КООПЕРАТИВ- КОНЦОВКА ДАЕТ ПОНЯТЬ, ЧТО ПРОДОЛЖЕНИЯ НЕ БУДЕТ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely LOVE this game, Its way better than the original.This is what i like about this sequel:Single Player mode is what really makes this game shine. It was short for me because i beat it in 2 days.Co-Op mode is REALLY fun with your friendsYou can make your own test chamber without using Hammer World Editor. Making your own test chamber is a really cool mechanic for me.And that's what i like about this game.Praise Gabe Newell...Buy this game. It's worth it. And if you don't, I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.10/10			",24,4,0,0,2,0,1

												I really can't fault this game at all. I try, but I just can't think of anything! Terrific fun and a refreshing change from the normal run of violent games ( In some small way, it’s a shame that Valve didn’t manage to avoid a violent finale ). It’s just fantastic. Buy it.

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. A lot of you might think that the original Portal is better, but from what I've seen, it doesn't look any better than Portal 2. Then again, I haven't played it yet.The story of Portal 2 is simple. After what happens in Portal, you wake up in a room that you find out is a containment facility (like the original game, but more... roomy.) After being there for a really long time, your mental state has suffered a lot. However, because there is nobody taking care of Aperture science, the state of the laboratory has suffered as well. Your motives in Portal 2 constantly change, and the story takes many twists and turns while you're playing. This keeps the story fresh and entertaining as you progress, which is a great thing as the story of Portal 2 is important (mostly because of what happens in the first game.)Portal 2, for a game that came out in 2011, looks really polished and has a great visual atmosphere. You can see the effects your actions in the first game have caused in the first 10 minutes of the game, and it's a constant theme throughout the game. Like the story, the visual asthetic has many twists and turns, but key objects stay consistant. This gives you a clear direction of what to do in the game, while also giving you a fresh new canvas to look at.The gameplay in Portal 2 has been improved upon from Portal, not changed. Key features are the same, but new features give the game life and give people who loved the first game a reason to play through the second one. This game has a very megaman-esque feel when it comes to game mechanics. When a new mechanic is introduced, it's usually in an environment that is very lenient so you can learn how that mechanic works. Once the game feels you're ready, it gives you challenges that involve that game mechanic that get progressively harder. Even after beating this game 4 times, I still get stumped on some puzzles. THAT is good game design.All in all, Portal 2 is a masterpiece of a game. There is something for everyone in this game, and I fully recommend buying this at full price. Quick note, I haven't really touched Multiplayer or the level editor.			",187,22,5,18,9,1,8

												I very happily recommend this game even though it may not take you more than a day to get through all the puzzles. It is very fun especially the co-op and any puzzles with gels are just amazing. So like I said, while you may not play it again and again it is a nice game to play on a boring afternoon when you have nothing to do (except the things you should be doing of course).

												What can I say...Even after 3 years (!) the game is still worth buying. Not only for the PTI because in the year 2015 a lot of mods are going to be relased. For instance:-Alive & Kicking- a total remake of the first portal.-Conversion (sadly might be cancelled because of the hard political state of Ukraine ;( )- The only thing that I can say. It will be awesome.-Repercussions- From the videos of it I can say that: Valve quality. Made by the same guy that created the Black Mesa: Source mod.-Portal Stories: Mel- Developed by the guy above and a couple of other great modders.And that`s only the top of the ice mountain of additional content that will be relased.So... buy it even if you know everything about it, because the golden era of this game will start very soon! ;3			",108,28,3,11,10,2,11

												Think of the best thing you can possibly imagine... Now double that... (You are thinking about two threeboobed chicks right?)And that's just half of how good this game is. It has amazing atmosphere. Great humour. Perfect dialogs. And it never gets boring. If you don't already own portal, that's fine. Portal 2 is a stand-alone game anyway. You don't need to have played the first game to enjoy this. So. Get this game, you will not be sorry.The multiplayer is also pretty fun, it has a really fun twist in the end - but besides that, it's pretty much just puzzles. No real story in that gamemode. Anyway. Time for the verdict... +Amazing atmosphere+Perfect story and humour+Even though it's running on the source engine - it looks amazing.-Disappointing multiplayer.9.5/10			",114,17,4,18,4,2,5

												Portal 2 follows up with the same game mechanics as Portal but this time adds in a full single player campaign. Once you're done with single player there is another lengthy co-op campaign, and once you're done with that there are a few bonus co-op DLC levels included called Art Therapy. This game gets you scratching your head on how to solve complex puzzles but starts off with simple puzzles so you can get used to the mechanics and various game elements. Highly recommended, and nothing beats the feeling you get once you solve a chamber that has been stumping you for awhile. Lastly, thanks to the Steam Workshop there are an infinite amount of community made chambers waiting for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

По окончанию игры она мне показалась какой-то доброй), не смотря на то, какими были беспощадными ГлаДос и Уитли.Хороший саунд. Впринципе его тут мало, но вот в конце он вообще эпик) Также хороший кооперативный режим. Жду третью часть, хоть бы она была...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely the best game I ever played.  Has an innovative, funny and extremely clever campaign.  I highly suggest it.Along with a great story, Portal 2 has a great multiplayer option.  It is challenging and well conceptualized. Another great tool this game has is an in game level developer.  You can create levels using this tool and publish them to the workshop.  You can also use the Portal Aufhoizing Tools to take your levels to the next level.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not entirly sure what to say about Portal 2 that hasn't already been said in either Steam reviews or elsewhere. All I can do is add to those thoughts.It's a fun game, and at times a little challenging. It's perhaps not as challenging as the original Portal was, and the increased story elements take away from the awe of a story actually unfolding before your eyes in what appeared to be a straightforward puzzle game. Yet, Portal 2 has a lot of humor and the characters are great. The story is fun to follow and only adds to the experience. There are a few Easter Eggs in the game for Valve fans, which is a nice touch. In short - sit back, play and enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With an intriguing story line, great voice acting followed through with fun, innotative puzzles, Portal 2 is certainly amongst my favourite games of all time. Given to me as a christmas present, i've been playing non stop ever since. I highly recommend investing your money into this wonderful creation. If you haven't played the original, not to worry, nor have I, the story line is easy and fun to catch on especially as the game is filled with dark humour causing you to learn more about the main character's past. Also the story actually delves into the history of ""Aperture Science"" so if you want a fun game to keep you entertained, this is the game to purchase.

												Great test for your mind, gameplay is very good for me. I like games like this. In comparison to Portal 1, it adds new co-op mode, which I've finished twice with my friend... Why? Beacuse it's great. Gameplay in co-op mode refers to singleplayer gameplay. Gameplay of singleplayer is a continuation of Portal, where you are 'back' in the ruined Aperture Science, and you are still trying to escape. Will you finally escape...?9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												English: A masterpease, an exeptional puzzle game and a huge improvement on the original game. The story is great, the multiplayer is great, the gameplay is great and the environment is great the only problem I have with this game is that it is too short in my opinion if the game was a few hours longer it would have been much better.

												Do I really need to review Portal 2? Ok. As you can see, it's a sequel to the original Portal. The basics of the game are the same - you need to use portals to overcome different puzzles. In Portal 2 you have new mechanics(including different versions of cubes), you have new environment(like Aperture Labrotories from 50ties). Also you have co-op in Portal 2(it's a completly different campaing) and Steam Workshop support(which keeps this game alive - that's how I played 100 hours). Pick it up if you liked original or if you want some good action-puzzle game with great atmosphere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really love this game.I am a person who really likes difficult puzzle games, especially ones with nice story and dialog.Portal 2 I found to be too easy though. It wasn't as challenging as I wanted. I like the humor and dialog a lot though. Weatley and GlaDOS are pretty meniaclly hilarious. I liked Portal 1 better because the voice of GlaDOS was a little more robotic and believeable, and the puzzles were a little tougher.I liked Portal 2 because it was longer, and there was more to it. Overall it is a great game, good music, great visuals, and voice acting, and at times has challenging puzzles. You should play it as well as Portal 1.The thing that keeps me coming back time and again to this game is the community created content called Community Chambers. You can download test chambers made by members of the community for both Co-Op and Solo. You can also create test chambers of your own just using the vanilla game. I LOVE that feature. It gives the game INFINITE replayability. Some of the maps that people make can be really tough too, and I like that. You can continue to play maps made by the community, and there will always be more than you can even play because people keep making them.That is the main reason why I got this game for Steam when I already had it for Xbox360. On Xbox you cannot play community content or make your own maps. Even if you have this game for console you should try it on steam for community chambers. I highly recommend it. You can play chambers for hours.Buy it for INFINITE replayability!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2... the game people have been demanding since the world was lit with light. The masterpiece that fills your eyes with tears of joy... that cake.... It's undeniably a game you would want to grasp as soon as possible; embrace the companion cube, learn the truth about cake... umm... friendship. If one portal wasn't enough, then two is more than you could ever imagine. You won't be needing anything else! Take 2 pay for 1, they come in two colors, have a nice day! But that's not it! If you order as we speak, you'll get a free potato and a lemon! Hold your horses... let's double that offer! You will now get two potatoes and two lemons! You must think we just cloned that deal using a cloning machine, but fear not... we keep our minds inside the safe zone at all times.As the boss says: ""When you give up, that's when you truly *bleep* up."" Reach beyond your imagination, befriend the repair robot, color everything with experimental gels, reveal the lie as it unfolds itself....

												Let me start by saying I'm quite a fan of the Portal series. The gameplay ideas are well thought out and the aesthetics of an old, worn down Aperture Science are stunning.The voice acting is amazing. Ellen Mclain's voice acting for GLaDOS is delightful, and Wheatley... oh, there's so many words to describe...The gameplay was very unique, you started out with a few levels from the first Portal game, before being thrown into a new set of tests, in a barren Aperture Sceince.When I got to the gel levels, I literally just sat there, saying to myself ""Wow... just, wow.""Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fresh take on the Puzzle genre and for those who have time to kill.

												So, I never played Portal or Portal 2 before, this holiday sale though got me to buy the bundle and figured I mind as well as see what the hype is all about.In the first one, I had a few chuckles, and the puzzles were fairly straightforward.  The ending level was incredibly long and I found myself getting more annoyed with it then enjoying it.  Overall, it was a fun little game, but didn't snag me.The next day, I figured I'd beat Portal 2 just to say I finished the series before saying I didn't really enjoy it.  At first, I was expecting more of the same, and was given more of the same.  However after what I thought was the end to a fairly decent puzzle game, the suprise happened.  I don't want to go into spoilers but after the fall, it really got interesting.  I loved the lore and backstory and explaination given there, but still found the puzzles a bit easy, and at times, very tedious.  When the third gel was added, the climb back up really was the first time I got frusterated by the puzzles, as it seemed very unclear how to proceed.  Solving those final puzzles of that section were very rewarding, and that and the story got me looking forward to the final battle.  The puzzles when back in the modern factory were far more annoying than hard in some places, and challenging in others.  The final battle was interesting.Overall, as a Portal newb, I was fairly glad that I beat both games without looking anything up, reading any guides, or resorting to outside help.  That experience left me with a sense of satisfaction, and with the reasonable length of the two games, that satisfaction of time well spent, and the fun of the stroyline, left me having to say, I found these games very enjoyable.So, for someone who went into the series knowing nothing but memes, expecting nothing but memes, and going into it already deciding it wasn't a series for me, I was pleasently suprised.  For anyone else expecting the same, I recommend you give it a try, you'll find yourself changing your mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The 99% positive reviews are probably enough to convince you to get this game, but if you still have your doubts then maybe this review will help you.Portal 2 is a great experience, however, not everyone may enjoy it, or feel it was worth buying. The game, like Portal, is entirely puzzles. You get your portal device, make portals, and find a way to get past to the next area. I liked that the game had a very smooth and nice introduction to the concept of the game. All the mechanics were taught in a challenging, meaningful and consequently, entertaining way. The gameplay was very enjoyable. Portal 2 offers much more levels, and therefore, hours of gameplay. This said, the level of challenge Portal 2 offers is much greater. The game introduces several new mechanics, which make the gameplay evermore interesting. Aside from these, you get a smooth soundtrack that enhances the atmosphere of the game. Another great aspect of the game was the co-op mode. The multiplayer in this game, I must praise. Brilliant. It is a legit idea to buy a 2-pack, simply for the sake of playing the co-op with a friend. The co-op feature alone is a good enough reason to get the game. It feels very rewarding to complete series of levels with a friend.Now with a highly praised gameplay by critics, and 99% positive review rating from the steam community, you would assume the game has no bad points right? No? Well, I personally feel it does have a minor one.Story. Some people may not even care about this, but I do. I really enjoyed Portal, and enjoyed narrative of the game. Portal 2 obviously continues from where you left off, but sadly, the actual story wasn't so engrossing. I liked the characters, GLaDOS and Wheatley (great voice acting!) but for the most part of the single player mode, I did not care for what you were supposed to do. There is no clear direction or purpose, and it felt like just random story elements were added for the heck of it. I couldn't fully appreciate this aspect of the game.ConclusionWith the vast amount of content available from community contributions, along with the map creation feature, you cannot get enough of this game. Though I personally enjoyed the singleplayer mode of Portal better, due to it being shorter and a more constructive narrative, it really is just my preference. Portal 2 is a great game to play first, and there is a great amount of content you can find around the Steam community. Puzzles are much more challenging, but overall feel quite rewarding when solved.As to why I stated that you may not think it's worth buying, here is why: some people just don't enjoy puzzle games. I have quite a few friends that only have a few hours into this game, and they felt it was boring. I can understand this, and if you felt bored, it may not have been worth paying for. I feel that if you pay the full price just to play for a few hours, just to know you would get bored, then it's not worth it. This said, I would highly recommend waiting for the discount, or purchasing it in a bundle. To end on a positive note, game is solid. Try to get it the moment it's on sale92/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 takes the puzzle-solving formula of the original and expands upon it, whilst filling it out to make a full stand-alone game. There's a fantastic story well told with interesting characters and great set-pieces.The story is engaging, the sound design astounding (particularly the music), you'll want to push on to see the next twist in the plot, the next interaction with the games cast of off-beat characters. The voice acting and animation of these characters really bring some life to the corridors of Aperture Science.Some may be put off by the 'puzzle' element, and although that is a key part of the game, it's blended in so well you don't notice as the game changes foot from action to puzzles to story and back again; these elements each encroach upon each other, sometimes at unexpected moments. The game is well designed and balanced, unobtrusively teaching you all you need to progress, leaving you feeling like a genius.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 is a first-person perspective puzzle game. The Player takes the role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robots—Atlas and P-Body—in the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint;in the cooperative game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle.The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.The initial tutorial levels guide the player through the general movement controls and illustrate how to interact with the environment. The player must solve puzzles using the 'portal gun' or 'Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device', which can create two portals connecting two distant surfaces depicted as matte white, continuous, and flat. Characters can use these portals to move between rooms or to ""fling"" objects or themselves across a distance. Outlines of placed portals are visible through walls and other obstacles for easy location.Game elements include Thermal Discouragement Beams (lasers), Excursion Funnels (tractor beams), and Hard Light Bridges, all of which can be transmitted through portals.Aerial Faith Plates launch the player or objects through the air and sometimes into portals. The player must disable turrets or avoid their line of sight. The Weighted Storage Cube has been redesigned, and there are new types: Redirection Cubes, which have prismatic lenses that redirect laser beams, spherical Edgeless Safety Cubes, an antique version of the Weighted Storage Cube used in the underground levels, and a cube-turret hybrid created by Wheatley after taking control of Aperture.The heart-decorated Weighted Companion Cube reappears briefly.Early demonstrations included Pneumatic Diversity Vents, shown to transport objects and transfer suction power through portals, but these do not appear in the final game.All of these game elements open locked doors, or help or hamper the character from reaching the exit.Paint-like gels (which are dispensed from pipes and can be transported through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them.Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface,and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals.Only one type of gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time only. Some surfaces, such as grilles, cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or wash away gels, returning the surface or object to its normal state.The game includes a two-player cooperative mode.Two players can use the same console with a split screen, or can use a separate computer or console; Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 3 users can play with each other regardless of platform; a patch provided in late 2012 added split-screen support for Windows and Mac OS X users under ""Big Picture"" mode.Both player-characters are robots that control separate portal guns and can use the other character's portals.Each player's portals are of a different color scheme, whereof one is blue and purple and the other is orange and red.A calibration chamber separates the characters to teach the players to use the communication tools and portals. Most later chambers are less structured and require players to use both sets of portals for laser or funnel redirection, launches, and other maneuvers.The game provides voice communication between players, and online players can temporarily enter a split-screen view to help coordinate actions.Players can ""ping"" to draw the other player's attention to walls or objects, start countdown timers for synchronized actions, and perform joint gestures such as waving or hugging.The game tracks which chambers each player has completed and allows players to replay chambers they have completed with new partners.

												I find so hard to believe how *well made* this game is. I passed Portal three times (but I've got a total of 9hrs, not much at all)  and thoroughly enjoyed it; mostly because it's inside the Half-Life universe. I had been wanting to play Portal 2 for a very long time because of it, since the first game was so original and well thought-out. I actually memorised most of the Portal levels and tricks, so I thought Portal 2 wouldn't be a huge challenge, and that it'd be easier. I thought it wouldn't make me think as much as the first game, I was sure of it. And I was wrong.Valve has crafted something astounding with Portal 2. There were about four chambers in which I was so frustrated I just wanted to rip the hair off my skull. The game forced me to think and puzzled me a great deal. When I wasn't stressing myself, shooting portals all over the map and jumping to my death in exasperation every ten seconds, I was astounded and unable to believe how incredibly well made the maps are and how well executed the chambers are. Portal isn't my favourite Valve game, subjectively to me it isn't the best. But objectively, I have to say Portal is Valve's best creation. They have crafted something special in this game, three influential factors (two which I'll count as one): Humour, tragedy/darkness and originality. The first factor is evident. Cave Johnson and his speeches are hilarious. GlaDOS is a ♥♥♥♥♥, and yet her intended-to-be-hurtful comments are hilarious and found a way to make me gasp in both surprise and humour. The long-fall boots, turret trailer and the Portal Valentine's Day video are hilarious to say the very least (and freaking original!).The second factor is well covered up by the first factor, but it is still there nevertheless. Portal has a tragic story: that is undeniable. Aperture Laboratories has a tragic, screwed-up background. Test subjects were treated like dirt, the scientists didn't care an iota about their welfare and Cave Johnson didn't even try to hide his contempt towards them. That's why it's screwed-up, but it's tragic because it's an abandoned facility which used to be one of the greatest science companies of all time (even though they had their fair share of controversies) and it wasn't abandoned because of its bankrupcy, or because they ran out of ideas/products. It's because everyone was murdered, dammit! Every single scientist we know of, except Rattman, is dead and just when Aperture had its most promising project under its sleeve. Not a single soul is seen in Aperture; death is such a strong essence in Portal but the tragedy is well masqueraded by the undeniable humour. The third and last factor is the most astonishing one: ORIGINALITY. The test chambers, the idea of the game, the execution of physics in the game to make a realistic notion out of the puzzle-solving with the Handheld Portal Device; as bizarre as the idea of a gun which shoots portals in plain surfaces sounds, Valve found a way to make it seem both believable and realistic. Both with the execution of physics in the game and with the explanation of the gun itself. It's incredible. These three factors, but the last one specially, is why I consider Portal is the best game Valve has ever made, and why I consider it to be one of the most amazing games to *ever* be created. I recommend it to *everyone*.Thank you Lord Gaben for hiring the folks at Nuclear Monkey Software to create this franchise. PRAISE GABEN!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has got to be one of the most fun, most rewarding and entertaining experiences I have had in a game.First I simply played the single-player and enjoyed it a lot, felt I received my moneys worth. But after playing a bit of coop with my sister I just felt inspired to get around and write a review.So where to begin? Perhaps gameplay. It takes a gimmick, shooting portals to travel, manipulate stuff and ultimately solve puzzles. Portal 2 runs with the gimmick and, in true Valve-style, creates puzzles which feel more rewarding and organic than typical videogame puzzles, where it usually feels like you are trying to mind-read a cryptic all-powerful creature, a creature which tries its best to mask what it wants from you, which punishes every experimentation and failure harshly and without even giving you a clue of where you went wrong.Instead, Portal does things like Half-Life 2 did (I touched upon it in my HL2 review here), there´s more of a sense of observing, putting things together without too much arbitrary design choices and rules which never seem to stay consistent and trustworthy. Portal 1 and 2 has some arbitrary things like portals firing upon white surfaces, but it makes this clear and stick with this rule, it creates an environment where learning the rules is not useless, but you keep adding them up lawfully, like a scientist exploring how the game universe operates.It´s fun to figure puzzles out, rewarding, and you can incrementally add up the steps, instead of having to hold in mind a complicated maze and then have to succeed on your first try or start from scratch. I mean, you can and have to strategize, but it can be done in parts, and it is more organic, than feeling gamey, like having to remember the way to put some tilepuzzles together from some scrap of a picture you caught a glimpse of earlier in the game.The Single-Player story was fun, the pacing, telling, the little details you can pay attention to or run past are immersive. I could go on, but many of the strengths of Valve games are here in Portal 2, so what I´ve said about HL2 applies, in the style of relying on atmosphere, environments and observation, coupled with narration. It was a well rounded satisfying experience. I´ll admit it´s now some months since I played SP so I can´t go to more details, but my impression is still very positive. I still have a general idea of the actual substance of the story, it was a bit whacky at times, a scifi story with comedic twists and turns, but it was still told well and had the content was enjoyable, even Wheatley for me, though I´ve heard some were annoyed by that character.But the coop has been utterly fabulous. From the simple way to invite friends and jump into the game, the joy of figuring things out and the game giving the tools to allow you to communicate effectively (mic obviously a tool available), with pings with options to point out where to stand, what to look at, how to interact with, the remote view which allows you to see things from your friends perspective, and just the dynamic, organic humour of flying around portals, messing around, gesturing in a silly way, taunting Glados-- I haven´t played it yet fully, but I expect many more similarly enjoyable rich hours. There´s some story in there as well, it feels like Valve wanted the coop to be rich enough to stand equally strong on the SP campaign side. Some even like the coop more than SP, and I´m starting to see why.As a source engine, the game looks beautiful, plays solidly with little problems, bugs or performance issues, and is a great open engine allowing tweaks and mods. The game has Workshop and will possibly add even more fun to play, both SP and coop.If I were someone to give scores, my initial playthrough would have been a solid lovely 8-9/10, but now after starting to fool around with coop, this is simply 10+ out of ten for me.

												I have been playing this game for almost 11 years now, I got this game when it first released and it has come a long way since its first release. When it released, it was nothing but a racing game with only 2 cars in it, A Mini Cooper and a generic hatchback. Now today it is a puzzle game with portal guns and they are colourful and pretty. The switch from a racing game to a puzzle game was very good and I hardly noticed they switched. The puzzles in this game confuse me so much, I have yet to pass the second puzzle because I keep getting distracted by the beautiful visuals that are in this game. In the next update to this game I read online that they are adding a sniper rifle so we can shoot the turrets instead of being forced to use our brains to avoid them, which I think will add alot more variety in the game. My only wish is that they implement a Team Deathmatch style game mode where we can make classes and kill the other team. Overall, this game is a really good game that I rate 6 out of 10, get it.

(please play them, it makes me happy knowing people are bashing their heads in from difficulty)This is a must have for EVERYONE. If you play it with me I promise we'll be good, good, GOOD friends.

For the beginners or people who want to buy this game, it's totally worth it. Hours of enjoyiment and figuring out the puzzles is great way to spend some time.PS. I highly suggest to play singleplayer through before you are going to play CO-OP, just because you will get the idea how this works and know who are the characters you play as.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a new and improved Portal game, with single player campaign that continues the story from Portal 1, an new co-op campaign, and the developers have basically given us Portal 3, when they gave us the level editor. Hundreds of thousands of community made levels are now playable. Thank you Valve for this AWESOME GAME!!! I highly recommend everyone to play the Portal franchise.10/10 - The Art of GamingPS. I still prefer if Valve makes Portal 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GREAT GAME, had lots of fun playing it. Awesome physics and mechanics, great levels designs and gameplay. Didn't stay stuck for too long on any stage which made the game enven more enjoyable. Something that I really enjoy was the humor and the sarcasm in every scene (well done). There is only one down-side to the game: it is quite short (beated the co-op and single player in about 15h), but that is understandable, due to the fact that such great effort went to making every stage. I highly recommand this game, more specifically to people who love platformers and strategy game. I don't regret anything about this purchase, a couple of nights (even days) of fun. Once again, GREAT GAME.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before you get this game it is recommended to get portal 1 first to truly understand the story of portal 2 or you might be clueless to what is going on. After this definitely get this game and play the single player. If you do have a friend who also has this game play co-op with them. co-op tough is highly recommended to do with a friend but you can do it with other people online. you can also make chambers to share to the world and play with your friends and other peoples friends over at the workshop (you can also make single player chambers as well and do make sure that people cant take easy shortcuts, get a friend to test it with you).

												Testing is probably the right thing to say about Portal 2, with all the puzzles in the game it is nearly impossible to get a grasp on all of them in an instant. But why doing all that brain-hurting stuff alone? Just take a friend with you - even if the story differs.But what makes Portal 2 this good? I played alot of it already and tested a lot of user created maps in the workshop, which is another great feature, they were really hard and i enjoyed to solve them alone or with friends even if you sometime get to a point where you are just frustrated because you just can't find the right way to do it.Anyway - Portal 2 is on of the best an funniest game i've ever played and so should you - have fun and good luck!

												This game is amazing.It takes you months to beat it, and by the time you've beaten it you forgot how to do all the puzzles so you can do it all over again. When you've donw that a ffew times, you can play with your frieds and co-op takes you like 6 months.Basically, my point is its really fun and it never gets boring. Its not a game that you play for a couple of hours then never play again. I highly recomend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games you'll ever play, I guarantee it.Portal 2 has two great different game modes: Singleplayer and Co-Op. Sadly, if you don't have any friends, you won't be able to play the co-op, but in my opinion, the singleplayer alone would be worth your money.Your problem solving skills will come to a test while playing this, but the story alone in this game is something to love; Portal 2 is a perfect example of great narration and character interaction with the player. The characters are enjoyable and the gameplay is easy enough to master. You can explore and find easter eggs that tell you more about the plot and the world you're in.The co-op is also entertaining. Puzzles that you have to solve with a friend? Nothing could be more fun! The commands help communication alot - you can watch your friend in a small window to see what he sees, and with the easy commands you can tell your friend what to do. You practically don't need voice chat at all, but it does help alot! The puzzles in the game are fun as well, as the small storyline that goes along with the co-op - nothing major, but still enjoyable. And the community maps are endless - you can always get more community made maps, that can be wonderful to play through!TL;DR: 10/10, would play again. Must buy game if on sale in Steam!You can also have a drinking game with a friend, if one of you fails, take a shot. You'll get hammered in no time, because mistakes are bound to happen.

												This is VALVe... Making a great sequel yet again. Not only singleplayer is amazing and fresh, with a very strong story, but the co-op is one of the best co-op games out there. And with the steam workshop and community maps for both singleplayer and co-op, it's literally an endless fun! VALVe at it's best, this game is perfect!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All of the old tricks, a bunch of new tricks, and even more GlaDOS than ever before - what's there not to love? This time, the trusty portal gun will be not only your weapon in a battle of wits against cybernetic malevolence, but also an instrument of story-telling and a tool of exploration as the game throws you out of the septic confinement of test chambers and into cyclopean environments that guard the history of Aperture Labs. Some of the locations have an almost ""open world"" feeling about them and the puzzles will often turn into a challenge of ""Find Waldo"" involving portal-able surfaces, and many of them could be described as ""cheap"" in retrospect. Yet the story and the consistently amazing character writing are enough to keep you going even through the most frustrating of trials.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having completed the singleplayer (and played about half the co-op), here is my review:Great game. Fun, challenging, lengthy enough to statisfy. This game has significantly more story than the 1st, and the story is good. I found all the new mechanics introduced to be incredibly fun. The co-op is great as well, the levels require working together, but there are still plenty of oppurtunities to kill each other. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played too many games on Steam as of yet, but this one is by far my favorite of them. The story is well crafted and the ending was so good it left me speechless. (Plus, it was thundering outside my house which added to the dramatic effect :P) I unfortunately had Wheatley's Betrayal spoiled for me by a friend, but minus that I went into this game completely blind and had a blast. I am definitely looking foward to playing the co-op mode with one of my friends and then playing the original as well.  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 is, by far, my favorite strategy game.With the loads of content it has in the normal game, you can also play community-made levels; There is an infinite amount of playtime in this game. Level-designing is also one of these fantastic features that I personally really enjoy!Each test I complete in this game, I either think ""I'm a genius!"" or ""How did I not think of that earlier?"". A great succes just like the original Portal, but even better with all the new features such as special ability-gels. This game requires quite a bit of a strategical mind, a good timing and controlling skills.Over all, Portal 2 is a great game, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is into strategy games.

												Edit, wanted to rewrite this whole review. Portal 2 is the only reason I got back into gaming. I was at a school center, and I saw the place had a COMPUTER LAB, that also had PS3's and 360's. I was pretty happy. At the time, all I played was Minecraft. I used to play my Nintendo DS and DSi and my Gameboy, but I grew out of them. Usually the computers were taken by people playing Minecraft, so I sat myself down at a 360, and I checked under the counter for games. There it was. Portal 2. I played that game so much. Need for Speed: Most Wanted reeled me in to deciding that I wanted a PS3. I got a PS3 with Most Wanted and Portal 2 and other games. I was so happy. One day, I checked the inside and saw there was a code for a free copy on Steam. I remembered that I made a Steam a year ago because my friend told me to, but I never used it! I was happy because you needed a retail or Steam purchase to unlock all Steam features. I started to build my Steam collection from there, and I started an obsession over ALL Valve games, especially Counter Strike and Half Life. Portal 2 is sincerely my favorite game ever.

For the beginners or people who want to buy this game, it's totally worth it. Hours of enjoyiment and figuring out the puzzles is great way to spend some time.PS. I highly suggest to play singleplayer through before you are going to play CO-OP, just because you will get the idea how this works and know who are the characters you play as.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Online CO-OP is fantastic, Unless your team mate is an idiot. 10/10 Would play again ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 is an experience that must be played to truely understand what it is. Is it a shooter, or a puzzle game? The answer is both. Portal was one of the games that defined this generation of gaming, among other Valve creations, raising the bar for the quality of the sequel. I am happy to report that it does not dissapoint. With 3 new charactors (Wheatley, Cave Johnson and Caroline), Portal 2 delivers a plot that is perfect in nearly every way, adding to the original, but not taking away. Alongside the many charactor developments and plot twists that I will not mention (you have to see for yourself!), gameplay is beautiful. The added mechanics make for more interesting puzzles than in the first game and many more of said puzzles. The Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or the portal gun, is back and better than ever. You get the portal gun towards the start of the game and keep it until the end. You will encounter many new challenges that you must solve, up until the end. The end of the game is something that should not be spoiled, but I will tell you that it does not dissappoint.After the single-player experience, the game keeps going into the new co-op mode. Playing as one of two bots with your friend controlling the other makes for an interesting experience. Yes, this means there are two portal guns, and yes this means that there are four portals. These puzzles are challenging depending on how well you do. If you sit in the corner not contributing, you will not get through the first puzzle in the co-op campaign. There are many moments in co-op where you just feel like having fun and playing tricks on your partner, which the game lets you do. It is obvious that this game will put your friendship to the test. With voice chat and your ""ping tool,"" you have ease of communication, so you can't blame the game for that. These tools are quite fun and easy to use, so there is no learning curve.To summerize, Portal 2 is definately worth the $20 it costs and even more worth it when it goes on sale. I've replayed the single-player many, many times and enjoyed the game all the way through my play time of 100+ hours. Portal 2 gets a 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you still haven't played this or the first Portal... Then you should be buying it RIGHT NOW. It's too good and really funny. Shoot portals, solve brain-melting puzzles and get insulted by an extremely sarcastic AI. All for a good price. Don't forget you can also download solo or co-op puzzles made by the community, for free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spectacular game, great charater development, excellent storylines. Hell, what can I say? This is one of the best games i've ever played. This game not only carried on chell's story, and executed its ending perfectly, but also created a co-op gamemode, so you can enjoy the game with your freinds. Furthermore, the main story line takes us to the depths of aperture science laboratories, and touches us with the backstory of Cave Johnson, and GLaDOS. I absaloutely loved both the single player mode and the co-op mode, as they were both halarious modes, and it was an amazing adventure all together. 10/10, love this game not only for the humor, but for the great story-lines.UPDATE: It's been almost a whole year since I finished this game. I cannot tell you how much is miss every bit of this game. This is by far my favourite game and whenever anyone would as what my favourite game is, Portal 2 is the first thing that comes to mind; this game is amazing in every way and I HIGHLY reccomend getting it when its on sale or even when its normal price. Trust me, you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the characters even got an award for being on of the best villians in video games! I've beaten the campaign three times now! The co-op puzzles are good too. Great temawork skills are involved, so only play with a good listener and a good thinker! All in all, as I said before, in my top two favorite games. And I've played a ton of games!

												What have we been wishing our lives? oh yeah! a portal gun for the lazy people (im joking calm down). Portal 2 brings it up the next level for the original Portal. This time we get to finally know a lot more about Aperture Laboratories and its dark side. Like in the original game there are 2 people back, Chell (Hero) and GlaDoS (anti-villan). This game brings up right where Portal ended well kinda as you are in a dorm room? You eventually meet someone named Wheatley who tells you that youve been sleeping for 100 years (clear white lie) and that the entire Laboratory is destroyed because of you (so true). The puzzles in each room increase and so does the story. The Co-op is strongly recommended cause many people do not co-operate with you since every puzzle is literally meant for 2 people. Than comes the beloved Steam Workshop making our lives 200% harder. Since you can make your own level, 99% people will rage quit im not lying its not only true but funny.I give this game 9/10 because the co-op mode doesnt have enough features and in my opinion they should add a little more levels in both single and co-op modes. Now go shoot portals in the wrong place and get yelled at by GlaDoS			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the beat game I've ever played!!!The main part of this game are a whole bunch of challenaging puzzles. They are not very difficult, but quite tricky and you will need some time to observe your surroundings and find out the solution. It will be a real challenge for your observation and imagination.I will also recommen you to play the co-op mode with your friend. You will need really good cooperation skills to make through it, and the tricks you use in co-op mode is fairly different from that you use in single mode.Finally, the story in this game is pretty dramatic and attrative. I enjoy the special perspective of A.I. on human and science, and I love the different personalities of different cores. (especially the yellow core who love space XD)Overall, Portal2 is a really great game that I would always recommend to my friends.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I had to give Portal 2 a score between 1-100, then it would be 999999>This game has got a lot of funny moments and a good plot that tells you the story, without spoiling too much. Maybe the biggest spoiler in the game was a turret.For the music; almost perfect, but sometimes a bit too electric. I liked the fact that the music changed with your actions, your location and plot. I don't see that often in games (if they already have music that fits). I.E; it intensifies when you're defeating the boss and it changes when you use the blue gel or if you kill a turret.The gels are an amazing addition that really adds a new element to the game. Now you don't have only need to think with portals, but also with speed, fysics and bouncyness.And when you're in co-op modus, you have to think with portals twice as much as in singleplayer.Don't forget about the perpetual testing initiative! Since Portal have got an end, and after palying the game more times, you know how to solve the puzzles. But in Portal 2, you can use the maps of the community. And if you want to, you can make your own (like I did).The detaillness of the maps where amazing. You can spilt Portal 2 in 6 parts and every part has got its own properties. For instance, when you're playing in the underground, you see that everything is falling apart due to a lack of maintenance. You also hear that. The soundscape fits amazingly well!Shortly;If you're hesistating, buy it. Portal 2 is worth it. It's even more worth it when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game provides a good and funny story line in single player which I suggest playing first before the co-op because the single player game leads off to the co-op the thrill of the timing and hoping you get the portal to the right location is probably the most complicated thing because you dont know if theres a turrent or any obstacle that could kill you around the corner. The graphics are amazing the physics of the game is great and above all it tests you and your friends loyalties to each other and your wits. Just make sure not to throw your keyboard or mouse out the window and punch a hole in your computer.			",30,1,0,0,2,0,0

That's because this is a more complete game than the original experience, and the co-op mode is great as well.  Speaking of... if you have the PS3 version, you can play co-op with PS3 and PC.

												This game is one of the first i got here on steam, and boy am i GLaD i did it. Hours of fun in the main story, which can feel a bit over extended at times, but still and amazing follow up after Portal. The online part: In the coop feature (that allows you to enjoy killing your gaming companion if that's your wish) you can enjoy new puzzles that can only be solved with teamwork! And if story telling has taught us anything, is that the power of teamwork knows no bounds, and to challenge that we have the custom levels made by fans who get a kick out of having other players die to their intricate layouts.A great gaming experience that i recommend to everyone who wants a good puzzle game.

												Valve takes the show again with this outstanding follow up to the indie puzzle game ""Portal"". Portal 2 manages to be clever, funny, innovative and immersive. The game creates a story you'll never forget however it is fairly short. A seasoned player can complete both the story and co-op story in about 8 hours, but on a first time through it takes about 15-20 minutes. It isn't your average game, but if you buy it I can promise you won't be sorry			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Portal 2 is a game that you will keep you entertained for hours.If you like comedy, challenges and are looking for a game that isn't too short nor to long, Portal 2 is the game you want.This is a must-have for any Steam user.Anyway, I give Portal 2 a solid 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And I can now, without a shadow of a doubt, say ""YES"". Yes, you should buy Portal 2. Five years too late to be saying this, but I really mean it, if you haven't already, you should play this game.

Between the writing of the characters, the level design, the voice work, and the concept of portals and addition of gels, this is the straight up funnest game I've ever played in my life.

												This is my favorite game of all time. The puzzles are complex but not ridiculous, and the story is fantastic and the soundtrack is too. I had a great time playing coop with my friend, although we did the challenge puzzles first by accident. The atmosphere is great too. I wish the main story was longer-only took around 12 hours-but that's alright as there are user levels that are really creative. I'm not too good with the editor but it was still fun making a level. Amazing game, Portal 3 plz			",21,6,0,3,2,0,5

												Portals 1 and 2 are probably the best games because they are so much different from any other fps. Not the typical kill things and win the game. It has an amazing storyline, amazing dialouge, beautiful soundtrack, and crazy puzzles unlike any other game out there. It doesn't matter how old you are, both Portal games are an amazing pick for anyone looking for a new twist of gameplay. 14/10.			",29,9,0,2,3,0,0

New puzzles, new types of levels, and a story that goes from working with GlaDOS again to a story that goes behind the scenes of a former CEO of Aperture Science and a loyal personal assistant who seems familiar. Funny moments in the game as well as serious moments. If you were a fan of Portal, then get this game. Heck, in fact, if you're getting Portal the first time, get this one too if there is a bundle!

												Portal 2, what can I say, the game before it was brilliant but this one, this sequel, has just exeeded what everyone expected of it and more!Once again we are in aperture's science lab however things has changed since before (I won't give anything away about the storyline btw). There is a new robot to guide us and his name is Wheetley. He is absolutely briliant with is quick one-liners and has a fantastic voice actor just to rub it in. And once again there are a new set of mind-boggling puzzles to go through. The game has something that players who just got it will never see coming and the graphics are improved and look so much more immersive and beautiful than ever, you just can't go wrong with it. And like its previous game it has an absolutely amazing ending. However, unlike its previous game it no longer has a sense of the puzzles being repetitive and slightly to harsh for average brains and it is more focused on storyline too. It is definitly one of the best sequels to a game I have ever played and seen in my life.10/10Just play it, you won't be disapointed.			",9,2,0,0,2,0,0

												""I DON'T NEED YOUR DAMN LEMONS.""One of the many great quotes that come from this jewel of a game. After having already played Half-Life 1 when I was 6 and Half-Life 2 the many unbearable years later, I can say that Valve is one of my favorite game developers, and Portal is a game that justifies that dignity. The concept of Portal itself is already exotic in itself. Valve takes this notion and flawlessly creates a game that tackles you with numerous labyrinths along with a tasteful and humorous storyline that grasps your attention to continue on. Even though this game is a puzzle game, a genre that usually can't attract interest like other popular ones today, this game is an exception. One can become easily attached to the eccentric characters of the story, from the cynical ones to the ones that just scream 1 elongated word in space. I've played this game 3 times already and have yet to be tired of it. You'd think I would memorize the puzzles by the second run, but some of them still manage to escape my mind, and I find myself overthinking or overlooking something. The puzzles are flawless and their carefully and meticulously creators made sure that there were no loopholes nor errors. The level creator even allows more hours for endless creativity and fun. Of course, my puzzles are complete crap and have loopholes ever. Easily one of my most favorite games of all time. Get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 is easily one of the best games of this console generation. It's not quite as good as Portal, but it is definitely worth your time. The difference between Portal and Portal 2 is that Portal was a stellar puzzle game with a stellar framework, but Portal 2 is a story that begrudgingly has a puzle game in it. For example, the death mechanic here puts more time between you and what you were doing before. It's still a fantastic puzzle game, and new mechanics like gels and lasers form around the main portal mechanic like fluffed sugar around a stick in a cotton candy machine. And let me tell you, it's delicious cotton candy.			",45,3,0,6,1,0,0

Including fantastic voice acting, dialogue, puzzels oh and of course cake! If you are a fan of Portal or just simply want a fun challenging game, Portal 2 is the game for you!Pro's: Superb Voice acting and puzzels Con's: The mass about of puzzels becomes tiresome.~8/10~			",106,13,3,9,12,0,13

												Played this game co-op with my girlfriend, what a great experience! I sighed countless times as she failed to spatially visualise the solutions. :PDo not miss out on the Co-Op section of this game; playing it with a close friend with built-in voice communications is extremely satisfying and can lead to some great experiences and moments.

												This game, is incredible. The gameplay is nearly flawless, and the idea is brilliant. But first let me addresss everything the naysayers about this game say. 1: Predictable storyline. Hmmmmmmmmmmm I would agree with you there... except you didn't play the whole game. Seriously, almost everyone who says this has not played the whole game. And for the few who did, you clearly did not watch your surroundings enough. The point of the story was to make you want to play more, and it certainly did well on that note. 2: Not very hard. Again, play the whole game first. True, the game was not THAT hard, but I cannot think of a  puzzle game that executes the gameplay as well as portal does. While the game itself was not terribly hard, the community has certainly made some head scratching test chambers that will make you want to eat your own words. 3: Crashes. The game does not crash anymore (except on windows 8 so far) so ignore those reviewers who say that because their review is now irrelevent. Final score 9/10			",19,0,0,3,1,0,3

Amazing story, character development and just a huge improvement over the first one.Although, I do have one beef with the game though, it does ♥♥♥♥ the lore over at times, such as GLaDOS's revival, and the P1 testchambers, but still an amazing game either way.

												I got this game and the original in a bundle that was $7 during the Steam Summer Sale. Now I feel a little guilty about that. Portal 2 is one of the best video games I have played recently, and it's better than the original in every way, let me tell you why. The game has really good gameplay and level design, though they can be really difficult at times. The story itself was one of the best I've seen in a game recently. The game begins with you waking up in a room and Wheatly tries to help you escape Aperture labs. I will not spoil the ending, but it is worth playing for as it was one of the best I've seen. The dialouge in this game is also top notch, but I'm not going to spoil it. I have not gone into co-op mode at the time of this review, so I can't judge it. The only real complaint I have about the game is that it's too difficult at times. Besides that, Portal 2 is an amazing game.My score: 9.5 out of 10I highly recommend getting the game even at it's full price.			",80,19,2,6,15,0,4

												Portal 2 is honestly one of my most favorite games for PC of all time. And that's saying a lot since the game came out in 2011. The story is far more superior to Portal 1, the characters are the closest thing you can get to friends in this game and they're pretty damn hilarious. Each character is developed and created so well that you can get attached to them even if one them is a product of the greatest minds of a generation building the dumbest moron who ever lived. You don't get the scared feeling of being alone anymore in the facility and you're actually more determined to progress since you actually get attached to the story. The facility is much more bigger unlike the first game which actually gives you more space and gives you the futuristic feel. GLaDOS also gained much more emotion which makes you feel more close to her. The concept was amazing to begin with starting with the first game. The story is not that deep but is handled so well that it's actually so lovable. It's an awesome game overall and I would LOVE to see sequels. Do it now.			",18,8,0,4,2,0,2

												What have we been wishing our lives? oh yeah! a portal gun for the lazy people (im joking calm down). Portal 2 brings it up the next level for the original Portal. This time we get to finally know a lot more about Aperture Laboratories and its dark side. Like in the original game there are 2 people back, Chell (Hero) and GlaDoS (anti-villan). This game brings up right where Portal ended well kinda as you are in a dorm room? You eventually meet someone named Wheatley who tells you that youve been sleeping for 100 years (clear white lie) and that the entire Laboratory is destroyed because of you (so true). The puzzles in each room increase and so does the story. The Co-op is strongly recommended cause many people do not co-operate with you since every puzzle is literally meant for 2 people. Than comes the beloved Steam Workshop making our lives 200% harder. Since you can make your own level, 99% people will rage quit im not lying its not only true but funny.I give this game 9/10 because the co-op mode doesnt have enough features and in my opinion they should add a little more levels in both single and co-op modes. Now go shoot portals in the wrong place and get yelled at by GlaDoS			",112,15,3,18,10,0,15

												Who'd have thought that such a simple concept could be so complex and intricate? Portal is like a modern day equivalent of chess, but with a portal gun, no board and no pieces. So, entirely nothing like chess then... There is the similarity of having to think several steps ahead though, so that malformed chess comparison might be of some merit after all. There's no story in chess either, unless you've made you're own narrative up, involving the queen running off with the bishop to a rook on the back of a knight. If so, then perhaps you should seek help.""Taking a trip down the Funnel of Death.""So, the patented Aperture Science portal gun is back once again, and if you thought some of Portal's test chambers were convoluted, then you're in for a rude awakening with Portal 2, as there are some real brain-melting doozies awaiting in the numerous test chambers of Aperture Laboratories. Portal 1 feels like it was a dry run for this, the main event, which not only tells a killer story with more twists and turns than an Excursion Funnel (more on those later), but it takes the core portal concept and throws in a whole load of new mind-bending mechanics.What follows is a blend of frustration, puzzlement, bewilderment and thankfully, a hefty dose of jubilation. You see, nothing beats the feeling of satisfaction upon solving one of Portal 2's expertly engineered tests, amid the taunts and barbs being dispensed by omnipotent AI, GLaDOS, who is back with a vengeance for the sequel. With the addition of Repulsion Gel, Propulsion Gel, Conversion Gel, Faith Plates, Hard Light Bridges and Excursion Funnels, Portal 2 kicks things up several notches, creating some of the most fiendish head-scratchers you're ever likely to come across.At certain junctures, we'd become seemingly, insurmountably stuck and curse the game design, the level design and everything while trying to formulate a solution to a particular obstacle or what appears to be a total impasse. Moments like these are hugely frustrating, essentially because they make you feel stupid for not being able to get into the right mindset. And after that complete feeling of hopelessness at your own cognitive shortcomings, the reward of a 'eureka' moment, when the solution is suddenly right there in front of you, is entirely worth it.""Atlas and P-body are proper endearing, innit?""Of course, there is a lot to learn in Portal 2, but Valve pitches the learning curve perfectly, slowly easing you into the various mechanics, gently laying things out for you so it all makes sense, even if you missed playing the first Portal. Things start off nice and simple then, once returning protagonist Chell experiences her rude awakening, and before you know it, you're back in the clean-walled confines of the Aperture Laboratories ready to be taunted and cajoled through increasingly testing experiments. Soon, you'll come across blue Repulsion Gel that enables you to bounce off any surfaces painted in the stuff, orange Propulsion Gel that speeds up your running speed and white Conversion Gel that enables you to project portals on it. Then the game throws Excursion Funnels into the mix, which enable you to float through the air to otherwise inaccessible plateaus, and it's combining all of these elements that makes Portal 2 so immensely and gratifyingly challenging.And for a while, you'll be prodded from test chamber to test chamber, bending to GlaDOS's every whim, until everything predictably goes horribly awry. To say any more would be a horrible spoiler, but suffice to say that Valve has crafted a narrative that really does have it all. It's funny, dark and tense in equal measure, as well as consistently entertaining from start to finish.It's the gameplay that really makes Portal 2 such a joy though and everything else is just the icing on the... - we had to say it at some point – cake. That's before you even consider co-op, which is a whole separate campaign on its own, starring the most endearing droid duo since C3PO and R2D2. Playable in local split screen – vertical or horizontal: your call – or online with a friend or a random, Portal 2's co-op is pure genius, encouraging communication and actual, proper co-ordination. Playing without a headset really isn't an option, despite being able to project markers and start countdowns via the in-game HUD, and playing with someone you don't know proves remarkably difficult, if not nigh-on impossible. Even Valve knows this, as it even thought to include a warning disclaimer telling you that the game won't be as fun if you try and play with a person not on your friends list.""We don't think BP is to blame for this one.""Get an actual friend to play with you though, and you'll find that tearing through all five Courses of test chambers is a blast, with Atlas and P-body high-fiving and dancing their way through even more slickly designed stages that deal with each specific game mechanic Course by Course. It's enormous fun to hit Portal 2 in co-op and being given four portals to play with rather than two puts a whole different spin on the game's basic mechanics. In fact, we can't remember the last time we played a co-op title like this, that required constant communication between the two-players in order to beat each puzzle. Be forewarned though, you may need a large TV screen to get the best out of playing co-op in split screen. Online however, it all works brilliantly.Portal 2 continues a great tradition of clever and inventive achievement lists concocted by Valve, rewarding exploration with a few Easter eggs, including a few hidden surprises that shed light on certain aspects of the Aperture Science story. There's an excellent balance between single-player and co-op achievements too, making playing both modes even more essential. Most achievements are attained through natural progression, but there might be a few you miss along the way. Luckily, upon completing both the single-player and co-op facets of the Portal 2 story, you're able to jump back into any of the chapters. This is done via the hub in co-op, where you can also mess around gesturing and playing rock, paper, scissors to your heart's content. All in all, Portal 2's achievement list is excellent then.A riveting journey from start to finish, Portal 2 is yet another unmitigated triumph for Valve, building upon an original concept that was incredible to begin with and making it even more incredible. At times it might have you tearing your hair out, but ultimately if you loved Portal 1 (and who didn't?), you're going to eat up Portal 2 like a big old piece of vanilla crazy cake.

Didn't stay stuck for too long on any stage which made the game enven more enjoyable. Something that I really enjoy was the humor and the sarcasm in every scene (well done). There is only one down-side to the game: it is quite short (beated the co-op and single player in about 15h), but that is understandable, due to the fact that such great effort went to making every stage. I highly recommand this game, more specifically to people who love platformers and strategy game. I don't regret anything about this purchase, a couple of nights (even days) of fun.

												This game is amazing.It takes you months to beat it, and by the time you've beaten it you forgot how to do all the puzzles so you can do it all over again. When you've donw that a ffew times, you can play with your frieds and co-op takes you like 6 months.Basically, my point is its really fun and it never gets boring. Its not a game that you play for a couple of hours then never play again. I highly recomend this game.			",34,5,0,4,6,1,6

												Amazing Game. Challenging. Different. Interesting. This game peaks my interest and there will always be more challenge. Led by a sassy Artificial Intelligence Named GLaDOS ( Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System ). The game is beyond amazing.

												Amazing game, one of the best I have ever played. It is rich with lore, comedy, and also that nice hint of creepy stuff Valve loves to throw into their games. The puzzles are truly quite enjoyable, but being a complete genius like myself, I solved each test almost instantly! *ambitious laughter* But anyways, the characters are amazingly done, the entire story that the game tells you along with the one you uncover on your own has truly left me satisfied. This game is indeed a masterpiece and I would recommend this to any and everybody who has not played this magnificent work of art! It's bloody brilliant!			",66,12,0,5,2,1,0

												Valve takes the show again with this outstanding follow up to the indie puzzle game ""Portal"". Portal 2 manages to be clever, funny, innovative and immersive. The game creates a story you'll never forget however it is fairly short. A seasoned player can complete both the story and co-op story in about 8 hours, but on a first time through it takes about 15-20 minutes. It isn't your average game, but if you buy it I can promise you won't be sorry			",118,12,1,15,10,2,4

												Testing is probably the right thing to say about Portal 2, with all the puzzles in the game it is nearly impossible to get a grasp on all of them in an instant. But why doing all that brain-hurting stuff alone? Just take a friend with you - even if the story differs.But what makes Portal 2 this good? I played alot of it already and tested a lot of user created maps in the workshop, which is another great feature, they were really hard and i enjoyed to solve them alone or with friends even if you sometime get to a point where you are just frustrated because you just can't find the right way to do it.Anyway - Portal 2 is on of the best an funniest game i've ever played and so should you - have fun and good luck!

How have I not written a review for it yet?  Everything about it is fun.  I mean, you have a MASSIVE Singleplayer Campaign with a well thought out Story.  And you also have a Co-Op Campaign, with brilliant chamber design.  And even if you're done with the game, you can keep coming back for more with community made test chambers!  It's just so much bigger and better than the original Portal.  Speaking of how I feel about the original Portal... What did I rate it?  9.8 out of 10?  Well then, I say Portal 2 is a 23.6 out of 10!			",32,13,1,2,4,0,1

												Loved the game in 2011. But sadly it ended there. The story was one of the best in gaming but the game was far too short.I played the multiplayer half way throught with two controllers on my PS3 by MYSELF. Because everyone in the community and in my friendlist seems to be too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to complete the first level without my help so I didn't actually ever experience the joy of Portal 2's co op.After completing the game I actually cried the tears of joy while listening to the ending soundtrack. (maybe because I was tired or maybe because of the nostalgia that bursted out from 2007)Truly a lovely piece of gaming. Would recommend if you haven't played throught already. It's worth it.

												I really love this game.I am a person who really likes difficult puzzle games, especially ones with nice story and dialog.Portal 2 I found to be too easy though. It wasn't as challenging as I wanted. I like the humor and dialog a lot though. Weatley and GlaDOS are pretty meniaclly hilarious. I liked Portal 1 better because the voice of GlaDOS was a little more robotic and believeable, and the puzzles were a little tougher.I liked Portal 2 because it was longer, and there was more to it. Overall it is a great game, good music, great visuals, and voice acting, and at times has challenging puzzles. You should play it as well as Portal 1.The thing that keeps me coming back time and again to this game is the community created content called Community Chambers. You can download test chambers made by members of the community for both Co-Op and Solo. You can also create test chambers of your own just using the vanilla game. I LOVE that feature. It gives the game INFINITE replayability. Some of the maps that people make can be really tough too, and I like that. You can continue to play maps made by the community, and there will always be more than you can even play because people keep making them.That is the main reason why I got this game for Steam when I already had it for Xbox360. On Xbox you cannot play community content or make your own maps. Even if you have this game for console you should try it on steam for community chambers. I highly recommend it. You can play chambers for hours.Buy it for INFINITE replayability!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2... the game people have been demanding since the world was lit with light. The masterpiece that fills your eyes with tears of joy... that cake.... It's undeniably a game you would want to grasp as soon as possible; embrace the companion cube, learn the truth about cake... umm... friendship. If one portal wasn't enough, then two is more than you could ever imagine. You won't be needing anything else! Take 2 pay for 1, they come in two colors, have a nice day! But that's not it! If you order as we speak, you'll get a free potato and a lemon! Hold your horses... let's double that offer! You will now get two potatoes and two lemons! You must think we just cloned that deal using a cloning machine, but fear not... we keep our minds inside the safe zone at all times.As the boss says: ""When you give up, that's when you truly *bleep* up."" Reach beyond your imagination, befriend the repair robot, color everything with experimental gels, reveal the lie as it unfolds itself....

												Portal 2, what can I say, the game before it was brilliant but this one, this sequel, has just exeeded what everyone expected of it and more!Once again we are in aperture's science lab however things has changed since before (I won't give anything away about the storyline btw). There is a new robot to guide us and his name is Wheetley. He is absolutely briliant with is quick one-liners and has a fantastic voice actor just to rub it in. And once again there are a new set of mind-boggling puzzles to go through. The game has something that players who just got it will never see coming and the graphics are improved and look so much more immersive and beautiful than ever, you just can't go wrong with it. And like its previous game it has an absolutely amazing ending. However, unlike its previous game it no longer has a sense of the puzzles being repetitive and slightly to harsh for average brains and it is more focused on storyline too. It is definitly one of the best sequels to a game I have ever played and seen in my life.10/10Just play it, you won't be disapointed.			",9,2,0,0,2,0,0

												A freaking awesome game that kept me wanting more untill the last minute! I love the Portal series so much, I even changed my name to Cave Johnson!Haha I wrote that over a year ago. The game is still very fun, it makes you think, and here is my #1 advice for the game: if you dont know how to answer a puzzle, just try it different ways, your bound to find it somehow, but please dont cheat and look up the answers on google, it ruins the fun of the game.

												Do I really need to review Portal 2? Ok. As you can see, it's a sequel to the original Portal. The basics of the game are the same - you need to use portals to overcome different puzzles. In Portal 2 you have new mechanics(including different versions of cubes), you have new environment(like Aperture Labrotories from 50ties). Also you have co-op in Portal 2(it's a completly different campaing) and Steam Workshop support(which keeps this game alive - that's how I played 100 hours). Pick it up if you liked original or if you want some good action-puzzle game with great atmosphere.			",107,2,0,6,5,1,10

												GREAT GAME, had lots of fun playing it. Awesome physics and mechanics, great levels designs and gameplay. Didn't stay stuck for too long on any stage which made the game enven more enjoyable. Something that I really enjoy was the humor and the sarcasm in every scene (well done). There is only one down-side to the game: it is quite short (beated the co-op and single player in about 15h), but that is understandable, due to the fact that such great effort went to making every stage. I highly recommand this game, more specifically to people who love platformers and strategy game. I don't regret anything about this purchase, a couple of nights (even days) of fun. Once again, GREAT GAME.  ",14,2,0,1,2,0,0

												This game is literally the most incredible puzzle game you will ever play. Brilliant and orignal Sci-Fi Dystopian story with a nice dark tone set in the Half-Life universe. Challenging and well-thought-out puzzles that progressively change with more and more features. A puzzle game that still manages to make combat an epic puzzle on it's own. Graphics are good for its time (4 years ago now). Voice acting is superb and the music is incredibly well-done. Throw in multiplayer and the capability for custom chambers and you have a the single highest rated game on Steam. Seriously, buy this game. Get your friends to buy this game. Do it.

												This game is amazing.It takes you months to beat it, and by the time you've beaten it you forgot how to do all the puzzles so you can do it all over again. When you've donw that a ffew times, you can play with your frieds and co-op takes you like 6 months.Basically, my point is its really fun and it never gets boring. Its not a game that you play for a couple of hours then never play again. I highly recomend this game.			",34,5,0,4,6,1,6

												One of the best games you'll ever play, I guarantee it.Portal 2 has two great different game modes: Singleplayer and Co-Op. Sadly, if you don't have any friends, you won't be able to play the co-op, but in my opinion, the singleplayer alone would be worth your money.Your problem solving skills will come to a test while playing this, but the story alone in this game is something to love; Portal 2 is a perfect example of great narration and character interaction with the player. The characters are enjoyable and the gameplay is easy enough to master. You can explore and find easter eggs that tell you more about the plot and the world you're in.The co-op is also entertaining. Puzzles that you have to solve with a friend? Nothing could be more fun! The commands help communication alot - you can watch your friend in a small window to see what he sees, and with the easy commands you can tell your friend what to do. You practically don't need voice chat at all, but it does help alot! The puzzles in the game are fun as well, as the small storyline that goes along with the co-op - nothing major, but still enjoyable. And the community maps are endless - you can always get more community made maps, that can be wonderful to play through!TL;DR: 10/10, would play again. Must buy game if on sale in Steam!You can also have a drinking game with a friend, if one of you fails, take a shot. You'll get hammered in no time, because mistakes are bound to happen.

												Valve takes the show again with this outstanding follow up to the indie puzzle game ""Portal"". Portal 2 manages to be clever, funny, innovative and immersive. The game creates a story you'll never forget however it is fairly short. A seasoned player can complete both the story and co-op story in about 8 hours, but on a first time through it takes about 15-20 minutes. It isn't your average game, but if you buy it I can promise you won't be sorry			",118,12,1,15,10,2,4

												The 99% positive reviews are probably enough to convince you to get this game, but if you still have your doubts then maybe this review will help you.Portal 2 is a great experience, however, not everyone may enjoy it, or feel it was worth buying. The game, like Portal, is entirely puzzles. You get your portal device, make portals, and find a way to get past to the next area. I liked that the game had a very smooth and nice introduction to the concept of the game. All the mechanics were taught in a challenging, meaningful and consequently, entertaining way. The gameplay was very enjoyable. Portal 2 offers much more levels, and therefore, hours of gameplay. This said, the level of challenge Portal 2 offers is much greater. The game introduces several new mechanics, which make the gameplay evermore interesting. Aside from these, you get a smooth soundtrack that enhances the atmosphere of the game. Another great aspect of the game was the co-op mode. The multiplayer in this game, I must praise. Brilliant. It is a legit idea to buy a 2-pack, simply for the sake of playing the co-op with a friend. The co-op feature alone is a good enough reason to get the game. It feels very rewarding to complete series of levels with a friend.Now with a highly praised gameplay by critics, and 99% positive review rating from the steam community, you would assume the game has no bad points right? No? Well, I personally feel it does have a minor one.Story. Some people may not even care about this, but I do. I really enjoyed Portal, and enjoyed narrative of the game. Portal 2 obviously continues from where you left off, but sadly, the actual story wasn't so engrossing. I liked the characters, GLaDOS and Wheatley (great voice acting!) but for the most part of the single player mode, I did not care for what you were supposed to do. There is no clear direction or purpose, and it felt like just random story elements were added for the heck of it. I couldn't fully appreciate this aspect of the game.ConclusionWith the vast amount of content available from community contributions, along with the map creation feature, you cannot get enough of this game. Though I personally enjoyed the singleplayer mode of Portal better, due to it being shorter and a more constructive narrative, it really is just my preference. Portal 2 is a great game to play first, and there is a great amount of content you can find around the Steam community. Puzzles are much more challenging, but overall feel quite rewarding when solved.As to why I stated that you may not think it's worth buying, here is why: some people just don't enjoy puzzle games. I have quite a few friends that only have a few hours into this game, and they felt it was boring. I can understand this, and if you felt bored, it may not have been worth paying for. I feel that if you pay the full price just to play for a few hours, just to know you would get bored, then it's not worth it. This said, I would highly recommend waiting for the discount, or purchasing it in a bundle. To end on a positive note, game is solid. Try to get it the moment it's on sale92/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 takes the puzzle-solving formula of the original and expands upon it, whilst filling it out to make a full stand-alone game. There's a fantastic story well told with interesting characters and great set-pieces.The story is engaging, the sound design astounding (particularly the music), you'll want to push on to see the next twist in the plot, the next interaction with the games cast of off-beat characters. The voice acting and animation of these characters really bring some life to the corridors of Aperture Science.Some may be put off by the 'puzzle' element, and although that is a key part of the game, it's blended in so well you don't notice as the game changes foot from action to puzzles to story and back again; these elements each encroach upon each other, sometimes at unexpected moments. The game is well designed and balanced, unobtrusively teaching you all you need to progress, leaving you feeling like a genius.			",176,102,1,19,7,1,14

												So, I never played Portal or Portal 2 before, this holiday sale though got me to buy the bundle and figured I mind as well as see what the hype is all about.In the first one, I had a few chuckles, and the puzzles were fairly straightforward.  The ending level was incredibly long and I found myself getting more annoyed with it then enjoying it.  Overall, it was a fun little game, but didn't snag me.The next day, I figured I'd beat Portal 2 just to say I finished the series before saying I didn't really enjoy it.  At first, I was expecting more of the same, and was given more of the same.  However after what I thought was the end to a fairly decent puzzle game, the suprise happened.  I don't want to go into spoilers but after the fall, it really got interesting.  I loved the lore and backstory and explaination given there, but still found the puzzles a bit easy, and at times, very tedious.  When the third gel was added, the climb back up really was the first time I got frusterated by the puzzles, as it seemed very unclear how to proceed.  Solving those final puzzles of that section were very rewarding, and that and the story got me looking forward to the final battle.  The puzzles when back in the modern factory were far more annoying than hard in some places, and challenging in others.  The final battle was interesting.Overall, as a Portal newb, I was fairly glad that I beat both games without looking anything up, reading any guides, or resorting to outside help.  That experience left me with a sense of satisfaction, and with the reasonable length of the two games, that satisfaction of time well spent, and the fun of the stroyline, left me having to say, I found these games very enjoyable.So, for someone who went into the series knowing nothing but memes, expecting nothing but memes, and going into it already deciding it wasn't a series for me, I was pleasently suprised.  For anyone else expecting the same, I recommend you give it a try, you'll find yourself changing your mind.			",145,39,3,46,29,2,37

												Portal 2 continues where Portal left off, putting you through aperture labs testing courses with your trusty portal gun. As a fan of the series really this is all you can want, portal shooting shenanigans only this time with the added bonus of multiplayer and user generated levels! Continue the story, then pop over to co-op and go from there and you have a game worth recommending to pretty much everyone, I mean after all its Portal!			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												I find so hard to believe how *well made* this game is. I passed Portal three times (but I've got a total of 9hrs, not much at all)  and thoroughly enjoyed it; mostly because it's inside the Half-Life universe. I had been wanting to play Portal 2 for a very long time because of it, since the first game was so original and well thought-out. I actually memorised most of the Portal levels and tricks, so I thought Portal 2 wouldn't be a huge challenge, and that it'd be easier. I thought it wouldn't make me think as much as the first game, I was sure of it. And I was wrong.Valve has crafted something astounding with Portal 2. There were about four chambers in which I was so frustrated I just wanted to rip the hair off my skull. The game forced me to think and puzzled me a great deal. When I wasn't stressing myself, shooting portals all over the map and jumping to my death in exasperation every ten seconds, I was astounded and unable to believe how incredibly well made the maps are and how well executed the chambers are. Portal isn't my favourite Valve game, subjectively to me it isn't the best. But objectively, I have to say Portal is Valve's best creation. They have crafted something special in this game, three influential factors (two which I'll count as one): Humour, tragedy/darkness and originality. The first factor is evident. Cave Johnson and his speeches are hilarious. GlaDOS is a ♥♥♥♥♥, and yet her intended-to-be-hurtful comments are hilarious and found a way to make me gasp in both surprise and humour. The long-fall boots, turret trailer and the Portal Valentine's Day video are hilarious to say the very least (and freaking original!).The second factor is well covered up by the first factor, but it is still there nevertheless. Portal has a tragic story: that is undeniable. Aperture Laboratories has a tragic, screwed-up background. Test subjects were treated like dirt, the scientists didn't care an iota about their welfare and Cave Johnson didn't even try to hide his contempt towards them. That's why it's screwed-up, but it's tragic because it's an abandoned facility which used to be one of the greatest science companies of all time (even though they had their fair share of controversies) and it wasn't abandoned because of its bankrupcy, or because they ran out of ideas/products. It's because everyone was murdered, dammit! Every single scientist we know of, except Rattman, is dead and just when Aperture had its most promising project under its sleeve. Not a single soul is seen in Aperture; death is such a strong essence in Portal but the tragedy is well masqueraded by the undeniable humour. The third and last factor is the most astonishing one: ORIGINALITY. The test chambers, the idea of the game, the execution of physics in the game to make a realistic notion out of the puzzle-solving with the Handheld Portal Device; as bizarre as the idea of a gun which shoots portals in plain surfaces sounds, Valve found a way to make it seem both believable and realistic. Both with the execution of physics in the game and with the explanation of the gun itself. It's incredible. These three factors, but the last one specially, is why I consider Portal is the best game Valve has ever made, and why I consider it to be one of the most amazing games to *ever* be created. I recommend it to *everyone*.Thank you Lord Gaben for hiring the folks at Nuclear Monkey Software to create this franchise. PRAISE GABEN!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Expands on the original Portal formula adding some new tricks. Gameplay still remains similar to the original, although in the sequel, the campaign is certainly more of a full game. High production values make sure the game has excellent graphics and sound. Its got humour and at times feels like you're playing through a Pixar film. Still, overall I think the game is somewhat over-rated. If you enjoyed the first Portal, the sequel is bigger and better, but if you didn't find the first game that special, I don't think the sequel will change your mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing this game for almost 11 years now, I got this game when it first released and it has come a long way since its first release. When it released, it was nothing but a racing game with only 2 cars in it, A Mini Cooper and a generic hatchback. Now today it is a puzzle game with portal guns and they are colourful and pretty. The switch from a racing game to a puzzle game was very good and I hardly noticed they switched. The puzzles in this game confuse me so much, I have yet to pass the second puzzle because I keep getting distracted by the beautiful visuals that are in this game. In the next update to this game I read online that they are adding a sniper rifle so we can shoot the turrets instead of being forced to use our brains to avoid them, which I think will add alot more variety in the game. My only wish is that they implement a Team Deathmatch style game mode where we can make classes and kill the other team. Overall, this game is a really good game that I rate 6 out of 10, get it.

												Portal 2 takes the puzzle-solving formula of the original and expands upon it, whilst filling it out to make a full stand-alone game. There's a fantastic story well told with interesting characters and great set-pieces.The story is engaging, the sound design astounding (particularly the music), you'll want to push on to see the next twist in the plot, the next interaction with the games cast of off-beat characters. The voice acting and animation of these characters really bring some life to the corridors of Aperture Science.Some may be put off by the 'puzzle' element, and although that is a key part of the game, it's blended in so well you don't notice as the game changes foot from action to puzzles to story and back again; these elements each encroach upon each other, sometimes at unexpected moments. The game is well designed and balanced, unobtrusively teaching you all you need to progress, leaving you feeling like a genius.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But after playing a bit of coop with my sister I just felt inspired to get around and write a review.So where to begin? Perhaps gameplay. It takes a gimmick, shooting portals to travel, manipulate stuff and ultimately solve puzzles. Portal 2 runs with the gimmick and, in true Valve-style, creates puzzles which feel more rewarding and organic than typical videogame puzzles, where it usually feels like you are trying to mind-read a cryptic all-powerful creature, a creature which tries its best to mask what it wants from you, which punishes every experimentation and failure harshly and without even giving you a clue of where you went wrong.Instead, Portal does things like Half-Life 2 did (I touched upon it in my HL2 review here), there´s more of a sense of observing, putting things together without too much arbitrary design choices and rules which never seem to stay consistent and trustworthy. Portal 1 and 2 has some arbitrary things like portals firing upon white surfaces, but it makes this clear and stick with this rule, it creates an environment where learning the rules is not useless, but you keep adding them up lawfully, like a scientist exploring how the game universe operates.It´s fun to figure puzzles out, rewarding, and you can incrementally add up the steps, instead of having to hold in mind a complicated maze and then have to succeed on your first try or start from scratch. I mean, you can and have to strategize, but it can be done in parts, and it is more organic, than feeling gamey, like having to remember the way to put some tilepuzzles together from some scrap of a picture you caught a glimpse of earlier in the game.The Single-Player story was fun, the pacing, telling, the little details you can pay attention to or run past are immersive. I could go on, but many of the strengths of Valve games are here in Portal 2, so what I´ve said about HL2 applies, in the style of relying on atmosphere, environments and observation, coupled with narration. It was a well rounded satisfying experience. I´ll admit it´s now some months since I played SP so I can´t go to more details, but my impression is still very positive. I still have a general idea of the actual substance of the story, it was a bit whacky at times, a scifi story with comedic twists and turns, but it was still told well and had the content was enjoyable, even Wheatley for me, though I´ve heard some were annoyed by that character.But the coop has been utterly fabulous. From the simple way to invite friends and jump into the game, the joy of figuring things out and the game giving the tools to allow you to communicate effectively (mic obviously a tool available), with pings with options to point out where to stand, what to look at, how to interact with, the remote view which allows you to see things from your friends perspective, and just the dynamic, organic humour of flying around portals, messing around, gesturing in a silly way, taunting Glados-- I haven´t played it yet fully, but I expect many more similarly enjoyable rich hours. There´s some story in there as well, it feels like Valve wanted the coop to be rich enough to stand equally strong on the SP campaign side. Some even like the coop more than SP, and I´m starting to see why.As a source engine, the game looks beautiful, plays solidly with little problems, bugs or performance issues, and is a great open engine allowing tweaks and mods. The game has Workshop and will possibly add even more fun to play, both SP and coop.If I were someone to give scores, my initial playthrough would have been a solid lovely 8-9/10, but now after starting to fool around with coop, this is simply 10+ out of ten for me.

												Portal 2 is a very good game.It's got a great storyline, amazing humor, pretty hard levels, and a whole lot of science.It's a Valve classic. Lots of features, such as co-op play and level creating!When I first got this game, I thought that Portal 2 would be pretty weird. Once I got into the second chapter, I was hooked. The puzzles were challenging and very clever. Once I finally beat the game, I played it again. And again. And again.All in all, this is one of my all time favorites.Storyline:You play as Chell, a test subject at Aperture Science. You have been held captive for many years. You now have to make your way through the abandoned ruins of Aperture with the Handheld Portal Device.Have fun with this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've put over 110 hours into a game that has a 6 hour storyline. And that doesn't factor in the hours I put into it on my PS3. That should tell you something about how fun this game is. Between the writing of the characters, the level design, the voice work, and the concept of portals and addition of gels, this is the straight up funnest game I've ever played in my life. It's my go-to game for showing someone who ""doesn't like video games"" how much fun games can be. I can't imagine somebody playing this and not enjoying themselves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2, what can I say, the game before it was brilliant but this one, this sequel, has just exeeded what everyone expected of it and more!Once again we are in aperture's science lab however things has changed since before (I won't give anything away about the storyline btw). There is a new robot to guide us and his name is Wheetley. He is absolutely briliant with is quick one-liners and has a fantastic voice actor just to rub it in. And once again there are a new set of mind-boggling puzzles to go through. The game has something that players who just got it will never see coming and the graphics are improved and look so much more immersive and beautiful than ever, you just can't go wrong with it. And like its previous game it has an absolutely amazing ending. However, unlike its previous game it no longer has a sense of the puzzles being repetitive and slightly to harsh for average brains and it is more focused on storyline too. It is definitly one of the best sequels to a game I have ever played and seen in my life.10/10Just play it, you won't be disapointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 is an amazing sequal to Portal. It has it all: Plenty of puzzles, a good story, good graphics, good dialog, good characters, and more. The puzzles really make you think, and the game is much longer than the previous. I enjoy building my own test chambers in the editor, and am learning how to use Hammer to make more advanced levels. The only downside to this game is some mild language, but there is very little. All in all, a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game like no other, makes you work your mind to beat it, a lot more innovative than Portal 1 and has many new fun elements that's makes it a wonderful experience even for people who don't like puzzle games like me, simply worth your time and money.Note: don't play when you are feeling tired, you will be a lot less functioning and everything will seem a lot harder, rest them come back and the part where you were stuck will be easy, just like many other games.

												I recieved this game as a gift, and did not expect to enjoy it very much since I wasn't the puzzle game type. I have never been so wrong.Portal 2 has become one of my favorite games of all time. It's levels are neither too easy as to be boring nor too difficult to become extremely frustrating, making for a challenging and entertaining game. Each level is also very unique, which allows for the campaign to be easily replayable, as you will probably forget how to solve almost every puzzle. CO-OP is also a pleasure, as two people can share in the fun as they work together to solve a puzzle, and it is complete with high-fives and rock-paper-scissor matches.What really caught me off guard, however, was the story, which drew me in and motivated me to complete the levels. Valve also adds humor to a futuristic lab environment in ways that are absolutely hilarious (and sometimes very cold).All in all, I give Portal 2 a 9/10 and would reccomend it to anyone who likes somewhat of a challenge.

												While the single player mode of Portal 2 isn't as witty as that of the first Portal game, the new mechanisms you have to use to solve levels keep things interesting. Portal 2's most important change though, is the coop mode and the community chambers. These two ensure that you have a virtually endless source of entertainment to enjoy with a friend.

												Game is like terror training camp for blue and orange circle shooters.  You do many training over and over.  First big robot lady make you do tests.  Then you go to old place and do more tests with bouncy and speed liquid.  Finally you do more tests with idiot robot.Overall the game is testing.  If you like testes this game for you, for sure.Best thing about game is robot conversations.  It is like watching a Barclay card advert at times but in a good way.  I now have Barclay card so I can send many dollars to my uncle in Nigeria.  I never meet him before but said if I send him many notes he will send many more back.  You see, he is very sick man and cannot go to bank to withdraw his millions made from black diamonds and oil.  Maybe oil got on diamonds, I cannot be sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This could be the greatest game of all-time.A puzzle game, disguised as a first-person shooter, Portal 2 continues the story of the original Portal, and further builds on the chemistry between the silent protaganist (you) and the dry, witty yet homicidal A.I. controlling the facility you're trapped in.You start in a setting post-Portal, but wind up taking a tour of Aperture Science's past through a buried labyrinth of forgotten test chambers, as you learn the origins of the 'science' and GLaDOS.Stephen Merchant hilariously adds his talent to the voice cast as the bumbling Wheatley, and J. K. Simmons lends his stalwart, matter-of-fact tone to the newly introduced Cave Johnson, founder of Aperture.I can't imagine a more well-written or better voiced script.  You're guaranteed to love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My favourite part of Portal 2 is Co-Op becuase it gets more and more challenging!-------====================UPDATED 2016 EDITION====================-------Almost three years after buying this game on Steam, I still enjoy it SOOOOOOOO MUCH somehow, I have never EVER felt bored when playing this game and it has so many features and puzzles it's AWESOME!!! If your new to Steam, even if you have it on your old Xbox 360, THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST GAME YOU BUY!!! This game is truely amazing and will always stay in my heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly well made 1st person puzzle platformer by valve.Portal (1) was a great little demo that got such a great reception they decided to make a follow up. Portal 2 is essentially the same as portal 1, but now a full AAA title, a bigger story, a fantastic well written antagonist, great humor and atmosphere. There are some new game play added, but the idea is still the same -  Get out of the (areas) by using the portal gun. Some puzzles are really quite clever.If you like the first portal, you must have this one too. Now it also has a co-op game and steam-workshop that ads a lot to the game, but the campaign alone is well worth the price of the admission.Even though the source engine might be a little dated, it still works absolutely perfect in this game. I never found myself thinking the game was old. What the games is trying to achieve, it does really well. It is quite a gloomy and sad place in a way, even though there is lots of clever and fun humor.I found myself coming back to the game at times, even though I have completed it. It just feels nice to complete again, and the antagonist(s) is(are) that good you don't mind hearing her(him) again.Runs well on most PCs and still manages to look great. I have no complains about this game. It is a very smooth experience. Runs better with mouse and keyboard even though it is quite well optimized for a controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal, is a sandwhich, not any sandwhich that you may think of like a ham and butter a la soufle type of deal. No this is a game with many amizingly crazy wicked cracked eaten and puked out layers of deliciously goodness. Finding another game to play would be a pitty if this were not on you wishlist. I made this game, no i am not a watermelon in a tortilla? Where would you get that idea from anyway. Ok, let's talk characters. Glados, that is not how you spell the name BTW, yes you crazy guy who looks at the review. Dont think that the force is not strong with this game, oh f*ck is it ever. Your head will be spinning and you eyes will be soar after playing this awesome game. Oh, well yesterday i talked to obi wan kenobi, no he did not die. I asked him what game he wanted for christmas. He said Star Wa... I punched him in the eye, butt, nose, mouse, tooth, ear, and we we! Then he switched his awnser to Portal 2. Light sabers are no match for this mind boggling onion breath smelling thing of a game. We acually found a copy of this game while i was at the thrift shop, it was being sold for 100$. I asked why, the lady or maybe it was a man i am not too sure. But anyway, they said that that is their best selling item. Even though that was their only item and most expensive. Anyway, fighting yoda was hard if you are a noob at the force. and darth maul and wheatly. We tly we tea. ok well...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Place a Portal here then place...wait have i said this before? This game picks off perfectly after the last portal. Portal 2 feels fantastic with a great improvement on graphics gameplay and somehow even better dialog. the characters feel lively and the new mechanics don't feel forced and fit right in with the last games feel. blending new and old perfectly with great multiplayer chaos and a co-op mode that has you coming back. community support that adds more and more to play and when the story ends your challenge truly begins with all that content to explore from the community. I Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles and especially any fan of the first game. Portal 2 is an easy 10/10 and now i just want portal 3. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Together with its predecessor, ""Portal 2"" provides a very unique gaming experience, in which every single piece of the puzzling adventure is thought of, adding up to a game which achieves to constantly surprise the player by always finding a different way of approach.Unlike many other modern games, ""Portal 2"" vehemently sticks to his roots and tries to preserve the purity of its self-consciousness, meaning that it acknowledges the possibilities but also the boundaries of its medium, while not trying to be the next ""interactive movie experience"" or some other hybridform of gaming. ""Portal 2"" mostly achieves this by creating characters, which don't strive to be perfect or overcomplicated. Instead their characterizations focus on basic attributes, resulting into giving tiny turrets, a ruthless A.I. or even an ordinary cube more personality than most of the other characters in recent video game history.Besides its abilities to tell a sweeping story, ""Portal 2"" also doesn't fail to provide an exceptional gameplay experience, just by equipping the player with maybe the best designed device in video game history. To round up the package even more, the game inherents an excellent soundtrack, which seems to stay still alive in the players head, even after the credits have rolled.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another great game in the Portal series. A lot more difficult than the first one, but still a great game overall. I felt it was left open, and feel like Valve should learn to count higher than three. But, still a great game overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even funnier than the last one, haven't finished it yet, but having a lot of fun so far. It's a great game filled with humor, and challenging, but fun puzzles. Another cool addition to the game was the co-op mode, great idea to add it. And even better the idea to have player-made puzzles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game like no other, makes you work your mind to beat it, a lot more innovative than Portal 1 and has many new fun elements that's makes it a wonderful experience even for people who don't like puzzle games like me, simply worth your time and money.Note: don't play when you are feeling tired, you will be a lot less functioning and everything will seem a lot harder, rest them come back and the part where you were stuck will be easy, just like many other games.

												Game is like terror training camp for blue and orange circle shooters.  You do many training over and over.  First big robot lady make you do tests.  Then you go to old place and do more tests with bouncy and speed liquid.  Finally you do more tests with idiot robot.Overall the game is testing.  If you like testes this game for you, for sure.Best thing about game is robot conversations.  It is like watching a Barclay card advert at times but in a good way.  I now have Barclay card so I can send many dollars to my uncle in Nigeria.  I never meet him before but said if I send him many notes he will send many more back.  You see, he is very sick man and cannot go to bank to withdraw his millions made from black diamonds and oil.  Maybe oil got on diamonds, I cannot be sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Portal 2 - это пример образцового сиквела. Valve развила идеи первой части (которая по сути своей не являлась самостоятельной игрой) и вывела Portal на качественно новый уровень. Игра прибавила в постановке, получила множество интересных загадок и обзавелась потрясающим кооперативом. И конечно же заполнила собой нишу в ожидании сами-знаете-какой игры.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
