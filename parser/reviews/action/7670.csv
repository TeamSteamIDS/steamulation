												The best part of BioShock series so far, simply a masterpiece. Sure, the gameplay's solid, smooth, fun, and plasmids system are quite innovative, but that's not what makes ""Bioshock"" a masterpiece; it's the story. You get a chance to see that a world without morals are doomed to fail, even so beautiful, like Rapture. Dont be lazy to pick up all the audio, or you will miss the most intersting parts of the plot.			",188,69,5,28,24,4,26

												Bioshock is truly an amazing singleplayer FPS game with some RPG elements to it , and it is set in 1960 in the breathtaking and beautiful fallen underwater city of Rapture. I must say , this is one of my favourite games ive ever played from the story to the artsyle to the gameplay , everything is a complete masterpiece! The Story The story of the game is an absolute masterpiece! It begins in 1946 when an underwater city called Rapture , was built by a wealthy Russian immigrant called Andrew Ryan so it can escape the outer world's laws and government and create its own which is mainly based on the rich people's desires thus making the poor to start a rebellion later onSome scientists found a sea slug which can produce a special material called ADAM which can manipulate DNA which can cure diseases and grant people ""super powers"" , funded by smuggler Frank Fontaine they've started to produce Plasmids and Gene Tonics and sell them to , to boost the process they've discovered that if the slugs are implanted into little girls they produce 30 times the amount of ADAM , Then Frank Fontaine opened an orphanage home for little girls and used them as an ADAM FactoryAndrew Ryan attempted to arrest Fontaine but Fontaine faked his own deathDays later a rebellion has started in Rapture against Andrew Ryan  led by Atlas and the poor to bring him down of his throneThe year is 1960 and the game starts as you Jack , the main protagonist , is onboard an airplane which crashes near a mysterious Lighthouse Gameplay The gameplay is just brilliant! The game is a singleplayer FPS with some RPG elements to it as you can choose from many ways to play the game completely diffrently as it best suites you8 unique and interesting weapons to choose from with each one having 3 diffrent ammo types to choose from11 creative and useful Plasmids (super powers) you can choose from which each one has their unqiue and special effect on enemiesMillions of diffrent ways to customize your character with player enchancements which completely change the way you play Graphics Tho the game is released in 2007 i still find the graphics to age very wellThe artsyle of the enviroment of Rapture is at the same time beautiful and creepy in some partsIt totally makes you feel like you're in an adandoned underwater city where a rebellion used to be Soundtrack Nothing special but brings the creepy tone to the enviroment PROS: +A well written Storyline+Brilliant Gameplay+A very well-aged artstyle+Tons of ways to customize your gameplay with diffrent weapons , player enchancements and much more!+Variety of creative and unique enemy types+Dark and Creepy atmosphere+A nice amount of gore+Love the Big Daddies :) CONS: -Nearly the end of the game you'll be full on ammunition and money and the drops of the enemies will be annoying and useless-For Windows 7 users when you first start up the game you'll have some sound and resolution issues which can easily be fixed by finding some guides on the internet ( It didn't work for me tho -_-)-There's a chance that the Steam Overlay for this game won't work after you fix the resolution and sound issues ( as happened to me ... -_-)I totally recommend buying this game if you haven't tried it out yet I rate a total of 8/10Now , would you kindly buy this game and give my review a like? :)			",802,176,19,65,57,8,96

												Bioshock was a genre shifting masterpiece upon release.Looking back, there are some cracks in its foundation that stand out a bit more obviously today after so many reiterations and refinements have been made to first person shooters on the whole, but that the experience is still such a rich, deep, and enthralling one is a testament to how incredible it originally was.Bioshock is first and foremost the story of Rapture, an underwater utopia plunged into chaos by its own design of rejecting traditional ideology. It was a city created to be a safe haven for the most ambitious and intelligent people of the world to tap into their full potential; to experiment and create, free from the burden of morals and law found in the world above. Along with this came the discovery of a gene altering drug known as Adam, which when injected alters the hosts genetic code and bestows superhuman powers to them, from shooting fire from your fingertips to telekinesis and mind control. In a city removed from natural order restrained only by owns own ingenuity, the thirst for power eventually led to the city's demise.Entering this decrepit city as a castaway from a crashed airplane is among the most impressive and memorable opening sequences to any video game I've ever played. It's a perfectly executed series of events, informing you both of what the city once was and the nightmarish hell it became in a matter of moments, before leading you into an astonishingly well crafted world that devours you whole in its overpowering atmosphere. Everywhere you look there are callbacks, visual cues and audio diaries that retell what life was like in Rapture, and how it got to be the way it is. The sense of place and level of detail carved into the environment informing you not only what Rapture was, but what it represented, is an astounding achievement in world design and environmental narratives. There's never a room that feels out of place, or an oddly written character; it all fits together in this twisted world of objectivism steeped in the writings of Ayn Rand, so successfully realized it's almost frighteningly easy to see how a city like Rapture could potentially come about.Much of this is presented non-verbally, with art deco banners and store fronts, dated vending machines, and various subtle hints at Rapture's history peppering the environment and bringing it to life. The disturbing sounds and dialogues of the splicers inhabiting the city add a level of characterization to enemies that turns them into more than soulless targets, providing a glimpse into their backstories and bizarre relationships, and at times making me hesitant to actually kill them (at least until they tried to). The world design is so strong in fact that it largely overshadows the core narrative of your character, one which stays in the background until roughly 2/3 of the way through, and then ends in a rather disappointingly cliched manner. It's not to say it's bad, as when the plot finally comes to the forefront it does it in a way that's startling and unforgettable, but it seems almost secondary in many ways to the numerous auxiliary stories you hear as you make your way through rapture. It's there to keep the experience on a straight path, but it's not what drives it.With how much depth and originality was given to creating this remarkable world, it's a remarkable feat that just as much work has been put into Bioshock's combat mechanics. Utilizing plasmids, the same substances that turned the citizens of Rapture insane, adds a host of combat options to the standard gunplay, often working in tandem with each other to open the game up for dozens of different tactics that makes combat almost like a puzzle as you mix and match the tools at your disposal to find the most potent combinations (one of my favorites was the ""one-two punch"" of electrocuting a splicer, the enemies of the game, and then delivering a hefty hit with the wrench). Being able to carry an entire arsenal with you further broadens your capabilities, allowing you an immense amount of freedom in how you approach encounters and with it coming a welcome amount of variety.The inventiveness and distinction of each enemy you face layers on yet another element to combat encounters, from the different ways splicers react to you and each other (from running straight forward, arms flailing, to climbing the walls and dropping down from above), to the intense encounters with Big Daddies: huge enemies outfitted with an enormously powerful drill and far more speed an maneuverability than there colossal diving suit bodies would have you believe. These fights are brutal and require you to more carefully time your attack and fine tune your strategy, often using the environment and traps you set to your advantage as a head on approach is almost certainly suicidal.The few areas that Bioshock trips up on are largely the result of the existence of its more mechanically sophisticated sequel, which streamlined the tedious hacking minigame and added dual wielding to make combat faster and more fluid.. They aren't huge issues in the overall picture, but it does make returning to the original harder than I'd imagined and would likely seem a bit clumsy to those who played the other two games first (which I would certainly advise against).Despite all the years since its release, very few games have managed to match the scope and creativity of Bioshock's world and mechanics (even its own two sequels). It's an astounding achievement in every area of its design, and the sort of game that would be fair to consider something of a requirement to play. It's among the most amazing games I've ever played, as well as one of my personal favorites that I see myself continuing to return to as without fail I fall back in love with it again.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												The long awaited Bioshock has the distinct honor of being the first non-sports title to usher in the long awaited holiday gaming rush. As the spiritual successor to the System Shock series, Bioshock is a highly anticipated title because of its blend of incredible visuals and innovative First Person Shooting. Our tickets to Rapture have finally arrived, and everyone is obviously wondering if Bioshock can live up to its own hype. The answer is a resounding yes, as Bioshock is a genre-bending adventure-roleplaying-FPS hybrid that completely absorbs the player and doesn't let go until the thrilling end.Bioshock takes place in the underwater city of Rapture, built by the homicidal genius Andrew Ryan. Ryan conceived Rapture as a place for geniuses and the mentally elite to be able to separate themselves for society and flourish without the constrictions placed on them by morality and government. However, something goes deathly wrong in Rapture, leaving most of the inhabitants dead or raving, murderous lunatics. The game begins with the protagonist as the lone survivor of a plane crash in the ocean, with Rapture being your only hope of refuge. You quickly get caught up in unraveling the mystery of Rapture as you fight for survival, getting caught up in the different objectives of other ""sane"" inhabitants that usually need favors before they'll aid you to escape to safety.The blessing and curse of Rapture is the rampant use of Adam, a material that allows individuals to alter their own genetic code and give themselves superhuman abilities. Adam is a hot commodity in Rapture even long after most of its inhabitants are dead. Odd ghoulish girls called Little Sisters harvest Adam from dead bodies while armored monster known as Big Daddies protect the girls from harm. This relationship between Adam, the Little Sisters and the Big Daddies is at the core of Bioshock. Your character needs Adam to evolve and to remain capable of surviving the various foes that Rapture throws at you. However, the choice at the center of the gameplay revolves around the sacrifice of the Little Sisters. Will you kill the changed little girls to get maximum Adam, or will you attempt to save them and risk not having enough power to stay alive?The first and most noticeable thing about Bioshock are the visuals. Bioshock simply looks gorgeous. The underwater effects are among the best ever in a game, which is wonderful since there is a lot of water in the game considering that it takes place at the bottom of the ocean. The character models all animate incredibly as well, and even the protagonist has lifelike movements, flexing his on-screen hands occasionally in a convincing manner for the idle animations. The varied locales all look great as well, ensuring that the game experience is as immersive as possible. Rapture actually feels like the dilapidated city it is supposed to be. You'll encounter scattered bodies, some hung, some killed by gunfire, some killed by traps. There's always a sense that something has happened here, that the stage isn't a simple backdrop for you to explore.The next most noticeable thing is the high level of audio quality in the game. The sound effects are all spot on, from the bang of the shotgun to the whisper of the Little Sister to their protectors. The assorted splicers all chatter when they believe themselves to be alone, espousing nonsensical or deranged statements that reinforce their insanity. Also commendable are the voice actors in the various audio diaries scattered around Rapture.This brings us to perhaps the best quality in Bioshock... the story. Bioshock masterfully weaves an intricate tale by allowing you, the player, to piece together the story of Rapture and its mysterious fall. The various audio diaries, though not essential, help to evince the large picture for the player in between radio transmissions for various characters that guide you to the finale.Though classified as a First Person Shooter, Bioshock shares elements with a role-playing game or an adventure title. The various plasmid induced abilities as well as the different Adam-costing upgrades to your character give you a constant feeling of growth.There are also assorted ""minigames"", such as the ability to hack different machines via a pipeline game, or the ability to take photos of your enemies to give your character combat bonuses against them. There are also slots for combat, physical ability, and engineering where you can equip gene tonics, which enhance your abilities with traits such as a faster melee attack or the ability to turn invisible when idle. You can also upgrade your weaponry and invent items at designated stations. This variety serves to keep the gameplay fresh, as your character is always encountering a new ability, a new weapon, or better traits.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												In BioShock you are a survivor of a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. You are able to make your way to an island where a submarine is waiting to take you to into the great depths below where the mysterious underwater city of Rapture awaits. The city is trashed and genetic freaks called splicers roam around, attacking anything that gets in front of them. In order to survive you will have fight through these Splicers and other oddities keeping your eyes and ears open for clues into what has gone wrong, how you may be able to help or how you can escape.One aspect that makes the storyline work so well is the way it is told. BioShock uses a real time method of telling the story through random radio reports, overheard conversations and audio recordings.You can choose from a variety of different weapons, anywhere from pistols and shotguns to chemical throwers and grenade launchers. Each gun has different ammo that you can use. There are also many plasmids that you can use. You can electrify the water to kill everyone in it, set people on fire, freeze them and then smash them with a wrench, among other things.The graphics in this game are good, out of date, but still good.The sound of BioShock really puts you into the game. From the creepy things the splicers say to the background music, everything fits perfect.BioShock builds a great atmosphere by using terrific graphics and sound to set a creepy mood. BioShock is truly a stunning game and worth to buy.Sounds 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1591,618,71,238,229,30,272

												A marvel. A wonder.For me, it has a much more value than Bioshock 2 or Infinite, because it was before, and it said it all, loud and clear.I don't believe you've not heard a thing about Bioshock, it would be a total bewilderment!Yet I must state there, that Bioshock was like a grasp of fresh air for a submariner, when it hit the shelves in the 2007.In the thick of of bleak and obtuse FPS games, flooded all stocks and minds, Bioshock felt like a blessing from above. Ken Levine made his brightest shot into the eternity. Bioshock is a Magnum Opus. A real deal stuff. A resurrection of System Shock principles with the isogenic battle system (mixture of guns, guts, wits and magic), with modern, looking-better-than-Half-Life-2-graphics, and deep, dark, sound and comprehensive story. Again mankind was looking for salvation, but drowned itself by ever-growing sins like greed, powerlust, and false infallibility.A miraculous experience of witnessing the end of time and humanity. A travel to mad scientist inner space. A nice reason to forget about sleep, in my book.Mark is 8.5/10: the narrative falls down a little in the very end, and there are some other distracting little things on the way through Rapture, that keeps me from praising Bioshock as ""the-best-my-eyes-ever-seen!"" title. But it is still a brilliant of game design, totally worth of your time.			",725,238,45,156,102,5,232

												I can't believe it took me until now to play this game, it's just brilliant. Has its lows like most though but I have to say it impressed me how the story develops and gives you much more than what you could get by just running through shooting things (like you do in some shooters). It's a different shooter in most ways, let's say shooting weapons is not what you'll be doing the most in the entire game, you'll have these kind of superpower things named plasmids which are the aquired and upgraded as you advance and consume a meter bar named eve each time you use them. Also hacking stuff (security cameras, turrets) is a good part of it if you decide to, which is somesort of minigame but very helpful IMO.It's kind of easy if you ask me. I spent the entire game trying to save on everything, I mean, always have the maximum medipacks, the maximum ammo for every gun, etc. Every single bullet was important. I regret that choice as I ended up with most of my arsenal and currency unused. Yes you can run half of the game thru just using very little ammo/eve and just melee attacking your enemies with a wrench (default attack). Of course you'll have a lot more fun if you use guns/plasmids which I recommend you to. There are some unbalanced plasmids however, but try all of them so you can see for yourself which ones you like the most.Also, if you want to get the most of the story you should try to listen as many records as you can, helps you understand the whole thing (you'll find them randomly across the entire game).You'll definitely have a good time playing this. Worth $20? Definitely, but you can find it for $5 on most sales.			",214,50,3,25,13,4,24

												I am extremely Jealous of anyone who hasn't played this yet and gets to experience it for the first time. It is an amazing adventure that will leave you wanting so much more. It will not only hook you on the story, but it will open up a door to a genre you never knew you loved so much. Nothing more needs to be said. If you enjoy an amazing story with a concept that is so amazing that it is almost impossible to believe somebody could come up with, then this game will be your best friend.Easily without hesitation 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bioshock: A Tale of Poor City PlanningBioshock is great.  It is the story of a man who wakes up in the ocean and stumbles into an underwater city full of grumpy people.  In this city it is not only common, but encouraged, to buy chemical supplements and inject them willy nilly into your body.  This seems to have had a negative effect on the general population, but it doesn't stop you from doing it.  Bioshock features monsters and madness, suspense and surprises, twists and turtles, parents and powerups.Pros:Atmosphere.  Bioshock's environment is completely unique.  It's a city with a real story to it, and you learn about it from the plot and the environment itself.  It's beautiful and creepy and immersive.  The music is awesome, the art is awesome, the NPC dialogue is awesome.  Bioshock's atmosphere is awesome.Plot.  Bioshock's story is complex, deep, and of course interesting.  It's constantly engaging, you always want to keep going to find out what the hell is going on, and of course what the hell happened.  It poses questions about individuality, capitalism, government, morality, selfishness... maaaaaan, it's great.Nifty combat.  You get to use superpowers, but you are never overpowered.  Combat is always challenging.  Enemies are varied and interesting.  Big daddies are so fresh.  They are terrifying.Length.  Bioshock is actually a long game (31 hours for me), but it doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's most definitely not padded, it's always moving forward.  You get your money's worth.Cons:You collect way more money and goods than you can ever use.   You just fill up on everything and have nothing interesting to buy.Honestly, the guns feel a little... man, I don't even know how to describe it.  Floaty?  Disconnected?  Not smooth?Conclusion:Bioshock is fantastic and you will be thinking about it long after you've completed it.  Buy it, yo.			",141,26,1,15,8,1,17

												""Why children take so long to grow? They eat and drink like pig and give nothing back. Must find way to accelerate process...""I can honestly say Bioshock is the most fun single player game I've ever played. It has a great story, moments of surprise and interesting twists. You have freedom to make your choices. To be a good person or a bad person. Moral dilemma which is very straightforward in Bioshock. You can very easily predict how it will influence the ending. But that's not where your freedom ends.You can decide whether to destroy or hack security bots, cameras and turrets. You can use weapons you like the most and you can upgrade them. You can choose active and passive abilities (combat, engineering and physical) according to your playstyle, preferences and situations. You can collect items and craft! You can buy items in vending machines and if you hack them you can even reduce the prices there! You can take pictures of enemies with your camera and yield rewards for it. You can also roam around, explore and possibly find valuable items.So many choices!!! But can you really choose?The voice acting is excellent. All the voices talking to you via radio and all the audio recordings you find give you some kind of clue about what was going on. The game looks great. Very impressive graphics.Now would you kindly look out of a window of underwater city of Rapture at least once?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No Game has nor ever will be able to beat Bioshock 1's WTF Moment:  ""Would You Kindly....?""[/b] Very Good Game - Cutting Edge Graphics/Physics at the time, and still impressive today. I like to call it CRYTEK's ""Crysis"" of its time.I do not particularly care for FPS (usually play only the good AAA FPS titles), yet this game managed to give me such a good ever-lasting impression.STORY:Welcome to the Underwater World of Rapture!Your commercial Jetliner crashes in the Ocean. You are the only survivor and manage to swim to a little piece of land. On this piece of land is a little submarine type vessel - you climb into it & pull a lever it causes the vessel to take you underwater. As you are submerging you see a whole city built underwater. This is Rapture. A place built for people who sought freedom from persecution, religion, politics & the morals/ethics of the world. You find out that they began to play around with Biological/Genetic enhancements and that somehow things went wrong. The Setting is very interesting and beautiful but very disturbing as you will soon find out.The Story can get a little confusing at times, but as I mentioned, there is a really awesome WTF Moment or Plot Twist. This happens about half way through the game and after that things should start making a little sense.To enjoy the story to its fullest be sure to collect and listen to all audio logs. They contain vital story points, in depth information about the characters of Rapture and how it all fell apart.GAMEPLAY:Very Unique FPS: Your using of Weapons, Different Types of Ammunition, Plasmids and the Environment all in combination (e.g. Shock Plasmid + Water Combo) to defeat your foes was something new at the time. It had never been done before and it works really great. Never did the combat feel dull or repetitive to me.There are also light puzzles/riddles to solve and hidden areas to find that are loaded with loot & other goodies.WARNINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS:1) Play on the hardest difficulty so that you are forced to use use combos and converve ammuniton to survive.2) Do not  kill Cohen after helping him with his ""masterpiece"".  It will pay off and provide additonal content later on in the game. Don't worry, you can kill him later :-)3) Collect and listen to all Audio Logs - There is a great guide with maps and photos to find them all - otherwise you will miss out on a lot of content.I remember the days when Bioshock 1 came out and everyone was astonished at the graphics, physics etc. and then everyone (including my friends and I) ran out to buy a better graphic card in order to be able to play it.Shortly after Bioshock, Crysis hit and both looked great!RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN EXPERIENCING THE ""SHOCK"" & PARTICULARY ""THE BIOSHOCK SERIES"" OF GAMES:- Play the classic ""System Shock"" games.- After that, play all three Bioshock Games + their DLCs (the SP DLCs are good). Play the games in the order that they were released.- Each time you beat each game,  Read/Watch a few analysises of the story/plots twists/ending/morals of each game before moving onto the next.DO ALL THIS, AND YOU WILL GET THE MOST OUT THESE WONDERFUL GAMES - YOU CAN THANK ME LATER!

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bioshock Original Release: 2007 Genre Tags: FPS; Atmospheric; Action; Story Rich My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-16 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWBioshock is a wonderful example of what can be accomplished in the realm of video games when great design meets great execution. A FPS at its core, and the spiritual successor of the System Shock series, Bioshock is rooted in a strong and established foundation. But it isn’t just any other FPS game that will be mildly fun and then quickly forgotten. It is so much more than that. The fantastic gameworld design, the gripping atmosphere, the mysterious narrative, the idiosyncratic characters, and the uniquely identifying combat system all contribute to propelling this game into the elite caste. It is a legendary masterwork of gaming culture, and I posit: anyone who has yet to experience it would be wise to change that.With the high quality of all of the aspects of the game, it is difficult to name one as the “best.” But I would have to argue the most defining and inspired aspect is the wondrous and mystical gameworld atmosphere. The captivating atmosphere will grab hold of you from the opening scene and not let go until the ending credits. The world of Rapture is an absolute pleasure to explore and the ominous, dystopian ambiance is splendidly engaging. And it isn’t just the obvious things, but also the little subtleties and minute details that really elevate the gameworld atmosphere to elite status. The attention to detail is outstanding. Bioshock has an undeniably “A+” presentation.The narrative elements of the game are also exquisite. There is a main storyline that unfolds as you play and there is also a clouded history of lore that slowly becomes clear as you progress the game and discover the collectibles (which provide backstory). This multidirectional storytelling will keep you curious to learn more at all times, adroitly holding your interest as you make your way through the campaign. Moreover, the well-designed character development leads to interesting and idiosyncratic NPCs that are infinitely more intriguing than the usual forgettable clichés. It all amounts to an overall experience that will keep you engaged and entertained.As for the actual gameplay and combat, it is quite unique and variable. Nevertheless, I will admit that it isn’t necessarily the most riveting combat system around. But, as you are part gunslinger and part spellcaster, you can wreak havoc on your foes in a wide variety of ways. That, and the ability to purchase upgrades for your gear and abilities will keep the combat fresh and interesting throughout a playthrough.  Aside from that, there are also many collectibles to search for, there is loot hidden all over, and there are hundreds of interesting little things to look at. There is a lot going on.The last thing I’ll specifically mention regarding Bioshock is that I believe a large reason as to why it is so well received in the gaming community is because of all of the little things that were done right in allowing the player to decide how he/she wants to play the game. For instance, there is a great autosave/checkpoint system that won’t screw you over if you mess up and there is also an option for unlimited respawns (if you choose to use it). On top of that, you are free to manually save whenever you want. Or you can turn off respawns and never manually save if that’s your preference. Also, there is a large amount of lore, backstory, and narrative elements, but there isn’t hours of forced dialogue or unskippable cutscenes. You are mostly free to choose how much you want to learn or how much you want to plow through the game. This fundamentally open design allows for a wide audience to easily enjoy the game. Bioshock is a great game. If you haven’t checked it out yet, you would be wise to make time. It will definitely appeal to most gamers, especially fans of FPS games, RPGs, and strong narrative elements.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

												Would you kindly read this review and buy this game? If you didn't know, BioShock is claimed to be one of the most revolutionary FPS's games of all time, and that statement has plently of truth to it. It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.In terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen, 


Bioshock Crash, Resolution, Change Language, No Sound and FOV fix 
A Guide for BioShock
By: Andr

			I made this simple guide for anyone who can't get their game to work on a Windows 7 and Windows 8 OS, which the game crashes on startup. You can find most of the common fixes and tweaks here.		


and the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game. Voice acting is perfect without a doubt, and characters such as Ryan Andrew and Sander Cohen will leave a lasting impression long after you finish the game. Sound design is extremly well-done as well: the whale-like moans from the hulking Big Daddies are very creepy, and the game only uses music for atmospheric reasons, 


Would you Kindly?

adding an extra layer of immersion that makes the game quite creepy, but never outright scary (which is not what the game is trying to do).The story is the main highlight of BioShock, and presents themes and ideologies that are very applicable to reality, mainly the view of objectivism. Plot twists and unforgetable characters will make the experience a memorable ones, and each audio-diary will flesh out the world of Rapture, especially in events following up to the game. As for the main protagonist Jack, he's the typical silent playable character that every shooter seems to have, but his background information makes him quite interesting. Despite this, the story is damned near perfect, even if it feels ever-so rushed after the games huge revelation and twist.BioShock is a prime example of how video games are art, and is one you should not overlook. Even where it missteps in gameplay, it's story and presentation are grand throughout, and provide a unique experience you will not forget and will come back to again and again.

-Quick Review-BioShock is a FPS that was released in 2007, the story is very interesting, the game play is quite enjoyable, as you progress through the game you get different abilities, power ups, and new weapons that can also be powered up. All in all, this is a classic FPS to many gamers out there. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Welcome to Rapture, a city devoid of morals and government. A city where the inventor can invent, where a scientist can do science without the government questioning ethics. Oh and one more thing about Rapture... It's at the bottom of the Sea.As far as the story goes, you've just stumbled across rapture and now you need to try to get out of here alive, one problem Ryan {the founder of Rapture} is out to kill you. You will be helped along by a man named ""Atlas"" to navigate the various things you need to do to survive in Rapture.As you progress you will meet several people who will either try to help you along your way, or kill you, or both. The game is very streamlined, as long as you check the map it is quite difficult to get lost in this game.Game Play: The first FPS ""Story"" game that I played was Half Life 2, so when you start out a game with nothing but a Melee weapon, and then eventually pick up more weapons as the game progresses, I can't help but have flash backs to the good days of Half Life 2. I'm sure there's a name for that type of game mechanic development, but I will simply call it ""the half life progression"".You start out with a pipe wrench, which I proceeded to hit everything with... Dead bodies, light switches, little sisters, pretty much anyone who wasn't a ""big daddy"" (Because big daddy's would knock me into tomorrow if I wasn't fighting my hardest). Sorry, I digress; I love that wrench. The first few weapons you get are: Wrench, Pistol, Shotgun. You get about 8 different weapons but I won't spoil the rest for you, they're fun, trust me.You also get special abilities that require ""the blue stuff"" as I've so quaintly called it. What I want to call ""Mana"", ""Force skills"", and more names of blue energy meters is actually known as ""Plasmid"", which can only be restored by stabbing yourself in the arm with EVE syringes. You collect several abilities that use this energy source, the basic ones being: Shock, Fire, Telekinesis (Force pull *cough* ).There is one more thing to note about game play: Hacking. To hack you play a simple mini game that you need to complete circuits on. Before you try to hack you're warned how difficulty the hack will be and then you need to navigate a slow moving flow through a maze to complete a circuit, I found most of these to be very easy. Which made this part of the game slightly forgettable, but it does give you a break from the hoards of splicers trying to slice off your face. Achievements: At the time that I'm writing this, there are no achievements for this game, but sometime I would expect there to be a release updating and providing the Xbox achievements to steam users. (Date written: 10/23/14) Price: BioShock's standard price is $19.99. As I always say, I recommend buying the game on a sale, or from a humble bundle. So far I've played roughly 15 hours of the game, on normal difficulty. So this isn't one of those games where you're going to spend a large amount of time playing it. And since there aren't achievements I won't be pumping in extra time. Conclusion: Story: memorable. Game play: Logical. Achievements: Nonexistent. Price: Affordable. For everything else there's MasterCard. ...I wanted to end it that way, but I'll elaborate a tiny bit more as to what kind of person would enjoy Bioshock; most FPS players would enjoy this game, and probably find it quite easy to play. This game has high intensity, it's nowhere near ""horror"" quality, but the game keeps you tense for what's about to happen to you next.I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a bit of a different chance of pace for their typical First Person Shooter games, BioShock definitely sets itself apart from the rest; which is probably why it's such a favorite to many.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 10, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for Bioshock 2Here's the URL to see my review for Bioshock Infinite ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Bioshock is one of the most expertly made games I have ever played. The game takes place in a ciy called Rapture, a city under the sea created by Andre Ryan to be a utopia, where people's dreams would not be limited by things such as government or morality. You play as Jack, a man in a plane crash that landed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, who finds a Lighthouse that leads to Rapture, now ruined and destroyed due to a war created by Atlas, a man who leads a rebellion group against Andrew Ryan, and wants to help you survive as you fight Splicers (genetic mutants created by splicing up on something called ADAM; a substance found at the bottom of the ocean that can be used for a variety of purpose. Medical, entertainment, or even getting powers called Plasmids) and Big Daddies, protecters of the Little Sisters, who hold sea slugs in their stomachs that produce loads of ADAM.The gameplay is fantastic. Bioshock is a FPS with RPG and Survival Horror elements. You can geta total of 6 different guns throughout the game, each of which are good for certain situations. You can also upgrade these guns to make them stronger and better over the course of the game. You can also collect different types of ammo for each gun, usually there's a normal type, a type good for armored foes, and a type good for fleshy foes. Then of course, there's ADAM. ADAM is obtained after killing a Big Daddy, then by making a decision on whether or not to let their Little Sister to live. If they live, you get some ADAM, but for every 3 you rescue, you get rewards. Or, you can harvest them and get a huge amount of ADAM, but no rewards. ADAM can be spent on Plasmids and Tonics. Plasmids are you're alternative to guns, basically giving you special powers over the course of the game. Tonics give you're character direct upgrades, of which have varying degrees of usefulness. The gameplay has so many layaers of depth and strategy, and is still realy good in high-strung intense action moments. And it's just plain fun to shoot bees at a splicer, then set them on fire, and when they jump into water to get rid of the fire, you can eletrocute them and finish them off.Even if the gameplay wasn't good, the story alone is worth the buy. I won't spoil it, nor will I reiterate what I already wrote, but know that the story of Bioshock is not only one of the best, most though-provoking stories there is, but the best part about it is that it could only work as a video game, nothing else, as the story brings up the idea of whether or not the player's choices have an impact, and whether or not the player actually had a choice throughout the whole game. It helps that all the characters in the game are very complex and believable. I could write an entire essay about how amazing the story is, but I won't because I don't feel like wasting you're time. Now, would you kindly buy this freaking game already?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock I don't even know where to begin the good, the bad, the scary, the funny the impressiveness, the uninspiring.  This game has to be one of the best story’s I have ever played.  I went in not liking the game not wanting to play the game.  And even though it did take me about a month or two of casual gaming to achieve the ending because I did not want to play it.  The game play and story won me over.  This has to be one of the scariest, 80's hack and slash style movie, rolled into a first person shooter.  Now if you have read my other reviews you know I'm not a huge fan FPS's (first person shooters).  I do like to play video games so I play them and above all else I love video games with a fantastic story and this has one.  Bioshock is like the Twilight Zone meets Alfred Hitchcock and they had a baby.  Now I think it took me so long to get into the game because it starts off slow and you are leveling your character getting new ability’s, weapons, and getting the crap scared out of you by the slicers and the enviroment.  It takes you awhile to start to understand this game its set in the 1950's in an underwater city called Rapture.  If you are going to play it the biggest element to the game are the audio diaries.  They give you an inside look into the minds of the citizens of Rapture and explain how the city has evolved into its current state of commotion.  There are some essential lines in the game and one of the best is at the very begin as you ascend to the majestic city.   “I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture...”     This honestly does set the tone for the rest of game.  Now if you are going to play this game beware there are three different endings.  Make up your mind at the begin which way to go kill, save, or do both on the little sisters those three options determine your ending.  The game is 14-20 hours long depending on your play level and style.   Now I can't stress the audio diaries enough they are essential for you to get the whole story out of this phenomenal game.  Just when you think you are like this is it this is the ending nope hold on to your hat.  I think that was a decisive turning occurrence for me to start apprenticing this game and seeing why it has a 96 meta critic score.   Now the downside the game crashed on me a few different times. (Windows 7 user)  So just save often.  The story little slow at first but it picks up.  Wallet has a cap.  Hacking certain machines not set up to well I thought. Bots not the brightest.  Now the last couple I'm nitpicking because honestly this game doesn't have a lot of flaws in my opinion other then being a first person shooter :)  Get it love and play it again and again.

												As a spiritual successor to the greatest game that has ever been made and very underrated which is System Shock, I have to say I really enjoyed the game so far...Now into the review! When it comes to the plot here's how it goes. It takes place in year 1960, while travelling in a plane ya had a accident which ya survived in a middle of the sea, yet with a hope ya stumbled a small building with a golden statue at the top with a weird machine inside. After turning it on ya went down to the city build under the sea called Rapture, which fell due to the one man called Andrew Ryan, the owner of this city corrupted by the power created from the strange liquid called ADAM, which was never seen in the surface. Almost all of the people were addicted to it and started killing each other. While giving up hope, one man called Atlas who is against Ryan asks for your help to stop the madness.When it comes to the graphics I must say it still holds up to this day and looks great, though like with Unreal Engine 3 ya might expect a quality change that always happens when ya loaded a game but then changes back to normal. Basically any PC ya own in and after 2007 will run it.Now the gameplay...The most important aspect in every game. It is amazing! While the ammo and weapons may be scarce you also have another arsenal at you disposal....PLASMIDS! At the cost of EVE you can use them to either shoot lightning which can open locked areas, create a fire to melt the blocking ice or even use the telekinesis to stop an incoming rocket flying to your face and redirect it back to the enemy! There are also other Plasmids that does not require EVE and affects your status in combat or other situations. Almost every weapon can use other types of ammunition ranging from armor piercing to the incinerating ones and ya may find Weapon Upgrade stations which you can choose only one upgrade for each weapon so choose wisely! If you are low on something but have some money you can use shopping ventsto buy stuff but if you think you don't have enough money then you can always hack them! Hacking lets you turn any turret to turn against the enemies, lower the price for shops or change the healing station to hurt anyone except you and you do that by doing a minigame which requires you to place pipes in any order to let the cyan goo reach the end without leaking it or get to the damaged ones. Be aware that the more you progress in the game it gets more harder.If you think that you do not understand the plot in overall then you might have missed a lot of Audio Logs. From the Audio Logs you can find more about what was the life in the city and/or even dig more about the owner and his situation.If you liked Fallout's old styled music then you can find em here as well while sharing the newer ones and pretty much fits the game so perfectly. The sounds are also great and the voice acting is quite great.Overall, if you think about getting the game then....Would you kindly buy and play it? It is worth 20 Euro for it!			",166,11,4,7,5,2,7

It wasn't impossible to build Rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.— Andrew RyanBioshock pleasantly surprises with an original style and entourage, idea, excellent level design and beautiful interiors. Graphics and quality of the painters work deserve a special praise. Beautiful visual effects of water and mist, ironic retro-standard agitprop-like wall posters — it's a really great job. All of this stuff was flavored by tasty 'Art Deco sauce' and sweet-tempered soundtrack in the best tradition of the 'golden age' of Chicago jazz.Literally gentle game interface quickly brings up to date. Audio diaries found along the way (which are the main narrative device of the game) complete the plot with important elements and softly introduce players to the basics of the philosophy of Objectivism. A true masterpiece.10/10			",137,25,7,26,15,1,29

												A truly fantastic FPS.  The Narrative, told though voice-logs and a 1-way radio, does a great job in maintaining a good distance for the player; A perfect balance is struck between isolation (being forced to fight off hordes of splicers alone) and companionship (hearing a friendly voice motivate you forward.)  As for the gameplay, barring a few personal gripes (there shouldn't ever be a hack that is 100% impossible, solely due to bad RNG), there are very few things to dislike.  The wide selection of plasmids and firearms allows for numerous playstyles and adds a bit of replay value.  I'd personally enjoy it if you could limit your armory to just the weapons you use regularly (too many times did I over-scroll to the chemical thrower when just trying to take a simple picture), but this is in no way a deal-breaker.  Whether you heard about it back in the day and are just getting around to the classics, or recently played Bioshock Infinite and wanted to know what happened, this game is without a doubt worth a play, even if it may appear a bit visually dated.

 The underwater game flowing with of gameplay This is without any doubt one of the better games I have played. For me it has a lot of the aspects i like in a game. It uses a simple fighting mechanic to play and it isnt that hard to get used to. Pros:  It has a creepy/ horror scene. It gives the oppertunity to explore bit by bit. Doesn't use cheap jumpscares to creep you out. Has a really good storyline. If you die, you can get right back from where you died. Has multiple endings. Cons:  If you're into graphics, this is an older game. Can be dark sometimes.

												*Disregard my steam playtime, I played this on the GFWL version almost 7 years ago for dozens of hours. lol*Bioshock is a critique of individualism and atheistic values of society and Ayn Rand's extremely intelligent works, a videogame trope mockery , a art-deco style level desing mixed with 50's-60's aestetic and music with strong FPS mechanics focused on variety and player customization with some slight horror and survival elements.And despite years of age, it manages to be one of the most strong narrative driven FPS that you could spend a penny on.This was the first videogame that truly stuck with me, this brilliant work influenced greatly in the game enthusiast I love being to this day.Nostalgia alone makes this one of my personal favorites, remove that and I'd still say its one of the best games on Steam. A modern classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion this is the best Bioshock game in the entire series. It almost felt like a survial horror. The setting story is one of the best I've ever seen in a video game, It's like a game and a movie combined but it's not too cinematic. The enemy designs are what makes this game so good. The Big Daddies are fun mini bosses to fight and also challenging on higher difficulties and the splicers are crazy as hell. The first few mins of this game creeped me out when I was younger. This is by far the most scariest Bioshock game in the series. Gotta love the bunnymasks the splicers are wearing. I would say fighting Sander Cohen was my favorite part of this game. Just killing Splicers while Waltz of the Flowers is playing just feels so... you cant get that in any other video game! It's so memorable! Final verdict is that this game is one of the best fps ever and the campaign is Halo 1 status good. Gotta love using tommy guns and electric buck shotguns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an entirely new universe you are going to discover and probably the best story telling ever made.Bioshock tells the origins of Rapture created by the Ryan Industries, and ravaged by the ADAM, a liquid that changes people into monsters.Overall, the game is quite repetitive, you only have to help Tenenbaum to save the Little Sisters but the story is really amazing and will get you into it until the end.If you have already played Bioshock 2 and want to know more about the story, take this one !

												This masterpiece is a lesson that should be taught to every game developer involved in the FPS genre. I could save a few compliments and shorten this rather passionate, but humble, homage. But no. When talking about BioShock, one should let the words flow, just like the essence of its beautiful concept flows richly and vividly through every character's line, every thematic poster hanging on a random wall, every bit of Art Deco reconstruction, and every trace of Andrew Ryan's infamous personality.When I first played this game, back in 2009, I couldn't believe my eyes. The compelling and psychologically deep story that I was witnessing should be in a book or something ""narratively more complex"". Back then, with all my ignorance and prejudice towards the potential of videogame storytelling, I hadn't realised what sin I was carrying on my mind. The way I've come to think is: BioShock should've always been what it is: a story-driven, linear first-person shooter that touches the deepest veins of your perceptions on notions of compassion, violence, regret, love, and themes such as mindless obedience, civil disorder, despotic leadership, dystopian lunacy, transhuman monstrosity, and other rather shocking motifs that this game courageously explores. Images of fear and perdition that make us cringe, but also touching scenes of sacrifice and loyalty. Troubled and oftentimes scary characters are all over the place (including the player-character). It's as though journeying deep into the sea brings a progressive loss of sanity and grasp on common sense in virtually all the individuals involved. Coming back to the surface would be their only redemption (cleansing), not only salvation (rescue).On top of that, there is the addictive gameplay, with the clever and concise variety of weapons that respond directly to specific situations and areas, enemies and game frenzy. The plasmid feature dialogues with the game's spiritual ancestor, System Shock, as do most of the dystopian themes here represented. The enemies and their classes also adapt excellently to the progression in the game, making the contention *difficulty vis-à-vis enjoyment* close to perfection.The emblematic setting, and a unique steampunk atmosphere in the depths of the ocean. It's an eschatological drama in videogame form. The oneiric visions of mankind crushed by its own mental abyss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is top-notch, the atmosphere is incredible, the music, the gameplay - I can't praise them enough. This is something to be experienced first-hand, a page-turner novel in the shape of a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally played this years ago on Xbox 360 before I'd been exposed to PC gaming. In those days EB Games was oblivious to how exploitable their return policy was. I'd bought Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, took it home and finished it in two hours. Returned it half hour before the store closed and made a quick uninformed decision on a random game called BioShock. I'd not really heard anything about it and judging by the back cover it seemed like somewhat a first-person horror game.And over the next 12 eye bleeding hours that ensued, my fragile fourteen year old mind was exposed to themes of Objectivism, altruism, communism, horrific violence at the hands of little girls, superb voice acting and world building that rivals anything you've ever seen or read.9 or 8 years later, the Remastered editions are released. They are absolute trash. They crash constantly, the audio is messed up, can't change keybindings and aesthetically they're not all that much better. Do not waste your time with the remasters.The original still looks good. Some .ini file tinkering before making it playable again but I finished it again in two play sessions largely uninterrupted. Everything narratively holds up. Andrew Ryan, Atlas and Tene are voice acted so brilliantly. The game has hardly any cut scenes, which I wish was a trend BioShock set. Lacking cut scenes may seem like a inconsequential point of praise but having the story build and play out directly as you play, creates an immersion factor hardly achieved by video games period. The themes posited by Ken Levine are almost still as profound as the first time I played it. Even knowing how the story plays out, I found myself evaluating every side to the conflicts and finding common ground with even the worst characters. Not that I find myself affectionate toward Ayn Rand and her philosphy but it's thematically something hardly explored in media at all, let alone a video game.Mechanically and gameplay wise everything is still serviceable. I will say the gunplay lacks any impact and I feel like some weapons, especially the machine gun are hardly useful before acquiring upgrades. Largely many of the plasmids i found either uninteresting or not really useful. Telekiness seems to work combat wise for a scripted event but outside of that it's not worth much more than to access items outside your reach. Swarm seems completely usless as many enemies seem to continue on unaffected. And many others I found uninteresting or not at all worth swapping out the shock plasmid for.In terms of the tonics, they seem to provide much more variety and possible ways of playing. Although why you wouldn't go every tonic that makes hacking easier is beyond me. Hacking has no right to be a god damn newspaper puzzle. I guess it's cool they made it more engaging than the typical RPG hacking or lock picking but for gods sake, it can be laborous. Thankfully acquiring auto-hack tools seems to quite easy to come by but the few hacks I had to do manually, I can't imagine doing all of them that way.In terms of minor grips, having you edit .ini files to remedy mouse acceleration and also the fact the game crashes when some key bindings have been changed? This is surely something could be easily fixed with a patch and yet these are problems that persist into the Remasters (making them even more undesirable). The crosshairs and big gold objective marker make the UI ugly and if I'm correct I believe you can at least turn off the objective marker.A major gripe, there's an escort section at the end of the game. An escort section on it's own is bad enough. I wish the industry would do away with them but the fact the AI I was escorting became bugged out and would not move on despite me achieving the objectives. I had to let her die and restart. I remember this happening other times played BioShock years ago, having googled the problem it seems to be a random issue that doesn't affect everyone - just my luck, I guess. A man chooses. A slave obeys.And when it comes down to buying and playing this game, it's not even a choice at all. Play BioShock, right now. Would you kindly?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock is a great classic.Even now, the game can still be considered a good game; it was ahead of its time (technological issues set aside).The setting is probably what made Bioshock what it is now... 2K did REALLY well on that, putting an FPS game in a scary atmosphere. The world feels scary, even being as powerful as you are.But really, Bioshock really is a unique game. It provides an experience like no any other. The story is great and the gameplay still holds up pretty well for a game made in 2007.Sure, there are some issues but that is expected with a game this old. Controls might take some time to get used to; after a while, the game plays just fine.BioShock is one of those games that you just HAVE to have played in your life, above other games.

												I had played Bioshock about a year after it had released initially, but stopped about half-way through.  A few years ago I restarted the game with the intent of finishing it, but managed to get about 2/3rds in before dropping out again.  I finally replayed this game in the year of our lord 2015, and for once finished it.  Let me get this out of the way up top: The game is 100% worth playing (or even replaying).Good Stuff:-The setting is super original: an underwater laissez faire utopia filled with the best and brightest, ripped apart by civil war due in part to the discovery of a gene altering substance.-Combat is pretty good.  Tons of guns (that you can carry all at once!) and a variety of magic powers called ""Plasmids"" that vary from shooting fireballs to hacking turrets.-Passive buffs via tonics that you purchase/find and equip allow you to personalize your playstyle somewhat.-Varried enemy design, with thoughts taken into enemy placement in the level itself to provide interesting fights.-Great level design, from the layout to the art design.  Levels are open with multiple branches off the main 'hub' of each level that are typically explored throughout the level via progression towards your goal.  Although there is some backtracking, enemies are usually placed in a way that makes fights fun and interesting.-Water and particle effects are still pretty good.-Audio design is great, from the sounds of water puddling in hallways to the ambient effects your plasmids make when you equip them.  All the work goes into create a stellar atmosphere that lets you buy into the world.Bad Stuff:-The first 2/3rds of the game are a bit predictable in terms of how the game delays your progress narratively. -The last act of the game is a bit more linear than the first 2/3rds, and the final fight really stinks.-Some people think the audio journals are an overused trope, but I personally liked them for how they build the backstory.-Switching between your gun and plasmid is annoying at first, but you'll get used to it with practice.-The hacking minigame got boring for me about 1/3rd through the game, but some people might like it.-Most of the textures have this shiny look to them that makes them look like plastic.Ugly Stuff:-Be prepaired to work a bit to get this game running smoothly. I had a ton of crashes before turning off the steam-overlay and forcing the game to run in DX9 before it ran smoothly.  There are a ton of steam guides to help you fix that stuff up though.-Audio can hitch and cut-out during combat when too many sounds are playing at once.  I couldn't figure out how to fix this one, but luckily no dialogue is cut out.-Physics calculations in the game are played at 30 fps, making them stand out a bit on modern machines.-Options menu is a bit dated and you'll have to do some INI editing to adjust things like FOV and proper sensitivity. Verdict:Bioshock is still worth revisiting, if just for the story and gameplay alone.  It's a decently sized game and took me around 12 hours to beat, with the only downsides being that the final act is a bit lackluster and that the game looks dated and might take some playing around to get it to run without crashing.  But you're rewarded with a good shooter with a fantastic story and world that makes you interested to find out more every step of the way.Tip: You probably want to up the difficulty, the mid game and onwards is pretty trivial on medium difficulty.

												It is a very good game, with very good graphics and an amazing story. It is a game, which we all gamers dream of: Gameplay and graphics are both amazing.+For a game that was made 8 years ago, the graphics are amazing.+The story is very interesting and never gets boring. You always want to keep playing to learn what's going on.+There are different types of weapons, which you can upgrade at special stations. You can only find them if you search enough.+There is a variety of upgrades, which we can apply to our body and help us in different situations.+Your choices in the game effects the end, which is amazingly satistyfing.+The story, have I mentioned the story?-In Germany the game is only sold in German low violence version. I don't know, if there was something important that was cut off or only the gore was reduced but I would like to play the normal version.-There are sometimes desynchronisations in the subtitles.That is all I have to say. I recommend the game with all my heart. It is a game, which every gamer should have played. Buy it, Buy it, NOW!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock is often lauded as one of the pinnacles of FPS/RPGs as well as one of the finest video-game narratives. Although the game is essentially a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, the consensus from journalists and consumers alike is that it's a classic.However, with all that being said, it's interesting how both its narrative and gameplay has not aged as well after a decade, and how fans probably have misremembered its flaws. Don't misunderstand this as some hipster review; BS is a good game. Rapture is one of the most well-polished atmospheres ever made, the level design is very good in spite of its linearity, and its core gameplay is tolerable at best.The problem is none of these qualities elevates the game into greatness nor to ignore its many flaws. Even worse, these problems that plague the first game are only dwelled upon in later games when they originated here.Audio, FOV and Other PC Port IssuesBefore we talk about the game, I do want to mention the PC version. This port is rather terrible; however, it can be fixed. Mostly. 


Harvesting 
A Screenshot of BioShock
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




What I don't think can be fixed is any nausea you may feel if you turn up the mouse-sensitivity. I don't know whether it's the art-style, the FOV (I doubt it as I play the game with 90) or some mouse acceleration but I cannot play at anything higher than four (out of ten.) Unfortunately, while some of these issuesed are addressed, the Remastered does not fix everything: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/409710""Smile for the Camera!""BioShock suffers from two major faults: It lacks the dual-wielding system where you have Plasmids in one-hand and your gun in the other. The other mistake is the unnecessary fluff that takes away from the survival horror experience.The former can be excused for being the first in the series; however, the latter is something that cannot be easily overlooked, namely the crafting system and camera ""research"" system. Both of these inclusions are utterly worthless except when you get less ammo and tougher enemies.However, if you use the camera ASAP you can play two-thirds of the game without it. A better idea would be to throw away the camera and opted for better resource management and fixed enemy damage values. The game would be a better FPS for it, and it would be more honest.Jack of All TradesAlthough this question is more often one of semantics, I think it'll illustrate a point: In what way is BS an RPG other than streamlining the RPG-mechanics from its predecessor? SS2 focused on specializing builds around weapon types, PSI-onic abilities and/or attributes in other skills. You had the ability to shape your character from the introduction, and throughout the game you could change it to suit your playstyle.BS strips all the complexities away with its plasmids and gene-modifications. You will get all the weapons every single playthrough, and the gene-mods are in specialized categories that discourage any freeform experimentation. You're a Jack of all trades; master of all, specialist of none. The system itself is not bad but it is a clear sign of streamlining. With that being said, is BS's system truly an RPG or is it something more along the lines of the Far Cry's perks system? Content is still gated by placing plasmids and mods in specific locations, but the same result is the same stilted growth of your capabilities. It's one of many instances where I have to wonder how influential BS has been on modern games (for better and for worse).The More Things Stay the Same... The More Is ForgottenBS's role in influencing games is undeniable, but what is more interesting is what has been forgotten as to why these aspects are so enrapturing. For starters, the usage of audio-logs. Recorded messages are now the butt-of-the-joke, but their inclusion here was to keep the horror elements without littering NPCs or to bore the player from the lack of interactions. More importantly, they told the player of what cannot be gleamed from the environments as they provide a contrast to what the player finds. They provided something for your imagination to use.Another aspect that holds up is its environmental storytelling. For example, if you were to compare this game to Fallout 3/NV the biggest difference is how BioShock conveys more with less clutter. The developers were able to focus more so on the visual input, and let the finer details (visual or the audio) fill in the rest. And without the simple distractions like a constant UI notification for junk, the player focuses more on the surroundings. Now are these aspects perfect? God no. BS (and SS) is the originator of the trope of hiding key-codes and/or recording information at the worst times like a Lovecraft protagonist. And compared to F3/NV, BS has tighter and more sensible level-design that lends itself to having the time to add more details. However, it's the purpose and execution behind these storytelling methods that I think is forgotten about why they work so well, and when you dwell further on what the game set out to do you find more of its flaws more obvious now than back then.Would You Kindly Listen? (Spoilers)In spite of wanting to keep spoilers to a minimum, I do want to criticize the narrative because that is what everyone remembers BS most fondly of. No matter how many times I replay this game I can't tell you what the game is really about. BS tries its damnedest to provide an objective, apolitical story about a free-market city freed from conventions of morals and politics. The only problem is that it never commits to the idea of, ""Unrestrained societies are possibly bad!"", and instead gets jumbled up in its ""family"" nonsense and blatantly good/evil choice which comes across as being pretentious. (Sound familiar?)It could be argued that Andrew Ryan was right all along—the city fell to parasites like Fontaine—and he was the more upstanding character as he valued merits alone. However, in contrast, the characters like Dr. Steinman and Cohen show that merit is not satisfying enough. Usually I'd be fine with this vagueness of a message, but with the forced good/bad-ending to the game it hampers any middle-ground to be found.It also doesn't help that gameplay can clash with the narrative. For example, why can you leave money on security devices to ""hack"" machines? (How does that work?) Why does Andrew Ryan let his enemies buy bullets to fight him? Is he that committed to his free-market values?  Or, for less pedantic questions, why is the WYK effect on Jack inconsistent? He doesn't appear to remember being ""activated"" (if he didn't forget it after the plane-crash), and he doesn't respond to the command the same way (ex. when you are told to get the radio and when you are forced to lower your weapon). If it was a simple mental suggestion, then why (when he obviously knows) does he not react with speaking like how he talks at the beginning? (Why is he mute anyway?)The obvious answer to these questions is that the developers were too busy making a good game, and that's perfectly fine. BioShock is a great game for what it tried to do, but it's by no means a masterpiece of storytelling or gameplay.Is a Man Not Entitled To His Opinion?I'm under no dellusion that the remaster will address all these narrative issues. I expect the gunplay to be better and for a better performance like Infinite. What I wanted to share is when you return to Rapture to relive the glory days under the sea it won't be same as what you remembered. Games have come a long way from BioShock in both gameplay and narrative, and the only way we get better is to learn where the mistakes were made behind us.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome to RaptureBioShock is one of those games that any self-proclaimed gamer needs to have in their inventory. Yes, it is dated at this point, but man is it still a fantastic game. If you can't handle the older graphics, don't fret, BioShock Remastered just came out.Positive:- Extremely atmospheric - you will be sitting on the edge of your seat for the majority of the game- Fantastic original story - I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't played BioShock yet, but it is truly amazing.- Do things YOUR way. Want to go in shooting? Fire away. Want to be stealthy? Sneak away. Want to hack things? No problemo. There are so many ways to handle each situation.- Exploring is rewarding. More ammo, health packs, crafting items, you name it. Also find audio diaries to get diverse insights into Raputure's history.- Difficulty is just right. Yes you will get stronger as you progress, but you will be punished if you make poor choices.- I still want to play this although I have finished it 3 times.Negative:- Graphically the game looks a little old- It is a shame that you cannot equip a plasmid and weapon at the same time - either one or the other (this was fixed in BioShock 2)- The hacking system is laborious and dull (but still worth doing)- If you're easily frightened you will need some clean underwear on the sideConclusion:There really is no reason for you not to give BioShock a try, especially now that a remastered version is out. I guarantee you will not regret playing it. Like Portal, BioShock is an extremely rewarding and fulfilling experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Bioshock is interactive art in every sense of the word. From its breathtaking art deco scenery to it's disturbing, deep story, Bioshock succeeds where countless others have failed. It transcends gaming, crafting an ethereal existence on another plane. Part shooter, part horror, part social commentary, all masterpiece.Games like this come around only so many times a year, they need to be experienced by everyone, be it on the Xbox 360 or the PC. A game that is for all intents and purposes, perfect, is a remarkable achievement. Bioshock will take you on an underwater thrill ride that will leave you breathless, shaking and satisfied in a curious, perhaps even morbid way. It forces you to really think about the events and people, even long after you've beaten the game. And any game capable of such a feat is a must-buy in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock, an amazing FPS game that isn't Call of Duty.This game is amazing. I played it on the PS3 back ages ago, when my Mom let me play M rated games. When I played Bioshock, with the bundle of Bioshock 2, I loved every single bit of the game.Bioshock really gives you the chills, and makes you think. The gameplay is a bit outdated, but for a classic, it's not an issue, and still fun.I can't recommend this enough!Edit 1: I beaten the game. I forgotten how easy the final boss is, and how short the game is. But after all, it's mostly the best FPS out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good first person shooter, kind of a classic already. Really original setting, and engaging atmosphere.I enjoyed playing it on Hard without using any Vita-Chambers, and even if I find the combat not satisfying enough at times, it deserves the ""thinker's fps"" definition, thanks to all the ways it offers to deal with your enemies.One really good thing about this game is that it continues to add new mechanics regularly as you go on, preventing it from becoming boring.Everyone should play this.

												A brilliant game accurately summed up as ""Atlas Shrugged, underwater"". However, there is far more to it than that. This game doesn't just portray a character with Ayn Rand's philosophy, but also comments on that philosophy and takes it to its logical conclusion, as a society based upon ethical egoism, or basically selfishness, is ultimately self-destructive and cannot survive.The shooting is fun, the plasmids are great, the setting and graphics are simply gorgeous, and the plot is nothing short of unforgettable. I'm only sorry that I'd had the big reveal spoiled for me before I could play this marvellous game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is, without a doubt, one of my favorites. Here, have a list of pros and cons that you are probably gonna skip over. Pros -Good graphics-Fun gameplay -Immersive and spooky atmosphere-Unique combat system (Actually, I know nothing about the combat system since I went through about 3/4 of the game killing everything with a wrench)-You can finally kill drug addicts with wrenches without consequence-Unique enemies, which have their own strengths and weaknesses (None of which I knew. Except that all would die to my wrench)-Fun weapons (like the wrench)-Superpowers (Again, I didn't touch those. The wrench was good enough for me)-Can either brutally murder or gently caress small children (girls) for drugs- The final boss looks like the Missing Link from Monsters vs Aliens  Cons -Can only play 3/4 of the game using the wrench before actual strategy and skill is needed-The only thing the wrench couldn't help with was hacking, which ripped you from the heat of the moment so you could help get the Mountain Dew Voltage from point A to point B-Ghosts-Went to a strip club and there was only one stripper, and she was dead on a bed in the back room-The girls you can caress are protected by large reverse astronauts that can and will drill anyone that tries to get too close-The Big Daddies also don't die to the wrench-Too much waterOverall, this game is easily a  perfect  5/7I would leave a link to my♥♥♥♥♥♥youtube channel so you can see the full review, but I know no one's going to watch it.Now, would you kindly stop reading my review and buy the damn game already?

												Bioshock, Little Sisters and Rapture...You're thinking of these terms when someone mentions the game. It's probably one of the best games I've ever played. You have a story line that can be expanded with tape recorders or you follow the normal one. Much can't be sayed about the story without a spoiler BUT I can say it's suprising and the end is not what you're expecting ;)You can explore REALLY, really big levels with secrets, many enemies and loot. They are beautiful designed and the view out of rapture....Deep in the sea on the ground with fishes swimming about your head and glowing plants. Do I need to say more?The combat system is..well you get used to it but at the beginning it's confusing. They are so many ways to use weapons or Plasmids (magic  abilities) so everyone can probably find an own system to fight against the thousands of splicers and big daddys.The thing I liked very much was that you choose the end.So tell me will it be good or evil XD???PLAY it, BUY IT it's absolutely worth and it's INCREDIBLE, AWESOME and BEAUTIFUL! <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Steampunk-styled, dystopian alternate universe, where you have to unlock the mysteries of a city at the bottom of the ocean. I have to admit, I sort of fell in love with the series after a short time playing the very first Bioshock. I found myself wanting to immerse myself in the story and learn all I could, while trying to survive not only the hidden things lurking around corners, but the scattered people who seem to have gone completely insame. I would recommend not only this game, but the entire Trilogy, as it was fun, exciting, and worth at least a playthough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Would you kindly?It's Bioshock, what else do I need to say? It's crazy, it's smart, it's intense! The story is amazingly detailed and catching. You play as a man named Jack, who lands in the middle of the ocean, next to a lighthouse after a plane crash. Upon entering it, he gets taken into the underwater-city of Rapture, built by the millionaire Andrew Ryan. After the civil war, the city is not under control of sane people or Ryan himself, but ruled by crazy lunatics and geneticly mutated citizens of Rapture. Luckily you are helped by a man named Atlas, who gives you calls to tell you where to go next and what to do.In the game, you have an arsenal of weapons and power at your disposal. From wrenches, over shotguns and crossbows, to syringes filled with fluids that give you the abilities to shoot fire or lightning from your fingertips, use telekenesis and take control of other peoples bodies. (Just be careful with those Big Daddys!) These so called 'Plasmids' are what make Bioshock a unique shooter with an amazing story and characters, that catch you from start to finish.I highly recommend any Bioshock game to everyone who likes non-linear shooters, which are different from the rest.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With genetic modifications, beauty is no longer a goal or even a virtue, it is a moral obligation.Are you repulsed by your own reflection in the mirror? Ladies, are you tired of watching all of the other girls get the fella? Gents, are you sick of seeing the girls swoon for the hunk to your side? Nose too bulbous, lips too thin, brow too prominent? Stop in TODAY to Dr Steinman's Aesthetic Ideals to see what the power of ADAM can do for you.* Stop being the wallflower and become the life of the party.*Individual results may vary. Please verify mental integrity of your surgeon prior to undergoing any surgical procedure. Dr Steinman's Aesthetic Ideals bears no liability for loss of life, limb, appearance, or sanity. Proceed at your own risk.Some games, as with cooking, follow a recipe. The System Shock series prepared a great dish; BioShock took that formula, substituted a few ingredients, and presented a game worthy of being a System Shock successor. BioShock is not only visually appealing, is jam-packed with sweat drenched palms on the pants audio, but also with a great story that unfolds as you frantically meander throughout Rapture. Being violently thrown into the game, you are left with no choice other than to go down the rabbit hole, to enter this submerged version of Wonderland; a place that is as dangerous as it is curious. You are informally greeted by a denizen of Rapture, although they do not appear to be a friendly Welcome Wagon. Much like SS2, you are immediately put on the offensive, and will remain that way for the rest of the game.The inhabitants of Rapture are fighting a guerilla war. They know the terrain, have the weapons, and their leaders will stop at nothing to win. You will pick up weapons and skills along the way that will prepare you for the fight ahead. Being that Rapture is located many leagues under the sea, there will be no fresh supplies, no reinforcements, you'll be lucky to even find a way out of this madhouse. You have to learn to fight fire with fire, in some cases quite literally.Stand by for a Public Service Announcement...""What are you doing, Billy?""""What does it look like Sam? I'm taking Incinerate!""""My mommy told me Splicing is bad for you and that only grown-ups should do it.""""Oh you're such a square! All the cool kids are Splicing. You should try it.""Cut to Sam using Incinerate! Sam begins to seize and falls unconscious. A few seconds later Sam wakes up, looks wildly around, and then looks at Billy in a maniacal manner. Sam then lifts his arm, points a finger at Billy, and we see Billy burst into flames. In the foreground Billy collapses to the floor, writhing and screaming, while in the background Sam is walking away and whistling.""You're right, all the cool kids are doing it!""Remember kids, Splicing is for grown-ups only!Are there any allies here? Is the enemy of my enemy, my friend? Or are they my enemy? Sometimes it is hard to tell them apart. There are several enemy classes here, many of which require specialized ammo or attacks to kill. Life at the bottom of the briny sea and habitual overuse of ADAM has driven some of the more unique characters mad in a way that is both charming as it is horrifying. And some decisions in the game are of a moral nature, almost allowing you to descend into a madness of your own.The levels make full use of limited lighting, which seems only fitting given the nature of a derelict city at the bottom of the ocean. Sometimes you cannot tell if someone is lurking in the shadows or if even the shadows are a true representation of what you think you see. The audio is phenomenal; whether it is voices echoing throughout the corridors, the overhead ""Rapture Reminders"" or the sound of metal on metal as an enemy approaches, dragging something behind them.Other great carryovers from SS2 include:The hacking system. It's not overly complex, but given quick reflexes and a bit of luck, you can find yourself with a nice stash of ammo and money to further your cause. Linear & isolated environment. For the most part, you are free to revisit areas that you've been to before, but some areas remain staunchly inaccessable. Also, since you are at the bottom of the ocean there is nowhere to run to and very few places to hide.Audio logs. This was a time honored tradition in the System Shock series. It really gives you a sense of the impending madness and slow decay of Rapture.Research. It isn't specifically carried out in the same manner, but it gives you a leg up for certain.Upgrades. While the nature of the upgrades is different, it still gave you some control in customizing your character.Protagonists & Antagonists. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Limited inventory. In the case of BioShock, you can carry around Medkits, Eve hypos, ADAM, and ammo, but everything else is use it or lose it.BioShock is a fantastic game, carrying on a proud tradition. It's a SciFi, Fantasy, RPG, FPS, Survival game that fills the void that remained empty for so many years. If you haven't bought BioShock yet, would you kindly get it already? You won't regret it.

This game will force you to evolve into something stronger, something better in order to hopefully survive the worse things this underwater utopia has to offer.

 ""It was not impossible to build Rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else!""  says  Andrew Ryan . He knows what men capable of, after seeing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He believes that world will go into nuclear war and he wanted to build a city away from the clutching hand of the  ""Parasites"" . So, the construction of Rapture began. A city where the artist would not fear the censor. Where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality. Where the great would not be constrained by the small.      A man saw Ryan's utopian society as the perfect opportunity for a long but big-payoff con. Frank Fontaine, he knew what happened with utopias. When this undersea utopia fell apart, he wanted to be there, with a whole society to feast on.    Fontaine raised with the invention of plazmids which are special serums made from processed ADAM which allows genetic mutation , giving the user what some may call “super powers”. Plasmids are powerful, but excessive use of them leads to physical and mental addiction and instability. This was a major factor in the eventual downfall of Rapture society. But ofcourse it wasn’t the only reason, Ryan did lot of mistakes during that time. As he says; “The city... it is collapsing before my... have I become so convinced by my own beliefs that I have stopped seeing the truth? Perhaps”.     And at this point, our game starts. Incredible story specially made for a video game. Amazing voice acting. Combat might get a bit repetetive after some point but not a major issue. Graphics is still acceptable for a game which has been released 9 years ago.     Like Andrew Ryan says; ""A man chooses a slave obeys"". So, would you kindly choose to play this game?

A Crack In Rapture  TL;DR Bioshock is an FPS with one of the greatest stories in video game history. Explore the dark and beautiful submerged environments and find the cities mutated citizens. Uncover the dark history of a once great Utopia ,discover who you are and why you have ended up in Rapture. Using inventive special abilities unlock secrets and blow through areas. Using a large arsenal of weapons blow through all the enemies and traps that have been laid out for youFollow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Fantastic writingBeesGorgeous EnvironmentsGreat lorelarge arsenal of customizable weapons Cons Enemies are sponges to damageGame unnecessarily drags onFinal boss isn’t difficult---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayWith your trusty wrench and pockets filled with guns you have fun shooting waves of enemies and turrets through the levels, well at least for the first few levels, enemies just become damage sponges even after you get the camera and get the max rank for a basic enemy you’ll find that they still take multiple headshots without a worry, it makes sense for the big daddy there the tanky sorta-enemies of each level but the not the ones you fight so many of. Exploring the areas will find you some secret loot so I would recommend looking through each level because it’s nothing but a plus. The special abilities you are given can be quite entertaining and having swarms of bees at your disposal is something that should be feared by many. StoryThe story is a masterpiece and holds the game together no matter who you are or what you think of the gameplay. You are gripped throughout the entire game and having the twist be something that makes you think on what happened throughout the game is so mind blowingly good. You can see the history of the game as you explore the levels and see the destruction that was wrought and the madness that consumed the world. Each type of enemy has their own lore on how they have been mutated in such a way Characters While rarely seeing any characters that aren’t mutated each npcs dark past is slowly revealed throughout the game which makes you pity them more than anything while the little sisters and big daddies are the poster faces they don’t have a whole lot of backstory. The enemies have some interesting dialogue when there not shouting about murdering you. Art/Graphics With an Underwater utopia to explore you will find many beautiful visuals, you feel the cold steel interiors crushing you with pressure while being chased. The remastered version of the game makes the game look so much more modern with its updated textures. The steampunk designs give the look of a 1930s theme. The lighting in the cramped environments give a true idea of a maddened utopia.Bonus Notes The remastered version of the game doesn’t really add much, as the classic game holds up so well.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

Posted: July 12, 2014
												Thanks 40sw4rm for giving me this game!I usually do a playthrough of a game before I rate it. Usually, if I don't it's either because I love the game so much it's necessary for me to review it, or I dislike the game. Because unless they're patient (Which I am not) they have completed a playthrough and then put a negative review down. In this case, I chose the former. You've heard of the game. Gotten many nominations for best game of last generation. Obviously, I wouldn't consider it the best game of last gen (Mass Effect 2 and Skyrim. 'Nuff said) but it's quite amazing. I couldn't resist and had to review this now. I already know what happens next anyway. :/GraphicsThe graphics are impressive for a nearly 7 year old game. They still look beautiful, and when I take screenshots, they look great compared to other games. And because atmosphere is considered part of the ""graphics"" section of my reviews, I have reasons to add on. Bioshock is partially horror, but more of a story rich shooter. I won't talk about gameplay or story yet. The atmosphere is perfect. The whole time I've been playing, I thought, ""Please get me to a nice place, please get me to a nice place..."" and then I realize Splicers and Big Daddies are swarming the whole place. The game has an uncomfortable atmosphere, but it's quite amazing.GameplayThe game is a first person shooter. The style is similar to Valve's source engine games, get a few weapons, use scroll to get them, and you can't aim down the sights. Since I've played 400 hours on TF2, I'm used to the controls. Even if I didn't play TF2, I would've dealt with the controls. You can switch between weapons and plasmids, which are special powers run with EVE. It's used for puzzles on occasion, but mostly it's used to weaken the enemy significantly so you can go in for the final blow. The game so far is relatively balanced, none of the enemies really are intimidating until you encounter the Big Daddy. They're intimidating and will stop at nothing to kill you if you touch it or the Little Sister it protects. They're terrifying and monsterous. They also in a way decide your ending. They're probably the most difficult enemies in the game, excluding the final boss. You make decisions and decide Little Sisters' fates. You can rescue them for a good ending or harvest their ADAM and become stronger. One problem I have with the game, though is that it feels linear and it ruins the game a little bit, because I'd love to explore Rapture some more. Overall, the gameplay is pretty solid, along with some quick puzzles and decisions that affect the end of the game, it does not disappoint.StoryThe story is absolutely amazing, but there's a huge event towards the end of the game. Would you kindly make sure I don't go out of hand with this next short overview of what happens? Your name is Jack. The year is 1960. Your plane crashed near a mysterious lighthouse. When you enter, you discover a machine. When you go in and pull the switch, you realize that you're in an underwater city ruled by ""madman"" Andrew Ryan called Rapture. It was corrupted by ADAM, which is a drug that makes people insane. A man named Atlas helps you and started the catchphrase ""Would you kindly..."" which became one of the biggest quotes in video game history. And let me warn you, once you get to ""it"" (Bioshock fans know what I mean) then your mind will be blown. Bioshock's story is one of the best, darkest, stories that ever appeared in the gaming world.AudioThe audio is probably the first weak point of the game, unfortunately. The voice actors did an average job with their roles, but th music fits in nicely. I would say Andrew Ryan had the best voice. He sounded terrifying, influential, and takes the role of the villain well. Sometimes, however, the voice actors seemed careless or it had the microphone sound, like the person was farther away. Unfortunately, it's not all that great, despite Bioshock being an amazing game.ReplayabilityThe worst part of the game is the replaybility, but it's not really supposed to have strong replayability, seeing how linear Bioshock already is. There's two endings, you could play for both, but usually people just play one time and be done with it. Either way, Bioshock is still an unforgettable game.VerdictIn the end, with some pretty serious flaws like it being linear and the average voice acting.  However, based off of what I've seen so far, BIoshock is one amazing game and one you don't want to miss, horror fan or not. I highly recommend the game and can't wait to beat it. Now, would you kindly buy this game?Graphics- 9/10Gameplay- 9/10Story- 9.5/10Audio- 5.5/10Replayability- 4.5/10.:8.9/10:.+Good gameplay+Amazing story+Outstanding visuals+Interesting weapon combos+Amazing quotes and plot twist+Intense Big Daddy battles-Linear-Average voice acting-Little replayability			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of my very favorite games...Bioshock.This is one of those games that's an experience. The second i started the game i couldn't stop playing it, I marathoned the whole thing till finished and i had played it on the xbox too. Everything i'm saying is my opinion of course, but i truly believe everyone should experience Bioshock at some point and jouney through Rapture and witness this masterpiece, you can't relive the first play through again. So, would you Kindly hear me out?So going into Bioshock my tastes suit this game perfectly, everything about this game is brilliant. I loved everything about it. the very detailed and well written story, the lore, the atmosphere, the city of Rapture itself, the characters, gameplay, and of course the MUSIC!The Score for bioshock is perhaps one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard. It suits the game so much and helps tell the story, it's beautiful, lonely, and haunting, just like the game's atmosphere and story. The sheer tension before a battle where a big daddy and some splicers could be around the corner while a lonley cello or violin solo tugs at your soul just helps complete this masterpiece, it's absolutely breathtaking. Another thing to mention in the subject of music is 40's era music on radios while you explore Rapture, which older music and early jazz i just so happen to love. like this ink spots for example. I think this is a very nice, wonderful touch to, again, capture the atmosphere of this city which is like a character itself. Another addition I love is the song ""Beyond the Sea"" as it occurs in the beginning a very nice touch in deed considering Rapture is underwater. One touch i love is the Fonts! It gives me so much nostalgia because its like the same font used in Batman the Animated series! one of my all time favorite shows. I believe the font is called Plaza, i love it alot it's co classy and has a retro 40's look to it, very nice. I love all of the small details like story telling through items or locations in the game, you don't always need words or dialogue to tell great stories.With the release of the remaster, it seems slightly improved look wise, although i don't know about performance wise i haven't played the remaster enough to see. with the combat Bioshock 2 improved a couple of things in combat like using your weapon and plasmid at the same time was one improvment for example. one thing I always hated was this awful mouse acceleration, it was so annoying, thats one of the only negatives.Depending on your actions you'll get an ending based on what your choices in the game were. NO SPOILERS here, but i will say that I really loved the ending, I usually don't cry that much at the end of games (depending on the game), but the ending made me cry... alot, a happy cry though. This will conclude the review, sorry if it was really long and rambly, but it gets to the point where a game is such a masterpiece, so breathtaking on an emotional level, that i think it's no longer a game... it's a priceless work of Art. Games in General are Art.Thanks for reading my review i Strongly recommend everyone experience this Masterpiece of a game. a true Gem that's unique and different to most shootersI rank it 10/10 Big Boy Review scoreThanks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first time I have played the first Bioshock and I have to say it amazed me.The world, the story and the gameplay is really something special. The story itself takes place in Rapture. This is an Atlantis-like steampunk world where a disaster has happened. You go down into Rapture and have to figure things out to help the people down there, but as you play you will come to understand the character you are playing as and the world around you.At first it will comes across as 'do this', 'do that' but you will come to understand the meaning behind all of it. The story for the most part is told through voice recordings (So no 60 minute long cutscenes).You also find old voice messages left by people before they died, that tell you more about the backstory of the world. The further I got into the game, the more interesting it became to me and after I had completed the game I was searching the internet to find out more about Rapture.The gameplay is fun, the weapons feel nice to use, but occasionally I felt that my character moved too slowly. I played the game on medium difficulty and still found the combat challenging enough. I would recommend that if you play on this difficulty to spam E on every searchable container to get ammo, health, cash etc.This is because medium can become boring as you often don't have enough ammo and keep having to respawn at Vita Chambers.Due to these Vita Chambers, I sometimes got the feeling I was playing a multiplayer game. Because when I died I would just respawn and have to run back to where the enemies were. So death feels like it has little consequence.Many people complain about the amount of hacking you have to do if you don't want to be shredded instantly by the turrets.At first I didn't really have any problems with it and hacked every object that could be hacked, but as I progressed through the game I got really tired of it.As well as guns the game also has Plasmids, which are special powers that you can perform with your characters left hand.These Plasmids, like your guns, can be upgraded.The RPG elements in this game really makes you consider which items should be taken with you and which should be left behind.The world has this great Atlantis vibe. Everything in the world of Rapture is enclosed, which helps the game to achieve no pop-in and have great looking environments. These still look great after all this time because of the attention to detail, time and effort put in to them. You only see some problems when you get too close to certain textures. Because of the narrowness of the environments and the use of audio, you get this creepy haunted house feeling.A feeling that around every corner something strange could happen.I only wish that the game had given us more open environments and that the watery world outside of Rapture was more interesting to look at.The A.I. makes good use of its environment. For example, when they are low on health they will run to a nearby healing machine, or if they are on fire they will jump into water to extinguish themselves.The enemies are well realised with great acrobatic animations and sophisticated A.I. The only things that feel clunky to me are the enemy death animations and how the physics objects react.Like, when you hit an object with your wrench, it flies away jerkily through the air, as if you are viewing it at 10 FPS.Note: I would recommend saving every time before alt/shift + tabbing. The game sometimes crashed, when I did that. ( windows 7 64bit )Final thoughts:This was my first time playing through the original Bioshock and it is amazing.There is really alot of creativity and care put into this AAA game that you don't often see.Even if you own Bioshock 2 or Bioshock:Infinite (Infinite has nothing to do with Bioshock 1 and 2) I would still recommend playing it because of the story and how well the game has aged.

												A truly unique experience with fun combat and great narrative. The game's opening sequence is one of the most memorable and immerses you into the world right from the start. The narrative is mainly driven by audio diaries that the player picks up, so there is a lot of exploration involved if you want to learn story of Rapture. Collecting these is optional, but I would definitely recommend taking the time to explore the environment and collecting these audio diaries for a more satisfying story experience.The combat in the game has good variety because of the many different plasmids (essentially superpowers) you unlock throughout the game. The variety in the combat can also be attributed to the diversity in weapons and the different Gene Tonics (powerups) that the player can equip. (The weapons  can be accessed by the number keys/scroll wheel or by the weapon/plasmid menu, so there isn't any swapping/equipping weapons in and out.) My only gripes with the game are the hacking, which can get extremely frustrating towards the end of the game due to RNG, and the gameplay involving the research camera. The research camera felt like unecessary work and was just overall annoying. I would definitely recommend this game if you want a unique FPS with a great story and have the desire/patience to explore the levels of the game. I would not recommend this game if you do not have the patience to explore or if you want a fast-paced FPS. P.S. Play this version instead of the Remastered. Just finished a playthrough of the Remastered and it definitely is not worth it due to the bugs and the ridiculous amount of random crashes. (I am running an i5-6600K and a GTX 1060)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thanks to Oupa for offering me the humble bundle which included the Bioshock pack.In my opinion there are no negative points in this game.. At the beginning it was a bit hard (medium difficulty) for me to achieve my objetive in the game without dying several times. But then when I learn some information about ADAM, Jack´s plasmids and enemies weaknesses, I could achieve my objetive without dying so many times. The controls were not a problem for me since I already played other FPS (like CS:GO,TF2,etc...).Considering that the game was released in 2007, the graphics are pretty decent compared with some games that were released in this year. The storyline is awesome and the environment is kind of dark but still great. Actually some people talk about an audio bug, but I didnt have that problem.Now I will start playing Bioshock 2 when I come back from holidays and my expectations are in a higher level, because this Bioshock in general is just awesome.You should buy this game, and if it has a discount or something like that, it´s obligatory to buy it. I´m sure that you won´t regret it.My classification: 8/10*IF YOU DONT WANNA TO BE SPOILED, DONT READ THIS PART*About the storyline, while I was playing I thought the game  would finish when we killed Andrew Ryan, but then after killing him we discover that was not Atlas who guided us to escape from Rapture but Fontaine who makes Jack obey him by some commands that he set up in Jack´s brain (when he was 2 years old, I guess). The points that I most liked in the storyline was when I honestly didnt expect the main goal to change( explained in the previous phrase) ,the final boss battle vs Fontaine and the good ending :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has got to be one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Gameplay was good, the environment is literally breathtaking, and the story is magnificent.You play as Jack, whose plane goes down in the middle of the Atlantic ocean near a lighthouse. The lighthouse is actually the gateway to the underwater city of Rapture. Or it ruins, anyway. Rapture, the brain child of industrialist Andrew Ryan, was supposed to be a paradise for the common man, but not all was well in paradise. Civil unrest, class warfare, and add unmonitored sciencetific discoveries to the mix and things got real very fast. Plasmids, tonics that give humans super powers so to speak, is powered by a substance called ""ADAM"". But it destroys the mind with repeated abuse and now it's aftermath roams the streets.When you arrive, you seem to be at the tail end of the Rapture Civil War (a war between classes which quickly turned into a game of ""Who Can Splice More"") and you are almost immedietly contacted by a man named Atlas, who promises to help you escape Rapture. Now you must navigate through the city to find a way out. But don't get too comfortable in this city. Not all is as it seems and everyone is trying to get their hands on you.What I loved most about BioShock is that the main story isn't the only story. You learn about the city, it's people, and what caused paradise to literally sink. You learn how far we as humans will go to get what we desire and just what lines some will cross to enhance the human race.Are you a man or a slave? A savior or a splicer? Make your choices wisely, because in the end, your choices make you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Download ""openal"" (google ""openal download"") and install it.2.) Go to windows/system32 map and copy ""wrap_oal.dll"" to game executable location (E.g.: C:/steam/steamapps/common/bioshock) . 3.)

The Graphic is still great, The Story is still Twisted, The World is still MAD. The action and control are pretty smooth with laughable violence even though there are blood. Not an intense FPS like duke nuken, resistence, half life but have a complete different flavor.I recommend everyone to try this game even if they already played the Sequal already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock has... this unique feeling to it, it doesnt realy feel like a generic shooter with some magic powerups as what the outsider may think when they glance over it. The entire location this game takes place in is impressive and until now rarely done in those times.But the best part is story, yes the story is the most recommendable part. As the story is told via dialogue most of the time and the rare cutscenes are mostly done for the big reveals or intro's. This game was so good, I bought it when it was on sale and before I knew it I was 4 hours in and was far from bored and actualy had to force myself to stop playing to get some rest.If you never played Bioshock.. Well you should ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ change that problem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock today is just as good as it was back then.Even by todays standards the story is engaging as you dice with the the loonies of rapture, the freaky children and a brain dead mommy rapped up in a deep sea diving suit.You cant help but enjoy navigating your environment wielding convential weapons in one hand while brandishing jacked up powers in the other. The combos are amusing especially when you start hacking flying bots and chair bound cannons.The graphics are still stylish making the remaster possible the most pointless one ever but either way wont dissapoint.

												I pirated this game way back in 2009-2010, of course it was a stupid idea but the unforgettable moments I had playing this game was truly amazing. The first time using plasmids, the first time receiving ADAM. It was amazing.Bioshock is set in an underwater city called rapture, built by Andrew Ryan. The place goes mad, people become spliced and insane craving for ADAM and all hell broke lose. You play as an unnamed plane crash survivor and you swim to a near-by lighthouse, this is the beginning of your trip down into the depths of rapture.The combat is smooth as can be, weapon upgrade stations are far and scarce and are a one use only so you better chose which upgrade you want wisely, the upgrades can range from accuracy increases to damage increases. Splicers use their environment to attack you, weather it be hiding in the shadows or climbing on the ceiling like spiders, they will find a way to get you by surprise. Plasmids are an amazing addition to spice up the gameplay, they're genetic modifiers that can give you specific abilities e.g. electric or fire, with these abilities you can do environmental damage to your enemies, weather it be an oil spill conveniently set under the enemies feet or they might be standing in water.The levels aren't linear but you will have to leave at some point, the levels are huge and you can find all sorts in them. Maybe some extra cash or a big daddy or two, who knows?The sound is great however I did experience some issues when too much was going on, some sounds cut out completely breaking the tense moments.The overall graphics are still breath taking, the first time you enter rapture you see glowing neon lights and buildings covered in sea life. As for the inside the place is dark and secluded. How ever nice and bright in some huge places.Overall, this game is amazing. Can't wait for the  dissapointing  remaster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DR at BottomIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!9/10Necessary Purchase ""A man chooses, a slave obeys."" -Andrew Ryan                          Bioshock is a first-person shooter developed and published by 2K games. The game takes place in a sub-oceanic city called Rapture. The city was created by an entrepreneur by the name of Andrew Ryan who created the city with the idea that anyone could be great and do amazing things if they worked hard for it. The city used to be a revolutionary society populated by the best and brightest but now it's filled with splicers,people who have used too much Adam and have gone insane because of it. Adam is a sort of drug produced by a type of sea slug and it functions as a sort of cancer-like disease that replaces native cells with unstable stem versions. Adam is what makes the wheels of rapture turn and you use it to buy new plasmids or upgrade abilities at a gatherers garden shop. Plasmids are basically spells you can use and your ""mana"" pool is called eve. There are so many different kinds of plasmids that they make combat incredibly fun and varied as well. Each plasmid is unique and no two will feel the same. Bioshock also has Gene Tonics, which are basically just passives that fall under 1 of 3 categories: Physical, Engineering, or Combat. Each tonic offers helpful passive bonuses that can completely alter how you decide to play the game. For example, if you pick up the right tonics then you can basically turn Bioshock into a stealth game. The entirety of Bioshock is incredibly creepy but honestly I never got truly scared due to the fact that the developers included only 2-3 jumpscares and opted to use legitimate horror rather than these cheap alternatives.

			Bioshock is a FPS set in the underwater city of Rapture and it also has quite a few RPG elements such as customizable abilities and upgrades.		

As I mentioned before Bioshock is an FPS which means that you're going to be doing lot's of shooting and boy is it fun. The guns in Bioshock don't really feel that good and almost all of them have very poor control and are hard to aim with.  Bioshocks main strength comes from the enemies and the weapons that you can wield. There are loads of different enemies to fight,each with varying strength and you will have a plethora of weapons to slay them with. Weapons from a chemical thrower loaded with napalm to a shotgun with electric rounds every weapon serves a purpose and as you progress you'll begin to find that out. Each weapon has different ammo types that can be loaded in to the weapon such as proximity mines for the grenade launcher or AP rounds for the machine gun. There are U-Invent stations spread throughout the levels and at these stations you can craft various new items such as new plasmids or ammo types. About halfway through the game you get the camera and this will allow you to take pictures of enemies and for taking these pictues you gain bonuses. For example, if you take pictures of the Big Daddies then you can unlock extra damage and loot to use against them. This is an incredibly unique system and really enhances the combat with all sorts of bonuses to keep in mind. This brings me to my main problem with the combat in Bioshock: Its old. Now don't get me wrong I love old games because most the time they're just flat out better games but here the old and dated controls really kills the game in parts. The options menu  is fairly lacking and the graphics options may cause some problems but my main issue is the sensitivity. The sensitivity completely ♥♥♥♥ed me over in combat because it's always too high and there isn't a good scale built into the game. No matter what I did even on the lowest it was still too fast for me and ruined combat half the time. Now,when you die you respawn at a Vita-Chamber with no penalty. This may be seen as too easy but due to how dated this game feels I think it allows people to advance through this amazing game no matter what and not be held back by dated controls and gameplay.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=587209283 ""Plasmids changed everything. They destroyed our bodies, our minds; we couldn't handle it. Best friends butchering one another, babies strangled in cribs... the whole city went to Hell."" -AtlasSo you may know Bioshock as a game with one of the biggest twists of all time and a story to match. Bioshock's story is absolutely phenomenal and borders on perfect with it's deep characters, unique setting, and one of the best twists in gaming history. The story is amazing on it's own but you soon come to realise that every single thing in Rapture has it's own story to it. The splicers have a story, the Vita-Chamber you respawn in has a story, and , most importantly of all, you have a story. Spread about Rapture are audio diaries which are little audio recordings that shed light on what Rapture truly is and how it came to be such a decrepit pit at the bottom of the ocean.Rapture's environments are some of the best I have ever seen, especially for a game thats 9 years old. You experience a variety of levels and environment types throughout your time in Rapture and every one is memorable and unique. You also begin to get the feeling that, contrary to what Ryan says, Rapture is falling apart all around you and there's nothing you do but make it worse. Also the level design in Bioshock is so perfect that you can't help but look around. Each level has loads of little nooks and side areas where you can pick up a new Tonic or type of ammo. Eventually you'll piece together what really happened and then just when you think you have it all figured out, it all gets thrown on it's head as everything around you begins to fall apart.TL;DRBioshock is an absolute masterpiece of a game that will leave you aching for more of it's revolutionary storytelling and creative combat mechanics.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An experience at a level that most games try to reach, but seldom do. This game has it all. A gripping story line, amazing audio, and graphics. For being released in 2007, the graphics are on par with newer titles. With 20 hours of game play you will not be disappointed. Rapture is skillfully designed, and is truly a work of art. The dark environments are easy to get immersed in, and fit nicely in the horror genre. The game is based in the 1960s, and with the music and visuals you are reminded of that, but the game has a very futuristic feel.There are plenty of weapons, as well as plasmids to use. Different weapons and plasmids work best at defeating certain enemies.  But this game is not your standard shooter. With the ability to save up ""Adam"" to boost your skills, weapons and plasmids like a rpg, just not as complex. There's also crafting involved with items you collect throughout the game, again not to the depth of a true rpg. You have freedom to explore the confines of Rapture, and I suggest that you do. Be sure to pick up all the audio recordings to follow the story, as most of the story line plays out through these recordings. You will also find needed information in the recordings. You can replay all the recordings by using the ""M"" if you miss something or simply cannot hear what they are saying do to background noise.The biggest downfall of this game, the originality, the dark and macabre world setting maybe too obscure for the average gamer to appreciate.If you enjoy horror/survival games, then this is a definite must have, as well as a nice addition to any gamers collection.

												This game changed my life. As lame as that sounds, I discovered new ways of thought (Ayn Rand's Objectivism) and was introduced to the Big Band era of music and have fallen in love with it. All of this has to do with the environment and atmosphere, and the gameplay is equally satisfying. I've played through this game around 8-10 times. Sure I know most of the scripts and what not, but any chance to go back to Rapture again is a good enough excuse for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a truly wonderful experience. Genuinely absorbing storytelling, hugely creepy atmosphere, scary and interesting enemies, great weapons, Bioshock is just one of those games where everything came together perfectly. My top ten gaming list was for a long time home to games solely made in the 90s and early 00s (Thief, Deus Ex, Baldur's Gate 2, Half Life, System Shock 2, Morrowind, Planescape etc.), but Bioshock really does sit comfortably alongside those classics. If you enjoy first person shooters with strong stories, you owe it to yourself to play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From what I've read, it's not worth getting the remastered version unless you want the badges. Bioshock shocked me (ignore pun) when I first played it because of how smooth and beautifully it played for a 2007 game. Even without the remaster it stands up to current gen games with ease. I got the remastered version for free, but don't want to taint my God-like view of this game by associating it with crashing and bugs, so I think I'll leave it sitting there for now.

Posted: October 7, 2015
												In early 2010, film critic Roger Ebert published an article regarding his position on video games as an artistic medium. Early in the article, Ebert firmly expresses his view on the matter: “Let me just say that no video gamer now living will survive long enough to experience the medium as an art form.” As much as I respect the late Roger Ebert, I have to disagree with this statement because gamers living today have survived to see at least one game rise above the rest as a work of art. The game in question is Bioshock, a first person shooter that combines exquisite storytelling, impressive presentation, and innovative gameplay into one cohesive unit that stands with any novel, painting, or movie as a piece of fine art.	Bioshock begins with the player’s character, a silent protagonist named Jack, surviving a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. With nowhere else to go, Jack swims to a nearby islet occupied by a large lighthouse. Jack takes refuge inside the structure and discovers a small bathysphere that takes him to the game’s main setting, the massive underwater city of Rapture. According to a recording played in the bathysphere, Rapture was conceived by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan, who built the city with the vision of a utopian community where one could achieve greatness without any interference from outside forces, such as government or religion. However, upon arriving in Rapture, the player soon finds out that things did not go exactly as Ryan planned. The city now lies in ruin and all of its living residents have become murderous lunatics that lash out at anything that moves. Aided via radio by a mysterious man named Atlas, Jack must now explore rapture and escape with his life. 	What makes this game stand out from others is that the player has full control of Jack during the entire experience. By immediately relinquishing control, Bioshock immerses the player in a captivating tale of freewill and madness that slowly reveals itself over the course of the game. In addition to scripted events, such as the masterfully executed opening, the player can listen to audio logs left behind by the once sane citizens of Rapture. These optional logs give the player deeper insight into the lives of Rapture’s residents and the events that led to the city’s downfall. 	Ryan himself adds philosophical depth to the game’s already rich narrative. He exudes ambition and unrelenting determination to his beliefs with a charisma that makes him one of the most memorable characters in all of gaming. His attitude towards government and religious officials, which he refers to as “parasites,” heavily mirrors the objectivist beliefs Ayn Rand expressed in novels like Atlas Shrugged. The inclusion of these philosophical themes elevates Bioshock above the stereotype that games produce stories with little to no substance. 	Unfortunately, the story’s only flaw, and the main drawback of the game in general, is the ending, which feels abrupt and underwhelming compared to the rest of the game. Luckily, the rest of the story makes up for the lackluster ending with some amazing plot twists that will stick with the player long after their experience with the game has concluded. 	If Bioshock’s mesmerizing plot doesn’t draw the player into its world, then its unparalleled presentation will. Every inch of Rapture is painstakingly rendered with borderline obsessive attention to the tiniest details. Water realistically drips from the walls and ceilings. Neon signs flicker and short out. Cheerful announcements fall on deaf ears over the intercom. These fully realized details add to the idea that Rapture was once a thriving metropolis where people lived happy and fulfilling lives, making its current state of disrepair all the more heart wrenching. Furthermore, Bioshock exudes a distinct art direction rarely seen in games. Rapture’s consistent Art Deco style will generate a sense of appreciation for the artistry required to bring these environments to life. 	While Bioshock’s story and presentation already place it in a league of its own, the game truly shines in its innovations to traditional FPS gameplay. Throughout the game, the player gather’s a diverse arsenal of weapons, ranging from a pistol to a shotgun to a flamethrower. Aiming and firing each of these weapons feels natural and satisfying. Also, all of the weapons can be upgraded to increase their accuracy and damage among other traits. However, Bioshock deviates from FPS norms with the addition of plasmids. These genetic modifications provide the player with a wide variety of powers, such as setting enemies on fire, picking up and throwing large objects, and possessing enemies to have them fight on the player’s side. In order to obtain these perks, the player must collect a gene altering substance called ADAM from small girls called Little Sisters that freely roam Rapture’s halls. However, the player must first defeat the Little Sisters’ guardians, huge diving suit wearing creatures simply known as Big Daddies. These intimidating monsters deal massive damage and will take a long time to defeat, but the satisfaction and rewards make it worth the effort. Once the Big Daddy falls, the player has the option to either harvest the Little Sister, which gives the player more ADAM but kills the girl, or rescue it, which yields less ADAM but promises the player a future reward. These decisions not only affect the player’s access to plasmids but also have moral ramifications that play into how the game’s story unfolds. This morality based choice system not only presents the player with an interesting dilemma with tangible consequences, but also perfectly ties into the game’s overall themes of personal growth and freedom.When all of Bioshock’s elements come together into a singular piece, they form a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking experience that only a work of art can provide. The story keeps players guessing and presents them with philosophical concepts that other games can only dream of expressing. The presentation engrosses players into a world so authentically realized that it becomes as deep and complex as any of the game’s characters. Finally, the multifaceted gameplay forces the players to make decisions that impact their individual endeavors in unexpected ways. If this is the only time gamers experience the medium as a true art form, I can easily say that Bioshock deserves that distinction. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or a curious onlooker, you owe it to yourself to pick up this slice of gaming excellence.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock sets a new standard for FPS games, at least in storytelling quality. If it was half of what it is, it would still be on the top ten. But it somehow manages to surpass itself and to become one the best games of all times, and that’s not a personal opinion, it’s a fact. It proves that a good use of arts and philosophy can greatly improve gaming experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Para el 2007 los shooter no eran mas ir de un punto a otro y con una trama no muy compleja en medio de todo eso. Pero BIoshock cambio y revoluciono todo eso, es un poco lineal si pero te da libertad y con una trama mas que apasionante y atractiva. Con un final mas que hermoso y épico. Sin dudas de los mejores shooter que probe, jugabilidad magnifica y banda sonora y sonidos a la altura. Titulo más que recomendado.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After watching trailers, etc., I became fascinated with the world of Rapture. When I finally bought/played the game many months later, I had high expetations. This game exceeded my high expectations and remains to this day one of the best games I have ever played.

												A gaming masterpiece, no doubts.The story is wonderfully crafted, in fact it's so good you shouldn't watch any videos on it just to prevent you from getting spoiled.Graphics are amazing, on extremely low-end hardware it looks fantastic (minus you can barely read signs unless you get really close, and statues look more deformed than they should be) and runs well, my graphics card is dreadful, at 128mb of VRAM and I was able to beat the game start to finish without having any technical issues or crashes, with a playable framerate. (~24 fps not much on screen and standing still, ~19 fps when there was lots on screen and tons of action, but it felt like 30 oddly and didn't really run into many huge gaping framerate dips)Gameplay is near perfect, there are two ways you can engage your enemies, Plasmids and normal Weapons. Normal Weapons are your, well, normal weapons, like a machine gun, an oddly satisfying shotgun which I unfortunately rarely used, and a crossbow which I actually never used, probably due to the fact there was no ammo for the damn thing until the last level, where you can buy some in a vending machine, but that's a fat lot of use because that vending machine is right next to the final boss! Slightly less flawed, however, is the plasmids. Plasmids are useful tools that can shock enemies with lightning, light them on fire, freeze them, or summon a load of bees. Now, onto the flaws with the gameplay. First up is hacking, this is very useful, as you can hack security cameras and turrets to aid you against the enemies. Unfortunately, about halfway through the game hacking is near impossible just to hack something as simple as a vending machine, it also kills the pacing as you could be just about to hack as a enemy is shooting at you, then time stops completely as you hack. During my first ever playthrough of the game on the XBox 360, I only hacked once, and that was when you had to hack a Security Bot to progress. Second, is the wrench. It is immensely overpowered. From the second level of the game, you can pick up a tonic called Wrench Jockey which increases the wrench's damage. This tonic is the best in the game, as at the beginning, it takes about four hits to kill a Thuggish Splicer, and about six to kill a Leadhead Splicer. With the tonic, though, you can kill both in 1-2 hits. Wow.Ignoring the somewhat minor flaws with the gameplay above, this is a must-buy and is one of the best games EVER MADE, and would you believe it's nine years old already? I will note that if you own a Playstation 3, that version of Bioshock is the best, since it has a new difficulty setting called Survivor, along with PS3 exclusive dlc called the Challenge  Room which is not availible for PC or XBox 360. Now, that being said, would you kindly buy this game?EDIT: I have access to a laptop with a gig of vram, it can run the game on highest settings at 30-60fps now :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story in BioShock is dark and satisfying, something that will make you contemplate it long after you've put the game down. And though combat takes a back seat to the enthralling atmosphere, it's still extremely satisfying to combine your plasmid powers with traditional weapons. This is one of the finest first-person shooters with a great story and background around and a game that simply should not be missed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A well made shooter with RPG elements. Good variety of weapons/abilities to choose from. I thoroughly enjoyed the ~12 hours it took me to beat it.Pros:-Great combat mechanics. (Telekinesis was always fun)-Spooky environment/enemies.-Overall creepy presentation.Cons:-You are thrust quite abruptly into the story of the game. There's little to no explanation when the game begins as to why you are a machine-gun wielding sorcerer. You'll figure it out as you go.-Difficulty is a little weird. Normal baddies are cake. Big-Daddys tended to wreck me. Thankfully you essentially have unlimited lives.Overall, I'd recommend this game to sadists, serial killers, scuba divers, and sorcerers. I'd also encourage you to 'Rescue' the Little Sisters as opposed to 'Harvesting' them. If you rescue them all, the ending is equal parts satisfaction and horror.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is truly only one way to say this: Bioshock maybe one of the best shooters ever made. The impact this series had on shooters truly is a wonder. Among the Call of Dutys and crappy Half Life rip-offs it's great when you find an original, story based shooter. That doesn't mean that shooters need to have a great story to be good, Doom barely had one and we still love it to this day, but Bioshock was just perfect. Although Bioshock 2 was a bit of a let down and wouldn't be my first choice of shooter sequel, Bioshocks glory came back in Bioshock Infinite and if I could recommend one of the Bioshock games, it would be Infinite. Still, this game is fantastic and I really do recommend you play it if you appreciate video games as an artwork and shooters as a genre. Bioshock gets a 9.5 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review for Bioshock 2: Here.Review for Bioshock 2 Remastered: Here.**Note: This is NOT a review for the Remastered version.If you would like to see my Bioshock Remastered review, please click here.*Excuse the play hours. I've much more on console and the Remastered version.From the very day that it was released, Bioshock was a classic in its own right. It came at the right time, when the over-saturated shooter genre was steadily getting more stale as time progressed. The title found overwheming acclaim due to its fresh gameplay, unique story, and immersive setting. Often called the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, Bioshock is the title that put developer/publisher 2K Games on the road to success. The only real question here is... would you kindly?Even though Bioshock was originally released in 2007, the game has aged remarkably well. Many were surprised to hear that Remastered versions of the first two titles were underway, as the graphics have held up superbly over nearly a decade. While the console versions of the game ran flawlessly, the PC port did come with its share of issues; most notably mouse acceleration problems, but also a handful of glitches that cause one to have to reload their save files. Unfortunately, these problems were never patched out despite how easy they could've been to fix.Welcome to Rapture. The year is 1960. You are a man named Jack, aboard an airplane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The plane goes down, and surrounded by fire and debris you swim to a nearby lighthouse. Upon entering, you're greeted by a man named Atlas via radio, after being threatened by horrendously insane denizens of the underwater city. In a somewhat submarine type of contraption called a Bathysphere, you submerge down what is assumed to be thousands of fathoms under the sea, where you enter the rustic, dystopian, Art Deco style city of Rapture.At first the player isn't given much information on the character that they're playing, nor much of the story for that matter. The story progresses through a series of audio interactions with Atlas, and through collection audio diaries that are scattered throughout each level. Occasionally, other characters present themselves over the communication radio, and there are only a small handful of cutscenes which are placed at very appropriate moments. Without taking the time to explore Rapture and find all of the diaries, one may feel slightly lost in terms of plot and story. If you take the time to find and listen to all 122 diaries, it's easy to say that 2K did an amazing job adding depth and vibrancy to each character.As stated before, Bioshock has a very unique approach to gameplay. Not only do you get six upgradable weapons (shotgun, pistol, chemical thrower, crossbow, etc.), but you get 11 Plasmids to play around with; however, you can only equip 7 at any given time, but you can swap out what Plasmids and Tonics you have equipped at a Gene Swap Station. Plasmids rewrite your DNA, and infuse you with outstanding powers such as Telekinesis, Incineration, Insect Swarms, and even the ability to Hypnotize Big Daddy. In order to use Plasmids, you must have enough Eve, which can be gained through injecting yourself with Eve Hypos. It's the same basic concept as spells and mana. However, Jack's left hand changes aesthetics with each newly equipped Plasmid, and there are also upgrades to find for most of them.Suffice it to say that the game has a lot of variety to offer, especially given its age. The enemies that you will encounter are as equally unique, and they are known as Splicers. People who have been surgically modified to the extreme, whether willingly or forced, by the insane Dr. Steinman. There are a total of five different Splicers, each with their own unique attributes. However, let us not forget the star of the show here, the Big Daddy. There are two different kinds of Big Daddies, Bouncer and Rosie. Their role is to protect the Little Sisters who are harvesting ADAM around Rapture. You must face these behemoths each time that you want to either rescue or harvest a Little Sister.ADAM is another type of currency in Bioshock, although you also have money that you collect for buying items and ammo, and it is used to unlock new Tonics, Plasmids, new slots for each, and upgrades for both Health and Eve. The more Little Sisters you either harvest or rescue, the more ADAM you collect. I should also mention here that Tonics function as your abilities, and they can also have several findable upgrades akin to the Plasmids; there are well over 50 Tonics in total throughout the game. There's also a very limited crafting system in place, so that you can find components and make ammo, new Tonics, and even autohack devices to assist in hacking Turrets, Security Bots, Cameras, and Vending Machines.However, despite everything that has been aforementioned, the real ingredient that makes this game stand out so vividly is its amazing art direction and thick, immersive atmosphere. One really gets hit hard with the authentic 1960's vibe, which is conveyed through the Art Deco style of the game. However, instead of it being a pristine environment, Rapture is decayed, down-trodden, flooded, and rusty. At almost every corner you're reminded that you're hundreds, if not thousands, of fathoms below the surface, and at the same time you're constantly reminded of the time period; whether it be visually or by way of music. There's not a lot of music in the game, but there are aptly placed jukeboxes from time to time that sing relevant tunes from the time period. One of the hardest hitters is looking out of any given window and seeing a neon sign lit city underwater.If you've never taken the time to visit Rapture and delve into the universe of Bioshock, you shouldn't wait any longer. The story is absolutely remarkable, and one that you will not forget for years to come; I haven't played this title since 2007, and its story, influence, and artistic direction have never left me. There is a ton to do in Rapture, and a large amount of places to explore, looking back on it now it's pretty crazy how many mechanics and features that 2K were able to implement into the title; especially being such a smaller team a decade ago. Now, would you kindly go and play Bioshock? ""With the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well."" - Andrew Ryan.Rating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock has one of the most disturbing stories ever made in the gaming history. You are basically in a plane, then you suddenly crash and get wrapped up in a war between two factions fighting for power. Make use of Plasmids, powerful DNA modifiers that let you cast incredible skills; pick up the classic guns and kill all your foes. Dislike these methods? Hack, go on stealth, the choice is up to you. One of the best games ever made.+Different ways to approach the same situation+Inmersive dark atmosphere +Moral system that tests players+Rich in both lore and character background terms+Strong RPG touch+Beautiful architecture-Soundtrack could have been better98/100 Masterpiece ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is very good game with great storyline, art-style, decent graphics and interesting mechanics. It was fun playing it.You are Jack who survived plane crash and found underwater city, way more technologically developed than other cities in 60's. He have to survive again but now there are mutants (crawling on walls, ceiling, teleporting, tossing fireballs or ice) and security system which could be used against enemies who would like to slice protagonist, it will only happen when the defense system is hacked (hacking minigame is simple/hard depends on how important/powerful turret you want hack, it can be easier by equipping skills/plasmids). You can also find so called sisters down there (little girls who are ADAM producers, it's very important currency to buy plasmids and upgrades as life and mana) you can save them, or harvest them (it will kill them obviously your choice :p ), those girls are almost harmless, but they walk always with Big Daddy who are strong as f*** and won't let you get to sister easily, you have to kill/destroy him, after that you're free to go). original fight system (use weapons, or use plasmids/ spells which will freeze, burn, shock etc. enemy, very useful thing weapons have 3 kinds of ammo (good with dealing humans, armoured enemies, or standard ammo) hack defense system and wait for enemy annihilation ;] you can also hypnotise Big Daddy who will protect you as little sister, but he can accidentally kill you if you get in his way ^^ great graphics of underwater city great storyThere are also cons: fun feature, why protagonist can hold all that stuff and can't hold more than 500$ WTF? Comparing piece of paper or coin to huge weapon? Can't get it -.-  not enough ammo, it was hard to find it, sometimes had to fight with wrench and plasmids if I had mana, there are a lot of shops but with money limit you can't accumulate cash for later and when you need ammo you have no $ or inversely full cash full ammo and you find 90$ ""can't get it"" F****! It's like the game is teasing/taunting you ""remember that nice shining 100$? it would be nice to have it now >:D "" every time I had to change screen resolution options, not sure what was causing that, this game have problems with saving config I was begging every 10 minutes for that the game won't crash (maybe it was caused by Raptr, Steam or Xfire not sure but without those applications (excluding Steam) that still happened and adding turn off Vertical sync made it worse, game couldn't stand 200 fps?) after loading screen mouse is set like from 3200 to 800 DPI i had to jerk mouse for 5 seconds to return my sensitivity settings there isn't any journal, even hint won't help so if you find voice tape and if you won't listen to that because you were fighting you'll miss important password to open lift/door and that terminal can't be hacked, you won't get it any more after picking up new tape => retry mission or search net -.- respawning enemies, yes that thing was annoying back then in NES games so it's annoying in this game, when you die, you get back to vita chamber ""respawn point"", you want go back quickly to place where you died and what? New enemies on way :|Despite those cons it's a good game, fun to play 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here's my 2nd review of the 'best FPS's of all time', as promised.(Bragging note: dont mind my Playtime of the game on Steam, i played and did 100% on all 3 Bioshock games on the PS3)Bioshock is the most stylish game of all time.While HL2 is the traditional FPS, great in every department, but following previously established archetypes, Bioshock revolutionizes most of those formulas. So i'll also try my best to 'stylize' my 'review formula':Rapture.Truly, this amazing underwater city defines everything this game does well. From the very start, you feel like Alice, going into the rabbit hole, into Wonderland... Except you're late for this one, it's already in ruins.The art style is absolutely amazing, the 20's Art Déco combined with the sci fi / mechanical aspects results in a sense of confusion, not knowing if you're in the past or future, which adds to the mysterious tone of the ruined city.The combat system is also very refreshing, instead of just relying on weapons, they added plasmids, which can be mixed with the guns for fun gameplay, with an added layer of depth. The exploration and scavenging were a nice surprise for me (as an obsessive explorer in gaming), presenting both some RPG elements and the backstory of the city, before it collapsed (metaphorically), through the eyes of its previous inhabitants.Another unique, iconic element of the game is it's enemies, more specifically the almighty Big Daddy, who provides an amazing dynamic to the combat (i was gonna describe it, but i decided it's best to let the players found out for themselves).Finally we reach the Story, praised as one of the best in videogames, proving that FPS's dont have to be mindless with virtually no story (you guys know what games im talking about!), by presenting complex philosophical, moral and political ideas, as an amazing social commentary that should probably be studied and debated by the experts of those departments. All of this, with a limited amount of characters, that you can count witth the fingers in your hands. But even though few, each counts as a hundred, with powerful personalities crashing, which results in the infamous plot twists that catapulted this game into stardom.Now, would you kindly do yourself a favor, and go play this game immediately, if you havent yet (or even if you have!)

												Don't get me wrong, the game itself is great, The lack of an easy fix is what makes me not recommend it though.When games for windows live died Bioshock went on life support. It doesn't save controls for a long time and needs a ton of hotfixes to make it work properly on win7. It really is a good and fun game with an interesting story if you take the time to make it work properly but we need a real fix, it took me 2 hours to find precisely how to make it work and even then I still need to remap my keys and fix the resolution once in a while.

A great story line that kept me wanting to play until I could find out all the mysteries of what the environment and story had to offer.Completed the game on the Hard setting my first play through. Would play through again. Looking forward to finishing off the series.If you are a fan of first person shooters and are looking for a new story line to peak your interests, would you kindly buy this game and enjoy it. I did not think that I would enjoy this game, but have no regrets towards my purchase.*Purchased Bioshock Triple Pack from the Steam Summer Sale			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably one of my favourite games of the last generation, since when I played it I hadn't experienced anything like it before. The storytelling, characters and atmosphere are still fantastic, and there haven't been many games that have done it as all. The gameplay is kind of like System Shock 2 but much less complicated and difficult, but still quite challenging on the hardest difficulty setting but the vita chambers make it impossible to die and a bit tedious after a while =w=Graphics still hold up quite well and the art design is dark and twisted just the story, Rapture is awesome ^~^If you haven't play Bioshock since it came out in 2007 or at all its definitely worth checking out, plus its crazy cheap on Steam sometimes....

												Just completed this on straight run on hardcore setting & 27 hrs intensive play.  Played Infinate first & now working through  previous versions, this one apparently being released 2007.Really atmospheric game with good art deco style graphics & excellent sound effects that adds a sometimes dark, chilling effect.  Good gameplay, the added effect of plasmids blending with an aray of contemporary weapons makes this worth playing a few times with different approaches.  Additional 'hacking' that challenge the brain in the early morning hours.  There is the odd clunky scene but on the whole I would recommend for anyone to play this original themed game once. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Would you kindly read this review and buy this game? If you didn't know, BioShock is claimed to be one of the most revolutionary FPS's games of all time, and that statement has plently of truth to it. It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.In terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen, and the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game. Voice acting is perfect without a doubt, and characters such as Ryan Andrew and Sander Cohen will leave a lasting impression long after you finish the game. Sound design is extremly well-done as well: the whale-like moans from the hulking Big Daddies are very creepy, and the game only uses music for atmospheric reasons, adding an extra layer of immersion that makes the game quite screepy, but never outright scary (which is not what the game is trying to do).The story is the main highlight of BioShock, and presents themes and ideologies that are very applicable to reality, mainly the view of objectivism. Plot twists and unforgetable characters will make the experience a memorable ones, and each audio-diary will flesh out the world of Rapture, especially in events following up to the game. As for the main protagonist Jack, he's the typical silent playable character that every shooter seems to have, but his background information makes him quite interesting. Despite this, the story is damned near perfect, even if it feels ever-so rushed after the games huge revelation and twist.I could end the review here, as the story is something that alone should be able to sell this game instantly, no strings attached. However, how does BioShock sell as an FPS? The game features an arsenal of weapons from a flamethrower to a machine gun, and are all quite standard. The sense of conserving ammo that the game has at first is very intense, however later on you will have more money than you even need, so that feeling is somewhat lost. Gunplay feels slightly ""floaty"" (can't really get my finger on what it is), and later on becomes quite inneffective against enemies that suddenly have increased durability from earlier in the game. Speaking of enemies, you'll encounter Splicer's, humans which are addicted to this substance called ADAM, which grants them superpowers but makes them mentally unstable. Some will teleport around you, while others will have a box of grenades to utilize instead. But most significant of all are the Big Daddies.These hulking beasts present a real challenge, but are neutral if not dealt with. Why? They guard Little Sisters. which are key to the games plot and whether you get a good or bad ending. These altered girls harvest ADAM from dead corpses (and have a creepy sense of innocence to them), and you have the option to either save them or harvest them. Saving leads to the good ending but you get less ADAM, and harvesting them leads to the bad ending but you get more ADAM (and a combination leads to the sad ending). Actually combating the Big Daddies leads to a great deal of planning, and you'll have to acknowledge that you wont come out of the fight without a few scars.Going backwards, do you recall how I noted how guns became less useful as the game progresses? Well, that is because of Plasmids, which are basically superpowers like shooting flames, bolts of electricity, or even a swarm of bees! These are incredibly fun to use. een though you have to switch to your Plasmids and use them independantly from your weapons, making combat feel slightly clunky. The game also presents you with many RPG features, such as a hacking minigame (meh), weapon/plasmid upgrades, shops, ammo types, and plenty of nooks and cranies to add to it all. Overall combat is slightly outdated by todays standards (no sprint or ADS, if such a thing would bother you), but is still incredibly fun regardless.SLIGHT GAMEPLAY SPOILERS AHEADAnd here is a warning to where the game goes wrong. Following the huge plot twist at the end of the second third of the game, the gameplay plummets (pun intended) downhill, even though it may not seem so at first. It places some annoying restrictions on your abilities, but that's where the fun begins. After that you have a boring and confusing (IMO) scavenger hunt, and after that an incredibly dull escort mission before a forgetable (but not as bad as the scavenger hunt) final boss. To be fair, the only part that really stuck out as bad to me was the scavenger hunt: everything before it was annoying but still fun, and after it forgetable. The audio diaries and story will certainly make up for it however, as the games presentation remains consistent throughout.BioShock is a prime example of how video games are art, and is one you should not overlook. Even where it missteps in gameplay, it's story and presentation are grand throughout, and provide a unique experience you will not forget and will come back to again and again. There is no denying that BioShock is a game that will stand the test of time, and I would give it a 9/10 (If it was story alone than 11/10, it's that good). So, would you kindly get it?

I started playing Bioshock thinking it would be a straightforward FPS with no depth, but I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised by it.Both the setting and the story were really engaging which got me really immersed in the game. Everything from the shooting mechanics to the spectacular voice acting gave the game a really polished feel.The game isn't as linear as I originally thought, some points you're forced to scavenge for ammo and you actually get rewarded for exploring which is really nice.You can also really customize how you play by selecting from a huge choice of plasmids which change your character in interesting ways.One tiny thing that annoyed me is that there's absolutely no penalty for dying, you just respawn at the checkpoint losing absolutely no progress or money. Also, there are very frequent hacking puzzles which broke the pace of the gameplay.Finally, the ending of the game was highly anticlimactic. It spends ages immersing you just to end it all with an escort mission and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of a -Beep-, climaxing with a 30 second cinematic.If you don't mind a minigame every now and then, or a somewhat rushed ending then I'm sure you'll enjoy the great gameplay and many plot twists that this game offers. I really enjoyed my time with Bioshock and it's one of the best single player FPS games I've ever played, so it gets a 7 out of 10 on 60 Second Reviews.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: Bioshock is a great game, if you haven't played it you should.The gameplay is fun with first person gunfights and a hacking minigame that goes from easy to insane as you play the game. One problem I did have was that I could not figure out how to turn off the tutorial hints.The visuals were nice, I really don't see why they needed to push out a remaster. Actually the faces of the characters (I.E. the little sisters) looked really creepy and sometimes inhuman.The sound was good except it randomly stopped working and I had to enable some sound driver in my sound devices.The story was remarkable and if you have not played the game: BUY IT NOW AND PLAY IT!I do recommend Bioshock, I loved the boss battle at the end it was very satisfying and one of the very best I have ever played.It takes 12 to 16 hours to beat the game.I rate it a 9/10.

												Bioshock is a great game. It's polished, gritty, tense and sometimes frightening. It's also quite wordy and philosophical. There's a lot to like here. The sound, especially, is amazing, and the graphics are beautiful.The game promises a ""play it your way"" experience, and succeeds, to a point. The many plasmids (think ""spells"") encourage you to try different tactics, but the very first combo you learn is the easiest and most effective: shock your opponent, and then bludgeon him with a wrench while he's stunned. It’s generally easy to identify a best plasmid to use for each situation; although you can explore others. I should also point out that this game is psychologically very taxing. You spend a great deal of time looting dead, mangled, burned corpses. You're crawling through a destroyed city. The game is oppressive and claustrophobic, and seriously depressing. I was glad when it was over, but also glad to have played it. Difficult at the time, but it left a lasting impression.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much everyone heard about this game back in 2007. It was massively popular for it's intrinsicly detailed world, and it's intense System Shock 2 inspired gameplay.I quite like this game. It is basically System Shock 2 lite, with an immersively new and original setting that cannot be replicated. It parodies and satires both Ayn Rand and much of history at the same time.Wether it's worth your money or not, you'll find Bioshock is a well written game, and it leaves an experience that one doesnt forget lightly.

												This is officially the best game I have ever played, and will probably ever play. I wholeheartedly say that you should buy and play this. After getting all three endings, and experiencing the feeling of joy to see the game come to a close, I knew that I had to make a review, to let all that see this - that this is the game, the game that will define your experiences when it comes to wanting the best of a game. I rate this game 10/10, and I beg you to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Call me late to the party, by about seven years, but Bioshock is a perfect example of all that is good in gaming and stands tall as one of the greatest games of human history.Coming into the game with the mindset of someone who played and loved Bioshock Infinite, I set my mind back to 2007 when the game was released: Measuring it up to the standards back then, the result? I was completely blown away.Bioshock was ahead of it's time with amazing graphics, fluid gameplay, immersive environments and a story that left me on the edge of my seat in anticipation. Taking the role of Jack, a silent protagonist you venture deeper and deeper into the eery and unsettling depths of the underwater city of Rapture, radio contact directs you to your goals and you can find audiographs to learn more about the history of such an incredible city. The environments feel isolated, making the player feel trapped and uncomfortable and sets up for a terrifying setting where you square down with the mutated and insane denizens still roaming the submerged streets.  The balance between environment and story are so perfectly intuned that it is easy to lose yourself in the setting and be completely immersed in the story, sinking hours at a time into unlocking the secrets this modern Atlantis leaves to find, building up to one of the most shocking twists you will ever experience. The story, lore and setting of the entire game is incredible, and when you finish playing through the game I highly recommend going online and reading up more, because the history of Rapture is so well written that I can spend days scratching around to find every little tidbit of information.To defend yourself you are given a large arsenal of firearms and Plasmids (genetic modification tonics that alter your very DNA and give you powerful abilities) that you can use in many ways: Set up traps and take advantage of the environment to maximize the damage potential of plasmids, or you can use your guns to plow through your foes in a very satisfying way, as each and every firearm has a good feel to it and carries a wonderful punch. As you progress in the game, enemies get tougher and tougher, requiring more firepower to take them out. Throughout the game you can collect and combine upgrades to your weapons giving them more damage output as well as numerous other bonuses such as recoil reduction or firing rate (at the same time giving your weapon a visible upgrade, making them look absurdly bad♥♥♥♥♥, as well as gene tonics that you use to give yourself powerful buffs to your combat and hacking expertise.The level design is flawless, being understandable but far from straightforward; offering plenty of opportunites to explore and loot, finding every little scrap of ammo and utilities to give yourself as much of an advantage as possible. Now I have to apologize, but there is one part about Bioshock that wasn't perfect and if I can say so safely: was bad. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT BUT I FEEL I NEED TO POINT THIS OUT.So be advised, mild spoiler alert: Skip this paragraph over if you do not wish to have spoilers.In the later stages of the game you partake in (ugh) an escort mission. One of the types of missions that gamers almost universally despise on a molecular level. The objective is to guide a little girl through a splicer infested area and protect the little rat because she's the only one who can open the doors for you. Now the flaws with this is that throughout the game up to this point you set the pace yourself, you moved, fought and explored as you saw fit, because this was your experience and you experienced it as you wanted: Then this little bedwetter waddles in and sets the pace for you, robbing you of your control  as she struts thoughtlessly into automated turrets and other dangers. But the worst part is that the nosepicker is just about one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen: She repeats the same small handful of dialogue over and over without end, and practically NEVER SHUTS UP. I honestly wanted to shoot her myself, but I seemingly needed her to open the doors for me, to which I wanted to physically pick her up and use her as a battering ram. This portion, although short-lived, felt so far out of place and was a blemish on an otherwise perfect game.Finally, Bioshock was built on an outdated engine, which results in some game-breaking issues as a result of incompatabilites with modern technology, such as inconsistent mouse sensitivity and flat-out broken audio. To which I refer you to these guides on Steam that have both solved these issues:Mouse sensitivity -

												Belated review. Very few games have ever presented a world as unique as that of Rapture in Bioshock. For that reason alone, it is worth playing. But when you also consider the incredible setting is just one part of the eqaution - the game features great gameplay and a cool story as well - it all adds up to an experience that simply cannot be missed. For anyone who has yet to play this classic... what are you waiting for?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												New to FPS on PC (so I beat the game on easy mode like the scrub I am)(easy mode is pretty friggin easy)First thing is that if there are a couple compatibility issues with Win10. You have to find the .exe file and run on compatibility mode for Windows XP 2/3. There's a couple other compatibility issues, and certain things will make your game (and computer) bug out, but it's not that big of a deal.The first thing you see when you start the game is an ominous entryway into the city; your plane crashes near some sort of towering structure, and the inside doesn't light up until you enter and the double doors close behind you. You slowly descend, the lights flickering on as you proceed, and eventually you get to the bathysphere and begin your journey to the underwater city.The opening scene is just *twang* mmm, delicious. The initial events set up the expectations for the rest of the game quite nicely. The entire city seems to be the worn-down remnants of some wonderfully fun place, very carnival-esque with all its glowing neon signs and jingles, but teeming with crazy people spiked on 'plasmids,' which I'm going to explain as genetic modifiers that allow you (and them) to use superhuman abilities such as zapping people with lightning, telekinesis, etc.For anyone looking to create a world of their own, play through Bioshock and pay attention - this game gets many things right.As for gameplay, you tend to have to do a lot of scavenging. Money, ammo, other resources, are all fairly difficult to come by unless you scrounge up everything in an area, including searching dead bodies and checking for weapons near recently deceased attackers (seriously, you have to figure out where they dropped the gun before you can claim their ammo). If you really do search everything and you're good about not wasting too many resources, you can end up with a lot of excess, so it's not too bad.The controls are a tad complicated because there are two 'categories' of weapons for you to use and multiple weapons for each category, but there are enough keyboard shortcuts that you can set everything up and be able to manage everything pretty quickly.There are a variety of ways to handle enemies that can be pretty fun - hacking security bots, for instance. Igniting gasoline makes everything catch on fire, water spreads lightning, and other such interactions. The only thing I don't really like is the security camera things. Maybe I'm just blind, but I have never spotted a security camera before it's spotted me, so I have to deal with these security bots for a full minute while the alarm blares, every single time.The story itself was underwhelming, because of its considerable reputation for having an incredible story. No, the story is not incredible. It's pretty good, definitely not bad. But not incredible. What I'm going to praise instead of the story is everything else - the aesthetics of the game are really good. The VOs, the characters, the sounds, the environment, and game progression compliment the story very well.Final score 8/10. Very fun gameplay, great voicework, a wonderfully carnival-esque world of horror, and also very nice music and sound. The song about some lady looking to buy a doggy with a waggily tale is still stuck in my head.btw pro tip - when you're choosing between 'harvest' and 'rescue,' always choose 'rescue.' It'll be worth it.NOTE: I got the entire BioShock collection for 16 freaking dollars, so I'm going to be very lenient about any mishaps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is a great game. It's polished, gritty, tense and sometimes frightening. It's also quite wordy and philosophical. There's a lot to like here. The sound, especially, is amazing, and the graphics are beautiful.The game promises a ""play it your way"" experience, and succeeds, to a point. The many plasmids (think ""spells"") encourage you to try different tactics, but the very first combo you learn is the easiest and most effective: shock your opponent, and then bludgeon him with a wrench while he's stunned. It’s generally easy to identify a best plasmid to use for each situation; although you can explore others. I should also point out that this game is psychologically very taxing. You spend a great deal of time looting dead, mangled, burned corpses. You're crawling through a destroyed city. The game is oppressive and claustrophobic, and seriously depressing. I was glad when it was over, but also glad to have played it. Difficult at the time, but it left a lasting impression.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't have much playtime on Steam, but I got literally every achievement for BioShock on Xbox 360. This is one of my favorite games. It's also one of my favorite examples of video games as an art form. The narrative is amazing, because while there is some amount of ""telling"" in the story, the vast majority is more of ""showing,"" or even just ""experiencing."" Rapture is a setting that lends itself to the creepy and mysterious, and ever turn can be full of surprises (I don't even like horror films or anything like that, but I loved this setting), and the various audiologs give more to every character, while not feeling mandatory to progress (although mandatory because the story and the characters are just that interesting). The only thing wrong with the game in my opinion is a slightly uneven difficulty curve, and that the only way to get enough Adam for basically everything is to save every Little Sister, which punishes harvesting them.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 26, 2014
												I was skeptical at first, since I started the series with Infinite and ended up not liking that game. Fortunately I decided against my bias and purchased this one.One thing I love about Bioshock, is the way it tells or rather shows you the story and events in Rapture. Infinite in my humble opinion felt way too scripted, and it bugged me, how often that particular game took away my control over Bookers' character. Bioshock instead opts for a different way of handling this aspect by letting me, the player decide wether I want to give attention to a cutscenes or not, what I really like. Bioshock also features a very engaging story, that might surprise you.Despite a somewhat ""antique"" Unreal Engine 2, the game is a stunner, providing incredible (and unsettling) setpieces. Unfortunately ragdoll and physic animations are capped at 30FPS which really makes them stick out like a sore thumb. The games' biggest problem however are the low FOV and the ridiculously low weapon FOV, which made me motionsick after 5 minutes of playtime. This can be avoided by using a tool called ""Flawless Widescreen"" which allows the user to customize both options. Irrational Games did a great job on Bioshocks artdesign which still holds up even to this date. The music and soundeffects are well done and provide a good atmosphere.Bioshocks gunplay is alright. The player is given a rather large arsenal of weaponary and plasmids. The guns felt a bit too weak, which turned some enemies into frustrating bulletsponges. My favourites are the wrench and the shotgun, which I found useful for all situations they game would throw at me. Plasmids are integrated well into the gameplay and are lots of fun to use, even though ""Elektroshock"" turned out to be a bit too OP (extremely handy for foighting Big Daddies).I do have an issue with the health system. Even with a full inventory of health kits, I happened to die alot because there is little to no feedback when you're low on health. The bar isn't visible enough due to its rather small size and is in my opinion badly positioned (upper left corner). It would have been nice if the player was given the option to customize the HUD to their likings.The game happened to run very badly on my PC. It crashed alot, never saved my settings and featured horrid mouse acceleratrion issues. The DX10 features are responsible for Bioshock not working properly on newer machines, I advise to set the game to DX9 (add ""-dx9"" to the start options). Fixes for this game can be found on the PCGamingWiki.I had a lot of fun with Bioshock and can safely recommend it to anyone who like to play First Person Shooters.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ich war Anfangs etwas skeptisch über dieses Spiel, da ich Infinite vorher gespielt und nicht genossen habe. Gott sei Dank habe ich mich aber letztendlich doch zum Kauf des ersten Teils entschieden.Was mir an Bioshock sehr gefällt, ist die Art und Weise, wie die Geschichte und die Geschehnisse in Rapture erzählt oder besser, gezeigt werden. Infinite hatte meiner Meinung zuviele geskriptete Szenen, was mich sehr genervt hat, da mir einfach zu oft die Kontrolle über Booker entnommen wurde. Bioshock hingegen verzichtet auf diese Vorgehensweise und lässt den Spieler entscheiden, ob er einer Cutscene beiwohnen möchte oder nicht, was ich sehr begrüße. Zudem wartet das Spiel mit einer sehr fesselnden Handlung auf, welche den einen oder anderen zu überraschen vermag.Trotz veralteter Unreal Engine 2 sieht das Spiel fantastisch aus. Man bekommt sehr schöne (zum Teil auch sehr schaurige) Setpieces geboten. Ragdoll und Physikanimationen werden nur in 30FPS dargestellt, was nicht ins Gesamtbild passen möchte und schlecht aussieht. Das größte Problem des Spiels ist jedoch die niedrige FOV sowie das viel zu niedrige Waffen-FOV. Nach nur 5 Minuten habe ich große Übelkeit verspürt. Das Programm ""Flawless Widescreen"" ist hier zu empfehlen, mit dem man beide FOV-Optionen nach Belieben anpassen kann. Das Artdesign von Bioshock ist Irrational Games sehr gut gelungen und lässt das Spiel auch heute noch gut aussehen. Die Musik und Soundeffekte passen gut in das Spiel rein und verleihen es eine solide Atmospähre.Bioshocks' Gunplay ist passabel. Es wird dem Spiel ein üppiges Aresnal an Feuerwaffen und Plasmiden geboten. Die Feuerwaffen sind meiner Meinung nach etwas zu schwach, was einige Gegner zu echten Bulletsponges gemacht hat. Meine Favoriten waren die Rohrzange und die Schrotflinte, welche sich bei allen Situationen bewährt haben. Plasmide sind gut eingebunden und machen extrem viel Spaß anzuwenden, wobei die Fähigkeit ""Elektroshock"" doch ziemlich overpowered ist (extrem hilfreich gegen Big Daddies).Ein Kritikpunkt den ich habe ist das Gesundheitssystem. Trotz reichlichen Vorrat an Verbandskästen bin ich häufig abgekratzt aufgrund fehlendem Feedback bei niedriger Gesundheitsanzeige. Die Anzeige im HUD ist nicht gerade groß und meiner Meinung nach flasch positioniert (oben links). Wäre ganz nett gewesen, wenn man das HUD umgestalten könnte.Das Spiel hat am Anfang auf meinem Rechner Probleme gemacht. Es stürzte oft ab, hat meine Einstellungen nicht gespeichert und hatte extrem gräßliche Mausbeschleunigung. Die DX10 Features verursachen Probleme auf neuen Rechnern, deshalb rate ich Bioshock im DX9 Modus zu spielen (""-dx9"" in die Startoptionen einfügen). Im PCGamingWiki findet man alle Informationen und Fixes für das Spiel.Ich hatte auf jeden Fall sehr viel Spaß mit Bioshock und kann es jedem Spieler, der First Person Shooter mag, empfehlen.

												""We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us.""Bioshock is a hell of a game I'll give it that. A first person shooter with RPG elements and a knack for scaring you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.+The graphics look beautiful for a game that came out in 2007. Sure the textures aren't great, and the characters are a little cartoony, but everything about the aesthetic of this game helps to fully set the atmosphere. And take my word for it, this is one of the most immersive games I have played in a very long time when it comes to the atmosphere. +The soundtrack is phenomenal. It fits every single scene. It helps draw you into the game. It can make even a bathroom that lacks jump scares the most terrifying place you've ever tip-toed your way into. +The level design is fantastically done, if poorly translated onto a 2D map. The underwater city of rapture has a mild claustrophobic feeling to it, but it makes sense. It fits the setting quite well, and when you need space? You can usually find or make it.+The story is fantastic, Ken Levine does wonders with stories. Draw dropping plot twists and endings that'll leave you speechless, i loved every second of it. There isn't a story in the world Ken Levine could write that I could forget.+Decent-length. Got 21 hours out of the game after getting it for $1 in a bundle. Definitely worth the price. I was partially a completionist however, I explored almost every single room and shelf in Rapture. I also moved very slowly at points since I scare easy.+Since the tags say it's horror, I can tell you it really does horror right. Jump-scares when you least expect them. And a very creepy atmosphere that doesn't rely on jump scares to begin with.-Respawning enemies. Just...ugh. Bioshock as a series is infamous for throwing enemies, and bullet sponges at you. If it bothers you, play on a lower difficulty, you'll become a bullet sponge yourself.-Bugs with Win7 or later. From random crashes (That lead to all of your settings resetting) to the sounds cutting out when too make sound sources are coming in at once. Most noticeable when guardians of rapture (Sounds better than dinky flying robots) are shooting. Especially noticeable towards the end of the game. Immersion-breaking to say the least...but not game-breaking.All in all, this game holds up. I'm very glad I made my easy-to-scare♥♥♥♥♥finish the game, as it was totally worth it. Keeping its buggy state and flaws in mind, I give this game an 4/5. I think this is a game that everyone who enjoys a good immersive story should play. Were the bugs fixed, I'd give it a 9/10, so maybe a console version might fare better for you. Either way, I have to admit that it is an amazing game and it has defined the standards for the horror FPS genre. Now, would you kindly consider giving it a try? =)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Questo gioco , è uno dei migliori titoli a cui abbia mai giocato. E ho iniziato a giocare con l Amiga 500 nel lontano 1988 , per poi passare a un 486 sx (ovvero senza processore matematico).Quando ero bambino io, un masterizzatore cd (non dvd che non esistevano) costava circa un milione e mezzo di lire gli hard disk da 100 mb costavano 1 milione di lire e le schede grafiche ancora erano forse nella mente di chi ha progettato la prima. Internet non esisteva e i giochi erano assai difficile da reperire....Parlando di Fps, posso dire che dopo essere stato impressionato da Wolf3d, stupito da Doom (perchè a quei tempi Doom era un passo avanti non da poco), il primo Medal of Honor, per poi rimanere coinvolto nelle ambientazioni e musiche del divino Duca altro passo avanti memorabile nel mondo videoludico..... non mi è rimasto piu impresso niente fino a Bioshock.Per me è la storia Fps piu bella di sempre, un gioco fatto col cuore e non solo per vendere un prodotto. Curato in ogni particolare, con quei nemici malati, divertenti, particolari.... con le sfide a i Big Daddy, la trama coinvolgente al massimo. Voglio dire al giorno d oggi non c è nessun gamer che non sappia che Bioshock esiste, e se avete provato solo l Infinite (per carità bella grafica ma niente di piu) sappiate che vi siete persi LA PERLA DELLA SAGA.Godetevi questo perchè non troverete fps piu coinvolgente neanche negli altri 2 episodi.Capolavoro			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's the best First Person Shooter I've ever played. Bioshock was released in August 2007 and almost 10 years later it still manages to look and sound better than most modern games. When it comes to its story, characters and atmosphere, I don't think it's been done better before or after. From the iconic Big Daddies to Rapture itself, the entire mythology surrounding this game is a masterwork of science fiction and a watershed moment not only in gaming but in pop culture itself. I'm not sure there's such a thing as a perfect game but if there is, Bioshock should definitely be in the conversation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game has a very dark underwater theme but I like the overall visual effects and story line. This game does have a problem with contrast as the default brightness setting is intentional , I have to play this game in the dark in order to see it better. Brightness adjustment just makes the game washed out. Played best having your speakers up loud to simulate a movie theater. Don't have a subwoofer as residents of the mobile home park would go after me for loud noise. Bought during the Humble Bundle. Friend gifted me Bioshock 2 so I will play this next. Works great with the Logitech F310 gamepad in XINPUT Mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Calling the setting a character has become a cliché but Rapture, Bioshock's underwater city, is not only a character: it's the game's main character. In my journey through the game I've found myself much more interested in discovering the city's secrets and history than advancing the main plot. It's Ayn Rand's special halloween episode and it's great. The gameplay is a bit clumsy and I felt that were too many clashing systems that don't quite work together well. Still, it's one of the best games from last generation and I feel everyone should give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												I don’t know since when PC gamers become this picky and that difficult to impress, but this remastered version isn’t that bad, I feel it receives overwhelming negative reviews like this is not fair.Unlike a large number of steam users out there who have next-gen alien technology powered Titan weapons to fire, my pc is old and can’t launch most of the AAA titles games come out now days(I play AAA titles on console), I usually play some naïve pixel graphics games on my vantage skeleton PC . After reading so many thumb down reviews, I couldn’t stop wondering, ‘is this remastered version that bad?’ So I decided to give it a try myself to see it through. Thought it would not be able to launch since my PC barely reaches the minimum requirements to play. It turned out ironically. I got in game with no issues at all. It runs perfectly smooth on my PC, my key binding was just fine and did not encounter any functional break down. The sensation of the mouse is not at its best but far away from horrible to control. It did not mix up with my controller either. My game did not crash once. I arrived Repture safe and sound. Honestly, I’ve tried to experience any issues players here had raged, but I had met none. The only fair point so far I’ve agreed is: This version doesn’t look that much different from the original. But I wasn’t in the right place to grumble this, since if the graphics were improved to the next-gen level, I probably wouldn’t be able to launch this game by any chance.The developers have my respect and sympathy. They’ve made products for the most of their customers (original game owners including me) for free, now they are rampaging. Their new potential customers now are wondering around because the game got mixed reviews, their decisions are uncertain.Honestly, I’d say: If you don’t own Bioshock franchise and would like to get them, this remastered version is definitely better than the original ones. At least, they’ve added steam achievements for Bioshock 1 and pretty fun museum exhibition mode in game. Of course, if it had trading cards and badges and creepy profile background would be brilliant, but maybe they will add it later, who knows? As someone received these 2 remastered games for free, I thank the development team’s efforts and 2K to bring them here. I am not a fangirl of Bioshock franchise, but I knew it is a masterpiece. I don’t play many FPS games, but it doesn’t mean they are not good because my personal taste isn’t there.Scarlet’s Score: 8.0/10(I haven’t got enough time to play this game till the end, so I can’t give exact the full review of the gameplay. However, for a timeless FPS known as Bioshock, an 8 point is fair to where it’s standard lies)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Formal Rating : 9/10User Rating : Superb plot,INSTABUYDate of the review : 05/26/2014 Bioshock.Well,i played BI first and then i tried this one,and i can clearly admit that i enjoyed this one way more than Bioshock Infinite.Why?Strongest plot,strongest gameplay.I loved every second of my playthrough.I couldn't stop pressing F12,i took like 60 photos,because in every room,there was something interesting.A corpse,a painting,a quote,you know,these kind of things.Plus,this game got its creepy moments too.For example dead corpses which are not really dead,Or rooms with creepy stuff like,toilets with not-so-much-light,or weird statuary.Anyway,lets continue on the details.Plot : 10/101960, and you're flying over the Atlantic Ocean. One mysterious plane crash later, you're floating in the water, apparently the lone survivor, surrounded by the flaming wreckage of the aircraft. But there's a lighthouse on a tiny island just at the edge of your view.Your only chance is to get there.and so you do.inside,you find a submersible called bathysphere,which only purpose is to get you into the void of the sea.You don't have a choice,so you pull the trigger,the door closes,and you get down...down..There you find a secret city,underwater,named Rapture.An underwater city created by Andrew Ryan,with her own rules,her own freedom.However,everything has gone completely wrong.The city is vandalised,destroyed,and deadly lunatics roam the paths of Rapture.Apart from the phreaks,little girls named ''little sisters'' who contain the corrupting substance called ADAM move through the city with their ''protectors'' ''Big Daddies'',some people with a huge armor. Gameplay : 9/10Character Customization.nope,i dont mean you can change your appearance,however,you can find ''magical powers'' which can be shot out of your fingers,elemental powers such as electricity,Ice,fire,wind,even BEES (no,not the bees).Those powers consume EVE(mana).You can use your powers to control your enemies against your other enemies,you can use them to gain control of machines such as turrets.Also,you got a variety of purchasable talents,which variety from Engineering,Physical,and Combat talents.each kind of talents got a different use,for example there's a physical talents which makes you swing your melee weapon faster.You start with 2 slots for every category of talents,and you can purchase more from a Gatherer's Garden .There are 8 types of weapons,1 melee,6 guns,and a camera,which doesnt deal any damage,however it is used to take photographs of your enemies,so you can learn more about them and find new methods of dealing with them.There are 3 types of bullets for every gun,the normals,the armor penetration ones (against machines and big daddies) and the Antipersonnel ones which are useful against lunatics etc. You are also able to find weapon upgrade machines,which will make your weapons more powerful.You can hack vents,safes,or even turrets to help you defeat your enemies.There are 2 types of ''money'' the normal money,and the consumable ADAM which give you new powers or slots or even higher health.ADAM can be used on a different kind of vent,the Gatherer's Garden.You can consume ADAM from the little sister,by either saving them(you will earn less,however everytime you complete a series of 3 ''rescues'' you will earn a surprise),or killing them.Finally,You collect audio logs which help you understand more whats going on.Graphics : 8/10I cant say i went crazy about the graphics,however Bioshock got some nice atmosphere.Controls : 8/10Easy Enough,however at the begining i got a little confused.Audio : 10/10Incredible voice acting,making the game stick greatly with the plot.Great soundtracks,but the thing i loved about the audio,is the music which plays when you rescue a little sister.its both beautiful and cute.

												I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said about Bioshock. The game is fantastic in all apsects: Story presentation, music, the enviroments, the diaries slowly feeding you information. Gunplay and plasmids form a strong FPS core without feeling overhwleming. Really, all I can complain about is that if I have to play one more ♥♥♥♥ing game of pipe dreams I will take a wrench to someone's face. But in the end, everything comes together to form something much greater than the sum of its parts: Rapture. When the Great Chain of Industry ties all of Bioshock together, will you have your hand upon it, moving forward, inexorably forward?Would you kindly put your hand on the chain?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Describing a bioshock game to someone is a very arduous let alone strange task. Telling them about the wonderful yet delapidated undersea city called Rapture, the megalomaniacal Andrew Ryan; creator of the city, the highly addicted (injectible) drugs that give you superpowers is a joy. However it continues, as you must talk about the addicted Splicers, the Big Daddies, the Little sisters, the numerous other characters you meet on your journey who have been affected by rapture differentley, the wonderful locations that are both interesting and dangerous. Or, you can just tell this ""friend"" of yours to stop asking so many questions about the game and to play it for themselves.10/10 - very good game. Now play it; Would You Kindly?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The soundtrack is awesome and make the game much more imersive and unique, since the music is produce for this game. For the gameplay, here it's a tip, please pay attention on the history, seek the speakers, look the cut scenes, because it's really really good. I saw some critics about the vita chambers but i don't complain. So, if you like FPS games, with some stealth system, and an incridible history you really need play bioshock, not just the one, but the franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most FPS's are bland slog fests, no fun, no colour, or vibrancy; just dull pieces of work. Bioshock, is able to capture the fun of running, and gunning your oponents down, as a game, and is able to succeed that as an art.Game wise, fairly standard assortment of guns, early to mid 1900's themed. Interesting twist yes? Now throw in rag-tag modifcations to guns, a plethora of different ammo that does everything from explode on impact to cause massive electrical damage. Then throw in almost supernatural powers, with a wide variety of character augmentations, to help you adapt to the changing environment. Want to run at 500% speed hitting people with a wrench in the back that freezes them solid, and you can become invisable- Bioshock has that.These augmentations to the self are not just a gameplay feature, they are a core feature of the games narrative. The game itself portrays a distopian underwater city, that, as you are forced to enter seemingly, without your own choice in the matter, forces you to see what has happened. It forces you to take on this role, and realise who the real villain of the situation is, who or what is the real monster behind sociatal collapse and anarchy. Everything in the game seemingly has a suitable purpose to back up a part of the narrative, and it works, because nothing is then ever out of place. The game is able to form a cohesive structure, that despite its debatable ending, creates a wonderful philosophical experiance.There are those that this game is a dumbed down System Shock 2, or even a console port that is meant for lesser gamers. But until we look at games in their individuality, we cant see the shine each one brings to the table. Bioshock, as a single product is simply an amazing game, that is a must own for any gamer.

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock then skip to Results and read from there.2K Games blows my mind with a phenomenal first person shooter that goes above and beyond to provide an incredibly experience. BioShock does something magical, beyond gameplay it the complete and total mind-♥♥♥♥. Story:A plane crashes in the middle of the ocean and you are the sole survivor. As you are swimming from the wreckage you notice a small tower standing. What does the tower offer, but the amazing city of Rapture. The underwater city is completely in ruins and everyone is completely mad, but why and how will you ever escape. As you maintain communications with one other sane person it is up to you to make sure you both can make it out alive. Campaign:The campaign occurs across a variety of different areas as you take pods to go between. Each area even has multiple zones within it which can either be cross very quickly or can take a long time. The difficulty scales brilliantly in this game, and you can go from Easy to Hard depending on the experience you want from the game. With multiple endings, depending on if you save all the little sisters or kill more than one. The campaign puts you to the test with an amazing story, secrets through the game, and multiple puzzles/challenges. The campaign is long and has fourteen levels, which vary in length and even include epic boss fights that put you to your wits. Gameplay:BioShock plays like a typical First Person Shooter in many ways, but mixes in elements of RPGs to give variety. You gain these abilities called plasmids which you can buy with Adam (a type of in game currency) that can give you spells or tonics which give you buffs. There are many different weapons which throughout the game you can upgrade to make the weapons more efficient. There are seven weapons (wrench, pistol, machine gun, shotgun, grenade launcher, chemical thrower, and crossbow) and a camera. Unlike in Dead Rising the camera in this game actually serves a purpose, making you stronger/more effective against enemies as you take more pictures.  I personally played this game on hard and used the wrench almost the entire time without plasmids, so you can really choose the way you want to play with BioShock; either running through guns blazing, or taking your time sneaking around. Results:BioShock is an amazing game that offers a brilliant campaign, beautiful story, and amazing gameplay. This game mixes RPG, Puzzles, and FPS all gift wrapped into one fantastic game. You can have an epic struggle playing the game on hard or just enjoy the story playing on easy. There are loads of secret recordings spread throughout the game that develop the story and keep offering you more. BioShock is completely worth every penny even at full price. If you are frugal like me, then just wait till it’s on sale as it totally will.Pros:+Brilliant story that provides incredible replay value.+Amazing combat system that allows you to choose how you play. (Either melee, guns blazing, or shooting magic everywhere)+Loads of guns that allow you to mix your strategy, each with three different ammo types.+A camera that allows you to increase your character strengths.+A solid campaign with fifteen different levels.+Secret recordings that give you more elements to the story and create a deeper experience+Loads of different tonics which allow you to buff yourself and enhance your gameplay experience+Loads of different plasmids that allow you to shoot electricity, fire, ice, and even bees. Cons:-The volume for the recordings cannot be adjusted, they use the same levels as the gameplay volume. (In order to hear the recordings I had to crank up my speakers and hide in a corner)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, would you kindly let me share my thoughts  on this game with you? (informative, objective and spoiler free) - It is an older game, graphics is not great, but still pretty decent.- You will get lost a lot. This may be +, since it is not as linear as most games nowadays, but it can get annoying. - Voice acting is not very well made- Subtitles are different than voice, so if you like to play with subs on, it can get confusing- NPCs have too few lines they keep repeating, which can be annoying... I used to be an adventurer like you... - You will save a lotIf you still keep reading despite those minor setbacks, here is why the game is awesome+ The story, despite being confusing at first, will be explained throughout this game with a few awesome nad unexpected plot twists.+ The world continues in newer games, that I recommend to play, too. So if you like this game, you have more to look forward to+ The atmosphere is well made+ The gameplay itself is great, and quite intuitive. The game mechanics are good, too.+ You choose how to play - melee or ranged? Traps and smart play or full out assault? Kill everything you see or spare some lives? (this is slightly taken into consideration for the ending sequence)+ I did not encounter any bugs or crashes, running on PC win7 64bit.There is one problem with this game when you ALT+TAB that a lot of people complain about. It can get stuck in window-mode. However, this can be easily fixed by pressing ALT+ENTER once or twice. So do I recommend this game? It is too old to pay full price for, but if it is on sale, yes, definitely. You will not regret it.Now, would you kindly make the purchase?  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're wondering whether or not to buy this game, then the answer is this: YES, ABSOLUTELY !Now, I don't normally like shooters and scary games, where your enemies jump at you out of the blue but the trailers and screenshots from BioShock have always appealed to me and I finally decided to go through with the purchase. This turned to be one of my best gaming-related decisions so far. From the intro, the game had me captivated. I immediately loved the atmosphere of Rapture, with its amazing art-deco architecture, and various locations (after all years since its release, the game still looks great), I could almost feel how it must have felt to walk in the shoes of the protagonists. This feeling was further enhanced by the music... Ohh yes, the music. Nothing builds an eerie atmosphere better than hearing a pleasant old-shool song, played as if from a vinyl disc, while exploring a blood-stained, ruined city. The game mechanics? Here, there is little to mention apart from the fact that it's a solid, well-balanced shooter with some RPG entwined in it. You;ll have plenty of weapons, plasmids and genetic upgrades along the game but when all is said and done, you will end up using your three favourites. Hacking mini-games get a tiny bit boring after some time, but you can easily skip some of them with the help of items found along the way.As far as graphics are concerned, I can only say that Irrational Games made wonders with Unreal Engine 3 and even now, even with almost minimum level of details, the game looks great.Storywise, as far as video games are concerned - it's a masterpiece. If you don't play BioShock, you're missing out on a great story. and that's notwithstanding the fact that after the main plot twist (somewhere aobut 3/4 of a game) the plot loses its momentum a little.Quick summary of advantages:+amazing design and atmosphere of Rapture+great soundtrack (music and voiceover alike)+easy to master, entertaining combat with many possibilities to take down enemies+brilliant storyline and memorable characters+the game graphics did not age muchSome disadvantages:-rubbish map, unintuitive journal (although you won't use the latter too much)-if you don't like it - can give you a jump sometimes-only a few types of enemies-some artificial limitations - money cap, no plasmid+weapon combo...One additional thought. If you're anxious that BioShock might be too scary for your tastes: don't worry. Just pluck up the courage and force yourself through the first two locations (like I had to :D) and from there, it will go al lot smoother. There are much fewer scary moments in the further part of the game and when they do appear, you will be able to predict them with ease.So, coming back to the start: play BioShock, enjoy the story. You won't regret it and the memory of Rapture will stay with you for long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am starting to write reviews for the games in my library and I declare this one as my first.  I will divide my reviews into three parts and a comments section to keep things standardized.  I will do my best to give candid and brief reviews. Bioshock Review(Story)Do you have a choice?  This is the question Bioshock asks.  The game takes place in 1960, in an underwater city called Rapture.  The city is falling apart as civil war rages among its citizens.  As a nameless protagonist (who winds up in Rapture due to an accident), you meet and help numerous people as you learn more about what happened to the city leading up to the war.  There are good and evil choices to make and multiple endings to the main story that reflect your decisions.  The dialogue is well written and voice acting phenomenal.      (Gameplay)Bioshock is a first person shooter with most combat taking place in close quarters areas.  You alternate between conventional fire arms and powers called ""plasmids"" that allow you to shoot electricity from your hand, throw objects, etc.  The weapons  have multiple ammo types/firing modes/uses that are acquired through upgrade stations.  Likewise, plasmids can be upgraded and all feel unique.  Multiple play styles are available: go in guns balzing, set traps for enemies to walk into, hack turrets so they fight with you, or take a stealth approach.  Ammo, health, and crafting supplies are acquired from looting or use of vending machines strewn about.  One mechanic the first two Bioshock games are known for is enemy research.  In Bioshock, research is accomplished through taking photographs of enemies and filling your research bar.  Every time you reach a new level of research, you gain a damage boost against that particular enemy.  Ammo can get scarce sometimes.(Design)The art-deco/1950's/1960's America decor are very well done here.  The advertisements, record player music, items, even the bottles all fit the time period. The game can get scary at times too due to the atmoshpere and noises you hear as you creep around.  Nearly every object has its own physics.  Glass bottles clink, suitcases float in the water, and fire leaves furniture (and enemies) charred.  The sound design is excellent, though I have an issue when gunfire starts where sounds cut out due to everything going on.                    (Final Comments)    As the first in the series, Bioshock is a great game with good controls, great writing, and one-of-a-kind atmosphere.  The twist of the story is legendary in my mind and the dialogue will leave an impression on you.  Now, would you kindly stop reading my review and dive into Rapture.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Describing a bioshock game to someone is a very arduous let alone strange task. Telling them about the wonderful yet delapidated undersea city called Rapture, the megalomaniacal Andrew Ryan; creator of the city, the highly addicted (injectible) drugs that give you superpowers is a joy. However it continues, as you must talk about the addicted Splicers, the Big Daddies, the Little sisters, the numerous other characters you meet on your journey who have been affected by rapture differentley, the wonderful locations that are both interesting and dangerous. Or, you can just tell this ""friend"" of yours to stop asking so many questions about the game and to play it for themselves.10/10 - very good game. Now play it; Would You Kindly?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After hearing so much about this game over the years, I finally caved and bought the Triple Pack, probably one of the best purchases I've made. The narrative is engaging, gameplay mechanics are well-polished and the graphics hold up extremely well for a game released in '07. Would definitely recommend to those who want a great story-driven FPS.Also, for those experiencing issues with the resolution when you alt+tab or whatever, just change it to something else in the options then back to what you want.

												Get yourself in a world of lunatics, in a big dark creepy city fully built underwater.Fight against insanity, claustrophobia, and  seriously crazy tern of events.This is game has very good graphics for its age. A small but sweet amount of weapons and 2 types of upgrades for each.Combine guns and special powers to burn your enemies, electrocute them, freeze them or fill them with holes from your specially crafted antiarmor bullets shot by a crazy looking 24-bullet revolver.Get through the world of Rapture, survive, hide and use hack and stealth mechanics or go on rampage mode and destroy and fry everything.Gather materials, craft stuff, research attack systems and special skills, upgrade your skills and weapons, choose your skills wisely and stay alive and sane no matter what.Beware of the enemy. Well designed AI for its time. Your enemies will seak ways to get wet if you light them up, they will seak places to hide, they will try to get themselves healed. They will swarm around you if you are not careful. And make sure to use any tech available to your benefit (hack turrets and cameras and make them friendly).There's no wonder why this game was so successful. Perfectly combine FPS action shooting with survival horror and a very good and interesting plot.Totally recommended and keep an eye for a complete franchise pack bundle!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said about Bioshock. The game is fantastic in all apsects: Story presentation, music, the enviroments, the diaries slowly feeding you information. Gunplay and plasmids form a strong FPS core without feeling overhwleming. Really, all I can complain about is that if I have to play one more ♥♥♥♥ing game of pipe dreams I will take a wrench to someone's face. But in the end, everything comes together to form something much greater than the sum of its parts: Rapture. When the Great Chain of Industry ties all of Bioshock together, will you have your hand upon it, moving forward, inexorably forward?Would you kindly put your hand on the chain?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll entertain you with a short story.I owned a PS2 when I was a kid. I only owned a couple of games, MLB '06 and a couple Guitar Hero games. Not a lot of real game games, y'know? I built my computer, this glorious, 1600 dollar computer that I put my heart and soul into. I got Steam, and my first sale was the summer sale this year.I saw the entire Bioshock franchise on sale for amazingly cheap prices, and of course I scooped them up. Bioshock feels like my first real game. It was my first real foray into gaming, my first real game. It's fantastic. The maps, the enemies, the narrative, the social commentary on the state of the gaming industry...it's all fantastic. It deserves its place on the lists of greatest games of all time.

This game is great, easily my favourite in the series and one of my favourite games ever!The gameplay is really fun and this is the most unique FPS ever. Plasmids are these things invented on Rapture and are great fun there are fire, ice, bee swarm and posess, combat is mixed between these plasmids, machines you can hack to help you and your guns and other weapons.It's set in the underwater city of Rapture and it is so beautiful even in the sate it's in. Splicers are people who got addicted to the plasmids and went crazy and you will see a lot of them throughout the game, just listening to them you can see how far gone they are.The story is really amazing about the rise and fall of Rapture, there are audio tapes that are actually really interesting if you take the time to listen and the BIG DADDY fights are great, you are fighting these huge things with drills for hands that just want to protect their little sisters in their eyes, splicers want to drain the sisters EVE to use plasmids by killing them, If you're not prepared these can kill you in seconds.The game lasts over 12 hours and not one part wasn't unique or frustrating.I would give this a 10/10, this is still one of my favourite games ever. Everyone should get this masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is first-person shooter action game developed by Irrational Games, 2K known as Boston / Australia in 2007.The game takes place in the 60s. The player, Jack survives a plane crash and reaches the underwater city Rapture found in decay. There he must fight against mutated humans and capture the substance called ADAM inside little girls called Little Systers that are defended by powerful Divers called Big Daddies. This substance will let the player acquire genetic improvements .Bioshock was really surprising because it created a whole new world with incredible narrative. history is noteworthy . Despite maps are not huge, they have superlative art and there are so many things to do that you never get bored . Combat is frenetic, there are turrets and machines to be hacked that provide ammunition and resources , there are also hidden resources and tonics to search that provide a remarkable range of combat.Instead of just owning guns, machine guns, etc. , we find tonics fire , electric rays, clouds of bees or many other forms of attack. This mixed mechanism was fairly new and fun at the time and it succeded on a very good game, Dishonored (2012), that took this concept and adapted it well .The game has elements of stealth, survival horror and role. It also has an important political component simulating an ultra-capitalist alternative world in a city where there are no ethical dilemmas and took to end the arts , science and engineering , which led to its decline .It is one of the top ranked games of all time . It has two sequels. The bioshock 2 showing an ultra communist character and Bioshock infinite that develops in an aerial city. In Bioshock infinite political, religious and scientific plot led to the end in a very elaborate story. It´s still a must have game in 2016.The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360. The windows version required DirectX 9.0c API.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bioshock es un videojuego de acción en primera persona desarrollado por Irrational Games, conocida como 2K Boston/Australia en 2007.El juego transcurre en los 60. El jugador, Jack, sobrevive a un accidente de avión y llega a la ciudad submarina Rapture que se encuentra en decadencia. Allí deberá luchar contra seres humanos mutados y capturar la sustancia ADAM de pequeñas niñas defendidas por poderosos Buzos llamados Big Daddies. Esta sustancia le perimitirá adquirir mejoras genéticas.Bioshock realmente sorprendió, ya que creó un mundo totalmente nuevo con una narrativa increible. la historia es digna de destacar. Si bien los mapas no son enormes, presentan un arte superlativo y hay tantas cosas que hacer que uno nunca se aburre. El combate es frenético, hay que hackear torretas y máquinas que brindan municiones y recursos, hay recursos ocultos para buscar y los tónicos brindan una variedad notoria al combate.En lugar de solo poseer pistolas, ametralladoras, etc, nos encontramos con tónicos de fuego, rayos eléctricos, nubes de abejas u muchas otras formas de ataque.  Este mecanismo mixto de combate fue bastante novedoso y diria que el muy buen juego Dishonored de 2012 tomó este concepto y lo adaptó muy bien.El juego posee elementos de sigilo, survival horror y rol. Además posee un importante componente político simulando una mundo alternativo en una ciudad ultracapitalista donde no hay dilemas éticos y se llevaron al extremo las artes, la ciencia y la ingeniería, lo que llevó a su decadencia. Es uno de los juegos mejor rankeados de todos los tiempos. Posee dos secuelas. El bioshock 2 que muestra un personaje ultra comunista y el Bioshock infinite que se desarrolla en una ciudad aérea y hay componentes políticos, religiosos y científicos  llevados al extremo en una historia muy elaborada. Es todavía un juego imprescindible en 2016.El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360. La versión de windows requería la API DirectX 9.0c			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While most certainly BioShock has a unique style of an Underwater City and that enthralling 50's-60's Jazz and Blues culture, the game is not ideal...   It makes some attempts to include philosphy, allusions and metaphors in it's story. However they meet a dead end. None of them are adequately explained and thus the story lacks a certain emotional meaning, espcially when it comes to the ""dilemma"" of saving the little sisters or ripping their hearts out both of which lead to two rather unsatisfying endings... I fell in love with the atmosphere and the setting, but I can't do more than just feel sad that it's just a shooter - and the shooting part feeling much more like Oblivion, the gunplay representing a very weak part of the game as a whole. Some of the Plasmids were cool, but once again - I found myself using only 2 or 3 for the most part since a lot of the abilities they give are just either ruled out by your playstyle or simply poorly balanced and totaly useless. The difficulty is also another issue. You litteraly have no need to put it on Hard more or Medium because you automatically respawn in a Vite-Chamber after your Hit Points are gone. What that means is that you don't have to use your health pack  -""First Aid Kits""because you can simply kill enemies through perseverance as it doesn't alter their health.  For this reason I found myself just rushing through the game on Easy, as the only thing that Medium and Hard consumes is your real-world time spent on the walkthrough. I definately advise you to try it, but not at full price. And definately don't expect a revolution - it has good voice acting, unique setpieces in it's narative - which seem to be painfully familiar with System Shock 2 and rather intriguing characters - yet it's far from perfect as critics claimed it to be...

												This game is an absolute classic with an outstanding story. Initially Bioshock has almost a horroesque feel but it quickly becomes an Action/FPS driven by your need to learn more about this crazy and breathtaking place called Rapture. There is a fair amount of exploration and dialogue to balance the combat and you owe it to yourself to play this game especially if you haven't had is spoiled to you yet since it is known for having one hell of an ending.

												All the elements of a great game come together here to make Bioshock.  The graphic style is highly creative and distinct from other games.  You are surrounded by an early 1900s feeling with music from the era and architectural elements of the era as well.  The characters are absolutely nuts in a bio-enhanced way and they aren't too stupid either.  They run away to get health, sneak up on you by crawling on the ceiling.  It's actually quite creepy because of the atmosphere and the characters (friend and foe) that you meet through your journey.  The story isn't wonderful throughout the game, but the beginning and the ending (or rather endings) is rather powerful and rewarding.  Check it out, I had loads of fun, though its not for the squeamish, especially when it comes to harvesting little sisters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock is more than just a normal first-person shooter. The combat system is innovative, the game design suits the late 1960s style of the story and the story itself is stunning. By combining classic shooter elements, short to long ranged weapons, and a lot of different skills this fps is quite innovative. The skills enable the player to develope his own playstyle, either forcing your enemies to fight each other, or being center of the combat and shock, burn or freeze them yourself, both is possible. In addition to this every weapon and skill is upgradeable at different vending machines. This brings me to another key feature of the game, hacking. Nearly every electronic device such as vending machines, safes, doors and security bots can be hacked. Nevertheless, the crucial element is the story. The story is set in the 1960s and takes place in the underwater city Rapture, where the player encounters different charackters, one being more crazy than the other. The game creates a dark atmosphere with moments of horror, which underline the plot. All in all, BioShock is still worth its money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Could not pass up the Triple Package Deal of all the Bioshock games for $10.00 during spring sale. What a freaking steal! In my book, Bioshock still holds up to other FPS of today and this game was released in 2007!After 13 hours of outragous game play (and still playing), what I say about Bioshock is A Twisted Macabre from the devs of Irrational Games. I expect to see Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney Jr. appear in this game.Creepy sounds. This must be played with a quality head set or booming speakers and yes, turn out the lights when playing.Love this game like a good spooky moive of the 1930's. A Macabre of a game! You must get when on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A single-player only, story driven First Person Shooter with an imaginative setting and story. It took me 29 hours to beat it on hard, first try, 100% completion. If you're not as... thorough... as I am, then you ought to be able to beat it in 15-20 hours or so.I'd rate it pretty highly.BioShock puts you in the shoes of a survivor of a mid-ocean plane crash. With no where else to go, you swim to a nearby lighthouse but... why is it there?The game was designed for consoles so this is a PC-port. If you use a controller, you'll be in good hands. If you prefer the mouse and keyboard, then you'll probably want to fiddle with the .ini files in order to ""fix"" the mouse control. To do this, run the game once, and close it. Now, navigate to your documents folder and find the ""AppData"" folder. It is hidden so make sure you are showing hidden files in Windows. You're looking for the folder: [username]\AppData\Roaming\BioshockIn there, you'll find a user.ini and a bioshock.ini file. In the user.ini file find/add the following lines: (you can change the MouseAccelThreshold to 1.0 if you'd like some acceleration)MouseSmoothingMode=0MouseAccelThreshold=0.0 In the bioshock.ini file find/add the following lines: (they appear twice each, so make sure to set both to false)CaptureMouse=FalseReduceMouseLag=FalseDoubleBufferMouseLag=FalseIf the game ever crashes on you (which it will if you alt-tab or if you use the Steam overlay too many times), then these two files will be overwritten with a default file (bye bye custom controls =/ )To circumvent this, make a copy of these two files after you set up your graphics/sound/control options. If the game crashes, relaunch it, close it, and copy your backup files over the existing user.ini and bioshock.ini files to quickly restore your settings.Anyways, once your mouse settings are good to go the gameplay is great, and the story is engaging. If you haven't played this game yet then you're missing out. Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First time ever playing it(even though been in games library for a few months lol) and I have to say it is a great game. Love the jump scares plus enemies are crazy(plus side in horror genre) and weapons are great. Plasmids(power-ups: bolt, incerate..etc.) are awsome to use especially when used correctly. Overall game is a 9 outta 10 for me and not 10 outta 10 because enemies are not the best AI's( they just run at you without thinking)  BAD CONKER  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic start to an amazing series. Gameplay quality is amazing and leaves an immense amount of replay value. I don't think there is one bad thing I can think about this game. I love how it just throws you into the game, you really just learn on your feet. There are so many combinations of weapons/powers that it fits nearly any playstyle and there will no doubt be one set that you will be comfortable playing with. The story of this is just simply amazing, it throws you into the story in such a beautiful way. I also very much like that what you do will affect what can happen later, it makes it that much more interesting in my opinion. 10/10. Forever 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Favorite game 1 million/10Even though I put the game down so many times because I did not want to relearn it, I still loved it. The tension in this game is so good not to mention the chills you feel searching these abandoned halls of a once wealthy dystopia. For once I see a shooter that has an amazing story and it shows how much lack lust things have become. This game might not be perfect but it did something games rarely do for me. It made me feel and that is odd when you don't feel anymore, it left me speechless if it can do that for me then it might do it for you as well. Now I was spoiled a little from a few YouTube videos on the storyline but it still even with spoilers had a huge impact on me like getting hit by a bullet train. Now the game play made my heart race, that never happens that function in my brain was broken a long time ago and it worked. The last time a game had this huge amount of an impact on me was fallout 3 mostly because I got to see my character grow up and left more questions about my virtual parents  than answers. This one if you do the good ending you actually feel like a hero. Now unlike many other games with more than one ending the cause for the bad ending is something that you know is wrong from the start, unlike other games that ask you to put the work into doing some long quest exploring the map and finding secrets, you know how to get the good ending from the beginning . The mechanics are a little tricky that's why I did not pick it back up I had to put it down because life happened and I did exactly what I did with portal 2 and forgot to finish the game.I am glad I did, I actually came close to tears but still I am speechless this game will forever have a long lasting impact on me.The game play reminds me of half life if half life had more of struggle with ammo and required you to know thy enemy rather than shoot thy enemy with gun and take his ammo. You must learn this new environment and all it holds conserve ammo and modify your genes to allow you to better fight against the enemy.Though a warning a lot of people are complaining that it does not work with newer hardware unless you tweak it a lot. But it's from 2007 usually games from 2007 have issues with newer hardware, but there is a remake coming but I don't think it will be better than this one. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game has a great story kind of linear but also with certain choices to change the story abit, there is also incredible art direction in this game if you like artwork this game will be a treat for the eyes.It takes place in a city called Rapture free of mans traditional ideals and it's built under the ocean and there are mysteries and horrors that await, you can modify weapons and it will alter the way they look which is cool also you get these interesting power ups known as plasmids they range from fire to telekinetic ability to turning foes against one another,hack vending machines and so on it even has some content you might miss the first time around i highly recommend you kindly buy this game but while it may have rpg elements dont expect something like fallout, if you ever played system shock 2 then you will know what i mean this is the spiritual successor of system shock 2 and a great one at that the story the gameplay and art and sound make this game a treat for those who appreciate a very story rich unique game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Great game, for its time I remember when BioShock first came out and me and my older brother were in awe at how amazing it looked as the plane crashes into the ocean and flames engulf your vision in that opening cut-scene, we thought that this was the best looking a video game would ever get.A lot of time has gone by since then, and we were wrong, However this game is still really good and has stood the test of time. This game has a great story that can be progressed even further with the use of the audio logs scattered around the landscape and the game play mechanics are still outstanding and unique to this day, the use of plasmids and lack of ammo makes for some very thought provoking moments.The roar of the Big Daddys coupled with the soft murmurs of dialog from the Little Sisters from another room evoke a feeling of fear as you remember the last encounter that left you with little to no ammo or eve. In this game you definitely feel like you are nothing and could just be destroyed by anything any second, and this is very rare for games to do these days and is a great thing to experience.BioShock excels at evoking feelings whether it be the sadness or regret of harvesting a little sister or the nice feeling you get when you rescue a little sister and she runs off after thanking you profusely. But this game is somewhat unforgiving to you if you are yet to decide which route you want to take. Spoiler-Free Tip If you want a good ending, do not harvest any little sisters. SAVE THEM ALL.I harvested two and I was considered evil by the games standards which is something that I found disappointing as I thought there might be a system that would tally a ratio of harvests to rescues but that is not the case.Just remember: SAVE THEM ALLThere are also a few game-breaking glitches where alt+tab'ing will sometimes mess with the resolution or make it crash, I also came across a bug where the game lost 3 hours or so of save-games so I was forced back, and the game also crashed on the final cut-scene forcing me to replay the last section.Definitely worth playing, even today, you might just want to change some controls but after that you're good to go.tl;dr: Great game, even for today's standards, a bit unforgiving, and a bit buggy. Tends to crash. Still really good!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome action-RPG game that depicts the downfall of a fantastic city submerged in the Atlantic Ocean. The founder didn't find himself in the political systems that are used to create society so he finds himself a spot where no man can claim it is his country or land: a submerged city. The protagonist arrives due some aeroplane crash...+ Great story+ Nice setting+ 'Easy' combat system- no movie/dialogue skipping			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good game. Pretty smooth gameplay, an interesting story with a few well done twists and, if you don't rush through it, the game can easily last over 8 hours. My few complaints are that less experienced  players (like myself) have to rely on Vita-chambers and constant healing if you play on harder difficulties and that the ending left a lot of questions unanswered but it was still an enjoyable ending. I recommend buying this if your looking for a nice story in a first person shooter. It is a must buy if it goes on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is a great game with a great story line. However I find that the steam version, despite trying some fixes to sort these issues out I find the game freezes then crashes a lot, whether this is because of the games age or not I find this makes the game playable for about 10 minutes before having to restart the whole game through steam. Because of these issues the game for me has become more of a hassle to play rather than a fun game to complete. I would recommend the game if you can get it to play without these issues but as I have found no fix yet I can't enjoy the game myself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

WARNING: Now, first of all, I do have to say (and this shall not detract from my overall opinion of the game in the review itself), I had TONS of trouble trying to get this darn game to work. I never got it to work on Windows 7, despite following all common proceedures (running compatibility modes and certain launch parameters etc.). And after a solid three days of trying to get it to work, and it still refusing to run, I then went to try and run it on a Windows 8 laptop, and hey-ho, it worked! So just a warning, purchasing this on Windows 7 may prove to be quite a bit of a gamble, unfortunately. I hear some people work it perfectly, while others, not so. Anyhow, the game was eventually working, and so our journey begins:-------------------------One of my main concerns with the the first Bioshock, upon purchasing the Bioshock Triple Pack was, ""Will it still hold up today, in 2015 - nearly 8 years after release - even after I  completed the near-flawless Bioshock Infinite, just a few days before?"". It's simple. The answer is: HELL YES, GOOD SIR/MA'AM.Rapture (now probably one of my favourite game settings EVER! (I still must play Stalker, mind you! :3)) captures your full attention from start to finish. If you're anything like me, and you find yourself intrigued by the prospect of dystopian societies (whether that be through: 1984, Terminator, Brave New World and whatnot), you will love Bioshock. The true nature of Rapture really shines through, with the presence of audio logs, scattered around the game, which provide tons of insight into the fascinating city, all on top of the brilliant linear story Bioshock presents.THE NARRATIVE: (9.99/10)I usually hate collectibles in games, seeing that they mostly provide little incentive, other than some measly achievement, or a disappointing extra cut scene. But Bioshock somehow makes it worthwhile! It certainly helps that it all has top-notch voice acting, lots of really interesting back-story in how Rapture came to be (and then not be), and also, if you listen carefully, great links to the overall linear story of the game. At first, the audio logs have an uncomfortable overall  aroma of optimism, despite you knowing what the city ultimately becomes. And the way in which you hear the people recording the audio logs progressively lose their minds is equally sad and unsettling. Even the enemies you gun down become somewhat sympathetic, despite Rapture essentially being a society whereby the smartest, the richest, and the cockiest are all clumped together underwater - all while forgetting any sense of moral values, that are thought to 'plague' the world above.In terms of the linear story, I will admit that it's major purpose is to build up to one 'twist', about 2/3 of the way through the game, and this is one twist that arguably could define the entire game, in terms of its legacy. For me, this twist was spoiled approximately 2.3 billion times before I actually played the game, but, I still enjoyed it nonetheless! As although it seems rather unremarkable and unpredictable, the context is everything. Not to mention the mind-blowing way it is delivered, and one that is sure to top some of my favourite ever moments in video games. Do try very hard not to get it spoiled though, that is, please don't research the plot on Wikipedia. You won't regret it. :) That all being said, unfortunately, don't be expecting any equally revolutionary ending of the game, as it is rather underwhelming and predictable. (Especially with a slightly out of place end-boss fight) Which is a huge shame! Although I do suppose Bioshock is often cited as one of the greatest games, with the worst endings.COMBAT/GAMEPLAY: (9/10)The combination of using plasmids (genetically modified, almost 'magic' abilities, that allow you to do various disgusting things with your hands), and weapons is quite fun. Although, it may initally appear a ""step-back"", for those that played Infinite first, like I did, or Bioshock 2 (although God Only Knows why you'd play that before the previous instalment), since those games allow you to use both weapons and plasmids at the same time. Whilst in Bioshock 1, you must use the right mouse button to switch between them. Do not fear, because you get quite used to it.'Bioshock' does have one thing going for it though, and that's the sheer variety of ways you can use its combat mechanics to your advantage. I still struggle to choose what I found most satisfying to do, but I believe there's probably a playstyle for just about everyone in the game somewhere. For instance, you'll often be found in a situation whereby there's a large group of enemies, and you have a whole arsenal of plasmids and weaponry to accompany you. You could just telekinesis the explosive barrels at a group of splicers, and ignite any remnants of oil on the floor to prevent them getting to you. Or you could hack into a disabled turret to help take them out for you, and set explosive and electrical traps to keep them at a distance. Maybe you just want to silently bash them over the head and freeze them solid? You got it. It's not quite Deus Ex, or Dishonoured, but it's probably about as close enough as it gets.One particularly interesting enemy was the highly memorable, 'Big Daddies', which I don't want to get into too much detail about. But oh boy, they're pretty tough. The Bouncer' quick reflexes, charges, and the shockwaves it unleashes make things really interesting, and it constantly keeps you on your toes. As you scurry around the surrounding area, thinking of ways you could make your life significantly easier at that very moment of time.  I have heard many complaints regarding the ammo and loot distribution being a bit unbalanced, especially further into the game, as some people believe that some of the tension is rendered a bit pointless when you're absolutely loaded with first aid kits and bullets. While I can see where those people are coming from, I personally didn't have much of a problem, as I often enough, found myself in situations where I had to conserve my ammo somewhat if I wanted to make progress. Mind you, there's probably room for improvement, but it didn't bother me that much. SOUND: (10/10)Moving on, sound design: PHENOMENAL. I really do dig games which evoke incredibly bone-chilling atmopsheres (eg: Dead Space, Metro 2033, Alan Wake). But I believe Bioshock to currently be my favourite of them all (again, I'm yet to play Stalker. :P). And a huge contributor to Bioshock's amazing atmopshere is the way sound is used to really amplify moments of tension: The distant shrieks, screams and complaints of splicers, the unforgettable stomps of the 'Big Daddies', the gurgling and gushing water, the creaks of the dying architecture of Rapture, and various other things... And when it's all combined with quite effective use of lighting, and a soundtrack that pays perfect tribute to the sheer insanity of Rapture's citizens: Bioshock becomes a masterpiece.  The game is not particularly 'scary' per say, but the atmosphere is built in such a way, you'll trick yourself into constant paranoia. And I loved every minute.CONCLUSION:I have no idea how I had not managed to get around to playing the Bioshock series sooner, but I can assure you, I've been missing out on a lot. Even if you're only remotely interested in the game/series, you should give it a good shot. The first game in particular will always stand up there with all my favourite games of all time. And in my humble opinion, masterpieces don't have to be absolutely perfect, and I am willing to forgive the few flaws I have found with Bioshock, because it is just that good. I think it's a masterpiece. And (apologies for the cliche'), a must-play.It's so tempting to give it a 10/10 overall, so I just think I will... Just excuse the ending? :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me tell you a story, I always wanted to play Bioshock but only recently decided to buy them after Infinite came out. I played this one and LOVED it. It's simply amazing one of my favourite games of all time along with Halo in the FPS genre. The story is just plain good and the recordings are a pleasure to listen to. Rapture looks like a living city and the asthetic is amazing with this steampunkish style. The sountrack is really good also, not one of the best I've heard but it really fits the ambience and the atmosphere of the game. I only have one complaint about it, the combat. The shooting and the mouse controls just feel abit clunky but maybe that's just me. None the less I am willing to put the combat issues I had apart because the game is just plain unique. If you ever hold on into playing it, I suggest you do it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: June 11, 2014
												Bioshock 1, the spiritual sucessor to System Shock and keeping most of the creepyness of its forefather intact. *SPOILERS PRESENT*Lets talk about the first thing we see in the game, the Graphics, the game just oozes with atmosphere and detail, when you walk around rapture you can see how people would live their lives, theres no randomly placed gap which would make you wonder how people got over it or why its there its modeled in a way that you'll walk around a place the same way you would if Rapture was real, and not falling apart, or have crazed looniees trying to kill you.That said there are a few low points about the graphics, some stuff feels VERY Copy and Paste, like i never enjoyed going into the bars because they felt too similar to each other, I might just be oblivious since I don't go to pubs in the real world but I would assume at least SOME differance also while I get this is meant to be a city that is collapsing from the inside but I think there is way too much grey around, its a typical gripe with FPS games in the last 10 or so years bit I still belive it to be a valid complaintNext the sound, Honestly I didn't find the music that good, thats not a bad thing though as the lack of music or the sound of old style music playing from old radios helps add to the atmosphere, I don't know if this is a glitch though but sometimes when there was alot of shooting and such random audio bits would cut off, a prime example would be when I fought the first ""boss"" of the game (not the Big Daddys) I had 2 Flying guns (Buzzers I called them) and a turret shooting at him, with an alarm going off and him shooting my buzzers, during the entire fight the turret and one of the buzzers would be shooting with no sound coming out, other times when grenades were thrown the Wistle sound would keep cutting out and starting back in, as I said it might be a glitch but still, Minor gripe, The voice acting is pretty well done as well though the lines are repeated a liiiiittle too much which can make the fighting a little grating to the earsThe Gameplay is your pretty solid run and gun kind of shooting game I played it on the hardest difficulty and I'm going to say right now, its too easy, the reason is because it is impossible to Game over unless your at the final boss, Got killed by a Big daddy? don't worry you respawned and the big daddy is at the same health it was when you died! it kills alot of that fear the game could have as your being hunter by a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off diversuit man and your down to your last sliver of health and EVE, While we're talking about Big Daddys and Difficulty its pretty dissapointing that on the case you have the Driller Big Daddy (Bouncer) but on the hardest Difficulty you face primarly Rivet gun Big daddys (Rosie) it doesn't help when actually the Rosies are easier to kill then the Bouncers, sure you can get two shotted by a Rosie but at least you can keep your distance and snipe them while dodgeing the bullts, I honeestly found fighting the Rosies the worst part of the gameplay and fighting the Bouncers one of the best, because your constantly back peddling from the Bouncer while he is slowing you and charging at you, one of my fondest memories in the game is when a Duel between me and one of the Few Bouncers in the game ended with us both killing each other when we charged at each other in Melee, Fondest memory with the Rosies? eh, taking control of them.So I'll talk a bit about the Plasmids too, to be honest they seem like a mechanic that wasn't fleshed out in time, I only ever used 3 Plasmids (except when the game forced me to use other ones to progress or for plot convinience) Shock, Big Daddy Hypnotise and the Swarm, Shock just so I could hack turrets, Big Daddy Hypnotise because it was fun and Swarm just so I could yell out ""NOT THE BEES!"" The Plasmids are just ""there"" I never had a reason to use them except of course For Fun, Hacking or Quoting Nicholous Cage (all of which worth it in my eyes, especially the last one) Outsid of that I pretty much felt there was no real use for them, No enemies weak to a certain Plasmid no Deus Ex style of using a Plasmid to get through a place. As for the Passive Plasmids again there was no real point in some of them, the only ones I generally wanted more of was the Hacking ones because as the game went on Hacking got so hard to the point where it was literly impossible to hack without a few hacking plasmids.So lets move onto the Hacking...Honestly it stars fun but it gets boring, like REALLY boring This was basically how my Hacking excitement went*Start of game*Sweet! i can hack these Buzzers and turrets to fight for me!*1/4 through the game*Well Lemmi hack this Vending Machine, Cause why not?*1/2 Through the game*urgh.....Boring*After the 1/2 point*Screw this, Autohacking tool!It just becomes so very dull that I was using my huge amounts of cash (Again because the game is too easy so i always had alot of cash) on Autohacking tools, and on the final chapter I just stopped Hacking the vending machines all together because it was so very very dullFinally the Story *AGAIN, SPOILERS*Honestly its a little bit all over the place but in a good way and ends mostly with closure, ok well except one, why the hell did your plane crash? but I digress the game does a good job at pacing the story up to the big Shyamalan style twist and makes Atlus a very beliveable friend which is all the more suprising at the end, Atlas as a character is a rather well developed character...untill near the end when he becomes Fontanie, he then spends the rest of the game mocking you from your com system and to degrade him even worse during the last hour I kid you not about an hour before you face him he suddenly becomes a spliced up looney, Personally that was weak because all it didn't feel like I was faceing the guy who set me up, i just felt like I was facing another Splicer Alibet a newer one, I would of liked a good ol fasion Gun duel and before you beat him he THEN pulls out a new plasmid he made to turn him into what he is to try and get the edge.Overall Bioshock is a well made game and has alot of atmosphere, gunplay, and likeable characters, the things I don't like about it though is how the main villian becomes a Splicer loony like the rest of Rapture, The hacking gets VERY boring and because you can only game over at the final boss its very VERY easy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												so you wonder if you should buy this? well this is one of those games that defined a generation of games lots of games of the last generation was influnced by this great game. This game has a great story kind of linear but also with certain choices to change the story abit, there is also incredible art direction in this game if you like artwork this game will be a treat for the eyes.It takes place in a city called Rapture free of mans traditional ideals and it's built under the ocean and there are mysteries and horrors that await, you can modify weapons and it will alter the way they look which is cool also you get these interesting power ups known as plasmids they range from fire to telekinetic ability to turning foes against one another,hack vending machines and so on it even has some content you might miss the first time around i highly recommend you kindly buy this game but while it may have rpg elements dont expect something like fallout, if you ever played system shock 2 then you will know what i mean this is the spiritual successor of system shock 2 and a great one at that the story the gameplay and art and sound make this game a treat for those who appreciate a very story rich unique game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay is very interesting you can find all sorts of treasures and kill whoever you want and of course to proceed you have to do missions plus there is a twist which will blow your mind as well :D! I recommend this FPS game it's very fun and it doesn't get boring 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is one of those games you can't help but to put in a category all by itself. It is not just an FPS, it is a narrative driven game where the story will take center place, and where the gameplay just seems to be the addition to that same story. I can't tell the plot without spoiling it to anyone, but I will tell you this, it is a story so good, with plot twists that will blow your mind, that at some point Universal Pictures was going to produce a movie based on it. The whole game world sucks you in, you explore an underwater city called Rapture, after your airplane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean... and literally nothing in this game, story wise, is as it seems. I was really impressed with this AAA story, and if you like games that are not just about blowing stuff up(which Bioshock also has in spades) you will be looking at your screen in awe as you reach the end of the game. The story is simply put, phenomenal. Gameplay wise, Bioshock offers a lot of freedom. You have your standard weapons, like a machine gun, a grenade launcher and a Pistol, each with 3 different ammo types. This plays a key role in battle, as some ammo is more efficient in dealing with certain types of enemies. You also have access to a camera, allowing you to take pictures of your enemies to discover their weaknesses, and it is a really useful tool. On top of the weapons, you have Plasmids. Plasmids are genetically created abilities that allow you to deal even more damage to your foes. You have Winter Blast which freezes your enemies which you can then dispose of with a shotgun blast for example, Electro Bolt which deals electricity to your enemies and hostile machinery, and quite a few others. The plasmids are what makes your approach to battles more fun. You can use them in any way you see fit, and this is what truly makes the combat in this game stand out. You have near infinite possibilities to dispose of your foes, and combined with your tonics, (upgrades that allow your character to get stronger and allow certain actions in the game a lot easier) you can become a true killing machine. The AI in the game is quite impressive as well, with enemies running away when hurt, and looking for health stations to heal. These are some of the most challenging enemies in a video game I have ever encountered, and they will keep battles fresh and exciting. There is so much more I could say about this game, but the essential is this: Bioshock is one complete game package. The story is amazing, the gameplay is perfect and revolutionary, the music fits the action nicely, and even the graphics are really good, for a game with a few years. Bioshock is in my opinion, one of the best games ever made, and for the price you pay, you will be getting a game experience you will never forget.The Good-Amazing Story, it will mess with your definition of morality-Gameplay is fine tuned to perfection-The Plasmids offer a freedom in combat that is uncommon in FPS/RPG hybrids-Combat requires a cautious approach due to the ammo types in all weapons, simply point and shoot won't get you far-Art style is phenomenal, the city of Rapture has a very Art Deco feel to it-Characters in the game you actually care about(for the better and the worse)The Bad-Nothing I can think of, it is really close to perfection9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Would recommend this game without thinking twice!!I bought this game because all three were on sale. I had no idea what this game was about, just saw FPS and thought Great another shooter that I'll never complete. I was so wrong. The game has so many elements to it - which at first seem tough, but they give such a different playing experience. It's suspense with an edge that just makes you keep playing. After completeing this one I cannot wait to play the other ones! A definite buy to anyone who hasn't.It may sound cliche but 10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is definitely a gem in the Steam Punk genre. While the storytelling could have been better, the game design was focused on pulling the player into an undersea world that remained frozen in a 1950's New Yorkian era. A lot of graphic detail went into making the player feel they were walking through the remnants of a once-great undersea empire.Unfortunately ... Playing this game made me feel like a Jedi Padawan stranded on the Titanic at the bottom of the atlantic looking to get his next fix while a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sith and Probe droids were running amok.

												This game is an absolute classic with an outstanding story. Initially Bioshock has almost a horroesque feel but it quickly becomes an Action/FPS driven by your need to learn more about this crazy and breathtaking place called Rapture. There is a fair amount of exploration and dialogue to balance the combat and you owe it to yourself to play this game especially if you haven't had is spoiled to you yet since it is known for having one hell of an ending.

												This is without a doubt the best psycho-social simulator of libertarianism in fantasical undersea worlds. Sure, the part where you have to murder normal capitalists is off-putting to my contrived 1950s communist-hating morality, but I get it, it's a game.I don't get it, sometimes. But then again, I'm a man who thinks that magic comes from hats, not from BS like ""DNA"" and I know for a fact that sea slugs aren'real.Don't believe me? Go find a slug. I'll wait. But once you do, put a little salt on it. The slug will die. Sea water, as well all know, is salty, because communists cry into rivers at night to poison the great oceans to keep us from drinking them and solving the problem of global hydration!So, sea slugs? That's the least believable part of this game! I also got mad when the game suggested that there were no gods, which is a blatant lie, because duh, Marduk, the bull-calf of the sun-god Utu is real! OBVIOUSLY!This game also put out one of my eyes. I still recommend it. The game, not the eye. The eye was bad. That's why this game knew to put it out. It's  a good game like that. Blasphemous, sure. Unwilling to appeal to your own sense of oligarchical supremacy? Sure. But a good game, nonetheless. I think that we should go back to the system where the man who fought the most bears was king, but T. Roosevelt killed all the bears, so the closest thing these days is playing Bioshock.

												A very good game. Pretty smooth gameplay, an interesting story with a few well done twists and, if you don't rush through it, the game can easily last over 8 hours. My few complaints are that less experienced  players (like myself) have to rely on Vita-chambers and constant healing if you play on harder difficulties and that the ending left a lot of questions unanswered but it was still an enjoyable ending. I recommend buying this if your looking for a nice story in a first person shooter. It is a must buy if it goes on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So I purchased all the Bioshocks ( even System Shock) . Bioshock is a twisted sick type of game.

												“Happy we'll be beyond the sea, And never again I'll go sailing.”	Oh Bioshock. What is there I can’t say about it? Arguably one of the greatest games and narratives of the twenty-first century, the game merges all there is that exemplifies the first person shooter, but also mixes in aspects of grandiose utopian-turned-dystopian society with its own unique culture you discover on your own. Because of all of these elements, it’s no question that Bioshock could be easily, and is, considered a modern masterpiece.	Developed and produced by 2K Games, BioShock was released in the summer of 2007 and caused a stir in the industry. Up until that point, first person shooters were a primarily guilty-pleasure game about going online and just shooting people for the heck of it. BioShock, however, changed this system by doing away with multiplayer aspects (until BioShock 2, of course) and instead focused on the player’s environment and the experiences this environment yielded, which were innumerable by the conclusion. By featuring an extensive pseudo-open world environment that slowly explained itself through plot elements and self-discovery, Rapture enraptured you (pun intended) with its beautiful natural surroundings in stark contrast to its crippled ruins of a once great society.	Your character, solely named “Jack”, wakes in the ocean after a plane crash that left him as the sole survivor. After swimming around and out of the debris, you come across a mysterious lighthouse, into which you proceed. You then enter a miniature submarine, which in turn takes you deep below the sea and finally to Rapture. A once grand society that was built upon the dreams of the 1940’s business tycoon Andrew Ryan in order to escape the dangers and restrictions of the Cold War, Rapture is found to be overrun by mutated men and women that kill anything that moves (a result of genetic “splicing”), bandits and thieves, and Big Daddy’s accompanied by their Little Sisters, whom in turn once provided the society with its fueling for genetic experiments. Through twists and turns, fights and discovery, and arguably one of the greatest plot twists of gaming history, Jack discovers himself as a person, his mysterious past, and the dark secrets that lead to Rapture’s inevitable demise. With memorable characters that describe the city and its populous through their actions, BioShock provides lasting memories and thoughts for anyone that cares to explore it.	As for the game itself, the action is consistently entertaining and serves to keep you busy at all times. Through its addicting combat and evolving story one can easily dunk a good four hours into a single sitting and even still not find themselves halfway through the narrative. With several weapons, the action can be dynamically changed with a single button press and create a more diverse combat scenario. Likewise, with a countless supply of genetic powers named Plasmids the player can fully manipulate themselves, the environment, and even their enemies. The Plasmid system itself was revolutionary of the genre, by producing a sense of combat that doesn’t just revolve around blasting people to bits with shotguns and rockets, but instead using your own body to do the same thing, but in a flashier way.	Regarding technicalities and faults, I only have really minor complaints about the game as a whole. First off, the hacking system (in which the player hacks into devices and provides access to machines) is the most commonly addressed flaw in this game. By forcing the player into taking themselves out of the combat and playing a simplistically boring puzzle game the game breaks its greatest strength: immersion into the environment. My only other real complaint is the mission system, where it almost feels repetitive. Go grab this, kill these people first, take pictures of these, kill these people first, etc. While still fun and well executed, the game can slowly get repetitive, but right when it becomes noticeable the story changes once again and restarts this cycle, cleaning the slate and making it fun once again. The Rundown	Overall, BioShock is by no means a perfect game, but essentially there is no such thing. What one finds amazing, another can find boring, however BioShock provides an experience that anyone, even those that don’t enjoy shooters, should give a shot (yes, pun intended again) due to its grotesquely beautiful environment, contemptibly loved characters, and immoral wonders that serve a testament to the human race even now that reigns supreme as my favorite game to this day.Pros: -Amazing story and environment-Wide variety of combat scenarios-Vivid and complex linear/pseudo-open world Cons:-Slowly repetitive aspects-Them hacking games thoughThe Rate: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is a first-person, sci-fi, fictional shooter where you take the role of Jack, a normal person at the beginning of the game soon to become one of the most iconic figures in both this game and the entire Bioshock series. You must traverse the underwater so-called ""paradise"" of Rapture, where those who dwell in it are free from religious criticism against their own ideas, free from the restraints of government, and are free to pursue their own ideals, to take down the rebellious tyrant Frank Fontaine.I have to admit, when I first started playing this game back in 2010, I had my doubts. Why? Because for me, violent videogames wasn't so much my cup of tea, in fact, back then I never really played violent videogames; I usually played Mario. But after playing this game twice, TWICE, both on PC in 2014 and PS3 of 2010, this game has made me a huge fan of the Bioshock series because the story is insanely rich, dark, driven, and deeply fulfilling, packed with violence, betrayal, and revolution. And the entire setting in general: an underwater city, who ever thought of that? You can think of Atlantis, but heck, not this one!To start off, the start of the game where you're in the plane seems to bring about curiosity as to what this game really is about, because you can look at the front cover of the game and say, ""Hey. It's a man in a diving outfit, and he's with a little girl. Well that's pretty cool."" However, I usually say that covers can be illusions to what lies behind, and for Bioshock, this is 100% correct. Already do you crash land in an ocean somewhere off the North Atlantic ocean, near Iceland, swim to some very imposing and unknown, yet beautiful and intricate, building, enter inside, go into a bathysphere (a ship-thingy), and already you're in Rapture. What better way to already jump into the dark, underwater ""paradise"" then crash-land, swim, then witness the city first-hand through a metal sphere?Now, aside from that, Bioshock is a first-person shooter, and it does that well. However, what makes this game unique in it's POV is that you fight with genetic weapons called Plasmids, made from a genetic resource known as ADAM, which serve as your primary utility throughout the game. Rather than say, ""Okay, this guy's got magic for some reason,"" you can say ""The guy's a severely altered, genetic freak, so kick your heels and run!"" It's interesting to see a game where the magic is the result of genetic mutations and self-splicing alterations rather than some natural, innate gift because it really brings about that gruesome background of the game... and teaches kids why you shouldn't use drugs.Anyways, the story, damn! I played this game four times and not once did I get bored with the story. It is huge, and while repetitive, it is great, and it never dries up, it never goes dull, and it always stays alive. The whole foundation of the game itself is heavily dependent on its story because it is the story that sets the game in a momentous rhythm that will leave you wanting more. From how Rapture fell during the Civil War of 1959, to the remains and its genetically-altered denizens and future impact is so well woven and produced that I could not imagine a better game story that can compete against this one.The enemies in this game that you fight against are very creative, different, genuine, and, of course, unique. Big Daddies,   altered humans in diving suits who have been heavily spliced and grafted into their suits are a true challenge to face, but enjoyable to fight against. Splicers, possessing different types of abilities through the overdose of ADAM and Plasmids, makes the game more intense as you have to come up with different ways to fight them off or run away.Truly, the best thing about this game is the entire environment and setting itself. When I saw Rapture through my own TV screen for the first time, I thought that this was perhaps the most amazing creation in a videogame I've ever witnessed. An underwater city that isn't a utopia, has a different name, and can no way be related to Atlantis really brings about the unique quality of Rapture and makes it stand preeminent amongst all other underwater myths. While shocked, I was also awestruck by Rapture's own beliefs and ideals set forth by its philosophical leader Andrew Ryan, because normally, people would just create a history for a city, but this is a whole new level of ""history,"" filled with insanity and dark athmospheres.Overall, all I can say about this game is:🐅Snowy's Scorey🐅:10: Masterpiece, highly recommended to play9: Truly brilliant, recommended at its best8: Okay, will recommend7: Decent, will recommend, but within certain limitations6: Average, probably not worth recommending, but at least looking at5: Meh, some things are right, some wrong, but not complete4. Um.., not sure if this game is up for grabs3. Not worth buying2. Not worth looking at1. Quarantine yourself from this gameAlthough the graphics are not exactly perfect, who freaking cares? The game itself is a masterpiece, with a heavily-driven story, cool combat mechanics and environment, and the lavish and beautiful setting of underwater Rapture. Buy this game when HD Remastered comes out in September because I can guarantee you this game will be amazing. The game is definitely worth the price, and it is entertaining all around.

												A classic that I've never played before it's steam release and I'm here to say it's still worthy of most the praise it gets.I'll keep it short.GOOD+Story is fantastic. Many hours of gameplay for a single player game. Even has replay value.+The FPS elements are great. Using different guns and abilities to take out your enemies doesn't get stale.+The RPG elements aren't perfect but can really change the way you play, especially when you start upgrading.+ Even though through most of game the tension is high and it can be downright scary at times, it was never grotesque or resorted to jumpscares to shock you.+ Difficulty modes. The game might be a bit overwhelming at first but is actually rather easy when you get used to it. But being able to increase the difficulty on subsequent playthroughs solves that problem.+ Though the visuals might have aged somewhat, I got totally emersed in them.NOT SO GOOD- Controls aren't optimal and is part of the overwhelming start. Switching weapons, powers and ammo doesn't get smooth until you learn to just deal with it.- The Hacking minigame, like in most other games, is too boring and occurs way too frequently. Almost every camera and turret in the game needs to be either hacked or destroyed to progress. And since conserving ammo is quite a big deal, hacking is the best choice but also the most boring one.-Though survival and conserving your ammo are elements of the game, expect to blaze through on easier difficulties after you get used to the enemies and such. (Big Daddies are Big Babies, no really)- The final araes of the game take a looong time. This might be a good thing to some, but it feels stretched and a little disjointed from the rest of the game. Making the ending overall a bit weak compared to all you've done to get there.So step right up and get yourself a ticket to Rapture, because this game is totally worth playing! Especially if you've become a fan of the Bioshock series because of it's more recent installments!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is my favourite FPS game. I wanted to play it to do a 3rd walkthrough just recently, but for some reason I could not make it run on Windows 7. I know there are some bug fixes, tweaks out there, but eventually, I decided not to bother with them. Initially, I played this back on XP and also on Vista as some of the effects required DX 10.What makes Bioshock a unique FPS game is its atmosphere. The protagonist finds himself in an underwater city called Rapture after an airplane crash which was meant to be a sanctuary, a safe haven from the atrocities of the world by its creator, but right at the beginning you quickly realise something went awry as almost all the inhabitants of this marvelous city want to kill you. And also each other. These residents are all obsessed with ADAM, a substance found deep under water. Or more like a substance that was extracted from slugs found in the dark, cold abyss. This substance grants its user superhuman powers, powers that are just like magic: you can set things on fire, you can grab and throw objects at your enemies, you can control machines etc. Clearly, humanity's greed got the better of it, again, as it seems everybody is set out to grab more and more ADAM to seize power. And what are those huge fellows called Bid Daddies who wonder around in thick armor escorting (protecting) little children (girls) who are characterised by two things: they have a huge syringe in their hands and their eyes are glowing.The game offers you conventional weapons found in any other FPS games but makes it more interesting as you have various types of bullets available at your disposal. And while you hold your weapons in your right hand at the same time you can cast your spells with your left hand. You can also hack things so that you can purchase items at vending machines with discount and in case you hack turrets or sentry bots you can quickly get some allies. In order to use your Plasmids (spells) you are required to get some EVE (similar to mana in many RPGs). It is inevitable  to fight Rapture's monstrous creatures called Big Daddies to get some ADAM with which you can purchase new Plasmids (or the better version of the one you already have).It's worth checking every room, every corner in Rapture as you can find some hidden treasures. Notable are the audio logs that expand upon the background story and you can get to know the main characters of the city better and also understand what their agenda is. The game has morality choices, too: although you fight Big Daddies the very reason you want to defeat them is to get close to the little girls they protect. You extract ADAM directly from them and you can decide whether or not you want to let them live. This means you can have two endings at the game.The game has a superb art design and lovely music. Its atmosphere can be creepy, scary at times and exploring Rapture is a fun experience between fierce battles. This is highly recommended to anybody out there who loves the FPS genre; bear in mind, though, that the game has issues with Windows 7 so it's best to look for the solution beforehand.

												I played this game on the xbox 360 when it first came out, and I had an absolute blast.  A really neat and original storyline in a nice looking FPS package.The use of plasmids (elemental weapons) as a change-up from your regular guns was a welcome difference compared to every other FPS out there.For a game that came out almost 6 years ago, it's still one of my absolute favourites.  It can get a bit repetitive with the enemies, and it could use a few more weapons (found myself almost always using the machine gun or shotugn exclusively with the electro plasmid) but it held my attention for almost 30 hours so far and it keeps going.  Some minor glitches happen with the steam overlay but like I said, minor.Do yourself a favour and try out this game.  It's not the most beautiful, but it's a fun and engaging story.  And then go try Bioshock 2 and Bioshock Infinite!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is a marvel.A truly amazing, very tightly-paced linear shooter that has, to me, the greatest introduction to the world and backstory of any game, bar a few. The shooting mechanics are not innovative, but very streamlined and well executed.In my eyes, nothing about this game is wrong. NOTHING is objectively BAD about this game.The game is definitely one of the best case studies for being an all-round, GREAT video game.This DOES NOT mean the game is the BEST at everything it does.Irrational has made a blend of amazing plot, a foreboding, compelling world, and solid game mechanics to create not THE BEST GAME EVER MADE , but truly a FLAWLESS one.12/10 - Arbitrary Number			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

~ We all make choices, but in the end, our choices make us. ~I played BioShock once on the PS3 a few years back and I remember not loving it that much. I really liked the first half, but I found the second half to suffer from pacing issues. Flashback to a few weeks ago and my backlog was running dry, so I decided to replay it, this time on PC. And you know what, I'm not sure why I didn't love it the first time around, because this is one incredible game. It nails pretty much every aspect you'd want in a game. The setting is nothing less than brilliant, Rapture looks visually stunning and it never gets old, the atmosphere is absolutely stellar and the creepy 30s music give it a sinister feeling, the story and characters are really something else and the gameplay is very diverse and encourages experimentation. But the best thing about BioShock is how fleshed out Rapture feels, especially when you replay it and you keep noticing new things that you didn't see or hear the first time.  In terms of story there's so much lore in there it's almost ridiculous, if anything it's overwhelming at first. I'm not going to tread into spoiler territory, but only in subsequent playthroughs do things start to make sense, which really adds to a city that already feels so alive.+ Excellent visual design, Rapture looks absolutely gorgeous.+ Haunting and claustrophobic atmosphere with creepy music from the 1930s.+ Very tense and sometimes even scary at points.+ Ridiculous amount of background information and lore.+ Very solid, fun and diverse gameplay, lots of play styles and experimentations possible.+ A lot of memorable and varied characters.+ Pretty much perfect voice acting from everyone involved. - A few technical issues here and there, some crashes and freezes when loading a new area.- I didn't like the last playable level (Proving Grounds. There were barely open areas to explore which made all the other levels so much fun, it was basically a straight line to the final battle.- The endings (both good and evil) felt too rushed and, even though satisfying in a way, it doesn't feel fleshed out whereas the main game definitely feels fleshed out.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've come across the game after finishing Bioshock: Infinite and before playing DLC, I just wanted to keep the things right:) And you know what? With the same love for B:I I can say, this game is simply marvellous! Its graphics look descent even after 7 years after the game's release - that's how the games should be developed. The story itself is so powerful and involving that you won't need any efforts to push yourself to continue the game, as it won't simply free you until you finish it:) And even more - it won't free you ever again, I am pretty sure that after the game you'll go and buy Bishock2 and so on and become the dedicated fan of the universe as I did.I am really glad that it took a long time for me to get to the Bioshock series, as now, when most of new games are mostly trash and nonsense, I have a valuable game to play, with deep story, cool (never ever seen anywhere else before) gameplay, solid replayability and uprocking visuals. Thx to the devs!Summary: 10/10 without a hesitation!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This GAME!!! I shied away from it for a long time as I detest most shooter type games feeling that good suspense and horror is based on story and powerlessness of the main character.... But I was wrong! Not only is this game thick with well written themes, the gunplay is actually fun and doesnt wreck the rest of the game by consuming it with points, getting kills, or other such nonsense. The main character survives a plane crash only to find himself in some sort of underwater 'utopia' built by a man of science and industry. But as our main character discovers quite quickly, things have gone very wrong down in Rapture and he will be lucky to get out in one piece. Beautifully rendered using Art Deco motifs and music from the 1950s, this game is imaginative, brilliant, fun and I honestly cannot think of a single problem with it. It plays smoothly and without a glitch on my 300$ Del laptop. If you have not had the pleasure of discovering this game, do yourself a big favor and get it! Absolutely awesome~ 10/10 for game play, writing, graphics, sound and overall feel of the game in general.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely remarkable, In terms of the emotions you will experience, the plots twists you go through and the bold characters you encounter. It is essentially a morality game and so it forces you to make crucial decisions of which both effect you, the outcome of the game, characters around you and most importantly the power you will possess. Everything in Rapture is destroyed with mere intentions that just go wrong, leaving a dystopian world of chaos and greed. Ever character appears to be what they are because of rapture and their involvement with it, therefore, no one is technically 'evil' just flawed on different levels. Probably the standout element of Bioshock is the ability to modify your genetic make-up to develop new weapons and abilities - for instance, early on you gain the ability to fire lightning bolts from your hands, which can then be used on a simple level to stun enemies, rendering them more vulnerable to a solid whack with the wrench, or on a more strategic level to electrify water and take out multiple enemies, fry electrical devices, or enrage the Big Daddies and goad them into attacking other bad guys. Later on you can adopt more macabre plasmids, like the ability to fire swarms of bees, and passive skills like the power to tap into electronic devices. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This GAME!!! I shied away from it for a long time as I detest most shooter type games feeling that good suspense and horror is based on story and powerlessness of the main character.... But I was wrong! Not only is this game thick with well written themes, the gunplay is actually fun and doesnt wreck the rest of the game by consuming it with points, getting kills, or other such nonsense. The main character survives a plane crash only to find himself in some sort of underwater 'utopia' built by a man of science and industry. But as our main character discovers quite quickly, things have gone very wrong down in Rapture and he will be lucky to get out in one piece. Beautifully rendered using Art Deco motifs and music from the 1950s, this game is imaginative, brilliant, fun and I honestly cannot think of a single problem with it. It plays smoothly and without a glitch on my 300$ Del laptop. If you have not had the pleasure of discovering this game, do yourself a big favor and get it! Absolutely awesome~ 10/10 for game play, writing, graphics, sound and overall feel of the game in general.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is a first-person, sci-fi, fictional shooter where you take the role of Jack, a normal person at the beginning of the game soon to become one of the most iconic figures in both this game and the entire Bioshock series. You must traverse the underwater so-called ""paradise"" of Rapture, where those who dwell in it are free from religious criticism against their own ideas, free from the restraints of government, and are free to pursue their own ideals, to take down the rebellious tyrant Frank Fontaine.I have to admit, when I first started playing this game back in 2010, I had my doubts. Why? Because for me, violent videogames wasn't so much my cup of tea, in fact, back then I never really played violent videogames; I usually played Mario. But after playing this game twice, TWICE, both on PC in 2014 and PS3 of 2010, this game has made me a huge fan of the Bioshock series because the story is insanely rich, dark, driven, and deeply fulfilling, packed with violence, betrayal, and revolution. And the entire setting in general: an underwater city, who ever thought of that? You can think of Atlantis, but heck, not this one!To start off, the start of the game where you're in the plane seems to bring about curiosity as to what this game really is about, because you can look at the front cover of the game and say, ""Hey. It's a man in a diving outfit, and he's with a little girl. Well that's pretty cool."" However, I usually say that covers can be illusions to what lies behind, and for Bioshock, this is 100% correct. Already do you crash land in an ocean somewhere off the North Atlantic ocean, near Iceland, swim to some very imposing and unknown, yet beautiful and intricate, building, enter inside, go into a bathysphere (a ship-thingy), and already you're in Rapture. What better way to already jump into the dark, underwater ""paradise"" then crash-land, swim, then witness the city first-hand through a metal sphere?Now, aside from that, Bioshock is a first-person shooter, and it does that well. However, what makes this game unique in it's POV is that you fight with genetic weapons called Plasmids, made from a genetic resource known as ADAM, which serve as your primary utility throughout the game. Rather than say, ""Okay, this guy's got magic for some reason,"" you can say ""The guy's a severely altered, genetic freak, so kick your heels and run!"" It's interesting to see a game where the magic is the result of genetic mutations and self-splicing alterations rather than some natural, innate gift because it really brings about that gruesome background of the game... and teaches kids why you shouldn't use drugs.Anyways, the story, damn! I played this game four times and not once did I get bored with the story. It is huge, and while repetitive, it is great, and it never dries up, it never goes dull, and it always stays alive. The whole foundation of the game itself is heavily dependent on its story because it is the story that sets the game in a momentous rhythm that will leave you wanting more. From how Rapture fell during the Civil War of 1959, to the remains and its genetically-altered denizens and future impact is so well woven and produced that I could not imagine a better game story that can compete against this one.The enemies in this game that you fight against are very creative, different, genuine, and, of course, unique. Big Daddies,   altered humans in diving suits who have been heavily spliced and grafted into their suits are a true challenge to face, but enjoyable to fight against. Splicers, possessing different types of abilities through the overdose of ADAM and Plasmids, makes the game more intense as you have to come up with different ways to fight them off or run away.Truly, the best thing about this game is the entire environment and setting itself. When I saw Rapture through my own TV screen for the first time, I thought that this was perhaps the most amazing creation in a videogame I've ever witnessed. An underwater city that isn't a utopia, has a different name, and can no way be related to Atlantis really brings about the unique quality of Rapture and makes it stand preeminent amongst all other underwater myths. While shocked, I was also awestruck by Rapture's own beliefs and ideals set forth by its philosophical leader Andrew Ryan, because normally, people would just create a history for a city, but this is a whole new level of ""history,"" filled with insanity and dark athmospheres.Overall, all I can say about this game is:🐅Snowy's Scorey🐅:10: Masterpiece, highly recommended to play9: Truly brilliant, recommended at its best8: Okay, will recommend7: Decent, will recommend, but within certain limitations6: Average, probably not worth recommending, but at least looking at5: Meh, some things are right, some wrong, but not complete4. Um.., not sure if this game is up for grabs3. Not worth buying2. Not worth looking at1. Quarantine yourself from this gameAlthough the graphics are not exactly perfect, who freaking cares? The game itself is a masterpiece, with a heavily-driven story, cool combat mechanics and environment, and the lavish and beautiful setting of underwater Rapture. Buy this game when HD Remastered comes out in September because I can guarantee you this game will be amazing. The game is definitely worth the price, and it is entertaining all around.

												“Happy we'll be beyond the sea, And never again I'll go sailing.”	Oh Bioshock. What is there I can’t say about it? Arguably one of the greatest games and narratives of the twenty-first century, the game merges all there is that exemplifies the first person shooter, but also mixes in aspects of grandiose utopian-turned-dystopian society with its own unique culture you discover on your own. Because of all of these elements, it’s no question that Bioshock could be easily, and is, considered a modern masterpiece.	Developed and produced by 2K Games, BioShock was released in the summer of 2007 and caused a stir in the industry. Up until that point, first person shooters were a primarily guilty-pleasure game about going online and just shooting people for the heck of it. BioShock, however, changed this system by doing away with multiplayer aspects (until BioShock 2, of course) and instead focused on the player’s environment and the experiences this environment yielded, which were innumerable by the conclusion. By featuring an extensive pseudo-open world environment that slowly explained itself through plot elements and self-discovery, Rapture enraptured you (pun intended) with its beautiful natural surroundings in stark contrast to its crippled ruins of a once great society.	Your character, solely named “Jack”, wakes in the ocean after a plane crash that left him as the sole survivor. After swimming around and out of the debris, you come across a mysterious lighthouse, into which you proceed. You then enter a miniature submarine, which in turn takes you deep below the sea and finally to Rapture. A once grand society that was built upon the dreams of the 1940’s business tycoon Andrew Ryan in order to escape the dangers and restrictions of the Cold War, Rapture is found to be overrun by mutated men and women that kill anything that moves (a result of genetic “splicing”), bandits and thieves, and Big Daddy’s accompanied by their Little Sisters, whom in turn once provided the society with its fueling for genetic experiments. Through twists and turns, fights and discovery, and arguably one of the greatest plot twists of gaming history, Jack discovers himself as a person, his mysterious past, and the dark secrets that lead to Rapture’s inevitable demise. With memorable characters that describe the city and its populous through their actions, BioShock provides lasting memories and thoughts for anyone that cares to explore it.	As for the game itself, the action is consistently entertaining and serves to keep you busy at all times. Through its addicting combat and evolving story one can easily dunk a good four hours into a single sitting and even still not find themselves halfway through the narrative. With several weapons, the action can be dynamically changed with a single button press and create a more diverse combat scenario. Likewise, with a countless supply of genetic powers named Plasmids the player can fully manipulate themselves, the environment, and even their enemies. The Plasmid system itself was revolutionary of the genre, by producing a sense of combat that doesn’t just revolve around blasting people to bits with shotguns and rockets, but instead using your own body to do the same thing, but in a flashier way.	Regarding technicalities and faults, I only have really minor complaints about the game as a whole. First off, the hacking system (in which the player hacks into devices and provides access to machines) is the most commonly addressed flaw in this game. By forcing the player into taking themselves out of the combat and playing a simplistically boring puzzle game the game breaks its greatest strength: immersion into the environment. My only other real complaint is the mission system, where it almost feels repetitive. Go grab this, kill these people first, take pictures of these, kill these people first, etc. While still fun and well executed, the game can slowly get repetitive, but right when it becomes noticeable the story changes once again and restarts this cycle, cleaning the slate and making it fun once again. The Rundown	Overall, BioShock is by no means a perfect game, but essentially there is no such thing. What one finds amazing, another can find boring, however BioShock provides an experience that anyone, even those that don’t enjoy shooters, should give a shot (yes, pun intended again) due to its grotesquely beautiful environment, contemptibly loved characters, and immoral wonders that serve a testament to the human race even now that reigns supreme as my favorite game to this day.Pros: -Amazing story and environment-Wide variety of combat scenarios-Vivid and complex linear/pseudo-open world Cons:-Slowly repetitive aspects-Them hacking games thoughThe Rate: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My Thoughts/About The Game  This game is beautiful. It's a masterpiece, and I will never forget the happy ending I got when the game was finished. I felt like I couldn't write a review yet until I completed the game. I was actually not going to buy this game since it is a horror game. However, I pulled myself through and I was having a hell of a time. This game is old, but the game feels like it's new.Pros:+ Amazing graphics+ Multiple endings+ Story is compelling+ Have the ability to hack machines+ Arsenal, loads of weapons+ Controls are easy to use+ Upgrade powers and weaponsCons:- Certain plasmids have unfair advantages- Crashes due to Unreal engine, sometimes- Big Daddies become easier to deal with later on because of weapons such as the chemical thrower. It gives unfair advantages- Annoying bug that changes your settings back to normal when you changed them for your desire In Conclusion  What I put in the cons is probably mostly false since I couldn't really find any bad reason to not buy this game. The story, the arsenal of weapons and powers are what kept me coming back to this game. I can't compare this game to Bioshock 2 and Infinite because I haven't played them. Finally,  I recommend  this game to anyone who is new or experienced into shooters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest RPGs of all time. Solid shooter mechanics, fluid gameplay, and satisfying difficulty add another layer to an unprecedented narrative.This will be much more enjoyable if you have a working knowledge of objectivism and its history, but any and everyone should play through this game once for any one of the abundant features it has to offer.

												loved this game the first time round, and bought it on steam to play again. sadly it took a while to get it working because of dx10. had to resort to using dx9 to get the resolution correct, then closing the game and opening back in dx10 to play. and even now the game will not use the steam overlay correctly. this tainted the game slightly for me, however it does not deter from the fact its awesome! better than infinite in my view.

												Bioshock is a great game with a great story line. However I find that the steam version, despite trying some fixes to sort these issues out I find the game freezes then crashes a lot, whether this is because of the games age or not I find this makes the game playable for about 10 minutes before having to restart the whole game through steam. Because of these issues the game for me has become more of a hassle to play rather than a fun game to complete. I would recommend the game if you can get it to play without these issues but as I have found no fix yet I can't enjoy the game myself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After having played this game the first time on the Xbox 360 and not paying attention to any of the story and finishing the final bos first try with a controller I thought this game was all hype. After having replayed it and this time actual paying attention, BRAVO! This was an outstanding game. The twist got me as if it was my first time playing this game. I already knew one twist, but the main twist got me like it should have the first time. Playing this game with a mouse and keyboard is definitely the way to go. Using a controller was just too slow to aim with and trying to hit splicers was a right pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ That being said with the mouse I was able to clean house! The boss was still just as easy as it was with a controller, but I knew going in that the boss was a bit of a let down.The many unique things about this game is what sticks with me the most. The plasmids giving you a super power is interstingly done. It changes your DNA and you need ADAM to splice yourself up more and get more powers. The setting is one of a kind. Not many would venture to the bottom of the sea and put a giant city in the name of freedom from all forms of ""Parasites."" The story, if you pay attention, is fantastic. I never would have guessed the things I found out had I not played it again.Even after all these years the game still holds up and is an instant classic. Now I understand completely. For people who want to play this and are having problems with the game crashing open up properties and open launch options. From the put type in -dx9 and it shouldn't crash while you play. You will also notice that the animations and ragdolls are at 30FPS. If you go online and look for bioshock physics unlocker it will fix that for you.So overall for this game I am rating it a 9.5/10. I would give it a perfect score, but the boss still grinds my gears of how easy he is. So take that as you will.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a amazing narrative experience and also want to shoot bees out of your hands, you need to play Bioshock!This game is creepy. Many times while I played, I just stopped and looked at the scenery. The game is visually beautiful! Their art direction is so unique - that it's a shame that we still have boring ugly military shooters. My favorite thing is setting up traps to fight the big Daddies (who are these giant walking tanks), and then freaking out when your traps start falling apart. There's a lot of story in this game. But if you remove that Ayn Rand connection, you still have a amazing experience involving crazy freaks abusing psychic fire at you while you fire shotguns that shoot lightning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After hyping up BioShock for a long time, expecting it to be System Shock 3. I was VERY dissapointed.The gameplay felt dumbed down and there was absolutely no relation story wise (except for some similar elements).So I stopped playing it, and left it for about 6 years (not even kidding).I returned to it last year with a fresh pair of eyes, knowing it has nothing to do with System Shock and is it's own thing.The gameplay was not as bad as I thought and is quite in depth. The enemies are varied and interesting. And a fair amount of weaponry is available to dispatch them. Each one can be upgraded and can be used in unison with plasmids and tonics to create deadly combos.But where it really shines is the story, characters, setting, art, lore, concepts and atmosphere. It is AMAZING. It all comes together to make a truly immersive and terrifying experience. And should be considered to be an artistic masterpiece. I can't recommend this any more. Play this in the dark with headphones and soak it in.Edit:However the ending leaves something to be desired.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overview : i just finished bioshock 1 for the 4th time and i have to say the most iconic part of it for me is  the character of ANDREW RYAN !The smart true fighter who build this wonderfull city called RAPTURE !Game : As of the game it self, i have to say its truely one of the best FPS games you can play.There is only 1 Problem.....!!!The Mouse Sensitivity is Toooo High.....And even if u pull it down to it's minimum, it still has problems....If you are an FPS player then you know its all about the MOUSE, CURSOR & SENS, smooth traction and DPI !And for some reason the guys at 2k were too involved in the story that they forgot to do this right...But the good news is if you twitch your window's/mac's sens from OS + In game settings you can get a good setting...hopefully your mouse supports profiling for games...Story : i Really Really cant spoil the story but two thumbs up ! its GREAT !The Question Is Will You CHOSE or OBEY...?! (inside joke)But For Me The Character ANDREW RYAN was the what hooked me on this game !Remember the most powerfull weapon in this game is the WRENCh if you use all the right combo tonics which will stack .Who's it for : I generally recommend this game to everyone unless you only like realistic games like medal of honor or battlefield...i give this game 9/10reviewed By IMMORTALEADER			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about one of the most thought provoking games created in the 21st Century? One of the Master classes of FPS, BioShock combines exciting FPS gameplay, with a tense storyline, and brutal social commentary. For years I had waited for someone to do a refutation of Atlas Shrugged by the radical nut Ayn Rand. Finally I have been given something of that caliber. One of my favorite aspects of this game is its use of the Art Deco movement to define the architecture of the beautiful Rapture. Art Deco is one of my favorite art forms and to see it in a video game is just brilliant. Ken Levine is a master storyteller who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty in the mud pool that is political commentary. One of the greatest art works of our generation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Who’s the Big Daddy?BIOSHOCK is a fine example of what is achievable through the medium of video games. The developers have managed to combine an engaging story with strong RPG and FPS elements to produce a thoroughly absorbing and memorable experience. The storyline is unusually effective and all the more compelling due to the aspects of morality it addresses. The voice acting is terrific, especially the chuntering splicers that wander around Rapture -- their psychotic ramblings are utterly convincing. The game is also graphically impressive for a 2007 production -- Rapture is a beautiful, art deco wreck of a city. There could perhaps have been more humour, but overall this is one of the best single-player games I’ve played.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock. What can I say.This game is without a doubt in the running for game of the generation. For years prior to this game, the industry had been slipping out of the fact that games must tell a story, and focused more on how they played and esentailly how much money they can make. Then along game BioShock, the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, a game which would change the way we tell stories in games forever.Packed in with its superb story, comes a uniqe horror-esq experience that I have only felt in BioShock. The atmosphere in this game is so fantastic, you would believe a city could actually be underwater. BioShock correctly displays the corruption of a once bold empire, and the impact it has had on life under the sea. The main character, Jack, is shrouded in mystery for most of the game until ""it"" happens...10/10. The 6th entry in my 10/10 hall of fame. Play the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game just oozes with atmosphere, it's brilliant. So is the storytelling. The graphics still hold up to this day and the sound is awesome. During the game you gain access to special powers and search for items, similar to RPGs. The powers are diverse and fun and switching between them keeps things fresh. The game manages to scare a few times in the beginning, but once you know what you're up against it pretty much stops being scary. Multiple endings give the game great replay value and it already is exceptionally long for a FPS. This should already be in everyone's collection.[Rating: 94/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played this game ALOT before it was available on Steam.Bioshock is a great game with a great story. I do NOT recommend this game to anyone who expects it to be a run and gun game like Borderlands. Bioshock is a great Story-Driven game.In this game you play as Jack, the only survivor from a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean, You make your way to the underwater City Rapture which once was a beautiful city but many things went wrong.Explore Rapture which once was a beautiful Utopia under the sea.I also recommend the Novel from Bioshock, I'm not a reader myself BUT! I recently finished the book and it was amazing! It will tell alot about Rapture, from building the city to how it all went wrong, but more importantly, you will also KNOW who some of the characters are in the game from certain audio dairies, replaying the game after reading the book opens a new view on the game. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a piece of art. It's a masterpiece. However, the gameplay itself isn't what makes the game special to me. What makes the game truly amazing is the atmosphere of the world. The levels are so detailed. You can learn so much about the history of the world just by observing advertisements on the walls and listening to audio tapes scattered across the world. The story is so unique. The lore of this game is what's going to keep me coming back for more. There are many plot twists that will shock and amaze you. The gameplay isn't anything amazing or innovating. It's a first person shooter full of your normal: revolvers, machine guns, shotguns, grenade launhers. But the game also includes superpowers called: plasmids. These really keep the game fresh and exciting as you can do anything from emitting electrcity from your hands or using telekinisis to lift dead enemies and use them as a human shield. Overall, the gameplay is really fun and addictive and is a great complement to the amazing atmosphere, story, and world of Bioshock. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just now got around to playing this game. I don't know why it took me so long to get into this absolute masterpiece of a game.And I have to say that I absolutely love it.It's a much better game than I thought it would be. I had tried in the past to pick up this game but I ended up quitting before the game really got good.All in all, this is a 11/10; a game that truly deserves all of the praise it has garnered over the years. It's beautiful and runs well on Windows 10. My only complaints about the game is that it would sometimes default to being in a window, or do other odd things visually; and the other complaint being that the next to last mission turns into an escort mission for a Little Sister while she continually talks about ""angels"".

												I don't know how to write this review without giving out spoilers, but I shall try.I bought this game after playing Bioshock Infinite, of course expecting the same beautiful visuals, story-line and characters.Wasn't disappointed, but... since the city of Rapture is underwater as opposed to suspended in the sky, there were some stark differences, one of which is obviously the lighting and atmosphere, it's all so eerie and creepy, with a decent number of jumpscares.The first 5-6 hrs of the game were an utter bore to me, I was struggling with my Eves and First Aid Kits, kept running out of ammo, it was tricky to switch between the plasmid and your weapon mid-fight, and the freaky atmosphere wasn't doing anything to make me feel better. But after that, it was all uphill, I started seeing the reason why I bought this game in the first place, the story picked up, it was paramount to solve the current mission and move on to the next ASAP.Gameplay wise, it is decent, but what really is the heart and soul of the game is the story and the morality of your choices. I chose badly, thinking there was no other option and will always be haunted by my choices. The ending was quite emotional and a real kick in the gut. The game did crash a couple of times though...The Bioshock franchise has a knack for brilliant story-telling, and now, would you kindly buy the game and see for yourself. =)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about one of the most thought provoking games created in the 21st Century? One of the Master classes of FPS, BioShock combines exciting FPS gameplay, with a tense storyline, and brutal social commentary. For years I had waited for someone to do a refutation of Atlas Shrugged by the radical nut Ayn Rand. Finally I have been given something of that caliber. One of my favorite aspects of this game is its use of the Art Deco movement to define the architecture of the beautiful Rapture. Art Deco is one of my favorite art forms and to see it in a video game is just brilliant. Ken Levine is a master storyteller who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty in the mud pool that is political commentary. One of the greatest art works of our generation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Who’s the Big Daddy?BIOSHOCK is a fine example of what is achievable through the medium of video games. The developers have managed to combine an engaging story with strong RPG and FPS elements to produce a thoroughly absorbing and memorable experience. The storyline is unusually effective and all the more compelling due to the aspects of morality it addresses. The voice acting is terrific, especially the chuntering splicers that wander around Rapture -- their psychotic ramblings are utterly convincing. The game is also graphically impressive for a 2007 production -- Rapture is a beautiful, art deco wreck of a city. There could perhaps have been more humour, but overall this is one of the best single-player games I’ve played.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finished Bioshock yesterday and for me it is an good game but I played through medium and I have to say it was too easy in many ways. I recommend you to play it at hard difficulty if you actually want more of a challange.The story is great and how it evolves and how it comes out at the end of it all.You can change the ending so I haven't tried any other ending yet so I don't know how that comes out.The gameplay has a alot of different aspects in it like with the crafting and if you do not explore everything little corner and do not do things correct there might be some part of the game you will miss out on in the first playthrough.Just pick hard difficulty if you want a good game and a challenge is my recommendation but if you're just there for the story sure medium works but be prepared for no real challenge.

												The botched sensitivity really ruins the fun for me. Basically, you get a scale of 1 - 10 to choose from, except choosing 1 or 2 randomly stops the mouse at times rendering it unplayable. Any higher sens is far too high for me as well. The remastered version is even worse, bugs wise. There's a great game hiding behind all the ignored technical problems, but until they decide to fix them I probably won't be touching this game for a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 I played it circa 2008 on my Xbox 360 and didn't even get past the first area of the game(also I played with hardest difficulty at that time) and continued on to other games at the time like Fallout 3/Mass Effect which are way more better imo. On PC I got it few years ago in a humble bundle and It sat along with part 2 and Infinite(which I bought last sale) until yesterday when I tried playing it... I just finished Bioshock 1 today, and will play 2 shortly, although I played at easiest difficulty and finished in about 6 hrs. Rapture is boring for me, the game kinda gets repetitive and I can't really relate myself to the games atmosphere, everything feels alienating. 1960s tech, impossible underwater city, super genetic manipulations, and characters that are badly deformed, etc. Playing the game seems more of a chore than an actual enjoyment to justify the $1 I spent on the humble bundle. nevertheless, I'll still play them. Looking forward to Infinite, which judging from trailers and gameplays, looked better to my tastes. Although honestly If it wasn't in my game library I would have just looked up at some youtube videos showing the whole story. I give the game 6/10. Still recommend			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played BioShock on the 360 and hated it. Then I got my hands on the PC version, and I'm starting to see why people like it so much.The world is a massive breath of fresh air from the done-to-death Middle Easts and Europes of the world. But that's not what's best about it. The atmosphere is simply amazing. It's a rare feat for a game to make me *feel* the world around the player, and BioShock does it. Add to that gameplay that's simple, but works rather well (apart from plasmids being a bit overpowered) and a pretty well-written story, and you have a recipe for success.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PORTUGUESE REVIEWBioshock conseguiu ser de longe um dos melhores jogos que já joguei em toda minha vida. Sem dúvidas é um investimento que compensa horas de diversão. O jogo tem uma trama muito envolvente, rico em detalhes e com um ar de mistério do qual deixa o jogador em total imersão. A história de Bioshock é baseada em uma utopia dos anos 60, e mantém-se fiel aos mínimos detalhes da época. Fora todo o contexto histórico da época, o jogador tem de encarar humanos transformados pelo vicio em Plasmids, os colossais Big Daddies e capturar ou libertar as Little Sisters, sem falar que as ações do jogador influenciam no final da história, sendo certo ou errado, caberá ao jogador decidir.ENGLISH REVIEWIn my opnion it is absolutely sure that Bioshock is one of the best games ever due to its rich details, the awesome story, and of course, the suspense involving the whole game. Despite of all the difficulty, Bioshock still such an awesome game no matter what type of gamer you are. You will enjoy it for sure! But be aware, your actions in the game can inffluence in different endings. It is up to you what you think about 'right' or 'wrong' actions. Have fun! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Positive:Tight story-driven gameplay and narration similar to Half-Life 2 and the likes.High level of detail and thoughtful level design. Some assets are used repeatedly and some special characters could have deserved more individual ingame models to make them stand out from the regular NPC, but all the levels, their layouts and their assets make sense. Everywhere you look you can see something special or unique rewarding those who look closer. There is some nice sound design too - your shoes squeaking on metal surfaces, the moaning of the Big Daddys, the sounds of whales or something like that whenever glancing outside into the depths of the Atlantic. Even when walking completely barred down areas you still know you are in a deep underwater city at the edge of collapse with water constantly leaking here and there, hitting you from above, washing down your vision and distorting it. I don't think an underwater city could be designed more believable and ambiance-strong than in Bioshock.What I noticed positively in comparison to Bioshock Infinite:- Enemies do respawn a bit. It makes the city feel more alive. In Infinite they would never respawn. Had you killed every enemy in the latter all the areas you were in remained empty. Not so in Bioshock. This also encourages playing around with guns or plasmids (special powers). - Enemies react more with their surroundings. Mildly. Like interacting with health stations to regenerate health, or standing in front of some item booths swearing at then to be broken or something. I never noticed anything like that in Infinite.- The Big Daddys and their Little Sisters are not enemies per-se. If you don't attack them they will not harm you either. This is rather unlike to how these straightforward story-driven shooters usually work. There wasn't really anything like this in Infinite either.Undecided:If you play on a too low difficulty, or if you are skilled enough with shooters, you may not find much use in the many plasmids and tonics that enhance your combat powers or that give you passive perks to avoid cameras, sneak up more easily on enemies, photograph them with better scores or whatever. I played on the easiest difficulty. I basically went guns blazing through the game and kept using like only three guns out of six or seven or so, and only two or three plasmids out of nine or so. The tonics I never really cared about too much either. Some enemies are resistent to some plasmids, and the game at one point ""forbids"" you to use some plasmids; while that was explainable story-wise it felt a bit forced. Still, all of these ""gadgets"" felt better implemented than in Bioshock Infinite (where it felt a bit silly at what rate and numbers they were tossed at you). I skipped hacking many booths and safes too because there was no need to buy anything (ammo, supplies, power upgrades) or because I always had enough automatic hacking tools with me.  If one wants to see more sense in the ""whole picture"" of this gadget/""economy""/resource management thing I suggest trying one of the harder difficulties or one may end up ignoring/skipping most of what is there.The same as in the previous paragraph applies to roaming levels for supplies. All items are uniquely placed around, that is part of the ""high level of detail"" I mentioned, and one may find that interesting and fun enough, but if you play on easy difficulty and/or if you are skilled with shooters there is little need to loot all the various containers and look in all the corners to find supplies. You simply won't need most of them. Even if you do it can become a one-button hitting spamfest because you will always want to grab most of what there is anway for the lack of any inventory whatsoever. What you can't grab the game will just leave where it is. I personally decided to just spam my ""use"" button at everything that could have possibly been a container rather than actually pay attention to what was in there. The only thing I genuinely cared about when looting around where the audio tapes from the various special characters in the game that would give insight into the recent history of Rapture. I did search all corners I became aware of just to see the way the devs placed their assets, but that aside there was little point to it.Negative:Characters could have deserved more depth. Some of them at least. Andrew Ryan was the most interesting one, but all the others are rather one-sided and predictable in what they want and do and think.Gunplay felt awkward, or a bit sloppy. I didn't try changing sensitivity or something but aiming didn't feel as easy as in other shooters. Not even when aiming down the sights. On the contrary I found it always easier to fire my guns from the hip. The gunplay didn't feel as bad as for example in Left 4 Dead, but not as great as in more modern semi-military FPS either.Animations of ragdolling character models and items looked odd. Not as ""fluently"" as one may expect. Like when shooting down an enemy from the ceiling he would fall down thanks to gravity and all, and ragdoll along the way just fine, but kinda like in some half-working slow-motion or something. Really hard to explain.There are three endings. I've seen the others on YouTube. I was satisfied with mine, but others may find theirs disappointing or irritating because the choices on which it depends what ending you get may not feel as obvious or logical as they should. Don't know if it's just me, but there were some bugs. Nothing too dramatic, but mildly annoying. I suppose related to the age of the game. I couldn't always hear all sounds. Like when I was shooting around the music would sometimes cut off for an extremely brief moment, the second I was to stop shooting (or my enemies) it would be there again. Then sometimes the game wouldn't always save my control and gameplay settings. The default key assignments in Bioshock felt a bit odd (like running/walking is on CTRL rather than SHIFT) and so I sometimes had to reassign the buttons again when I was starting up the game again. I noticed the game wouldn't quit properly - when exiting it my Windows 7 would tell me about an unexpected error forcing to close down the application. It didn't hurt me directly because quitting the game was my intention, but this half-baken shutdown may be related to settings not being saved properly.What I noticed negatively in comparison to Bioshock Infinite:The protagonist is completely silent and unnamed. I did like the actively talking Booker in Infinite more, I generally prefer a talking protagonist in games more. It just feels odd and irritating and somewhat ambiance-breaking to see NPCs constantly avoid naming such one protagonist all the time or answer their own questions because the protagonist would never raise his own voice to do so.

												I bought this when I heard I would get the Remaster upgrade for free.  I never got the Remastered version to work. Crashed every time, but that's a different story for a different review.I decided to play the original (non-remaster) since the remaster wouldn't work.  Worked well for a while.  Looks pretty good for an old game.  However, all of a sudden the sound no longer works in game.  The main menu sound is fine, but as soon as I load any save file, there is no audio.  No idea what caused it.  I'm sick of battling with all these issues though.2K is terrible PC ports and customer support.  Huge Bioshock fan very unhappy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While on the surface it might look like little more than a very pretty first-person shooter, BioShock is much, much more than that. Sure, the action is fine, but its primary focus is its story, a sci-fi mystery that manages to feel retro and futuristic at the same time, and its characters, who convey most of the story via radio transmissions and audio logs that you're constantly stumbling upon as you wander around. All of it blends together to form an interesting underwater world that sucks you in right away and won't let go until you've figured out what, exactly, is going on in the undersea city of Rapture.My only disclaimer is that playing this at night is a heart attack waiting to happen. I'm telling you: those splicers, man...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock:Positives:+ There is a really engaging story in Bioshock with a twist that you won't expect. Audio logs which supplement the plotline can be found by exploring the environment and are a welcome addition. The game is set in the underwater city of Rapture and follows two men who struggle for power - Andrew Ryan, leader of the famous Ryan Industries and Frank Fontaine.+ There are quite a few weapons that can be upgraded, like crossbows, shotguns, pistols, the Tommy Gun, grenade launchers and a chemical thrower which fires liquid nitrogen, napalm and electric gel.+ A key part of Bioshock is the use of Plasmids, genetic abilities which can freeze enemies solid, incinerate or electrocute them. Unleash a swarm of killer insects or create a decoy target to draw fire away from you. There's many options here.+ To add greater complexity there are tonics which improve your skills in countless ways. Physical tonics add healing benefits and eve restoration (eve is required to cast plasmids), engineering tonics are crucial to hacking safes, door combinations, gun turrets, vending machines and cameras. Then you've got combat tonics for physical damage resistance.  + The characters are interesting, the shooting is great, basically it's fun which is the most important pro.Mixed:~ Only about 15 hours of content for this FPS, which is not much (played on medium difficulty and didn't really have any issues). It's not the worst I've seen but clearly it's lacking in gameplay longevity. ~ Graphics are not bad considering the age of this game. Average.~ Somewhat linear game. It is not open-world and there are no side missions, it's strictly one area to the next. With that said, it's forgiveable since the developers have put some sort of effort into hidden areas and locations which aren't essential.Negatives:- Very poor map design, confusing to navigate and find out where to go for your next objective. Overall Score: 8/10Very much recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After finishing this game and this being my first FPS game I cleared on my channel, Bioshock came off at first as this nightmarish type of steampunk that I ever came across.  The story came off a bit noir-ish but as I started to put more time into the sections, the story got more intriguing and I wanted to know more.  Since a buddy of mine did the game on his stream, he got me the first and last games in the series and in time, I plan to do the second game as well as the last game.  But it has given me an even fonder respect for a stand alone FPS that isn't bogged down by the multiplayer aspect that some (and very few) FPS games have.  If you like Steampunk, you'll enjoy Bioshock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, to me, is the embodiment of a horror-action-shooter. It is a great game with many different ways to play and explore. I really enjoyed the diaries since they helped give me more nackground on the story, and they didn't get in the way at all, which is good. The combat is very stacked against you in some cases, but thats great. A challenge in any videogame is a good one. For example, when you run out of ammo, and cash, you need to rely on your sneaking around to get the jump on enemies. Not only is that difficult, but can be very rewarding. It is also noted that when you run out of EVE, you automatically become significantly weaker. This encourages scrounging, exploration to find more hypo or cash, or to sneak around, and try to avoid fights you could previously handle. With hundreds of different ways to play, its a groud breaking game. However, the ending in my opinion was a little fast. I played medium difficultly, and finished the fight in about 3 minutes. This is odd, since I would fight splicers that would take a very long time to kill, due to shortage of supplies and the fact that they would not die after multiple headshots. I feel they could've extended the boss fight slightly more, but thats not all the counts. The Journey is ultimately more fun and exciting than the ending, and it left me a hunger for wanting more. Great game, great mechanics, and would play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've ever been thinking about playing this game, like I did (it took me a while to get to this game), don't hesitate, buy it and try it. It's not an ordinary fps shooter because you gain some crazy powers. If you'll start playing this game today (2013) 1st you will probably have to get used to the graphics (seemed old to me in the beginning) and then get used to the controls - switching powers and weapons is also a bit messy at first. I missed cutscenes to enjoy the story line more (because im used to them from another games). But afterall it's fun game with a nice atmosphere of the '60s, so... buy it, try it, enjoy it...[spoiler alert] I was surprised with the ""hacking"" puzzles :D I like them because I had some plumber game on my phone, but I can imagine someone might get pis*ed by that stuff. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Really nice details and the atmosphere is creepy. The scenery of this game is sometimes amazing. You play in Rapture, the city on bottom of the Mid-Atlantic sea. Splicers and Big Daddy's trying to keep you away from the end, but nothing stops a real shooter. This game is 2007 but it still is awesome! Use plasmids to shock or burn your enemies. Shoot Big Daddy's and get ADAM from Little Sisters. Power up and rock the classic game. I would give it 10/10. Even though i played it first time 2011, but it was still amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: November 15, 2015
												I've only finnished this game yesterday and since then I've wanted to write a short review of it. Bioshock is a singleplayer, fps that sells itself on an interesting combat system and unique and complex story. The game is set in the fictional, underwater city of Rapture where a new scientific descovery has caused the citys enhabitents to go mad and murderous and become what are called Splicers. These will be your main enemy for the game along with security bots and Big Daddys as you explore, back-track ( theres allot of that) and then explore some more of the huntingly atmospheric Rapture.Now that i've mentioned the Big Daddys, they serve as optional bosses in the game. By killing them you can ether harvest or rescue the Little Sisters that they gard. If you rescue them then you get a small amout of adam (the currency for upgradeing your abilities) and the ""good"" ending. If you harvist them then you get lots of adam and the bad ending. But as i said you have to fight the Big Daddy to get these which serves as a nice risk and reward system.The story (no spoilers past the first hour) starts with your un-named silet protagonist's play crashing into Rapture. He is then aided by a man named Atlas who tells your character that in order to escape he must kill the cities founder Andrew Ryan.  Audio tapes reveal bits about the more advanced story. The story grabs you imediately and serve as one of the best parts about Bioshock... until about 2/3s of the way through the game. After an epic plot twist that i wont spoil the game in general becomes a sudden chore.After the twist the game throwes you into a long, boring fetch quest followed by one of the most hideous escort missions that ive ever played (if you hate this escort mission the you probably wont like Bioshock 2). Then there is an easy, anticlimactic boss fight followed by a TERRIBLE 30 second (if you get the good ending like me) cutscene. These missions, story choices acompanied by a huge difficulty spike make the last hour or so awful and boring.The combat system is fun though. You will use a combanation of wepons and plasmids (basicly superpowers) to defeat your enemies. Useing different combos of wepons and plasmids you can find awsome ways to kill people , for example, an electric shock and then a blast from the crossbow is a good one to fight the spider Splicers. You can also hack droids to fight for you, but the hacking mini game is a dredful, anoying mess so unless you use all of your adam upgradeing your hacking abilities.In the end i would definately recomend playing Bioshock as its a great, chilling experience with a cold (if a bit anti-climactic) story, but i would only buy if it was on offer as the game is diffinately without its flaws. Yet despite these flaws im looking farward to playing Bioshock Infinate (i tryed bioshock 2, but didnt enjoy it) to see a new story with some hopefuly improved gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahhh Bioshock.. Where do i begin?I'll start off by saying that Bioshock made me look at video games in a completely different way. Bioshock isn't all about the killing, violence, etc. Bioshock takes an amazing setting, environment, and atmosphere that makes it feel as though you stepped into the shoes of Jack. I could honestly say no bad about this game and dont want to give any spoilers. I believe everyone who is serious about video games MUST play at least the first bioshock. The first Bioshock is a game like no other. It is about experiencing the eerie and dark halls of Rapture and to ""take in"" the environment. I can say I do not have many hours on Bioshock on steam, however, I have spent countless playing it on console and I can say from the bottom of my heart that Bioshock is (in my opinion) one of the most original , creative, and greatest game I have ever played. Take it from a person who has a profile picture of a Big Daddy when I say... PLAY BIOSHOCK  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I most likely won't be playing more than 100 hours on this game, I still recommend buying it on sale. It's a great game. It's got fun graphics, a wonderful storyline, and the actual playing is just tons of fun! (Spoilers Ahead) The powers are fantastic, being able to control electricity, fire, ice, and several others is incredible, and ties in perfectly with the storyline of the game. There is a big twist at the end that, while a bit obvious when you look back, is still entertaining and shakes things up quite a bit. It's a bit creepy, a lot of fun, and worth buying. I only say on sale because while all of those things are true, it lacks a certain amount of replayability. You could go through it twice, maybe three or four times, and each time beat it in roughly fifteen hours, but the choices don't change up much. Replaying it becomes experimenting with what weapon combinations work best for you. The surprises of the game will probably fade, but it's still worth the buy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Would you kindly make more games like this? Ken Levine made a Deus Ex for the masses, before Human Revolution. That's makes not only a great game but paved the way for a renaissance in immersive sims. Judged by its own merits, it's a great FPRPS that manages to combine great art style, superb voice acting and a good story with great gameplay. Of course everybody knows the big twist, but it's the journey that counts. If only he could have made this game without the shackles of the consoles...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is one of my favorite games of all time, whether it be Xbox 360 or here on Steam! This game DOES have controller support and has great replay value. I wish there were achievements for this game on Steam, but that's okay. I still love this game and will continue to play it! I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a shooter/horror game with a great story! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Would you kindly...""BioShock is a game where you take the roll as a man named Jack who has survived a horrible plane crash over the Atlantic ocean and finds himself within the mysterious, derelict, Objectivist city of Rapture. You are contacted by a man calling himself Atlas, claiming that his family is trapped and he needs help to rescue them.But is that all?Questions soon arise, about Rapture and it's people, about the Plasmids that give amazing powers but drive over-users insane. Who is Atlas? He asks you for help, but never is seen nor is his family seen. Why is Andrew Ryan, the once-powerful business magnate and creator of Rapture, holed away instead of trying to aid his city?BioShock is a game that asks questions and deconstructs people, and their actions. With a deep story and beautiful world, it's not a game to be passed up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is by far one of the most different and coolest games I have played.  I found the world of Rapture to be really creepy and the monsters that I fought as well.  I thought the weapons selection was good and the add ons and upgrades really added spice to them.  I did find myself wanting to get to the end of the game about half way through.  Having to complete tasks in order to advance was just annoying and cumbersome.  When I finally did reach the last boss, he was so easy to beat.  I got all my weapons and ammunition loaded up and ready for the final battle.  The last boss was far easier than most of the monsters I fought throughout the game.  Overall, great game, really creepy, great weapons and decent story.  Every gamer should play this game at least once in their lifetime.  This will go down as a classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's worth it just to experience the game world. The plasmid mechanic is actually pretty cool. Weapon / ammo management is horrid. The enemies are repetitive.

												While I most likely won't be playing more than 100 hours on this game, I still recommend buying it on sale. It's a great game. It's got fun graphics, a wonderful storyline, and the actual playing is just tons of fun! (Spoilers Ahead) The powers are fantastic, being able to control electricity, fire, ice, and several others is incredible, and ties in perfectly with the storyline of the game. There is a big twist at the end that, while a bit obvious when you look back, is still entertaining and shakes things up quite a bit. It's a bit creepy, a lot of fun, and worth buying. I only say on sale because while all of those things are true, it lacks a certain amount of replayability. You could go through it twice, maybe three or four times, and each time beat it in roughly fifteen hours, but the choices don't change up much. Replaying it becomes experimenting with what weapon combinations work best for you. The surprises of the game will probably fade, but it's still worth the buy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suffer with the no sound after plane crash problem (seems to affect most people using Vista or later), however I discovered that I do get sound after the plane crash (Win 8.1), but only via the headphone port on the front of my PC. As for gameplay, got to be honest, I'm left feeling a little bit 'meh' after playing an hour or so of this game. Expected more from this game after all the hype when it was launched, glad I waited and paid next to nothing for it, as I'm really struggling to want to continue playing it. If I could leave a neutral review as opposed to just recommend or don't recommend, I would do, as it's just about okay, but not awful enough to avoid. I tend to prefer conventional military shooters though, and this is a bit different. Each to their own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(aka enemies coming out of wierd places right behind you.) The game play is amazing. It's very easy to pick up. (Your typical FPS)  Just something to think about: It took me just around ten (10) hours to complete the game on EASY mode. Have not gone back to revisit the story, but it is a short-ish game.

												This game is  absolutely amazing! No words are enough to describe this masterpiece. It isn't just about going around and shooting stuff, that is just a small fraction of a whole new and unique environment. As you make your way through the ravaged city and deal with crazed citizens, it doesn't only make you feel what the underwater city of Rapture has gone through, but it makes you see that it was once a beautiful, thriving place full of life, aswell. It sets such a strong atmosphere that you'll truly experience every inch of this city and it's story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My nomination for the ""WHOOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!"" Award for obvious reasons. One of the games that will stand the test of time (even more in terms of narrative). It, along with the Half-Life and Mass Effect games, set the precedent for how stories are meant to be utilized in games. With the release of this game, the argument of whether video games can be art became less ambiguous. Bioshock Infinite has much more refined gameplay, but Bioshock 1 has a simple but effective plot structure that keeps you engaged from the first to last minute. It is well deserving of more than one Steam award, but the twist towards the end of the game made me blow my mind (and my load)!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The games gameplay definitely gets repetitive and boring after a while (then again, I played the whole thing in just one sitting, so that's probably why), and the boss fight  is definitely underwhelming, but these cons pale in comparison with the amazing pros.This game's atmosphere and story is done in a superb fashion. It's rare that I see a game of this type actually manage to create an interesting and unique setting for which the player to play in. Bioshock definitely excelled in making the underwater city of Rapture look fantastic, glorious, and yet also mortifying.The soundtrack is also one of the best I have heard in a long while.Rating: 10/10 - Must Play			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A true Test Of Time fighter bioshock has taken the brunt of time and has come out on top.being almost 10 years old its still fun addictive and comprehensive enough to keep veteranscommited and new commers interested. I used it to introduce my wife into serious gaming and we've been though so many adventures together. Gaming is an equalizing platform and Bioshock stands at the cusp of individuality and receptivness. A great game with datedtropes and solid controls. Aged like a fine wine its an amazing experience and althoughI'm not big on the remastered look I definitely appreciate polishing this precious Saphire intoa Glistening Diamond.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Believe the hype. Irrational Games' incredibly acclaimed horror/action first-person shooter is a remarkable showcase of the games industry's potential for intelligent storytelling and important societal and political relevance. Bioshock is almost as perfect as a game can get, and it is undoubtedly one of the most fun, engaging, and smart games I have played in a long time. In Bioshock, the player is Jack, a generic, middle-aged every-man type character who - after his plane trip takes a detour into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean - finds himself in the underwater city of Rapture, where he must alter his genetic code with plasmids, gather a unique arsenal of weapons, and collect the genetic enhancing drug ADAM in order to survive and escape a crumbling oceanic dystopia. The story is presented as simplistic in the beginning, only to give way to a deeply complex narrative who's subtle roots take subconscious hold very early in the game. Partly through player-exploration (in the finding of citizen recorded audio logs) as well as through linear progression, the player uncovers the dark past of his underwater prison as he finds himself caught between the battles of the city's objectivist/utopia-ist greed monger Andrew Ryan, and a rebel named Atlas who helps the player escape during the game's opening moments. The story works both as a basic narrative, as well as a critique of Utopianism, and the Ayn Rand-founded philosophy of Objectivism. In a moral based storyline, the player witnesses impressive narrative twists and moments that don't disrupt flow, in addition to observing a prediction of an Objectivist society come to life - a world where everyone is only in it for themselves. Not only is the story impressive in and of itself, Bioshock works perfectly as a critique of the ideals of Objectivism/Utopianism, making it one of the most politically and philosophically in-tune games ever. The games accomplishment of deep and rich player immersion is truly remarkable. There's a reason why Rapture has become one of gaming's most recognized locations, and it's resident Big Daddies (and accompanying Little Sisters) some of the industry's most infamous enemies. The games' haunting atmosphere and dark narrative are truly top tier and induct the player with a sense of despair and loneliness, adding to the immersive feel. Surely one of the most captivating experiences I've had with a game.In terms of gameplay, Bioshock hasn't aged a day. Using a unique assortment of weapons (ranging from the famous wrench to more heavy weaponry like the flame-thrower) as well as an array of biological ""super power""-type weapons called Plasmids, the player fights their way through armies of Rapture's now-insane citizens called Splicers (driven to their state due to overuse and abuse of the ADAM drug). The gameplay is not only fun and gripping, but also inventive, especially for the time of its release. It's very open-ended, despite the linear design, and the player choice is extremely well-implemented. And the Big Daddy fights are challenging in the best way possible - as well as being equally rewarding. In short, the gameplay in Bioshock is not only superb in its field of First person shooters, but it's some of the best in any game, period. Also worth noting are the graphics. For a game made in 2007 (7 years ago at the time of this review), the game looks great. However, even despite its technical prowess, the art design and level composition is truly incredible. It's one of the many factors that bring Rapture to life, and make it one of the most impressive gaming achievements to date. Bioshock is surely one of the best games ever made. Filled with memorable characters, enemies, and locations, as well as providing an engaging storyline and relevant societal critiques, this is what a game should strive to be. A landmark achievement. 4.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a player who decides what games to buy based on the reviews of the certain game, it's my duty to write a complete review about any game i finish, so here is my review:BIOSHOCK:Bioshock is a game where you your character is ""trapped"" inside the underwater city of Rapture and learns what needs to be done in this zombie-occupied city, most of the times surpassing the limits of the human body, and in the meantime learning what this city was, what it could have been and what it is now and how it got here.Bioshock is a first-person shooter, action, horror game, where you use your guns for damage and your powers, called ""Plasmids"", as both damage and utilities.Before i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.PROS:+This game has really good story.+The graphics are awesome for a 2007 game.+While playing the game, all kinds of emotions will conquer you.+The controlling part feels pretty good.CONS:-Too much amunition, you will reach a point where you dont have space for bullets, same goes with health kits, eve hypos and sometimes even money.-The map is bad, apart from being just a map (only shows the area and the attractions of any kind) it doesnt allow you to place a mark or anything, not even click to see informations about any place.TL;DR This game has his own page in the history of gaming and any serious gamer should at least see a walkthrough of this game, it is probably one of the best ever made.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the characters models can be repeated throughout the game, the variety in all other aspects compensate and add much more fun into the gameplay. For its time, this game was very much under appreciated, and even now, the game still lives up to expectations of players looking for a well done game. There is not much to say thats bad, with a compelling storyline and a creepy atmosphere, this game will guaranteedly keep you on your toes as you progress through the adventure of Jack or John or something (I don't know the name, and I'm not looking it up).The one thing I could say that makes no sense in this is that during the intro sequenceyou crash into some unknown placeyou go in some sketchy building underwater thats falling apartyou find a vending machine that dispenses big♥♥♥♥♥needles that *give you magical superpowers*you immediately inject yourself with it, without any consideration as to what it even was*gain superpowers*I love this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing story wise and gameplay wise as well. Plasmids and the many weapons you'll have thoughout the game are a lot of fun to play with. Splicers don't feel like boring zombies we see in other games. You can sometimes hear them talking to themselves which inhances the horror factor. The grumbleing of big daddies help with the creepy factor as well. Although the gameplay and tone of Bioshock is amazing on its own. The story is the thing that impresses me the most. It'll blow your mind and it feels very rewarding once you complete the game. Hacking into various things are pretty nice as well. If you're looking for something not like your average shooter with an amazing plot and setting Bioshock is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this on The Xbox 360, and just recently picked it up on Steam, the first two games were on sale back in December, and how could I NOT pick them up they are some of the most fantastic first person shooters I've played since the Doom 3 days. Today in gaming first person shooter just means Call of Duty Clone or something of that flavor, and it's kind of depressing most people think that.This game you don't have infinite ammo, you have to worry about your health. The environment feels terrifying sometimes to the point where I just can't play the game, but that's cool, because I like to be scared out of a game from time to time.  Though I do wish you had more freedom around Rapture. It's just go here do this and onward. Sometimes you just want to putz around, but there's no way to do that without not progressing in the game. If you haven't played this game before you NEED TO PICK THIS UP NOW AND PLAY THROUGH IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I see people complain about a lack of actual motivation. It's a video game, the lack of motivation is you sitting on your duff playing a kick♥♥♥♥♥game like this. The setting is awesome and I love that the game is not too dark and you can see everything. Someone said the style is 1960's and you are a few decades off buddy. Learn your decades. Anyway the game is liken to the original Half-life except you can shoot things out of your left hand and you gain abilities in some unique ways. You gain advantages by photographing baddies, cameras and turrets ect. That is neato. It is like leveling up but in an interactive way. Great addition to the survival FPS genera. Maybe beaten it 3-4 times and playing it again. Solid controls fun weapons and different ways the build your dude.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The ""FPSRPG"" kind of games (or as i like to call them, ""deus ex"" kind of games) can be counted on the fingers of a hand, solely because of the effort that must be put on these kind of titles and the variety that must be offered, but once they are created, and well, they become eternal masterpieces. Bioshock is one of them.The story is finely narrated without pinching the player through boring cutscenes or text walls, but simply by using the ""3d actors"" that the game offers or the audio logs gathered in an unique 50's nostalgic world filled of details and icons that got bethesda so much in love that they copied that while making Fallout 3 (see pip-boy and the plasmid tutorials).The plot is in background but at the same time will make the player wanting to know more, as you make way through halls of debrises and destruction with your wrench.The gameplay, as in every ""Deus ex-y"" game, is satisfying and rewarding, made out of many skills and little things to do that can make the player replay the game many more times to see how the character can change in every gameplay. It's good to pick up new skills, it feels good to shoot with your weapons or to thunderstrike with your hands, but if i compare this to his father (System shock 2), the game feels, sure, more dynamic, but ridicolously easy and criminally short.Gameplay: 9/10Story: 8/10Soundtrack 8.5/10Replayability 8.5/10The ""must play"" for every player that likes RPG-FPS kind of game, and the starting point to whoever wants to begin a genre like that, it's a pity that there aren't as many games as bioshock 1.

												Excellent game! An unforgettable experience. Though, there are a few issues that scream ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port!"" Fortunately, most of them have been fixed by our wonderful PC community.Here are some essential improvements:1) Mouse is wonky in the menu and hacking mini-games - fixed via a mouse fix .bat file posted by Steam user ""gudnaimsartaekn""2) No FOV slider - fixed via Flawless Widescreen application3) Physics animations are capped at 30 fps - fixed via Bioshock Physics Unlocker4) There's no built-in ambient occlusion, but if you have an Nvidia gpu, you can enable it in Inspector with the flag: 0x001400005) There's no built-in anti-aliasing. FXAA or SMAA (SweetFX) will do.6) Occassional crashes - running the game in compatibility mode ""Windows XP (SP2)"" with Admin privileges seems to do the trick. I'm not totally sure.With these improvements, Bioshock runs closer to the way it should have at release, though still not perfect. Crashes can occur randomly or when exiting the game. There are known game-breaking bugs, but I haven't found any, and I've beaten the game 3 times at least. A remaster would be appreciated, but right now this is what we have: a better-than-console version if you tweak it yourself, which can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to do.As far as framerate goes, my i5-4460 and GTX 970 SSC don't break a sweat at 1080p. Rock solid 140 fps with G-Sync.As far as game content goes, everything is gooooood! Without good content, why bother playing at all? :DBioshock is one of the best games ever, as well as its sequel and Infinite. Do yourself a favor and play them all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I sometimes wish I could wipe my memory of this game and be able to experience it for the first time again.  I jumped into Bioshock not knowing what to expect other than the fact that there would be Big Daddies littered around the place.  Little did I know I would be thrown into a beautifully desolate underwater city that had been flipped into hell below the sea.  I don't know what I love most about this game. The atmosphere is astonishing, the gameplay is stupidly fun, and the story kept me reeled in like a fish on its final hook.  The whole experience of this game left me wanting so much more from the Rapture/Bioshock universe and I can't express how happy I was when Bioshock 2 came into existence.  If you have ever played Bioshock 2 or Bioshock Infite but have yet to play this game, don't hesitate!  This game still holds up even years after it was released (graphically speaking).

												I bought this game years ago and to be honest, it was my first proper PC game I ever had.The game is just pure excellence in nearly every sense of the word -- deep political undertones sprinkled with philosophical questions; interesting gameplay; fantastic story; an atmosphere that is quite simply unparalleled and can never be matched by any other game that has been made.Completely worth picking up if you have never played this game.  It is the best of the entire BioShock series.  These games don't come around a lot, once every ten years.  I like to compare this game to HL in-terms of the impact that this game had -- it really did solidify the fact that games were really an artform and what games could really achieve.Would you kindly get this game?

""No,"" says the man in the Vatican, ""it belongs to God."" ""No,"" says the man in Moscow, ""it belongs to everyone."" I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different.

												A few months back, my friend gives me a BioShock reference, to which I directly agreed on not have played the game. He took it as an insult made me play it.The game has:- An underwater city. (One with the best atmospheric feel. A beautiful world with nicely designed places.)- A GREAT story! (Well built characters, a good storyline, andI totally fell for it)- Plasmids! (To show off)- Jumpscares (Just a few, but worth it)- Big Daddies (Well, badass creatures)- Always something to explore!My friend kept asking, ""Will you kindly, finish BioShock?"", and well, I did.

												I love this game. You reach a point in the game where you feel like a god and can't be stopped but then you run out of ammo and have to lemming rush a Big Daddy with a wrench. My only complaint about this game is that it occasionally messed up the fullscreen window on startup. Just restart it and try again. I would definitely give this game a chance as the story is fantastic and the gameplay is very frantic and exciting. One of my favorite games of all time. 10/10 would be stepped on by a Big Daddy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock isn't a ""shooter"" in the conventional sense. Yes there are guns and crazed enemies and wild locales, but this game is so, so much more than your average sci-fi CoD. Without going into too much detail, this game successfully blends story driven gameplay and choices with absolutely stellar level design and first person exploration/combat. BioShock is set in the vivid, stunningly realized underwater world of Rapture, filled to the (literally) bursting point with political intrigue, emotional decisions, stellar (voice) acting and so much more. On the combat side of things, it's geared greatly towards the thinking man, offering a huge plethora of upgrade options, gameplay mechanics and some very unique and interesting abilities. All this would've been much less enjoyable had the AI been neglected, but thankfully the splicers, as they are known, are reasonably intelligent and display some interesting manuvers while fighting.I must cut this short; I could ramble on for a good while about this game. I cannot recommend this highly enough. The sheer sense of ""wow, this truly feels like a place that once existed"" is off the charts. The combat is addictive. The story is one of the most unique offerings I've seen in videogames, especially the villain. Get this. Especially for one of the frequent bundles with BioShock 2 (also well worth getting, though not quite as stellar) this is just so worth your time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Drug addicts (splicers), big daddys, remote turrets, and super powers! Things in the city have gone dark. You have to watch out for all of these things if you want to get far in rapture. Will you be brave enough to explore rapture???so strap a huge drill to your arm fill up on adam and go rock some splicers! 10/10-Goombas			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It may be old, but I fell in love with it when I first played it in my Xbox 360 back in 2010. One of my favourite things of this game is the different endings and parts of the storyline you can unlock depending on what you do with Little Sisters.

												I bought this game years ago and to be honest, it was my first proper PC game I ever had.The game is just pure excellence in nearly every sense of the word -- deep political undertones sprinkled with philosophical questions; interesting gameplay; fantastic story; an atmosphere that is quite simply unparalleled and can never be matched by any other game that has been made.Completely worth picking up if you have never played this game.  It is the best of the entire BioShock series.  These games don't come around a lot, once every ten years.  I like to compare this game to HL in-terms of the impact that this game had -- it really did solidify the fact that games were really an artform and what games could really achieve.Would you kindly get this game?

Very progressively game, when you have to become a 'Daddy'.Its a nice story but if you 100% want to understand the whole thing, I recommend to play the second Bioshock game: 'Bioshock 2'.I will highly recommend to buy the whole serie of Bioshock (Bioshock, Bioshock 2, Bioshock infinite),because this game is just a little part of a big story/adventure !I had a lot of fun playing this game, just one of the best games I ever played.

The number of choices in 'plasmids' or genetic enhancements, and the effect of different combinations of plasmids  on gameplay - they've gotten it just right, with excellent balance between them and without ever making it tedious. The maps are well thought-out; collecting things and upgrading weapons is fun and neatly done, it leads you to explore the maps more; and the environment is quite...remarkable and even memorable. The audio tapes that tell the story are fascinating, as is the music and the general ambience of the game.Play this with a good pair of headpones, in the dark!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. I put in countless hours in this game back in the Xbox 360 days. I had no idea what the game was about the first time I played it. I was never the type to play these kind of survival horror games, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I was uncomfortabe at first, but as I pushed myself to play it, the story took over and kept me playing. The story is so immersive that when the story climaxes, you feel like it's happening to you and everything just clicks. The story telling and the pace of the game is perfect. Not too long, not too short. I just recently started getting into PC gaming and I just HAD to have this game in my library and play it again. 10/10 playing again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's....It's......BIOSHOCK, ♥♥♥♥♥! The game where you play as Jack, our protagonist! His plane crashed in the mid-atlantic, and you swim to a nearby lighthouse to start your adventure through the world of Rapture, an underwater dystopia, filled with crazed spilcers and insane people. Now, BioShock is a brave game, it knows what it wants to be, and it is. BioShock is an amazing, creative, and scary game, and it has left a huge mark in my soul, for being pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scary. Let me give you the good aspects of BioShock, and show you just how good this game is.Good Aspects of Bioshock-First, we have sound, which is amazing in bioshock, when I first went into the medical pavilion, the crazed wails of the splicers could be heard, the spinning of revolver cylinders from the splicers, the scrapeing of pipes against the hard floor, all done extremly well.-Next we have Rapture itself! Rapture was an underwater city designed by andrew ryan, a rich dude who though the surface was corrupted, so he packed up his bags and set out on his big♥♥♥♥♥cruise ship to sail for the perfect place to build. After years of hard work, he made, Rapture......but.....because of the wonder drug, ADAM, the city has fallen apart and now houses the most crazed, gene spliced losers in the whole world. Leaks are abundent, water is found in most places in rapture. Lights are flickering, showing the dead bodies of the sane rapture population. Rapture is done extremly well.-Next we have GRAPHICS! Graphics are amazing for 2007, good one Irrational, good one. Graphics are done extremly well.-Last but not least, we have the storyline! The story of BioShock is about a....well, find that out yourself......I gave you the rapture story, but there are missing pecies......lots....of missing pecies...(Forgot audio logs, good one Irrational, good one.)Movin on to bad aspects, and I'll tell ya, there aren't many.Bad Aspects of Bioshock-Not optimized for windows 7-8, but it works anyway, and the rare times it won't work, fixes are abundent and easy to find.BioShock is a heart pounder,♥♥♥♥♥♥taking, pants♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ classic, and fun adventure, and should be enjoyed by everyone.

You'll have a complete arsenal at your disposal from simple revolvers to grenade launchers and chemical throwers, but you'll also be forced to genetically modify your DNA to create an even more deadly weapon: you. Injectable plasmids give you super human powers: blast electrical currents into water to electrocute multiple enemies, or freeze them solid and obliterate them with the swing of a wrench. No encounter ever plays out the same, and no two gamers will play the game the same way. Biologically modify your body: send fire storming from your fingertips and unleash a swarm of killer hornets hatched from the veins in your arms.

												This game, to me, is the embodiment of a horror-action-shooter. It is a great game with many different ways to play and explore. I really enjoyed the diaries since they helped give me more nackground on the story, and they didn't get in the way at all, which is good. The combat is very stacked against you in some cases, but thats great. A challenge in any videogame is a good one. For example, when you run out of ammo, and cash, you need to rely on your sneaking around to get the jump on enemies. Not only is that difficult, but can be very rewarding. It is also noted that when you run out of EVE, you automatically become significantly weaker. This encourages scrounging, exploration to find more hypo or cash, or to sneak around, and try to avoid fights you could previously handle. With hundreds of different ways to play, its a groud breaking game. However, the ending in my opinion was a little fast. I played medium difficultly, and finished the fight in about 3 minutes. This is odd, since I would fight splicers that would take a very long time to kill, due to shortage of supplies and the fact that they would not die after multiple headshots. I feel they could've extended the boss fight slightly more, but thats not all the counts. The Journey is ultimately more fun and exciting than the ending, and it left me a hunger for wanting more. Great game, great mechanics, and would play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While on the surface it might look like little more than a very pretty first-person shooter, BioShock is much, much more than that. Sure, the action is fine, but its primary focus is its story, a sci-fi mystery that manages to feel retro and futuristic at the same time, and its characters, who convey most of the story via radio transmissions and audio logs that you're constantly stumbling upon as you wander around. All of it blends together to form an interesting underwater world that sucks you in right away and won't let go until you've figured out what, exactly, is going on in the undersea city of Rapture.My only disclaimer is that playing this at night is a heart attack waiting to happen.

												Deep at the bottom of the ocean is the city of Rapture. A city not for Gods or kings, A city for men.Built to be a utopia for mankind's greatest thinkers to prosper.The ""world's best and brightest"" were granted freedom of will and choice in Rapture, unrestrained by government, religion and similar established institutions. The results were amazing breakthroughs in robotics and genetics.But On December 31, 1958, a massive working-class uprising, led by a man known only as Atlas occurred in upper-class locations in the city, This sparked a civil war in Rapture and marked the beginning of the end.As the player you join the story after it has already concluded, left to wonder the ruins of this once great city, stalked by what's left of the survivors of the war, who due to genetic meddling are not quite human anymore.The game has totally immersive environments that the developers clearly enjoyed creating, accompanied by an original and genuinely interesting story that unfolds before you. With developers being far too willing to bypass story these days for the sake of throw away 'action' moments this game is an exception, Bioshock actually has strong literary references, with clear nods to books such as Logans run and George Orwell's 1984.A very impressive FPS not ruined by the trappings of most modern shooters, no unlimited regenerating health, no unlimited respawns or 10 minute cut scenes. This is an essential game for any self respecting FPS'er.The action starts early and never really slows down. Your own imagination decides how much you get from the conbat system and the enemy AI respodes well to your attack patterns and adjusts accordingly.Would you kindly go and pick up a copy of this game.

												If you haven't played this game already...WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE!? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is awesome! Having replayed it on PC made me appreciate all of the gorgeous art design and fantastic setting of Rapture that much more. The combat is pretty standard with the element of Plasmids being incorporated to spice things up but it's still fun exploring and shooting things in Rapture! So now would you kindly just buy this game already...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like a lot of things about this game. It's very interesting that players have the choice of doing different things to have a certain ending (I might of just spoiled it somehow). I like how the game has all these oldschool things to explore. I got this game because it would help me understand more about the latest Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite. I think all the plasmids in the game are all very unique and usful in different ways, and also the weapons. I would give it a 9.2/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While on the surface it might look like little more than a very pretty first-person shooter, BioShock is much, much more than that. Sure, the action is fine, but its primary focus is its story, a sci-fi mystery that manages to feel retro and futuristic at the same time, and its characters, who convey most of the story via radio transmissions and audio logs that you're constantly stumbling upon as you wander around. All of it blends together to form an interesting underwater world that sucks you in right away and won't let go until you've figured out what, exactly, is going on in the undersea city of Rapture.My only disclaimer is that playing this at night is a heart attack waiting to happen. I'm telling you: those splicers, man...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1st person, action, shooter. A whole under water city gone mad, aka Rupture Asylum and genocide on the freaks that live there. Personally I didn't like the story at all. It's pretty much about people with power that wanted everything to be perfect. Then they got bored of it and started doing sick stuff to each other.Plasmids aka the 'super powers' add additional sickness to everything on top, plus the little girls used as harvesters for substance called Adam, that power all the Plasmids. The only humane thing in the game I found, was to save the little girls and help their 'mother' throughout the game, that felt right to do. And apart from her and girls I didn't really find any other positive character. Wont spoil any story, but it wasn't as good as I hoped.For an old game it looked decent, nothing major. Gun play felt very basic though there are many guns available. Enemies were pretty much all humans that were abused by plasmids or experiments, torture, etc., one way or another. Some had interesting abilities in form of vanish / invisibility, walking on walls / ceiling, etc.. AI was challenging, dodging shots, rushing you on, flanking.Plasmid selection was insane and they were fun to use. Looting and hacking was also very enjoyable. After a while game started to drag on, missions and tasks were tedious with all the do this and do that constantly, it felt like I was literally mind controlled in real life. And right after the ""Golf scene"", I got bored completely.Character design and animations were above average, but nothing good. Visually I guess game was good for it's time, but don't expect much. Voice acting was good and enjoyable. Though I didn't enjoy much of the story, I still recommend this because some people might find it more entertaining than I did. To close this off, for me Bioshock Infinite had far more enjoyable story than this, though they are connected in some way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never write reviews, but I feel that BioShock deserves any words of praise that it receives.  I've played hundreds of games and BioShock stands apart in terms of the world that was created, the stellar narrative, the intriguing characters and enemies, and so on.  I put this game above BioShock Infinite (though that's a fine game).  Especially if you remain unspoiled, you need to play this game.  I have yet to encounter a world or story that I find as incredible as Rhapsody (I'd also recommend the Bioshock book for a followup to the game).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Get and upgrade various kinds of cool guns, and upgrade yourself on a genetic level to be able to use special powers.

												Ahhh Bioshock.. Where do i begin?I'll start off by saying that Bioshock made me look at video games in a completely different way. Bioshock isn't all about the killing, violence, etc. Bioshock takes an amazing setting, environment, and atmosphere that makes it feel as though you stepped into the shoes of Jack. I could honestly say no bad about this game and dont want to give any spoilers. I believe everyone who is serious about video games MUST play at least the first bioshock. The first Bioshock is a game like no other. It is about experiencing the eerie and dark halls of Rapture and to ""take in"" the environment. I can say I do not have many hours on Bioshock on steam, however, I have spent countless playing it on console and I can say from the bottom of my heart that Bioshock is (in my opinion) one of the most original , creative, and greatest game I have ever played. Take it from a person who has a profile picture of a Big Daddy when I say... PLAY BIOSHOCK  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is an atmospheric game that creates a dark beautiful world. The overall story might not satisfy some, but as you continue to play the game you fall in love with Rapture and why was created. The underwater city is not chained by morality and as a result you will encounter disturbing imagery that captivates you at the same time. It is a great shooter that has RPG elements, which increases the variety of gameplay options and allows you to experiment. The choice you make in regards to the storyline also provides another reason to play the game again. Even if the ending is lackluster, the tension and awe you feel throughout the game is extraordinary. Bioshock delivers an enjoyable and immersive experience that should not be forgotten or missed by any avid gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Really nice details and the atmosphere is creepy. The scenery of this game is sometimes amazing. You play in Rapture, the city on bottom of the Mid-Atlantic sea. Splicers and Big Daddy's trying to keep you away from the end, but nothing stops a real shooter. This game is 2007 but it still is awesome! Use plasmids to shock or burn your enemies. Shoot Big Daddy's and get ADAM from Little Sisters. Power up and rock the classic game. I would give it 10/10. Even though i played it first time 2011, but it was still amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock... Where do I start? A friend recommended me this game, and I wasn't sure about it. Looked iffy, but as soon as I started playing, I knew why he liked it so much.First of all...The story Is completely extraordinary and you play not just to have fun but to be immersed in the disturbing story of Rapture, and what happened to it. I used to play games just to have fun, but now I really focus in on te story, and this one was extremely well written. I don't want to spoil a thing, but all I can say is the story is truely amazing.Second...This game came out in 2007, but the graphics were pretty kickass at the time. I think 2k really did it right with the graphics. They even look good in present day 2015, so give 2k and the Unreal Engine some creditLastly...The Gameplay mechanics were really good. I liked how the guns handled, LOVED The plasmids and how unique each were. Aiming was not hard, which was good because the ADS Wasn't that good and I usually hipfired. The HUD was well made and looked good too, and switching weapons I could do with ease.Complaints? Well, I guess there's one. SO HARD TO FIND AMMO!! But that aside, this game is EXTREMELY FUN and I know you will enjoy every little second of getting drugged, killing little sisters, and getting mowed down by big daddy's.11/10 <-- Not even overexaggerating, I love this game.

Posted: September 12, 2014
												So after a five day binge play of the BioShock franchise, here are my thoughts about the game that started it all. For those who live under rocks, this game started two 'kinda big' controversies. One being the idiotic 'this disk will self destruct' one time instal that the original PC version came with, and the second being that the game was overtly pro-Communism and and anti-Libertarian. Before I get into the right/wrong for this game, let me address both the reasons for uproar. Firstly, video game companies have proven to be nothing but greedy a-holes that we enjoy licking. Born of the mentality that when you buy a game, it's not your property, it still belongs to the game company, we've been gifted with same day DLC, on disk DLC, the war on Game Stop, and still paying $60+ for digital titles. This was one of the first attempts to wrestle ownership of a game away from you and keep it firmly in 2K's hands, and you just pay for the privilege. Kinda funny for a game that seems to extol the virtues of the Communist manifesto that nothing belongs to the individual, to actually do just that! Clever marketing maybe? Anyway, as to the second bit of trouble, the game does go out of it's way to show that the Libertarian idea of free markets and minimal government involvement leads to mass suffering.... until you reach the end of the game. No spoilers, but as the game goes above and beyond in blaming the ""Great Chain"" for Rapture's destruction, it turns out to be nothing more than a clever plot device. So for all the sore fanny it caused, like most outrage in the media, it was started by people that didn't care enough to investigate the entire title to discover there wasn't any outrage at all. Surprise surprise.RIGHT: BioShock does one thing, and does it incredibly well. This spans for all three titles not just the first. And that one thing is: MOOD. From the second you step into Rapture you are wrapped into a mood of decay and despair so vivid you can almost smell the water damage, and follows you to the very end. BioShock singularly gives this a second helping that the other titles sadly discarded by making the characters look..... surreal. Everything has a 1940's taste and even the characters seem to be odd glassy caricature out of a pulp comic book. Like Half Life, the graphical limitations of the time add a stylized feeling that actually feed into the immersion rather than detracted from it. The second thing these games do, is mess with your emotions. This references to the ""controversy"" over the games political undertow, but the game rapidly changes pace making you unsure what to think or believe till the very end. Like I say with any game, all the graphics in the world can't save a game that doesn't have a good plot, and BioShock keeps you tied in knots non-stop. The mapping is set up wonderfully for PC FPS players, controls are simple though there is a bit of a learning curve with Weapon/Plasmid combo for the mouse, it will become second nature in no time. You can add on to both your plasmids and weapons, changing effects and visuals letting you customize your combat style and type of play. The voice acting is top notch, again adding to that mood and immersion, the Splicer's vocal taunts are haunting and Big Daddy whale calls will make your flesh crawl. Another incredibly well done feature is the Big Daddy itself. Every area has a certain amount of Big Daddy - Little Sister combos lurching around collecting ADAM, and it is imperative that you defeat them if you want to upgrade your plasmids. But BioShock doesn't just hand them over, oh hell no. You are going to fight and die over and over to get that ADAM, because the Big Daddy's only purpose is to mangle you quickly and without mercy. There are two types: The Bouncer who uses only physical attacks, and Rosie who carries a rivet gun and fires mines. Though toward the end of the game you get use to the combat patterns and have a big enough arsenal that the Big Daddy only becomes moderately dangerous, through the first half of the game these things are ridiculously hard and actually prove a great challenge. WRONG: Some of this I hate to even complain about considering this is a launch title for the franchise, and naturally a proving ground for certain bugs to get fixed and concepts worked out. However, I have a few bones to pick that kept me on the fence for a while. First and foremost, is enemy type. When you first run into the Splicers, they are creepy and horrible, but after the thousandth time you've blown away a male Splicer, their creepiness has long since worn off. Even the Big Daddy loses some of its intimidation by the end of the game and you realize you feel the same playing the final level of Bioshock as you do the final level of COD. It's just a target, remove it, continue on. This game is badly in need of skins for the enemies as well as attack patterns, to give it just a bit more flavor. Secondly is the hacking. Starting the game, I loved to hack things! The pipe and water flow hack was fun and challenging, but by the end of the game I was dreading it and going out of my way to find auto hacks just so I could push ahead. This could have been fixed by adding different hacks for different objects. A hack for vending machines, a hack for security bots, and a hack for vaults. There are too many plasmids that are just, for lack of better terms, worthless. They're great to look at, some have very interesting visuals, but ultimately are just not usable. You will use the Electric plasmid because of it's ability to stun Splicers, Bots, and even the Bid Daddy. You might also take Fire plasmid, but even that loses a lot of its punch toward the end of the game due to the fact that it has little to no effect on Bots, Big Daddy, and even the Splicers just seem to shrug it off. The rest are just gimmicks that work okay or not at all, but wont save you during a fight. Another thing that bothered me was at the end of the game when you dressed in the Big Daddy suit, your hands don't change to give you the feeling that you're in the suit! For a game that goes so far to set a mood, it was kind of a big 'oops' not make this one small visual correct for that scene. And lastly, screw the limited wallet. It's a moronic gimmick to force you spend cash and limit your ability to make pit stops to top off ammunition, rather than just remove that ability all together to make a supply pinch. That aside, BioShock is a fantastic game that has aged well and has plenty of replay value with multiple endings and plenty of hidden items to keep you playing. The story alone is reason enough to grab this title, as it will have direct effect on both of the sequels, adding to their depth and understanding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game! An unforgettable experience. Though, there are a few issues that scream ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port!"" Fortunately, most of them have been fixed by our wonderful PC community.Here are some essential improvements:1) Mouse is wonky in the menu and hacking mini-games - fixed via a mouse fix .bat file posted by Steam user ""gudnaimsartaekn""2) No FOV slider - fixed via Flawless Widescreen application3) Physics animations are capped at 30 fps - fixed via Bioshock Physics Unlocker4) There's no built-in ambient occlusion, but if you have an Nvidia gpu, you can enable it in Inspector with the flag: 0x001400005) There's no built-in anti-aliasing. FXAA or SMAA (SweetFX) will do.6) Occassional crashes - running the game in compatibility mode ""Windows XP (SP2)"" with Admin privileges seems to do the trick. I'm not totally sure.With these improvements, Bioshock runs closer to the way it should have at release, though still not perfect. Crashes can occur randomly or when exiting the game. There are known game-breaking bugs, but I haven't found any, and I've beaten the game 3 times at least. A remaster would be appreciated, but right now this is what we have: a better-than-console version if you tweak it yourself, which can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to do.As far as framerate goes, my i5-4460 and GTX 970 SSC don't break a sweat at 1080p. Rock solid 140 fps with G-Sync.As far as game content goes, everything is gooooood! Without good content, why bother playing at all? :DBioshock is one of the best games ever, as well as its sequel and Infinite. Do yourself a favor and play them all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												**** DONT LET THE HOURS FOOL YOU, IVE COMPLETED THIS GAME 5+ TIMES ON ALL DIFFICULTIES ON CONSOLE, THE GAME JUST DOESNT WANNA RUN ON WINDOWS 10****** WILL CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS **9 Years ago, we got Gears of War, Halo 3 and Call of Duty Modern Warfare. It was already a good year for gaming, but then you added Bioshock to the list. A game series that is still my favourite ever, and specifically a game that has been my favourite game of all time for a very very long time. I was 12 or 13 when this game came out. I was more in to the likes of Call of Duty or Gears, but my dad bought me this game for my birthday. I read up a little bit about the game before I started playing and wasnt happy to see it was a single player game with horror aspects.(Im a bit of a baby when it comes to horror games)Regardless, I put the disc in and hit play. This was the moment where a whole new world was opened up to me, Rapture,  Andrew Ryan, Atlas, Splicers and the whole messed up city under the sea. Why are these people so angry? Why do these little girls have glowing eyes? Why am I here?These were questions I had about 30 minutes in to the game.The story of rapture is so unique, and in depth that you wont learn a lot of the current history or lore while playing this game. You need to play Boshock 2 and Infinites DLC to figure out more (I also recommend the book Rapture: Bioshock by John Shirley, this is where youll learn the most about the history of the city under the sea and the people who made it to what it is now).LISTEN TO ALL THE RECORDING TAPES, THIS IS WHERE YOU LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT THE GAMES STORYThe game falls short for a lot of people when it comes to gameplay, and I find that arguable considering the game did come out 9 years ago. But I also think it is a fair thing to consider for new buyers or people looking to get in to the franchise. The combat is dull and simplistic in its own.But I think the fact that there are gun upgrades, plasmids (Plasmids give you different powers to use) and a variety of different ways to go around things when facing enemies, is enough to keep the game exciting when it comes to its fights.The atmosphre and visuals of this game are some of the best in gaming, ever. Bioshock has something of a trick to just make you feel as if you are there, in the world of Rapture. From gardens with poisonious plants, to freezing rooms where you have to melt walls of ice to progress, this game never failsw to make your FEEL your enviroment. Something a lot of games fall short on.The truth is...I cant find anything wrong with this game, its perfect. This game and this series are so special and incredible that I cant give it anything less than a 10/10. This world will amaze you. It will scare you. It will surprise you and it will sadden you. If you havent played this game of any in the series, please, I beg you, play them. This game is an absolute master piece and the other games fall from the same tree. Buy this game, play it, immerse yourself. I promise you 100%, you will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember the first time I saw this game.. I looked at a video of the guy injecting himself with a needle and then bees came out of his hand.. I was like the fu- o.0Years later a friend gifted me the game so I decided to see just how bad it was..Suprise!... The game was actually good? o_oThe story of bioshock is dark. Not as dark as alot of other games but still dark. You play.. (guy I forget the name of.. ahem..) as he crash lands into the sea. Oddly enough rather than checking for survivors or waiting for help he decided to decend into the depths of the ocean in a wierd looking sub thingy. I won't spoil the story but along the way you will meet moral choices that affect how things play out.My moral choices gave me a good ending that was actually really well done. I can't say for the other choices.. The thing about this game is I only played it once.. I saw no replayablity at all. so.. in short.. I can recommend this game but keep in mind you'll probably only play it once. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The atmoshpere and story are incredible and rea;;y immersive, the gameplay is awesome in that it can be as simple or as complex as you'd like with a mix of weapons, plasmids (powers) and hacking, and the difficulty settings are forgiving for FPS noobs such as myself.

That's makes not only a great game but paved the way for a renaissance in immersive sims. Judged by its own merits, it's a great FPRPS that manages to combine great art style, superb voice acting and a good story with great gameplay. Of course everybody knows the big twist, but it's the journey that counts. If only he could have made this game without the shackles of the consoles...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quickly becoming a classic of gaming, bio shock is a fantastic story from start to finish. With fun shooting and elemental mechanics and great atmospheric effects, it does well to hide its age. However, the physics engine of the game runs at a low framerate, and is very noticeable, even on high settings. There is a fix available for this I believe somewhere on the internet, so that may be worth a look.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'd recommend this title simply for it's atmosphere and environment, not to mention that there is a sweet storyline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bioshock series is very throughly enjoyable and always has a constant grip for my attention. This game did not let up with action and excitement. It had a very well thought out storyline with intriging characters and design. There was only a few problems for me; after i saved sometimes the game would crash. Thankfully i saved so nothing was hurt, i just had to start the game back up and continue. The only other problem i had was the final fight against Fontaine... IT TOOK ME LESS THAN 3 MINUTES!!! I was so pumped to get my butt handed to me by this Plasmid Pumping super boss, but I ended up handing his butt to him. I was slightly disappointed by that, but the way the game wrapped up was very nice. Overall, I do HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game. ...Also I now have a fear of Spider Splicers and falling rocks...

												I recomment to play the game till the end. Don't get tired of it in the middle and keep on playing :)+ beautiful unique underwater retro setting with good graphics+ nice horror atmosphere+ action with plasmids and weapons (both effective, upgradable and useful)+ good sounds and music according to the setting+ nice story with surprising ending- a little too long and boring in the middle (stopped playing it for a while then but started again later)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												========================Plot Twist Simulator 2007========================Atmosphere: Fantastic!Graphics: Considered that this is a game from 2007, the graphics are extremely good!Story: The story of the city is the best part about this game, I like the idea of having audio diaries spreaded around the city;(Spoiler!)I have no problem with the good ending, but the two other endings doesn't really make sense for me. The choices that I've made through out the game don't really correlate to those two ending scenes, there is no direct or logical relationship between harvesting little sisters and devouring the surface world. ""But in the end even Rapture was not enough for you..."" Seriously I just want to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of this underwater graveyard!Sound: Great in general, the ambient sounds are nicely done; but the dialogues from random splicers are a bit repetitive (Ive heard the ""Jesus loves me yes I know"" song for like seven times through out the game)Music: Fantastic! They have put a lot of effort into the soundtrack. I love Sander Cohen's masterpiece :DGameplay: The first half of the game is pretty fun, I enjoyed it very much. However during the mid-late game, things get a bit dull without new weapons and new plasmids but only upgrades. Good thing is, the story became more intense during this part of the game so that the game is still fun. The last part of the game gets interesting again because of the new mission type. The boss fight is a bit too easy,you just have to run around in circles, and then the fight is more or less the same as fighting 3 bouncers with bad range attacks, one after another.Overall: 8/10A wonderful game! One of my favourites!Although its gameplay is not as good as Bioshock 2, the mystery and atmosphere have made this game one of the best fps ever.Other notes: Easy mode is extremely easy, play on this setting only if you are new to video games; Medium mode is also easy, play on this setting if you are new to FPS games; Hard mode should be good for most players. On hard mode your health will drain very fast against stronger enemies, so you will have to explore the entire map for resources. Install Mods if you want a ""true"" hard mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's....It's......BIOSHOCK, ♥♥♥♥♥! The game where you play as Jack, our protagonist! His plane crashed in the mid-atlantic, and you swim to a nearby lighthouse to start your adventure through the world of Rapture, an underwater dystopia, filled with crazed spilcers and insane people. Now, BioShock is a brave game, it knows what it wants to be, and it is. BioShock is an amazing, creative, and scary game, and it has left a huge mark in my soul, for being pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scary. Let me give you the good aspects of BioShock, and show you just how good this game is.Good Aspects of Bioshock-First, we have sound, which is amazing in bioshock, when I first went into the medical pavilion, the crazed wails of the splicers could be heard, the spinning of revolver cylinders from the splicers, the scrapeing of pipes against the hard floor, all done extremly well.-Next we have Rapture itself! Rapture was an underwater city designed by andrew ryan, a rich dude who though the surface was corrupted, so he packed up his bags and set out on his big♥♥♥♥♥cruise ship to sail for the perfect place to build. After years of hard work, he made, Rapture......but.....because of the wonder drug, ADAM, the city has fallen apart and now houses the most crazed, gene spliced losers in the whole world. Leaks are abundent, water is found in most places in rapture. Lights are flickering, showing the dead bodies of the sane rapture population. Rapture is done extremly well.-Next we have GRAPHICS! Graphics are amazing for 2007, good one Irrational, good one. Graphics are done extremly well.-Last but not least, we have the storyline! The story of BioShock is about a....well, find that out yourself......I gave you the rapture story, but there are missing pecies......lots....of missing pecies...(Forgot audio logs, good one Irrational, good one.)Movin on to bad aspects, and I'll tell ya, there aren't many.Bad Aspects of Bioshock-Not optimized for windows 7-8, but it works anyway, and the rare times it won't work, fixes are abundent and easy to find.BioShock is a heart pounder,♥♥♥♥♥♥taking, pants♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ classic, and fun adventure, and should be enjoyed by everyone. My Rating: 9.5 out of 10IncredibleRating System:1/10- Complete Garbage1.5/10= Completly Awful2/10- Awful2.5/10= Completly Terrible3/10- Terrible3.5/10-Almost below average4/10- Below Average4.5/10- Mediocre5/10- Average6/10-Decent6.5/10- OK7/10- Good8/10- Great9/10- Awesome9.5/10 Incredible10/10 PerfectNote: THIS IS FROM THE STORE PAGE, I DID NOT WRITE THISStore Page Info:About the GameBioShock is a shooter unlike any you've ever played, loaded with weapons and tactics never seen. You'll have a complete arsenal at your disposal from simple revolvers to grenade launchers and chemical throwers, but you'll also be forced to genetically modify your DNA to create an even more deadly weapon: you. Injectable plasmids give you super human powers: blast electrical currents into water to electrocute multiple enemies, or freeze them solid and obliterate them with the swing of a wrench. No encounter ever plays out the same, and no two gamers will play the game the same way. Biologically modify your body: send fire storming from your fingertips and unleash a swarm of killer hornets hatched from the veins in your arms. Hack devices and systems, upgrade your weapons and craft new ammo variants. Turn everything into a weapon: the environment, your body, fire and water, and even your worst enemies.

												I like a lot of things about this game. It's very interesting that players have the choice of doing different things to have a certain ending (I might of just spoiled it somehow). I like how the game has all these oldschool things to explore. I got this game because it would help me understand more about the latest Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite. I think all the plasmids in the game are all very unique and usful in different ways, and also the weapons. I would give it a 9.2/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, surprise dentist. I screamed.As far as drawbacks go, I wish the weapons system was a little bit more intuitive. I had a hard time switching between Plasmids and Weapons and effectively getting the tool I wanted to use.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved this game. It may be a few years old, but I couldn't tell from the graphics, which were still stellar. The story is extremely well done and engaging throughout- you will be searching for every voxophone and going down every side corridor to learn more. Gameplay was also very fun- I played on Normal difficulty, which was challenging enough that I was never bored, while not being hard enough that I was frustrated. There weren't too many weapons to choose from (and to be honest some just didn't seem that effective compared to the standard Wrench) but I never found myself bored or distracted by that fact. Same with the Plasmids (basically, magic spells)- I almost always used the standard Electric Shock, but the others were still interesting and the gameplay forced you to use some of the other Plasmids in order to unlock secret areas or find hidden voxophones which advanced the story. In sum, I would give this game an 8/10, with a recommendation for people who want an engaging story to go with their gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As long as you make sure to take time to search for supplies, listen to dialogue and research, I can't stress enough research, you will do fine. The plasmids and tonics are very fun.

												I've never had played this game until recently, for some weird reason I've played Bioshock Infinite first, and then after seeing the (amazing) ending I wanted to start from scratch.It's an old game, for sure, but it's amazing. Some parts of it really blew my mind, it's amazingly fun, and I think that for the time it was really revolutionary also, the game mechanics and a lot of stuff you can do is really interesting.But it's not only fun, the story is great too and if you care, it has some level of replayability (some, I actually just saw the alternate ending in YouTube and called it a day, but still).I know it's old news, but I really recommend this game. If you've never played a Bioshock before, start from the beginning and you will really enjoy it. Don't mind that this is an old game, it's really great and it aged really well. If you're still undecided, then you can do as I did and start with Infinite (which is EXCELLENT), but then you will want to start from scratch and play all 3 (as I will do next, for sure).

												I have beaten this game many times getting the good, the bad, and the somewhat neutral endings. I can't help but recommend it! I loved this game so much I even wrote my senior thesis on it (the soundscape specifically).This was a real treat for me back in 2007 when I first played it. Originally I was put off by the E3 trailers but for some reason I gave it a shot and was charmed from the opening cutscene to my heroic ending.The game itself is an FPS with magic/plasmid abilities. You can customize weapons and plasmids to fit your playstyle. I have done playthroughs where I maxed out all my weapons and others where I only used the wrench and the electro bolt (this actually becomes overpowered by the end game). Story, gameplay, customization..you’ve heard it all before and yes it delivers on all of these. I have over 100 hours invested and loved the game so much decided to have a steam copy just in case. If you’re still on the fence, would you kindly just purchase the game! You won’t regret it!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been living under a rock or something, because I'm just now playing Bioshock in 2016. It's been on my ""to play"" list forever. It really is everything I've heard about. Great game. Definitely recommend - still worth playing today.There are plenty of reviews out there with all the good points, so I'm not going to beat a dead horse with that stuff. I did, however  have a couple of gripes with the game:1. I like to play with an xbox 360 controller. The support isn't all that great at times. selecting weapons that are in the diagonals of the selection wheel is almost impossible at times. That gets pretty aggrivating.I even got stuck for a long time on a level solely because of the poor controller support. When I reached the end of the level, I wasn't able to select where I needed to go. I figured I was missing something because my goals were telling me I still needed to collect an item (which was wrong anyways). After returning to the end of the level, I switched over to keyboard and mouse control and was able to select where I needed to go.2. The second gripe was somewhat mentioned above. The goals and hints are pretty bad about updating. At times they are flat out wrong and irrelivant.Minor gripes really. Especially if you don't play with the controller. Like I said though, this is a fantastic game. Wish I had played it sooner.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes I really enjoyed the game !!  It took me 51 hours or so that is what it says feels so much longer .First off I started playing games back in the day of 5.25 floppy drives , Internet what . and a 286 IBM was a top machine .I played a lot of board games mostly Military with my Dad growing up . as he got on in age I found the early games would be a okay substitute .  I wound up actually play testing some games for gary Grigsby . since i owned at the time the 2nd largest full line hobby store in VT specializing in Military models and history ..Okay about Bio shock I bought it on a sale here in the 3 pack . My roommates big shooter /role players say get the 3 pack so I did . Once I leaned the controls / got use to the first person shooting style once more , reminded me of old ,old Wolfenstien .  But with better graphics ,sound and such . Once settling into the game and new type of role playing . I found the game very enjoyable .  The  voice , animations are really nice . there is lots of blood when you kill not any nudity or sex type stuff in the game that i saw through my play through.  Okay I at times took breaks from the game went back to my military tatical games only to be drawn back to Bio shock , to find out what will happen next , where they are going to take me next to complete the task/ goal on hand . I got lost a lot but you hit the map/ hint key and you can figure out what you are doing . @ times I would need to actully take a step back from the game could that puzzle be that easy at this high a level in the game . This was a nice surprise saying that not everything is going always be harder as you go up in levels ,expect the unexpected .Okay look out for the ones that love sneaking up on you from the ceiling Ouch , took me a while to figure out why I was getting beat up before I saw them ...about the only thing that gave me a bad taste in my mouth with this game and this is not a spoiler but was the ending . Yes I spent all these hours , sleepless nights waiting for some major climex to the end game . thinking I would need be respaund several times at least maybe spend a hour trying to figure out the last level the finish to what was a great game full of intrigue  . conBut the end to me was a let down just expecting more then a few sentence type .   This is most likly just me and personal  since like i say I am a big player of Tactical/ strategic  war games . so lets say playing ""Gettysburg Ultimate general ""  all through out the 3 days of simulated battle time ity will build to a ending in good or bad results . Here the game just stopped  and was about it ..  But that is at this point the only issue i found to be negative so since I paid about 15 bucks for all 3 of the Bio shocks  have at least 50+ hrs in so far game 1 only am fairly new to the RPS systems /story type game plays .. I would sum the game up as a Buy Buy Buy  !!!!!!!  even if I do not play the next 2 in the serise  already have gotten more then my monies worth and have enjoyed many of days /nights playing the game . oh well this is only my 2-5 total ever review of a game I get no money or breaks for doing it just started today thinking I bought this game because of reviews  so I am going to review my games as I finish them or have say 20-30+ hours in them or learn the game playing parts so can give a good/bad review of the game . unlike some players right one since they get paid or free copy arangments How can you take a review to heart if the person has say 1.5 hrs of game play for a 60-70 hr game thanks for reading Bob CCrazyBearflutes .com			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always been more of an RPG gal, and avoided FPS games, but this game is a good mix of both. It kept me on the edge of my seat, as they say. In fact, there were quite a few times while playing where I was terrified, skulking around slowly, hearing the voices of enemies, yet unable to see them. This game has stunning visuals, and the audio, well, you have to keep it turned up! I love the dystopian art plastered all over the walls as well! Although the ending was a bit sudden, I loved ithe game! Now, I just have to decide whether to play Bioshock 2 now or Bioshock Infinite!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I took my time with this incredible game, there are so many little nuances here and there that make this game just great and in more ways than I can really count -- so in my play through I decided to really absorb Bioshock in its entirety, taking every one of those nuances in, and trying to just enjoy every single second. I'm not going to tell you ""why"" you should get Bioshock, a lot of these reviews already have noted the meat of the matter a' plenty. What I will tell you, is that inf you enjoy having a lot of fun with gaming -- then this is truly one of those gems. Lots of luck to you in your journey through Rapture... you'll certainly need it.... now ""would you kindly"" just get the game already!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game worthy of praise. Bioshock is an example of a game that does not get repetitive in story. The setting itself is quite original from most shooters to start with. This game also gives you a diverse range of ways to kill opponents and a lot of back story, which is not common for most videogames. The fighting is fairly simple, with a flair for dramatic deaths and a way to make quick allies. The fighting is very satisfying and new players can catch on quickly. The story is so well written and dialouged with excellent voice actors that you are drawn into it. The silent protagonist makes you sympathize with his situation from the very start. The plot twist could not have also been better delivered. The Plasmids also make fighting enemies an extremely creative process, I dare say an art form. No two people may choose the exact same plasmids as another person, making this game very fluid in its ability to offer many ways to combat enemies in the game, not just limited to run and gun. Stealth is also an important component in this game when you are low on ammo or are surrounded by numerous enemies and big daddies, often outting you at a disadvantage. The layout of the levels are also very condusive to the atmosphere and the the music score was flawless. The last thing is that though this game may not be known as a horror title, it definitly has its moments that frighten you. This game is so well made that I would dare recomend it even to people who only like playing sports games. This game whould be labled in my opinion the best well rounded, because of all its attributes and pluses. I can't even really think of anything bad or negative to say, though then again, I never really say anything bad because I always look for what is best in a game. This game has my full confidence. If you are planning to buy, you should have full confidence that this game will give you the best time for your money. ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BioShock is a classic, for good reason.  It has aged well and continues to be just as powerful as it was when released.  I envy the first-time player, as the plot twists will still amaze you, but even the repeat player can quickly find themselves lost in the incredible atmosphere of this game.  Mechanically, it is an above-average FPS that not only provides multiple options for how to handle situations, but each of those options is actually perfectly viable.  The opponents are interesting and Big Daddies still make me dirty my pants.  The last hour of the game is less than perfect, but even that is still better than most other games out there.  Well worth playing, again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bioshock is a classic, for good reason, it's just all around a good game.Bioshock has an interesting setting, with a lot of interesting lore that can be found lying around. Further more, unlike games like morrowind, the game READS them to you, so you don't have to sit there and read for 5  minutes every time you find a book if you want to know the lore.The game is also a good action game. It's not too hard (I felt like it was too forgiving of deaths.)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not much needs to be said about this masterpiece from 2007. There is a reason it was one of 240 games part of The Art of Video Games by Smithsonian American Art Museum.My only complains will have to be the PC port specific (typical) - bad mouse controls, a clunky UI, lack of proper graphic options, and optimization. We all know that KB+M is superior to controller, but maybe the clickityclack should sit out for this one. A remaster would be perfect for the 10 year anniversary, and it would be worth full price if done right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A steam punk horror FPS that will leave your jimmies quite rustled. Bioshock is the first game introduced into what would later become one of the best non-conforming FPS games to date. Filled with many twists and turns that will surely leave you scratching your head and really bringing the undersea world of Rapture to life. Bioshock is an intriguing title that tries, and sometimes fail, to spook you at every turn. The rusted and dilapidated environment accompanied with the pitter-patter of water hitting the  iron-clad walls and floor will bring the city of Rapture to life. An exhilarating story with many M. Night Shyamalan twists that really make the player sit down and think about what has happened through their experience in Rapture. A game that definitely has a story with a punch, but with some lacking basic fundamentals you'd expect to find in a FPS. Unfortunately, Bioshock isn't the best FPS for a number of reasons including difficulty when using spray (it's better to use guns as if they were semi-automatic for accuracy), a lot of the enemies move in strange ways that will cause them to complete dodge your shots if they're a certain distance from you (makes it very difficult unless you're aiming low when they are meleeing), and worst of all your only melee weapon is garbage even with all of the upgrades equipped. This makes medium to long range fights the best for you but there's constantly something running at you in your face. The FPS mechanics do take some getting used to and are pretty interesting, the fact that you don't zoom with right mouse button but with Z is definitely something most FPS don't do. Over the years the graphics have held up very well too and at the time of it's release it was hailed for it's intense computer requirements (thankfully much easier to acquire now). Bioshock is a title that deserves respect and while it's not fundamentally the best game the story is worth at least one trip though.☆★★★★ Overall ☆★★★★ Gameplay ★★★★★ Story ☆★★★★ Graphics ☆★★★★ Sounds ☆★★★★ Oddity ☆☆★★★ Length ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite possibly my favourite game of all time.BioShock puts you in the shoes of a man named Jack, his plane crashing in the middle of the ocean.  With nowhere to go, he spots a lighthouse.  Going inside, he takes a Bathysphere into the underwater world of Rapture, a city where the brightest sparks of society have gathered.  Quite quickly you begin to notice that, while looking pretty on the outside, the city isn't what it seems to be; non-existent morals and a civil war have turned this city into an abandoned mess, its inhabitants becoming addicts and constantly searching for the wonder drug ADAM.  Having to defend yourself with weapons made by man and superpowers developed by the citizens (fueled by EVE) you'll have to protect yourself as everyone comes after you.  The rest of the plot is more enjoyable to experience yourself so I'll just stop here.This game is simply amazing.  The graphics still look great to me after SEVEN YEARS, Rapture itself still being nice to look at.  The atmosphere is fantastic and, for once, I actually gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the collectible items; the audio diaries you find are interesting and enjoyable to listen to, each one being a treat.  Combat is cool, the enemies are fun to fight, the characters are all extremely interesting, everything is a treat.  What the best feature was for me however was definitely the story of Rapture itself; a city gone mad, its leaders going crazy for power, a war tearing it apart, it's truly phenomenal.One can only ask how a game can be made as a spiritual successor yet still define itself in its own way.  Then you get BioShock and you understand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The setting of rapture is really fantastic and stuff happened in rapture makes it more interesting.However, before you get the game you should be aware with the sound issueI was so excited to play this game but unforunately the sounds would die on me EVERYTIME after opening cutsceneTried sound uninstall, sound mix, mic slot plug-in, -nosound, -dx9, bioshock icon with compatability windows xp service 2 with adamin (this would make my game crash when launch) I have windows 8.1 and was getting frustrated until i also tried changing ""steam icon"" (not the shortcut but one under program folder) compatability to windows xp service pack 2 and WHOLA! it WORKED finallly SOUNDS!I dunno if it will work for you as well, but if it does, now you can enjoy the game with sounds!

												'A man choose, a slave obeys.'These words remain resonant in my head after playing Bioshock. Its one of those games which makes you question humanity and whether us as humans are men or slaves.The gameplay, whilst a little clunky, is satisfying and varied, although the Telekninesis plasmid is ridiculously powerful. The atmosphere is incredible and Rapture really sucks you in as a world. The story is also fantastic, however I found the ending to be slightly lackluster. (I harvested the sisters)Overall then, Bioshock is a masterpiece. The game holds you and doesn't let go until you force yourself to put the controller down.9.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What Bioschock lacks in gameplay fluidity as a first person shoother it makes up for with it's incredibly emmersive atmosphere. Though the incorporation of the plasmids is far from perfect and require you to switch not only between regular weapons but also between plasmids it's also fitting for the game because it makes you think more carefully about the attack combinations you are going to apply to each situation. If you make the mistake of equipping the wrong plasmid after discharging an entire cartridge on a big daddy he will make meatballs out of you.One thing that also works very well is the inclusion of RPG-like elements, such as different ammo types and power upgrades, that add another level of deapth to the game (pun intened) and require you to think more strategically and allow you to handle similar scenarios in different ways according to the upgrades you have.All this elements are combined perfectly with an intelligent and compelling story to create the experience that is Bioshock.

												In my highly valid and valued opinion this game is by far the scariest and most atmospherical game ever. Also it made me interested in the story behind rapture and its inhabitants. I am Andrew Ryan and I am here to ask you a question: Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? No, says the man in Washington; it belongs to the poor. No, says the man in the Vatican; it belongs to God. No, says the man in Moscow; it belongs to everyone. I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose...Rapture.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioshock is a very good game. The story line is confusing at times, but is very good. The game can be a bit creepy/scarry. There may be somethings that make you jump. (aka enemies coming out of wierd places right behind you.) The game play is amazing. It's very easy to pick up. (Your typical FPS)  Just something to think about: It took me just around ten (10) hours to complete the game on EASY mode. Have not gone back to revisit the story, but it is a short-ish game.

												Bioshock takes all of the lame parts of ""Atlas Shrugged"" and replaces them with guns and bees that shoot out of your hands, and then sets the whole thing underwater.

												None FPS fans read on!I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a fan of FPS games.  They bore me to death in all honesty; so it was with some trepidation I gave Bioshock a go, having picked up all three games for a fiver in the Steam summer sale (can't go wrong for five quid, surely, I thought).I am pleased to say that Bioshock is a fantastic game.  Rapture is remarkable.  The whole game has a very unique feel to it, and best of all, once you get into it, you have the option of how to play - you don't have to barrel through the corridors all guns blazing if you don't want to.  Instead I chose to creep around, hurling bees at the Splicers which was frankly as amusing the hundredth time to me as it was the first.The story is very good, boosted significantly by the environment, which makes you want more.  Having just finished the vastly inferior Bioshock Infinite I can in all honesty say that Bioshock is a one of a kind game; from stepping through those doors for the first time to the brief but satisfying (or not so much depending on your choices thoughout the game) ending, this is the kind of game that comes along once every so often and won't be repeated.Thumbs up, would shoot bees from hands again ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been taking the time to think about BioShock. On one hand, there is the ""Cult of Shock 2"" that retain a savage disdain for BioShock because of it's extremely obvious narrative and gameplay similarities to System Shock 2. On the other hand, there are gamers that reasonably acknowledge that BioShock's elements are derivitive of System Shock 2 and claim that the elements were streamlined for a newer generation. I know BioShock fans that have given copious amounts of evidence and suggestions to back this up, and I don't necessarily agree or disagree with that. That is a matter of prefrence. When someone takes the time to deconstruct and analyze System Shock 2, you'll find that it is a deeply and intracately woven role-playing experience where the player needed to become familliar with varying amounts of important elements to create their characters, specialize in specific statistics, and really just to experience the game once as an introduction to it all and play through a second time to experience the game properly. Many critics praised these very aspects that made System Shock 2 one of the greatest games ever created and the sales were miserable.When someone takes the time to deconstruct and analyze BioShock, you'll find a game that has that overall feeling of intracacy laced within the narrative with more understandable gameplay elements that were designed, in principle, to appeal to a large audience. There are elements that can be considered RPG elements and the game had the basis of it's core gameplay display itself as a suspense game in a few areas and a balls-to-the-wall action FPS in most others. The gaming community—especially the parts of it that sided with the ""Cult of Shock 2""—was split and BioShock became 2K Games' most profitable franchise at that time.When you take a look at the bigger picture, System Shock 2 and BioShock are two completely different games in principle and two very similar games in execution. When you get down to it, the ""dumbing down"" of System Shock 2's qualities was enforced, not by a corporate publisher or a greedy fat man in a black suit, but by the developers' own desire to make their baby, System Shock 2, more understandable. If you take the time to search up some interviews and stuff for System Shock 2 featuring Ken Levine and Looking Glass Studios (which is now 2K Games), you can tell that System Shock 2 was their pride and joy, and it must have been devastating when it became ignored by the central PC community. To that extent, I can understand more reasonably (and even forgive) a few of my previous issues with this title. I used to have a psychotic hatred for this game based on System Shock 2, and my previous review that I wrote for this game was an over-glorified comparison to System Shock 2. I'm not going to make the same mistake here in this rewrite, as I've come to the conclusion that to judge BioShock by System Shock 2 would be very unfair, as I think any fan of System Shock 2 would probably agree when I say that System Shock 2 is the better of the two titles.BioShock, on its own, is an okay game. I don't think it's the genre-defining work of art that the gaming industry seems to think it is, but I don't think that it's the water-logged, hollowed out corpse of SS2 that the ""Cult of Shock 2"" thinks it is. It does a few things right and it does a lot of things wrong, and in the very end it's up to the fans of System Shock 2 to decide whether or not they want to take BioShock as its own experience. As one of the BIGGEST fans of SS2 out there, I'm reviewing this game from that perspective.The gameplay elements found in BioShock all consist of unorthodox forms of first-person shooting and RPG elements without numbers. This game borrows implicitly from SS2's horror elements by including a few scenes that really do peak the player's intrest, but the attempts at horror are completely futile. The game can't be called a survival game because it isn't one, and resource management is way too easy, even on difficulty settings over Normal. These sections are far and few between as most of the game plays as a balls-to-the-wall action shooter. However, these sections are mediated by fluent pace changes every so often. Whereas other games from 2007 would often have you just shooting at everything coming by, this game takes a slower, more methodical approach to let you appreciate the vibe of what you're doing and really take in the enviorment as well as the NPCs populating it. The NPCs are hopeless drug addicts; you're a killer, and you feel like one...except when you deal with Big Daddies and Little Sisters.Despite everything else wrong with the game, *BIG DADDIES ARE FRIGGING AWESOME*, and anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't played this game. The Little Sisters, on the other hand, are the *lowest* rung on the morality ladder. Essentailly, the Little Sisters are little girls that you can either choose to save or harvest for Adam. You get more Adam for harvesting them and less for saving them. If you save all of them, you get the good ending, and if you harvest just ONE of them, you get the bad ending. Without spoiling anything, they both mean absolutely nothing and you can just watch them on YouTube. Without any character development, killing or saving the Little Girls becomes based on the reward. Would you rather have less Adam or more Adam? Exactly.The gunplay is very unsatisfying. I'm going to be a hypocrite for a few characters and say that SS2 also had unsatisfying gunplay, but you almost never used your gun because ammo was low and most of the gunplay was backed up by the horror elements of the game. Here, the weak sounding weapons and overexaggerated reactions result in gunplay that feels like a chore to sort through. There are moments when it's satisfying to take down a Big Daddy, but that's satisfaction from the challenge and not the actual gunplay.Besides shooting, BioShock includes two performance enhancing bodily modifications called ""Plasmids"" and ""Gene Tonics"". Plasmids are essentially powers you recieve from completing missions (and you can always buy them at the vending machine). Gene Tonics are the RPG Elements without numbers I was writing about earlier. They are pretty much character enhancements that set up your character to adopt certain play styles. For example, you can put together an invisibility tonic and a melee damage tonic to take on the role of a stealth assassin. For the game's other shortcomings, that's pretty cool.The game also features hacking mini-games in the form of circuit-based puzzles. You connect a set of pipes so water can successfully travel from one end of the circuit to another. While doing this, the game pauses and you always will have the right pieces at the right time, killing tension. If they really wanted to include some much needed tension, then they could have accelerated the current of the water whenever a piece was misplaced, or they could have provided a certain amount of each directional pipe, causing some inevitable ambiguation as to where to construct a direct path. They also could have made it so there was a tangible loss with each failure. There is no tangible loss when dying. There are Vita Chambers, which are essentially respawn points that make the game much easier than it already is, and then there's just going back to the main menu if you decide to shut it off.Like I said, I don't hate BioShock, nor do I carry the attitude I once had towards it like the ""Cult of Shock 2"". I don't think it's a revolutionary work of art either. I think it's okay. Not terrible, but not great. It's great in some areas and abhorrent in others, and what's there good is great and what's bad is horrible.3/5 - Okay. Worth a rental or a purchase (only if the price goes down).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is not much to tell people reading reviews for Bioshock. If u don't know the game yet u missed a big part of FPS history. It's dark it's fast and it's incredible awesome.Wait for a sale and get it if u missed your chance so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In lieu of a review, I'll just post this conversation. Who really needs another review of Bioshock anyway?21:37 < Link> i think i figured out why i dont like bioshock21:42 < Link> I just can't self project hard enough to get into the story. because there is no character you play as, it's just you, at least until the twist I vaguely remember jon telling me about21:43 < Link> you don't get a name, body type, face, anything to go off of. all you see are the guy's hands, and he never talks, so there is no character to speak of... so it's basically a third person story but you the player have been shoehorned into the plot because that's how games work21:44 < Link> It's like I don't even know why I'm fighting or doing anything. to survive is probably a good assumption but it's just..... eh21:47 < Link> Even though FEAR also does this... FEAR gets a pass by the engine just being superior and generally more fun to be in and play with. and actually you even have SOME established personality that the other characters refer to, and you can infer things by how ppl interact with you21:47 < Link> in bioshock so far I just get talked at by a one way radio21:50 < Link> and idk. FEAR's world promises something more around every corner too. In rapture, it's just like... yeap, more splicers.21:51 < Link> been there done that21:51 < Zooby> Link: the funny part is, that is actually the theme21:51 < Zooby> "" you don't get a name, body type, face, andthing to go off of.21:51 < Zooby>                   all you see are the guy's hands, and he never talks, so there21:51 < Zooby>                   is no character to speak of...""21:52 < Zooby> the theme of the character anyways21:52 < Link> 'self insert man'?21:53 < Zooby> like, it basically ends up saying ""you're a doll, bro""21:53 < Link> oh true21:54 < Zooby> not protecting the game; just finding it funny21:54 < Link> yeah I'm just having problems enjoying the being a doll ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arguably the defining videogame of the 2000s. Rapture is one of the most unique and intriguing places to visit, and the story turn two thirds of the way through the game not only turns Bioshock on its head, but unveils interesting questions about the nature of videogames themselves.

												As a game alone, could I recommend Bioshock?  The gunplay is floaty and 'off'.  It's difficult to explain, but the guns in Bioshock don't give as much feedback and aren't as satisfying as guns in games today.  Even comparing it to other games around the time of its release in 2007 doesn't do it much good.  Okay, so boo hoo, the ""Run 'n' Gun"" strategy isn't going to work in this game.  However, another mechanic balances this out - the use of plasmids.  These genetically granted powers allow you to stun, burn, and freeze enemies, allowing for a wide variety of strategies and traps. Zapping an enemy with lightning sure does make it a lot easier to get close enough to force-feed him a belt of ammo.Exploration is very rewarding in this game.  So much so, that if you're like me, you'll end up being full of loot half the time.  While I thought that they could scale back on how much loot was lying around the ravenged city of Rapture, I really liked the map you're given.  It highlighted areas you had already explored, which meant you wouldn't spend ten minutes backtracking trying to find that one door you *thought* was where you were supposed to go, so you skipped it to keep looking for loot, but it turns out you actually went the right way and so now you need to find it again to explore the hallway and two rooms behind it.I also really liked how fights with the Big Daddies worked.  They weren't agressive unless you attacked them, meaning you could hold off killing them until you were prepared; however, even when fully prepared, Big Daddies have a couple different attacks, making them formidable opponents.Based on gameplay alone, Bioshock is fun, but it hasn't exactly aged gracefully.  Don't interpret that to mean I don't like the game though.  Both the story and characters are very engaging.  It's the small things, like the interactions between the Big Daddies and their Little Sisters and ""idle dialouge"" (randomly chosen lines spoken by enemies that have little to no bearing on the story/plot and only serve to heighten atmosphere), that really made me enjoy this game.Having just competed the entire game a second time, I plan on going back for at least a third.

												Bioshock is a near flawless game.  At the time of writing this review, I may only have a few hours on record, but I plan to rectify that shorlty.  I originally played this game on ps3, then I went to the 360 and owned it there a few dozen times, and let me say, this game is phenominal.  The game takes you on an incredibly revolutionary journey for a fps in terms of story, gunplay (this is more than just a gun game; there is no ""mowing"" down people in this game).  The atmoshere of this game is wonderful, the rpg elements are great, the enemies are diverse and creepy, and the game has so much going for it. The game is linearish, meaning you go here, then there, then there, but there are optional places to explore (in depth) at every turn, so while you can probably rush through a corridor and beat the game in like 7 hours, if you play it the right way, this game should take you at lest 12 hours to beat, and you may not replay it immediately, but I did.  And you definately will play it eventually again, it is just so phenominal.  Please. buy.  now.  right now.  Click add to cart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's makes not only a great game but paved the way for a renaissance in immersive sims. Judged by its own merits, it's a great FPRPS that manages to combine great art style, superb voice acting and a good story with great gameplay. Of course everybody knows the big twist, but it's the journey that counts. If only he could have made this game without the shackles of the consoles...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seeing the ridiculous amounts of hype, i could not wait to play Bioshock.With its apparently mesmerising storyline and beautiful…well, everything. It seemed like it would be the perfect game for me...The storyline, i must say is truly wonderful, an innovative idea that's extremely well thought out and executed. This is accompanied by the also stunning visuals and environment style which are perfect for achieving the grungy, dystopian and eerie style that’s so synonymous with the series.Unfortunately, this did not make me impressed enough with the game enough to actually fall in love with it, or even like it slightly more than the average RPG. The gameplay style is very original, making it more of a ‘real life gun holding simulator’ than an FPS. This was highly annoying at times unfortunately.  Although this style has it’s charms, its slightly more irritating than ‘fun’.  Plasmids are pretty damn awesome but after using them on your 5000th bot, they get very boring. Which brings me on to my next point… It’s so damn repetitive. With the occasional plot point being the only thing that’s keeping you going, you battle through hordes of splicers again and again… and again…Basically, the longer you play, the more bored you get. With one or two twists in the story line that re-activate your interest in the game occasionally, I can say… I was vey disappointed in the game.It’s a beautifully made, artistic… boring game. Not saying it's bad, but its just quite boring at times. 60/100BTW This is a good game, but during the middle of it? It's pretty damn boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, surprise dentist. I screamed.As far as drawbacks go, I wish the weapons system was a little bit more intuitive.

												Played it for years on the 360, picked it up on Steam. By far my favorite game of all time, the other positive reviews seem to nail why the story and atmosphere are so solid. I would personally like to add that the satire in this game is incredible if you take the time to do your research and understand it. A fantastic piece of philosophy.The game shows its age mechanically on my newer OS's and systems, but it is by no means unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

BioShock™ as well as the Bioshock series will always remain as one of the best FPS game. The storyline is very thought-provoking with breathtaking twist and turns, together with many riddles throughout the game, from collecting and listening to diaries, to solving puzzels in order to advance through the game. It will surely bring you an awesome experience (and touching as well...). The AI are well designed, they are not some random guys just standing there waiting to be killed. To be honest, sometimes the Splicers, specially Big Daddies really annoyed me because it took me a while in order to defeat just only one guy (but still, i think that's what made BioShock even better). When i see the graphics in game, i couldn't belive this game was released in 2007. The landscape in Rapture is so realistic, the lights, the water, the smoke, the blood, all contributed to the ""Fallen Rapture"" scenery perfectly. The gameplay is great too, at first when i was entering Rapture as Jack, i knew i had to play ""sneaky-beaky like."" But as i advanced throughout the game, i realized that i can both stealth and play ""Rambo"" at the sametime. And believe me, it feels really awesome when you've killed a Leadhead Splicer (LoL). The sound also made big contributions to the game as well, this is the first game that allows me to hear the enemies singing, muttering, or just talking about weird-random things, it made me feel creepy and funny at the same time.I don think that this game has any cons, it's just too perfect, and here are my ratings:Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 9.5/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 9.5/10""And now, would you kindly buy and play this game without hesitation?""

												This is honestly one of my favorite games of all time, due to it's incredible story, atmosphere, and social commentary. The graphics are still stunning for this day and age, but you shouldn't even think of playing this game for graphics. Do that with Bioshock Infinite. This game, though, is raw and horrific. It is relentless and will have you questioning your morals while playing it. While not open world, Bioshock has an incredibly captivating setting of Rapture, an underwater city ravaged by political corruptness. The special ""abilities"" of freezing, electrocuting, and tormenting people feels sadistically satisfying, and gunplay is comfortable for even the most experienced FPS players. The atmosphere never lets up, and you will come across things you can't believe - characters with sickening goals and disturbing monologues. One early game, a doctor, is incredibly terrifying. But, enough rambling - I can't stress enough that you need to sit down with this game and appreciate what a gem it is in the gaming industry.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly stunning game that is utterly amazing and that I would highly recommend buying. It is a very fun fps that you can either breeze through or challenge yourself. It also has a beautiful, beautiful story, this is a game where you go out of your way to find out as much of the story line you just can. The combat is very fun and gives a new play style to fps and is a very unique game which is just wonderfully done.A few thingsIf you are weak at horror games this might be a little scary and I myself got a bit a scared on some parts. While it may be creepy I do not believe it to be a true horror game rather jut creepy and gory.It has recordings on parts and I would recommend finding as many of those as you can even if you it isn’t necessary it just adds to the games feel and gives a more fun experience. The game is very different from the average shooter and the combat is very enjoyable with many different powers and plasmids (awesome powers that you shoot out from your hand) you get to freeze, burn, sting (yes sting with bees), electrocute and blow up your foes.The story is very, very good and has a pretty well done ending that was satisfying and I myself intend to play it again and try to find a few of the recordings I missed.

												BioShock is a classic, for good reason.  It has aged well and continues to be just as powerful as it was when released.  I envy the first-time player, as the plot twists will still amaze you, but even the repeat player can quickly find themselves lost in the incredible atmosphere of this game.  Mechanically, it is an above-average FPS that not only provides multiple options for how to handle situations, but each of those options is actually perfectly viable.  The opponents are interesting and Big Daddies still make me dirty my pants.  The last hour of the game is less than perfect, but even that is still better than most other games out there.  Well worth playing, again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In lieu of a review, I'll just post this conversation. Who really needs another review of Bioshock anyway?21:37 < Link> i think i figured out why i dont like bioshock21:42 < Link> I just can't self project hard enough to get into the story. because there is no character you play as, it's just you, at least until the twist I vaguely remember jon telling me about21:43 < Link> you don't get a name, body type, face, anything to go off of. all you see are the guy's hands, and he never talks, so there is no character to speak of... so it's basically a third person story but you the player have been shoehorned into the plot because that's how games work21:44 < Link> It's like I don't even know why I'm fighting or doing anything. to survive is probably a good assumption but it's just..... eh21:47 < Link> Even though FEAR also does this... FEAR gets a pass by the engine just being superior and generally more fun to be in and play with. and actually you even have SOME established personality that the other characters refer to, and you can infer things by how ppl interact with you21:47 < Link> in bioshock so far I just get talked at by a one way radio21:50 < Link> and idk. FEAR's world promises something more around every corner too. In rapture, it's just like... yeap, more splicers.21:51 < Link> been there done that21:51 < Zooby> Link: the funny part is, that is actually the theme21:51 < Zooby> "" you don't get a name, body type, face, andthing to go off of.21:51 < Zooby>                   all you see are the guy's hands, and he never talks, so there21:51 < Zooby>                   is no character to speak of...""21:52 < Zooby> the theme of the character anyways21:52 < Link> 'self insert man'?21:53 < Zooby> like, it basically ends up saying ""you're a doll, bro""21:53 < Link> oh true21:54 < Zooby> not protecting the game; just finding it funny21:54 < Link> yeah I'm just having problems enjoying the being a doll ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arguably the defining videogame of the 2000s.

												After finishing this game and this being my first FPS game I cleared on my channel, Bioshock came off at first as this nightmarish type of steampunk that I ever came across.  The story came off a bit noir-ish but as I started to put more time into the sections, the story got more intriguing and I wanted to know more.  Since a buddy of mine did the game on his stream, he got me the first and last games in the series and in time, I plan to do the second game as well as the last game.  But it has given me an even fonder respect for a stand alone FPS that isn't bogged down by the multiplayer aspect that some (and very few) FPS games have.  If you like Steampunk, you'll enjoy Bioshock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It isn't just about going around and shooting stuff, that is just a small fraction of a whole new and unique environment. As you make your way through the ravaged city and deal with crazed citizens, it doesn't only make you feel what the underwater city of Rapture has gone through, but it makes you see that it was once a beautiful, thriving place full of life, aswell. It sets such a strong atmosphere that you'll truly experience every inch of this city and it's story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seeing the ridiculous amounts of hype, i could not wait to play Bioshock.With its apparently mesmerising storyline and beautiful…well, everything. It seemed like it would be the perfect game for me...The storyline, i must say is truly wonderful, an innovative idea that's extremely well thought out and executed. This is accompanied by the also stunning visuals and environment style which are perfect for achieving the grungy, dystopian and eerie style that’s so synonymous with the series.Unfortunately, this did not make me impressed enough with the game enough to actually fall in love with it, or even like it slightly more than the average RPG. The gameplay style is very original, making it more of a ‘real life gun holding simulator’ than an FPS. This was highly annoying at times unfortunately.  Although this style has it’s charms, its slightly more irritating than ‘fun’.  Plasmids are pretty damn awesome but after using them on your 5000th bot, they get very boring. Which brings me on to my next point… It’s so damn repetitive. With the occasional plot point being the only thing that’s keeping you going, you battle through hordes of splicers again and again… and again…Basically, the longer you play, the more bored you get. With one or two twists in the story line that re-activate your interest in the game occasionally, I can say… I was vey disappointed in the game.It’s a beautifully made, artistic… boring game. Not saying it's bad, but its just quite boring at times. 60/100BTW This is a good game, but during the middle of it? It's pretty damn boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The atmosphere in Bioshock is one of the most memorable parts for me when I first played this game. Rapture is one of the most dramatic and beautiful cities created in a game, that lets you get fully immersed in its lore and enviroments. From the frightening opening, and through the whole harrowing of the underwater city the game gives you something new every step of the way. The story is the other greatest element, for it is full of memorable characters and unpredictable plot twists. I was able to perfectly run the game on my PC, with only two ocasions of crashes, one being my own fault (do not throw a gas cylinder at the tennis ball machine.) It is a great FPS that everyone interested in the genre should try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll never forget how incredible the first 30 minutes of game play was to me when i first got this. It had been out for a few months by this point and incredibly i had heard nothing of the game other than a vague report from a friend it might be alright (months before it's release). The events of those first thirty minutes (trying not to give anything away here) quite literally had me sitting on the edge of my seat mouth open wide. It wasn't just the story, it was the immersion effect it had on me. Had a console version back then and played it through a few times.Now owing a pc version i decided to have another wander through Rapture. Boy am i glad i did! Lots of things i remembered, plenty i forgot. But what really had me was how well it has stood up to the test of time. I just plain enjoy everything about this game. Graphics and animations are beautiful with creative level design coupled with dynamic lighting that really gives the sensation of being on the bottom of the ocean, even if it is a little dated. Yes there is a bit of backward and forward grinding to be done mission wise, but the story/tapes you uncover along the way i feel are worth it and help the overall story. All in all Bioshock is a classic and a fantastic 25-35 hour adventure. My Specs: i7 4770          16GB Ram                  GTX770 OC (4GB VRAM)Thanks for reading! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic. Good storyline. Graphics hold up very well. It's a good PC version.Although it says: partial controller support, the x360 Pad is fully supported. To enter gamepad mode you have to use kb/mouse once though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played BioShock Infinite before playing this one; regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and highly recommend. The parallels between both games and great plots make both timeless masterpeices.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic that I keep coming back to.  Don't bother with the second, but this game and Infinite are great.  Weapons are limited, but the ones you have are fun and satisfying.  The story is the best part by far, and you'll find yourself fighting through guys just to find out what happens next.  DISCLAIMER: You will be disappointed by the boss battle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. If you enjoy a couple of pop-scares, frequent sub-boss battles with Big Daddies, a huge plot twist, the choice of 3 different endings, and a big evil liar that looks like a bronze statue... THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!! So, WOULD YOU KINDLY buy this game >:D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always been more of an RPG gal, and avoided FPS games, but this game is a good mix of both. It kept me on the edge of my seat, as they say. In fact, there were quite a few times while playing where I was terrified, skulking around slowly, hearing the voices of enemies, yet unable to see them. This game has stunning visuals, and the audio, well, you have to keep it turned up! I love the dystopian art plastered all over the walls as well! Although the ending was a bit sudden, I loved ithe game! Now, I just have to decide whether to play Bioshock 2 now or Bioshock Infinite!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
