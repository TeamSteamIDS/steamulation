												You're probably reading this because you liked the tank scenes in the movie Tron.Not coincidentally, Meridian4 made Tank Universal because THEY liked the tank scenes in Tron.And I bought it because I like the... well, you know.  And it definitely has a certain Tron vibe, only instead of Jeff Bridges, the protagonist is a bored, incapacitated old man.  Compelling!Am I glad I bought it?  Yes, because now I don't have to wonder if I was missing out on something great.  So IS Tank Universal great?  No.  Is it worth your time as a die-hard Tron fan?  Possibly.  And if you've never seen Tron?  Less, um... possibly.Ask yourself:""Do I enjoy Tron-inspired games where the primary mechanic is mentally calculating how to hit moving targets from a moving vehicle on sloped sufaces with a relatively slow-moving projectile that is affected by gravity (even though the existance of gravity in a digital world makes no sense)?""If the answer is ""yes"" and you have $5 to spare, buy Tank Universal.But also ask yourself:""Am I deeply annoyed by incoherent/irrelevant storylines, especially when I'm forced to endure them in lengthy, unskippable cinematics?""""Do my eyes roll back into my head during tedious, unnecessary travel sequences through static environments with no interaction?""""Do I have a hard time letting go of my nagging sensation that a game, for some unknown reason, isn't as good as it could have been?""""Did I hate Tron?""If the answer is ""yes"" to any of these, consider passing over Tank Universal.  Maybe the tank moved a little too slugishly, or maybe the upgrading & leveling system lacked the right incentives or rewards.  I could never figure it out.  The game always felt like off-brand Legos: that kind that fit together, though not quite right, and never with that secure, satisfying ""click"" of precision.  Don't get me wrong, it's still fun, but why didn't Grandma just buy EXACTLY what I WROTE on my *** **** LIST!?!?  Sorry, I'm thinking of my 9th birthday.  What were we talking about again?

												This is TRON, 1990's style.I say this with love for this game, Tank Universal, that without directly infringing on copyright the authors have adapted the game style around our favorite classic movie in an impressive way! Tank Universal sticks to just the tank battles rather than all the different gaming styles it's obvious inspiration, the movie TRON, taught us about. This indie developer hit the mark with a sweet blend of tank simulation that is fun to play. It really feels like you are another human wandering the computer plains in a parallel story to the original TRON movie.The game only has one real weakness, it wasn't an officially licenses TRON game. Because of this it doesn't have the strongest story line in terms of dialog and has to makes up for it in presentation. It does this in spades however and can keep you engrossed as you truly feel like you are alive in the original TRON world. Most of the time, in game, I felt as though a greater story line could have come about if only the author wasn't skirting copyright. There is an epic sense of why you are playing that feels like it needs stated outright. This is obvious, for those of us who have seen the original TRON. Without being able to state the complete and rather epic story that is hidden within Tank Universals premise, the story comes off shallow and lacking. It feels like we missed the main plot line of something truly epic. Despite this flaw, the game is incredibly fun.This game is great in what it does, it does WELL! The tank battles are fun, and can be quite challenging! The battlefield is a living environment and there are some decent physics at play. There is even a small amount of strategy in how you attack directly affects the results of battles. Watch as the enemy rebuilds his fortress if you slack off on the attack; beware indirect fire, and call in a Titan to literally tear down your enemies walls.I only wish that Tank Universal had been a licensed TRON game as this is what the first 3D TRON game should have been. The licensed official game should have been the sequel to this one! All fans of the movie and or tank battles should try this game out!Tanks / Simulator combat / indie / simple strategy / retro style			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tank Universal is a great throwback to VR, TRON, Battlezone, and just plain old-school gaming full of action and strategy.It's plain as day that Tank Universal is not a professional game - the basic animation, the chunky graphics, the lack of any voice acting whatsoever - but it clearly has heart. While not perfect, for its price, indie roots and throw back to the movie “Tron”, this is a must buy for action gamers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. This game surprised me. Very fun game & very unique in some aspects, the game gives off a neat Tron like feel, if Tron was a complete warzone anyway. Story wise Tank Universal delivers, I'm only a few hours into the main story but it's pretty fun, the only dissapointment is that they set it up that you're some old guy using a simulation helmet.. ruins a bit of immersion, but oh well! The actual story is pretty fun to play but so far I've realised there's a lot of empty parts of the game where you're just driving endlessly to get to your next objective which can be a bit drab.When you're actually in a battle though the game is very exciting to play, alongside a ranking up system with Steam achievements to match your rank the game can make it feel rewarding to excel in combat.Overall? Great game but the level design needs to be worked on, and there's a lack of a proper skirmish mode (Maybe you unlock it when you complete the game?) -Also the music they have in the game.. perfect, well suited to it's theme. 8/10 I would love to see these developers have a kickstarter to make a much more advanced version of the game too.

												This game is one of those games I picked up for cheap and looked at the screenshots to see a ""Tron"" like game with tanks, I thought to my self, that looks fun, ill play it.Honestly, I do not regret this purchase, Yeah sure the graphics may be dated, The framerate might be a issue for some (capped at 30 I believe, but that never stopped me from having fun), but seeing past all this, is not a bad game. Fun for those who want to burn up some time or want to witness a story in-between a base building/Tank warfare game.But hands down the best part of this game, you get to ride a sheep at one point, annoying at first to control but fun.If you are someone who can see past problems and isn't bothered by them, get this game and waste a few hours on it, you might actually like it.

												At first glance, the appeal of this game comes from the contrasting colors of its tron inspired graphic style, although it is not a graphically intensive game. The graphic style works well given the story of the game and some tidbits like animations for dying, respawning, and starting a level. Something that was bugging me about the game, however, is that after doing some searching online the developers of the game stated that the game was locked at 30 fps. I'm not playing on a potato here. The sound is appropriate to the visual style of the game and changes to accent certain in game events, but it can get repetitive.As for the gameplay of this game, you wander around some twenty odd levels as either a tank or a soldier on foot. As a foot soldier you don’t have weapons and can only run around and use a shield and its gameplay consists of either exploring around structures that are too cramped for a tank or running across a battlefield and using your shield to protect you. As a tank, you go around the map completing objectives such as traveling to advance the story, escorting units, or base defense/offense where you have to build up your base and capture the enemy key/flag while keeping your own safe. During the base missions, you don’t have to micro manage units or building anything, all you usually need to do is bring a resource to the base to make it begin construction and mark resources for harvesting and the computer will automatically build things. You also have only one primary weapon, the tank’s cannon which can be charged for more area of effect and damage, but charge resets if you are damaged. You also need to collect shards from killed enemies to use powerups such as sprinting or firing rockets or summoning units. Once you have enough shards you can use any power that you have unlocked according to its cost. To unlock these power ups and upgrade them, certain tasks will give you points to upgrade them as will finishing levels and you have to go to an upgrade station as a tank. Some power ups can be used with only a few shards and others are very powerful, but you need to save the shards; but I personally preferred to use them on sprinting most of the time.Many of the levels give you the idea that the world is huge and as such, you are incredibly slow without sprinting, but your sprinting is limited by these shards which only drop upon killing enemies. This problem is compounded by the game’s respawn locations and lack of a save system. If you die on some levels, you could be ages away from the next objective, but at least you will respawn with some shards to spring back, if only for a little while. As for the lack of a save system, you must complete a level in full or your progress will not be saved, so make sure that if you play this game that you can commit some time into finishing a level or just idle on it. If it weren’t for the slow pace of the game compounded with sometimes terrible respawning locations, the game would be more enjoyable, but it is still worth playing it to play something that is a different genre.

												If you're of that age where you watched Tron on the big screen and marvelled at the visual style, then you've come to the right place.Of all the Tron-related games and sequel movies (and I include Tron 2.0 in this!), I think this game comes the closest to replicating the ""feel"" of the world of the first Tron movie.   The only thing missing are the discs and the clank-clank as you walk around (which Tron 2.0 got so so right for me)..So, what is Tank Universal? Well, it's a Tron-homage-labour-of-love.  It's clearly an indie game.  The lack of voice-overs, and very simplistic animation marks it out as a small-team (one man?) effort.  Also, the story is very similar to Tron (Bad Guy taking over the system, User logs in to kick♥♥♥♥♥ and all other programs are amazed at how the User has more skills and powers)...   Tank Universal packs so much in. There's a little bit of wandering-around on foot, and a lot of time spent in a tank.  While in the tank, you can traverse mazes, explore the beautiful world they created, play domination, and so on. Everything under the 'umbrella' of being a good dude fighting in a world of bad dudes, and needing to travel around it to stay ahead of the 'bad dudes', while getting closer to the 'big bad dude' for the final fight... There's really quite a lot of variety, and stuff isn't repeated to death, like they would be in a AAA game, where they have to milk every last cent out of an expensive asset (for example).I was impressed by pretty much everything in this game.  The ship/tank models are lush.  The world design is stunning. The sounds/music are very very close to Tron, and the visuals are 100% spot-on (They even replicate the irregular 'flashing' of the poor rotoscoping in the movie by pulsing the brightness.. So ingenous..)..Is there anything which makes me unhappy?  That the game ended.   Playing domination was great fun (I was playing in easy mode, which may explain it).So, if you love Tron, and want to play a tron-like classic good vs. evil game, and aren't too hung up over spoken voiceovers, or FMV, then this game is for you!.Highly Recommended ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really love this little indie game! As the description says you drive a tank in a TRON-like computer system. The missions you have to fullfill have a very wide spectrum, so you will not get bored with always the same routine like in other games. You can also upgrade your tank with very cool new weapons.I recommend everyone to try at least the demo!Btw there is a Tank Universal 2 in developement, but because the Team behind this game is only one person it will take a while until you see a sequel. More sales might shorten the time for release. ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, this was the first legit PC game I've ever played on a computer. I mean, back when I was younger, I used to play pinball on this dinosuar computer we had, but once we got a laptop, I started indulging in the internet and downloadable games. This was the very first game I downloaded, and I have to say, I began my PC gaming on the right foot.This game has been and always will be my favorite game. (Yeah sorry, different favorite game now.. This game is 2nd best though!) The cutscenes can be a little slow, but everything is made up for in the strategy and the style and look of the game. I love the aspect of adventuring into unknown areas, especially in this game.If you enjoy some strategy with action and something interesting, this is definitely a game you should play.

												Let's face it: Tank Universal is an obvious homage to Tron. It's a Tron game in almost every respect, but name. Even the marketing for the game loudly proclaims you're entering a ""Tron-like world"". Sure, there are enough differences to make it something unique, unto itself. But when you're playing it, you can't help shake the feeling that you're essentially playing what could - or even should - be Space Paranoids as envisaged by Flynn in the movie.Aside from some frustration you may experience in the frenetic Tank battles, and the fact that you may end up starting over again on a level which could be aggravating, Tank Universal is a very nice indie game. Recommended to anyone who's a fan of Tron.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A strange Tron like tank driving game that I had a lot of fun playing. There was some sort of story line to the game, but it was very strange, but not nearly as hard to follow as Eye: Divine Cybermancy. The tank was not too hard to learn to control, the only thing that took a bit of work for me was aiming the arc of the cannon at high speed long distance battle. Much of the game has you doing roughly the same thing over and over again, with more elements added on though. Capture the flag, but as the game goes on the ""flag"" gets harder and harder to get to. But there are a few times you have to get out of your tank to do things, like try to hold on for dear life as you ride a virtual goat or something! As a whole the game is very enjoyable, but it doesn't really do anything new.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent, very underrated game. I think a lot of people dislike it for two main reasons:-You actually need to think about where your projectile will go, rather than a lot of games where you just point and click to kill enemies-And that the gameplay is repetitive.But think about this.TF2. Overwatch. Nearly every multiplayer objective-based shooter ever.They're all extremely repetitive, even more so than this.What difference does it make if you're fighting AI that isn't actually brain-damaged for once rather than people?If this was multiplayer rather than singleplayer, literally nobody would complain about the repetitiveness. And that bothers me.And that is why this only has 57% positive reviews.The gameplay might be the same but there are very varied maps and a wide variety of environments, more than can be said for some online multiplayer shooters. You move a bit slow, but you can solve that by being patient. The power shards are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to collect in big enough numbers to do anything significant, but that stops you blazing through the levels with ease. Some of the maps are confusing as hell to navigate, but it was the dev's decision to add in a maze-y aspect to some of the maps. I don't have a problem with it, it just takes me longer.

												If you loved the original Tron movie and Tank combat type games with retro-style, you will love this game. Even though the game is not connected to the original Tron, it is the game (out of all the Tron games) that feels most ""Tron"" like. The story in this game is very charming as well. The gameplay is great and new suprises await you on every level. Consider that this game was developed but just one person, and you will agree this is a very well made game.This game is in my top 10 favorites out of all my Steam games, and I can't wait for Tank Universal 2 which is in development. Tank Universal is the best ""I never heard of this game"" find that I ever found on Steam. Buy it! Enjoy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game about tank skirmishing in 80's-version-of-the-future-worlds. The player goes up against a giant eyeball overlord along with men from a resistance movement. Together they fight past vast amounts of enemy vehicles such as tanks, artillery, and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bombers.The story is more or less just there so people won't complain about lack of a story, and the read-only dialogue is laughably bad at times, but the game contains a lot of fun to be had and some really unexpected twists.Once you beat the campaign, you can test your strength in the ""skirmish"" mode, where you have 20 minutes to kill as many enemies, of all types, as possible, and try not to die in the process.However, there are a few downsides to this game:no multiplayer whatsoevercapped at 30fpsyou don't have a reliable way to deal with swarms of enemiesThis game is one of a two-part series, and there is a Tank Universal 2 in the works. Hopefully we see some modernization in it, I would absolutely love to skirmish with real players.Overall, I really like this game, and definately recommend it, but know that replayability is extremely limited and there is no multiplayer.56/64 bits			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good game all around. The music is good and you can just lose yourself in it and destroy entire tank regiments like a boss. The difficulty curve is reasonable, though it could stand to be harder. Enemy behavior could stand to be improved but they are supposed to be mindless drones vs. you the 'player'. The controls are pretty fluid, though the tutorial level could stand to be expanded upon in sequels. It could also stand to be longer as I am almost completed the game and its barely been 6 hours (which for an Indie game is impressive, but should be longer in the future). The large levels are nice, and the cyberpunk style works well with the music and the setting. Its like a damn Tron civil war.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PresentationTank Universal is one of the most weird, yet ambitious indies you'll ever play, as it tries to introduce you to a story that's not even defined by the end of the title. Developed by a single person, New Zealand's graphic designer Phil Jones, the game kicks off by introducing you to a terminally ill patient who was prescribed a virtual reality headset in order to help him relax. Inside this virtual reality is where you will take control of Unit8, a soldier finding himself at the beginning of a revolution against the society that rules the virtual world, deciding to join the resistance and help them defeat Gorgon, the ruler and oppressor of their world. From that point onwards, the game will send you on different snatch and grab missions combined with the occasional open combat against Gorgon's forces, which does get repetitive after a while, even though each chapter has its unique twist. Even though the premise is kind of weird and intriguing in its own way, this first chapter of who knows how many has nothing new to offer, as we've seen numerous dictators vs resistance stories before, and this one has nothing new to offer. There are only a few characters defined with names, such as the commander of the resistance whose orders you will follow, but there is nothing that will make you attached to his story or the cause you're fighting for, making the entire story feel pointless and boring nonetheless as you will spend most of your time moving from point A to point B without any given purpose.Rating: 5.5GameplayEven though there are some on-foot sections those are strictly implemented for the sake of the story, leaving the rest of the action to be experienced from inside your tank, the instrument of the only gameplay mechanics you'll get to play with. Aside from simple movements you will have nine different abilities for your tank, ranging from speed boosts to healing and even a nuclear bomb later on in the game. Using each one of those abilities requires shards, which you can acquire by destroying enemy tanks, making it vital to collect each shard if you want to head into the next battle prepared. While the first abilities you'll earn will also be the ones you'll use the most even by the end of the game, as using speed boost in order to dodge enemy fire is key, the ones unlocked later on will probably be a one time use only, as things such as mines or smoke bombs are less efficient and use shards that can otherwise be used on the traditional, yet efficient weapons. The objectives you'll aim for will quickly become dull as well, even though the game somehow combines them in chapters in order to hide that, but in a slow moving tank across a battlefield filled with objectives such as destroy thing A or reach point B, it's hard to have fun when you're constantly doing the same thing in the same way you did before; there is simply nothing new worth unlocking as you progress to the game, as you will see everything good there is in the first hour and be disappointed afterwards as you notice that's all there is.Rating: 6GraphicsThe sad truth about Tank Universal is that it looks outdated and ugly; sure, the game wants to look retro, but low resolution textures, limited colors and ugly visual effects are things that cling more to outdated than retro. On top of that, even considering the Tron-like look of the game, the environments look roughly the same, rarely changing colors or a few objects here and there to differentiate levels.Rating: 3.5AudioThe tehno beats go in theme with the overall look of the game, but everything else from repetitive and low quality effects to annoying explosion sounds and the lack of dialogue makes the audio part of Tank Universal something you could easily live without, as the sound effects will rapidly get annoying and repetitive.Rating: 4.5ExtrasIt takes around eight hours to finish Tank Universal, and even if there is a multiplayer mode, I couldn't recommend that as it lacks modes and barely works properly at all, and even when it does it still gets boring after 10 minutes. You could try to replay some of the chapters in order to achieve the highest level and earn all achievements, but even with all that you can only squeeze a few more hours.Rating: 7VerdictTank Universal is quite impressive considering the fact that it's all been done by one single person, but leaving his congratulations aside, this is still a pretty bad game, as the story is barely an introduction to what may possibly happen in a future sequel and the gameplay becomes boring quickly enough, not to mention the outdated graphics and sound design.Rating Overall: 5.3Check out the full review and a lot more about Tank Universal at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=362[/url[/b][/h1] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you a child of the 80's? Do you like TRON? Then you should probably play this game, because it is very much like an alternate version of ""the Grid"", with tank battles, exploration and a sprinkling of 'Battlezone' type strategy.No light cycles though...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game on a steam sale for around $1-2 and it was worth every cent. Considering I loved Tron when I was younger, and still do, I guess I was always going to like this game. It may not be the most graphically advanced game, but the gameplay is fantastic.Every level brought something new, it didn't feel repeditive at all, and on normal difficulty it offered a good challange, so going straight to hard difficulty is not required. If I had to list a con in the game it would probably be the cut scenes, as they were a little dragged out.Basically, I would say that if you can get this game on a discount buy it. If it's not on discount and you just want a good solid gameplay experience, absolutely buy it. Full price is cheap and its worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like Tron themed games, this might be for you. I just got into the first skirmish and the first impression was the game's was quite okay. However, the game got this unnecessary story which you have to endure in the beginning. So you entered virtual world, got enslaved, then a resistance contacted you, etc, then you go into training skirmish mode.The gameplay mechanic is kind of similar to MOBA type of game, where you have this allies fighting on your side (or creeps) and you need to progress towards enemie's homebase.So, if you like Tron and MOBA, this might be for you. For me, let's just say it's not my cup of tea.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2000 AD. My birthday, my cousin is over and were on my families brand new E-machines windows ME edition. He loads up a website full of java games, and one of them put you in charge of a Tron-tank in a green Tron-like world full of red tanks. That game was fun, and ever since then I have had an afinity with being a tank driver (That was all I did in BF2). I saw this game and thought back to that birthday. Pretty solid tank game all in all. Very good story, borrowed A LOT of elements from Tron but still to good effect in this universe. The game has a rocking battle system, designed like a DOTA type game (think Leage of Legends). Had their been a way to buy different tanks and play on different maps besides campaign levels, and of course a multiplayer component, their really is not anything that would have kept me from recommending this game to just about anyone. But, it has none of those features. I still got a lot of enjoyment from this game (suprislingly), I don't regret picking it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dearly love independent developers. This game takes a few notes from Tron, and places you in command of a digital tank, in a digital universe inside the very computers we use everyday. I always wanted to drive one of those Tron tanks, and this game hits the nail perfectly on the head. Progress through the story and use strategy, and smarts, to complete the hacks, keep your base alive, and help combat the enemy. I find the game a little short, but it's a fantastic ride nonetheless, and I understand this is only the prologue...I can't wait! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game sat in my Wishlist for a very long time. I was always tempted by the beautifully rendered TRON-style visuals and the simplicity of the art direction about the game.After finally having it sit there and stare at me, I decided to buy it and give it a shot. Man, what a suprirse this game turned out to be. The in-tank gameplay is excellent and quite difficult. You'll find yourself learning to place and gauge shot distances almost instantly, though you may be outclassed by the AI in this regard. The levels are large, and somewhat sparse of detail but it fits the feel of the TRON Visual style.Sound design is excellent, though there are no voice-overs for any of the characters. Even pulling a gibberish-langauge Voice Over like E.Y.E would have been acceptable, but the demands on a one-man dev team mandated this cut.There are a few on-foot sections that feel rather out of place as you can't jump, crouch, nor engage in any combat. You simply can run from place to place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked the old Tron movie and find arcade tank games fun you will like this game. It depicts the tank parts from the classic Tron movie very well. While the sound effects could have been better, compared to a game like the older offical Tron 2.0 game for PC, the sounds are very similar to the ones seen in the old movie. The music is great and kicks in a beat when the action revs up...Visually you can choose any resoluiton, which isnt default when it comes to Indie games yet, you have a few other graphical settings like vsync and ""glow"" effect,but its enough to pull of the ""Tron look"". I just recommend turning off the grain effect.The game plays you both inside and outside the tank. Outside is mostly for story where you walk around and talk to people etc and inside is where most of the action is. You drive around doing objectives, shooting enemy tanks and upgrade your tank with special abilities while from time to time the story progresses with text boxes and ingame cutscene.

												Alright so Tank Universal. First off, when you start the game the controls just feel floaty and bad. Theres no view bobble or anything it kind of feels like your on a segway. The mouse sensitivity is way to high, if you move your mouse at all you are basically doing a 360. Turning mouse sensitivy down also does'nt work, you still turn like speedy gonazales.Graphics: My god. you can tell all of the work went towards the tanks and battles. The walls have no texture, no joke some walls were just black voids. The ""human"" are an absolute abomination. Polygons are jutting out of them, you could cut a ♥♥♥♥♥ by walking to her. Once you finnaly get into a tank. (about 30-40) minutes in it's not that bad. The begining is god aweful though.Tank Battles: Oh my god. They nailed it. Being in a tank and trying to dodge and weave while trying to line up a shot is really fun.You can also charge up your shots by holding the fire button. Also there is 9 other gadgets in the game. I only got to play with the turbo. (which is nuts, you fly with that on.) And the other was a shield recovery. I can only imagine the other will add a pretty decent amount of depth in the game. You can also upgrade your tank with crystals dropped from destroyed enemy tanks. This part was the focus of the game obviously and they did a great job, it's fun challenging and rewarding.Final Score: 7/10 ( only because of tank battles. Without a really poor game.)

												I grabbed this one on sale, and for the price, even the non sale price, I'd say it's good value. Sure, it's capped at 30 fps, sure the tank handles like a fridge on a skateboard, sure, so far into it, there's only really one weapon which is some kind of frustrating to aim artillery cannon...With an aesthetic obviously inspired by tron, the low frame rate and garish, hard to watch colours just add to the feel of a 70's visualisation of a 'cyber-world', but the action is reasonable and so far and varied enough in pace to be interesting. The fridge mouted gun is slow firing but very powerful, feeling rather like a tank weapon aught to... and yeah, so far, I'm enjoying it.In short? worth a look in and if it comes up on sale again, certainly worth grabbing for a cheap and cheerful blast.

												its a great game. Deffiently worth it if you get it for 60% off or more. its HELLISH Slow though. you prolly sepnd about half the game going from place to place and another 1/4 of it in Cut Scenes. There are only a few tank battles. (4-5 i think) and the 128 Glyph captures achievement is super annoying as it takes a lot of game time. there is no Humor (non that i found funny) and the cut scenes are really dragged out. the Skirmish is just ""Destroy as many tanks as you can in 10 mins)  or something like that.Story is a good one (Though super slow :O ) and it really really needs Mutliplayer. (and the second one needs to come out!)it wasnt super Difficult and i was able to go through the game without dying more then once or twice. even then it was because i didnt know my ally tanks could run me over. (When out of your tank) i wish you could get out of the tank and maybe find Secret areas. and i also wish you used the Transport command more then once in the entire game.i know i said this a few times but its really slow.

												The game has the visual aesthetics of Tron while it feels like what the old school arcade game of Battlezone would look like if made today.  While the story is a fairly standard and generic 'freedom fighters against the evil government/corporation', the game play is a lot more challenging than you make think.  You have to plan your shots while being on the move because the AI aim is good.  The downside of the AI is the vehicle pathing, it pretty easy to predict and it's easy to get surrounded as the enemy tanks don't stop showing up as you push forward through the level.  Tank upgrades are not the usual fire speed, tank speed, and armor upgrades so you can't really farm points and turn it into 'easy mode'.   I really wish this game had multiplayer or co-op.  I think the maps, if a little bigger, could make a great competitive tank game.  Finally, this game has very low system requirements.  I'm playing on a Athlon X2 4400+, 2GB Ram, 1950Pro 512MB with no issue at all.Pros:  Aesthetics, shot planning, upgrade planning, map layouts, map completion strategies, low system requirements, cost.Cons: Story, AI pathing, No multiplayer or co-op, framerate capped at 30fps.

												I got this game 90% off with a steam coupon I got from crafting a badge, and it looked interesting so I bought it. It took some time for me to play it because it didn't work in the beginning, just froze and crashed, but finally I got it. It was really fun the first 30 minutes, then it just got very boring in the ""Tutorial"", so i quit. I like the consept, but it ended up being boring for me. but concidering I got it for 50 Cent, I think it is well worth it, you will get to try a new type of game(for me) and see if it is your ind of game. Ended up not being the case on my side. But if you got a 90% coupon, BUY IT!Review: Worth trying!			",316,78,42,33,69,10,23

												Tank Universal is a TRON tank game without using the name TRON. There's a campaign where you were enlisted in the rebel forces to defeat Gorgon and his ""general"" by engaging in various type of warfare, but it essentially boils down to puzzle solving (with combat) and capture the flag (or ""key"" in this case). The plot is very much a copy of the TRON Legacy movie plot (albeit with tanks) and the combat is your basic capture the flag with a couple variations like puzzles. It's somewhat interesting, but ultimate a bit primitve. The minimap is virtually useless as it doesn't help you figure out which way you can or cannot go. Powerups and upgrades are of unknown value. I guess it wouldn't really hurt for $1 or so.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												I played a fair bit of the demo of this and found a decently fun Tron-styled tank combat game. When I got around to playing the full game, I found that they took the whole Tron thing and ran with it, making about as blatant a rip-off as rip-offs go. From the plot to the obvious copy of the MCP, very little is original about this game. The walking portions are also pretty bad and only highlight the low budgetness of the game with poor animations and textures, and nothing you do while walking is very fun at all. It also proclaims to be part one of two games, and as far as I'm aware no Tank Universal 2 exists, so if you can somehow get into the story, you'll probably be left wanting.All that aside though, the tank combat is serviceable, though I feel it really would benefit from online multiplayer. It would be a great stretch to call this a good game, as it seems to focus on the worst parts of itself, but if you can get it for cheap (I think I've seen 90% off coupons for it) and really dig tanks and Tron, it's probably worth a lark.

												Awesome Tron inspired fun. The missions you do in this singeplayer tank game are really fun and large; this is the perfect game for multiplayer but sadly it isn't :II got about 8 hours worth of this when i played it ages ago but whenever i see Tron/ Tron inspired things it makes me want to play it again.All the combat you do is done within your tank as you help the rebels destroy the evil ""overlord"" (like in Tron :P) by capturing the enemies core and taking back to your base or by destroying their base (Depending on the mission). You fight and flight alongside other tanks as well as a variety of space ships, artillery and base defences.The gameplay is awesome, the graphics and sound are classic and can never get old and the story is intriguing and makes you want to keep on fighting and help the rebels win the war. I love this game and the only thing that could make it better is if it had multiplayer.			",1043,307,42,125,63,12,141

												The pacing of the game was far too slow. the huge empty spaces and the severe inability to move at a consistently sped up pace just killed it. Story wise: A man is dying, he is given a VR kit to help him forget about it. they give him a slow paced game, which is the exact opposite of what you want to do.with little time he has to live left, you'd want him to get the most out of it, not slow it down.Gameplay wise: slow. painfully painfully slow. I love tron and i love the tank fights in tron, I Really really love the artwork of this game and I honestly want to love it, but the pacing of the game just throws everything good about this game out the window.

												Absolutely terrible game. Everything is incredibly slow, the game makes you wait for what seems like forever with EVERYTHING. Dialog is painfully slow and dull, as is driving the tanks. Took me a solid 30 minutes of waiting for ""cutscenes"" (if you can even call them that) to end, until I was able  to even to play the damn game. The gameplay itself is even dull, as you have to wait a damn eon-and-a-half to fire your weapons. Please do not buy this game, I don't care how cheap it is, or if it's on sale. It's a waste of your money, and a waste of your damn time.  #WaitingSimulator			",51,6,0,9,5,0,3

												Ok,first off,TU is not a bad game at all.I'm still going to recommend it as its basically Tron tanks,but without the license.The gameplay is,basically,go shoot some tanks.turrets etc etc,but what it does,it does fairly well.Graphics are dated,but still quite nice,in a virtual world sort of way.The Storyline is basic and uninspiring and could have been soooooo much better.Now for the bad bit.Ages ago,before the full release,I and a friend downloaded the demo,and we both remember playing it together,multiplayer.Yet in the full game,theres no multiplayer!!!!!-WTH NOT?This game cries out for it,and could have been so much better with a co-op or even adversarial multiplayer system,and if you had it in the demo,or beta or whatever,why take it out?-Thats something I just don't understand.Anyway,its worth the money,for a short while,esp if you are a Tron fan,but its lack of MP is a sad exclusion.Nuff saidStar			",387,148,12,30,40,2,39

												Tank Universal is as fun as its name is stupid. Do you want to drive arounf in a crazy neon Tron-world while shooting stuff? That's a rhetorical question, who doesn't? This is the third most fun I've had while simulating LSD-based combat. Also tanks are pretty cool. Not ninja cool, but definitely cooler than unicorns. So there's that.			",127,41,3,23,31,0,22

The level design is bad and some of the areas are long and your tank is slow.The story is very bad, the graphics sucked for me and the action was boring (except when you have the key and the music comes on).Everything in this game is slow, boring and repetitive, so don't waste your money on this game.Sorry for being so negative 1.5/10Someone tell me if they have found anything good about this game for them.

												You like tanks?You like Tron?Then stay away from this game.This game is absolutely one of the worst dragged out games I have played.Basically, this game deals with a man named George who is instructed by his doctor to be on medication and to use a virtual reality helmet to help pass the time.So George puts on the VR, and finds himself in a Tron world, where after running across football stadium's worth, he's  suddenly imprisoned.A lot of confusion in the story takes place, and you are instructed by your red overlords to ride tanks to the leader, Gorgon, to...get annihilated by Gorgon himself.Yeah, I don't understand what the story is, nor do I have the tolerance to frustrate myself to understanding. And I'm the type of person who's all for story.And just like the story, the gameplay is not that impressive either.It's basically a tank shooter where your objective is to complete whatever your mission is. The tutorial first starts you with a ""capture the flag"" type of mission, where your job is to grab the red key and bring it back to your base.Unfortunately, the gameplay is very underwhelming, and you would get a better kick out of a game like World of Tanks instead, and that game is free mind you.With this game only being single player, too dragged out of dialogue and an uninspiring gameplay to boot, I can't recommend this game to any of my friends,  or anyone in that matter, regardless if you're a die hard Tron fan that loves tank games.

												This is by far the absolute worst game I have ever had the displeasure of playing, and I've played a lot of bad games. It is not worth the harddrive space, nor is it worth the $0.50 I spent on it with my 90% off coupon. Whoever created this game either has to give this game a huge update, so as to make it presentable, or they have to end their life in the most miserable way possible. I am highly displeased. Let's have a peak at why, shall we?1) The Graphics - I'll give them ONE, and only ONE thing, and that's that the graphics are unique. By saying that I in no mean am saying that they are even remotely good. I am merely saying they did something unique. Anyways, these graphics are Tron-esque, and that sounds pretty cool, right? Wrong. They are in no way cool, nor creative, nor pretty, nor thought-provocing. It's all just the same stupid blank walls and hideous patterns in an ugly shade of a neon color, generally blue. In fewer words; the graphics suck.2) The Content - If I had to choose one thing from the (ever so long) list of faults with this game that stands out the most, it is this; There Is Not Enough Content In This Game. The whole game is just walking, and shooting terribly animated rockets and laser beams and whatever the hell else these ""Tanks"" have at other ""Tanks"". That's it.I WOULD proceed to write more about this game, but I'm afraid I now have a migrane from the sheer terribleness of this game. For a more in-depth view at my mutual thoughts about this game, check out the following review of this game on youtube(This is not my video, it's simply a review video which happens to share my feelings for this game).

When I thought I might have suffered through to the good part, I found clunky controls, AI that's not fun to engage, and levels trying to use the Tron art style to mask their ineffective designs.
