												Arkanoid where you control the 'ball'. And by 'ball' I mean creature. It has all the stuff you've come to expect from an Arkanoid title; powerups, bonuses, multipliers, everything. It's colorful and flashy. Casual gamers are definitely the target audience for this game.[Rating: 64/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A colorful and fun arcade style game where you launch your Arkonaut from the bounce pad to collect DNA blocks.  You not only control the bounce pad but also the Arkonaut as well which adds extra challenge.  The avatars are cute and the music is catchy.  This game is deffinitely worth giving a shot.

												The game has great graphics. While they are simple there sharp looking and the sound is fine. The gameplay is kind of where it starts to fall apart. I would have liked it more if they would have kept it simple but nope. You see its not enough you have to clear a level you need to clear it with enough points. Ugh. I mean cmon really? Its a chore and slightly  annoying to clear all the maps but one because you failed to play the game the way they wanted you to play it. Booooooooooooo. Bad idea developers. I would have loved it if I could have played the game just to clear and move on to the next map. I would not recommend this to anyone because of this. Nope. 4/10 for graphics and sound but gameplay is a little on the unforgiving side.**Side note in the about game they compare this to other games Rainbow Island, Bubble Bobble and Arkanoid. You want to know what these all had in common? Once you got all the fruit or bubbles you moved on to the next level. This game is not like that at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a tablet/console port for a low effort/shovelware game.   There are numerous problems. A quick note on what it is:  It's an arcade game where you bounce up and down and collect various objects hovering in space above your head.  You can move the trampoline and the character that is bouncing.   There is not much to the gameplay.Let's go over the problems:* No controller customisability* No proper KB+M support - you must have a game controller* Janky game controller controls and handling - won't work on most game controllers* No graphics customisability* No Fullscreen!!!The developer has made zero effort porting this to PC - this is just an outright cash grab with no redeeming features.
