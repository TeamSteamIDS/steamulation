												Before playing, open the configuration tool from the popup after you click the Play button.Choose OpenGL as renderer and click OK.Open Hitman.ini in the game's installation folder.Add these lines:Resolution 1920x1080WindowStartUpperPos 0,0Change 1920x1080 to your monitor's native resolution, ex: 1366x768, 1280x720, etc.Save the file.Don't bother with the built-in antialiasing option, it doesn't work (at least in my case).Force AA through your graphics card's control panel.Start the game.You may need to change the controls a bit to make it less clunky.Mine is configured like this:Walk - WRun - ShiftWalk left - AWalk right - DWalk backward - STurn left - ZTurn right - CLean left - QLean right - EPerform action - SpaceToggle sneak - 4Toggle camera mode - 3Drop item - FEquip binoculars - Mouse 3Empty hands - AltFire weapon/use item - Mouse 1Reload weapon - RChange firing mode - TabNext item - GPrevious item - TShow map - MOpen laptop - F1Show mission status - F2Once done, you're all set and ready to play this epic game.

												I thought Hitman: Codename 47 was a great entry point for the series defining what it is that Agent 47 does and how he came to be. Just like any game from 2000 there will be many flaws in A.I. and level designing. Most of the levels were small and only had one or two ways of completion but that is fine because with a saving system like this one it really would have been a nightmare to beat this game. If you are caught, killed and hit space to continue from a checkpoint the guards will still be on alert EVEN if you are loaded back in an area you are sure you were safe in; they WILL find you. That is one of my very few gripes with this game as it still delivers satisfying gameplay with a variety of fun hits. The story, in my opinion is the game's strength but it only picks up in the end quarter of the game and for me, it did not disappoint. Learning how 47 was created and by who was pretty awesome and I enjoyed watching it unfold. Most gamers overlook this rewarding game but I highly recommend they try it out if they are a big Hitman fan!Personal Score: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over the past few weeks I decided to revisit one of my favourite ever series, Hitman. Amazing to think that this was released 15 years ago! Still so much fun to be had to this day. One of my favourite features of this game is that it was one of the first of its generation to introduce ragdoll physics to their system. Also, I believe this was the first stealth game I ever played. I remember finding it incredibly frustrating to be the “perfect” assassin, however as years have gone on I’ve appreciated the game more and more and adapted to all situations now with ease.Take your first steps as Subject 47 and guide him through the beginning of his ICA International Contract Agency career. Tip: Watch out for n°48! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hitman: Codename 47... Hitman 1...This is an Interesting game from a Series that I have only just started getting into, I have always been interested in how far my favourite games have come from their source material; the first Hitman game I played was Hitman Blood Money and I loved it, and I was suprised on how many of the elements present in that game were not in this one.The Beauty of Blood Money was the fact that the game could be played in pretty much any way you wanted; you could play stealthily, you could tactically pacify everyone one by one, or you could just shoot everyone. C47 however can't seem to decide on how it want's to be played, you can't really play stealthily because guards will shoot you for sneezing wrong, you can't pacify everyone because there is no non-lethal wasy of getting rid of guards, and you can't just shoot everyone because you die too quickly.There is always one or two ways to beat a level as opposed to the large playground environments used in Blood Money, without a walkthrough you will be stuck on this game often leading to cases of unfair difficulty.Am I saying that C47 is a bad game though? No. It is simply a game that has aged poorly in several ways; the control for example is bizzare: the walk forward and run forward functions are seperate buttons. Graphically the game looks really good for 2000's standards and there are some familiar elements in this game present in future installments such as the fibre wire and Sniper rifle suitcase. You are not punished for killing enemy mooks but you are for innocent civilians, a level of frustration is reached in certain levels however when you are forced into a shootout because there is no other way around the level.It isn't really fair to judge C47 on superior sequels, but rather look at the game itself, it isn't a bad game, but certainly not a great one, I would only reccomend this to people who have played future installments of the Franchise who want to play this out of Morbid CuriosityFINAL VERDICT: Average			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Hitman series of games was one I had always meant to get around to.  I owned three of the games for quite a while, but after picking up the last two (Contracts and Absolution) I finally decided to start playing through them.  Going into the first one, I fully expected it to be underwhelming.  It is old after all (released in 2000).  But even that didn't adequately prepare me for some of the infuriating old school design choices this game uses.First off, the game has occasional moments of brilliance.  The Hong Kong missions and the Budapest mission are shining examples of the potential of the Hitman premise.  But all the missions surrounding it are slogs to get through.  And it all comes down to one simple problem.Often, Hitman: Codename 47 doesn't seem to understand what the word ""stealth"" even means.Take, for example, the third jungle mission.  You're tasked with taking out a drug lord.  But he's holed up inside a mansion inside of a fenced compound crawling with guards.  There is literally no way to take him out silently.  The room he's in has only one entrance, and the moment you open the door he grabs a big machine gun and starts shooting up the place.  And if you leave any nearby guards alive, they will start shooting you immediately.  Sure, you have a couple respawns, but they don't do anything because the moment you get close to the guards that killed you they recognize you and sound the alarm once again.And it was in this mission that I finally realized how inconsistent the AI is.  Sometimes, they're incredibly stupid.  You can kill a guy on the other side of an open doorway from another guy, and that guy won't even notice.  However, sometimes you silently choke a guy who's in a completely different room (behind a closed door no less) from another guy, and the moment you walk through the door that guy somehow knows what you did and immediately starts shooting.  And there's no checkpoints so if everything hits the fan guess what?  You're starting that twenty minute long mission  all over again.This wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem if it wasn't for the randomness of it all.  The guard who psychically knows that I killed his friend?  A large portion of the time, it doesn't happen.  And there's no logic to it.  Sometimes he knows.  Sometimes he doesn't.  And this is endemic throughout the entire game.Then there's the mission design, and that's where the game will occasionally get incredibly lazy.  For example, one mission involves getting through a bunch of gates to get to a boat where your target is hiding out.  Unfortunately, no matter what disguise you are wearing (even if it's the same exact one as the guards protecting the gates), they won't let you through.  They yell at you when you get close, and if you try to pass, they start shooting.  It makes even less sense when you consider that EVERY OTHER GUARD CAN WALK THROUGH JUST FINE.I feel like a lot of the people still praising this game are feeling nostalgia because they played the game when it was new.  Considering that I haven't, maybe I'm just being overly critical because I'm more used to modern game design.  Whatever the case may be, I do  not  recommend this game, especially considering that I've heard Contracts remakes the best missions from this one (namely Hong Kong and Budapest).  I honestly would have skipped it if it wasn't for my masochistic completionist ways.I do plan on reviewing the rest of the franchise as well.  I'm interested to see how it evolves over time.

												My review is totally in respect that the game was published back in 2000.You will never finish a level as a 'silent assassin' unless u die and die and die and die again ,it is hard it is challenging and there is no helpers, u need to figure everything on ur own by dying and dying and dying, damn even the tutorial wasn't clear, but still there is more than one way to finish your mission and once you figure them out, you will go through the level as smoothly and satisfying as it can get. I love this game, still playable after 14 years, even with the old graphics and AI system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Codename 47 is very hard to judge as a whole. Most missions are really painful as you do not know why you are being killed and there is no save systeam so you have to do the game serval times usually.  But there are a few missions that really stand out such as the hong kong missions and the hotel mission. The graphics look really good for its time and the controls are the simplest of the hitman games I have ever played. Its attention to detail is really good suach as the fact that the sniper bobs up and down.  Its music is also one of the best I have heard.It is very hard to recomand codename 47 to other people due to its fustrstion. But if you want to follow the history of hitman or show that you played one of the most fustrating games that most people did not finish, than pick this game up			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a way to start a franchise. The game absolutely does not hold your hand, trial & error is pretty much mandatory in this game, but I think that's part of the fun here. Being 14 year old game, it does show signs of aging, the controls are rather clunky, draw distance is low and the voice acting is pure cheese. I recommend the game If you want to see where the series started, and learn the origins of 47. But other than that, Id start with Silent Assassin instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember playing this when I was a little kid and it was one of the first games I ever played. Playing it now and looking back, I have no idea how 6-year-old me got through some of these missions. The AI and physics are super sensitive, it's almost funny. Nonetheless, this game is great, and if you're a fan of the franchise it's a must play, at least just to see how far the series has come along. 10/10 would minigun again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back then, Codename 47 was a fantastic unique original concept on the PC game market. It had awesome graphics, awesome OST and it really felt a hitman simulation.Does it stand the test of time? Kind of. Graphics, sounds and animation still look good, unlike most games of that era. However, you may find it frustrating for:- Lack of checkpoints (you got one chance in a mission)- Controls need remapping and getting adjusted to it.- Camera is a bit weird.- Dialoug sometimes get weird.Why would you play this game? If you are already a Hitman fan then it might interest you. If you are new to the series then it is better to get Hitman: Contracts  since that game is sort of a remake of this one.

												Ahh this is how it started, Hitman, one of my personal favourite series. But lets talk about this game. Hitman: Codename 47 was the first title they released back in 2000, this game is all about being extremely stealthy and if you screw up a bit, you're pretty much done. Im not going to blame the game for its high difficulty because it was their first game and they learned lesson from it. Aside from the gameplay, the controls arent bad, its playable, but this game has the best soundtracks which are worth listening to. The graphics is amazing of its time.  If you really wanna get into the hitman series, I recommend you to start playing from Hitman 2, or this if you dont mind the clumsy controls and the difficulty level. But overall i would say this game is still good 6/10			",1394,482,38,129,91,11,163

												This game reminds me of how amazing my childhood was, it brings back so many good memories.. Of course it looks and feels dated (which is no surprise since the game is almost 16!!! years old) and the following games have improved upon pretty much every aspect of codename 47 but I still thoroughly enjoy it for what it is. On a side note this hitman is VERY hard. Although in most cases there's only one natural way to beat missions, it's really difficult to figure it out. Missions like Lee Hong assassination or Plutonium runs loose took me ages to complete on my first playthrough back in 2003. In my opinion this hitman is the hardest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This first title of the hitman saga is the one that differentiate the most among them. It gives, perhaps, the most freedom of choice and is the most difficult Hitman game. Almost every mission can be completed in 3~5 slightly different ways, but you can't save during a mission. It has a fair deal of excitement and suspense. The mysterious assassin, the stress on stealth, and a decent narrative make it well worth playing even many years later.

												Well, this series got off on a shaky start. If you are looking to get into the Hitman series and want to start at the beginning, you may or may not want to skip this one anyway. To start off, the graphics look great for the time, even though the draw distance is fairly low. Also, on more modern systems, you need to mess with the graphics options a bit so static textures don't behave like animated .gif files. Before even touching control configuration or resolution settings, make sure to set the renderer to OpenGL, no matter what. Otherwise, on a presentation level, Hitman does it's job.As for controls, they definitely take a bit of getting used to, and you'll definitely also have to mess with the controls for at least 20 minutes just to see what suits you. And some of the design choices for them, even for the time, don't make a whole lot of sense. Such as a dedicated sprint foreword key. Luckily, after at least five or so configuration changes, I managed.Regarding sound, the music does a pretty good job most of the time at setting the mood. Whether things are tense and you are sneaking up on your main target to slice their throat without making a peep, or running through a Columbian jungle running-and-gunning, Jasper Kyd did a solid job composing it.On a story level, the first Hitman is a bit basic, but still captivating enough to see through to the end. One thing that really spiced my interest is the references to movies such as Scarface or The Godfather.And finally gameplay, well, it's a lot of trial-and-error. On many missions you will find frustration as the game expects you to sit though hours and hours of you dying from the same problem when the solution was literally in the last place you would look. I really can't blame anyone for looking up a guide or walkthrough for the game, as it really doesn't give you a clue sometimes. And in regards to the missions, there are not a lot of them, so this trial-and-error frustration doesn't last too long. Some can range heavily in length and aggravation, and most aren't very replayable or memorable. There is a difference between a proper lack of hand-holding (i.e. something akin to Metroid) and tedious bull$hit.What also range between missions are the bugs. Yes, this 14 year old game that they are still selling on Steam still has bugs. None of them are necessarily game-breaking, but can ruin a would-be successful play through a mission. Some range from minor visual glitches, to enemies that spawn out of nowhere that somehow see through your disguise and murder you, to the game spontaneously crashing. In the end, for IO Interactive's first game, and it being the year 2000 when it was released, I give it a bit of leeway. And as a whole it isn't a bad game. I have to agree with the Metacritic score of 73/100 it was given. If you really want to start Hitman from the ground up and are willing to deal with a bit of annoying cr@p here and there, maybe wait for a sale unless you are really that eager.			",192,15,0,4,4,2,5

												In my opinion, the best of the classic Hitman Series, A.K.A. Pre-Blood Money. Yes, similar to what everyone else is saying about this game: it IS indeed unforgiving to ANY player, whether you're confident you've faced the toughest games out there, be it shooter or stealth, or maybe you've been completely oblivious to the Hitman Series and have decided to buy the bundle since it's on sale: You will die, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, again. So you might be asking yourself: Just freakin' tell me whether or not I should get the game you _____! Well, here's what I'll say, which is 100%, and entirely honest!     The Verdict: 9.5/10      The Reason: I have no idea     The Logic: It's been my favorite game since I was 5  years old     The GamePlay: I don't know, read someone else's review...............Yea, why are you still here? Don't you know I have better things to do than type reviews? Buy the game if you're not a little _____ like nearly every other chump here, then I suggest you buy the game. It's hard, it's fun, it's rewarding, it's out-dated, it lacks saves in levels, it lacks great AI, it lacks a lowered difficulty, but it may just tell a slightly compelling story that may just make it worth while, and maybe lead you to continue playing the series, because you aren't an imbecile,  and you actually appreciate real games for what they are!     Well, this is the end of my review, and the MAX you'll get out of it, but check out my other reviews that are for real if you'd like...and P.S., the Hitman Series is my absolute favorite game series of all time, so there you have it!Update:     For all owners of Codename: 47, nominate it for an award now, so we can make the Hitman franchise great again!

And it is the beginning of the legendary Agent ,,47""The good things+Amazing Level design with alot of detail in it+An very interesting and unique stealth disguise system+Amazing graphics for 2000 and they are still amazing to this day+You need to use your brain to get trough+Badass protagonist+Alot of weapons if you want to go rambo+Differend ways to complete a Mission+Very nice Music+Differend locations to play in ! (Harbors,Jungles,Hotels,Cities) witch really make the game feel differend and changing+interactivity with differend objects and sometimes you can even use them for you Mission+Very nice animations ! They are still pretty impressingAnd the bad Things-Sometimes the AI is buggy and glitchy so because they attack you for no reason or just dont do anything when you have bomb out and place it next to them ! But it happened only 1 time to me so its not a problem-This game is short ! Only 12 Missions and 2 of them arent even Missions.This game was very amazing of its time and it still is to this day !

												Well, this is a hard recommendation but a recommendation none the less. For starters if you want to start through the hitman franchise, this is not as good place to start, this game have some serious issues, some and the whole Hitman thing isn´t as refine here as in Blood Money, or Contracts and Silent Assasin. So prepare to be frustratate, by some unfair level desing, ackward live system and THOSE F-ING COLOMBIAN LEVELS!!! those level are the bane of this game, I see many people quitting this game at this moment... and when I played this when I was younger I remenber this levels took me weeks to beat, which bring me to the next point.When you manage to beat the harder levels of this game, it will feel amazing, you will feel like the ultimate master assasin, yeah the sequels might do a better job giving you options and else. But the sadisfaction of beating a level is something that always brings me back to the very first one Codename 47. This one still have great levels, and is fun to exploid it things or just try to role play, that´s a thing that I always love about every single Hitman game, and this game runs flawlessly on Windows 10. How I wouldn´t recommend this game?			",148,18,0,13,7,0,16

 About Hitman: Codename 47 As the enigmatic Hitman, you must use stealth and tactical problem solving to enter, execute and exit your assignment with minimum attention and maximum effectiveness. For a price, you have access to the most devious devices, but how you use them will determine if you retire as a millionaire  Release Date: 23 Nov, 2000	 The Campaign 	One of the finest Stealth / Strategy RPG's of its generation, it puts you in the role of Agent 47, a shadowy assassin who is equally capable of slipping in and out of target locations un-noticed as he is of pulling out a pair of chrome-plated 'Ballers' and taking absolutely everyone out. With a broad range of missions from the 'Lee Hong Assassination' (Rooftop Sniper takedown) to the 'Massacre at the Cheung Chow Fish House' (No one comes out alive), the game provides a wealth of memorable situations you will talk about years down the road. Flaws	 The game is not without its flaws - for a game nearly 14 years old, gameplay mechanics can be somewhat clunky. Probably the biggest gripe however is the in-game Save option, which does not exist. If you are spotted in the middle of a mission or die, you will need to start the mission over. While not a big issue in the earlier (shorter) missions, this can become extremely frustrating on the later missions where you need to navigate a huge mansion with tons of guards and after 20 minutes of perfection, one mis-step means you're killed and need to restart.All in All  Hitman: Codename 47 is a very nice Retro Game!9/10 From Me Sweep	 ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												At the time of this writing Hitman: Codename 47 is closing in on being 15 years old. Hitman: Codename 47 has a great concept. It is the first hitman game I have played and has the series' iconic game mechanic of changing clothes which I found to be very fun. Sadly, that was one of the only things fun about this game.The game maintains a level of enjoyment throughout except during longer missions where everything goes horrible every possible time for the player. This game is a stealth game but often times I came to realize that the game doesnt seem to understand what a stealth game should be. Often times Agent 47 is forced into shootouts or situations that cannot be stealthed through. This becomes frustating very fast as the game also has no checkpoints and Agent 47 is relatively fragile compared to most action heroes. This lack of checkpoints makes the game challenging but less fun. Mechanics sometimes further amplify this problem as controls are imprecise and patroling guards sometimes randomly know you are the mysterious man who killed someone 2 blocks away in that back alley that no one saw or heard anything from.  The game does feature a respawn mechanic which allows the player to come back to life at a preset area (usually where you completed your last objective) ; HOWEVER, it does not make you incognito and every guard that was shooting at you before will still be shooting at you now. The AI is terrible (Its understandable given the game is 15 years old)    Sometimes guards will be overly suspicious for no apparent reason. It is not unusual for a guard to hear a silent takedown and come running around the corner to see you over the body.. but because it was a silent takedown he obviously doesn't know it is you that performed the act. You can easily outsmart the AI but sometimes the game doesn't play by its own rules and someone downstairs three rooms away heard you when the guy right infront of you didn't. The rules / game mechanics are vague    Even now after beating the game and understanding the game a whole lot more than I did while playing it, I do not understand the rules of some AI or mission objectives. Often times the game throws you into a level with an absurdly vague objective and lets you wander to figure it out. Usually what you are supposed to do has very little to do with the information you were given or objectives are exponentialy more complicated than the brief mission objectives say. Mission objectives do not tell you if you have completed them or not leading to sometimes trying to leave a mission and not knowing why you cannot. Often times I have wandered into an area that gets me killed not knowing it was restricted access or worse guards only sometimes care which leads to situations where you play the exact same way twice with different results. The difficulty     Overall the game is challenging, but its a stealth game and getting caught is bad and gets you killed. Even ignoring the other flaws in the game the difficulty is still absurd. Missions can sometimes be really short and easy and then immediately you are thrown into a half hour minimum warzone with no idea what to do. Some missions I beat on my first try with no assistance from any walkthroughs and other missions even with walkthroughs it took me 5+ hours to beat a single mission. The first mission was almost impossible despite being incredibly straight forward. The first major assassination that takes place at a seaside restaurant is potentially the hardest. A later mission you are forced to take on a boss battle with Scarface Tony Montana who has an M60 while you have whatever little toy guns you can find lying around AND this is also in the middle of a larger mission where if you die you have to start all over due to no checkpoints. Final Thoughts    Overall the game isn't the worst experience of my life. Some missions in it may qualify for that title but the game overall is enjoyable. If you had checkpoints and could skip levels that were overly hard and long the game might actually be somewhat recommendable. I think the games age does play a part in why it was so hard but a little extra effort to explain details of what needed to be done would have gone a long way in making this game a much more enjoyable experience.

 OG Triple OG OG Triple The Original Gangster. The First Hitman game (Hitman: Codename 47) took the gaming world by storm when it came out in 2000 and remains a cult classic to this day. Campaign: One of the finest Stealth / Strategy RPG's of its generation, it puts you in the role of Agent 47, a shadowy assassin who is equally capable of slipping in and out of target locations un-noticed as he is of pulling out a pair of chrome-plated 'Ballers' and taking absolutely everyone out. With a broad range of missions from the 'Lee Hong Assassination' (Rooftop Sniper takedown) to the 'Massacre at the Cheung Chow Fish House' (No one comes out alive), the game provides a wealth of memorable situations you will talk about years down the road. Flaws: The game is not without its flaws - for a game nearly 14 years old, gameplay mechanics can be somewhat clunky. Probably the biggest gripe however is the in-game Save option, which does not exist. If you are spotted in the middle of a mission or die, you will need to start the mission over. While not a big issue in the earlier (shorter) missions, this can become extremely frustrating on the later missions where you need to navigate a huge mansion with tons of guards and after 20 minutes of perfection, one mis-step means you're killed and need to restart.Do not let the gripes stop you from playing this classic which spawned 5 sequels and a movie to boot. This is the OG, the Original Hitman - where stealth, strategy and patience are virtues and the reward is the perfect hit.   Rated - (8/10) Want More Recommendations?

												The original that started it all. This game was a great introduction into the Hitman series. The control scheme was fairly rough, but able to be deciphered and mastered relatively quickly. There are fewer ways to take down your mark in this early game, but it is still satisfiying.  I would definitely recommend this to any Hitman fan interested in seeing the roots of the current games.			",106,17,0,4,9,0,7

												Many people talk negative about this game but i personally loved it. The story is your a hitman named agent 47 and you must kill targets. You can either go silent and kill your objective or you could just walk in the front door and shoot the place up. It did have some neat mechanics like posioning someones food, Disguise as an enemy, and drag bodiesGame does get fustruating with the difficult of the people. Even on easy and medium when you die they give you an extra life or two.One thing i personally did not like about the game and i remember it when i played it back in late 2000 if i have 20 bullets left in this uzi but if i pick up another uzi i cannot take that ammo from the gun, so than i have to carry 2 uzi's in my inventory just incase if i run out. This game allows you to carry roughly 70 items in your inventory not counting snipers, aks, mini gun, and shotgun. This only goes for sub machine guns and pistols. So if you collect the guns while killing you could get confused on which gun is empty and which is not.Cons1. Some missions where i played i was able to run and all of sudden could not move at all. Was like i was stuck but i was able to shoot and move the mouse.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												Even though this is the first Hitman game ever made, it's the second one I ever played. I was lucky enough to find it in a bargain bin years after it was discontinued. The graphics are outdated but that's no reason why this classic game should not be in your collection, especially if you're a diehard Hitman player. Most of the game mechanics that the Hitman series is known for are present here, except for the ability to sedate NPCs and end-level statistics. The AI is also very wooden when compared to the later games. If you're starting out I would suggest either Hitman: Contracts or Blood Money. Codename 47 is more of a time capsule for purists.

												At full price, I can only recommend buying Codename 47 if you're a huge Hitman enthusiast. If it's on sale, however, I highly recommend to anybody who's into the Hitman series, or anybody who wants to get into the series. Does that mean this game is awful? Absolutely not, it's a wonderful game - but it's not without its faults. Here's some pros and cons:+Although stealth is the best option, you really don't get penalized for taking the loud and dumb route.+Provides an exceptional challenge.+Plenty of missions and gameplay time (I've watched most of the game before, I haven't played it as much though).+Provides good story, especially considering most games from this era in time lacked basic story elements.+Rather than beginning out with weapons or needing to collect them, you gain weapons upon mission completion, regardless of play style.+Before starting your mission, you select what weapons, items, and ammo you bring into the level - but for a price, and it's only for the current mission. For the next mission, you must select/reselect your inventory again. It makes you think more strategically on what items to use, rather than just take everything you can carry.-AI is pretty terrible by today's standards, especially compared to Blood Money.-Can be too hard at times. Codename 47 is harder than the rest of the games.-No checkpoints: so if you fail or make a mistake, you restart the whole mission. Fortunately, the missions are generally fairly short.-Camera is awkward at times. -Controls are terrible. I promise, you will want to map the controls before you start the game. Here's my config, to give you an idea:Walk forward: WRun: Shift (hold JUST shift to run. If you're also walking forward, it will not work, strangely enough.)Walk left (strafe): AWalk right (strafe): DWalk backwards: SLean left: XLean right: VPreform action: EToggle sneak: CToggle camera mode: AltDrop item: G (X works good as well)Equip binoculars: BEmpty hands (holster weapon): FFire: L mouseReload: RChange firing mode: DeleteShow map: MMission status: Tab			",207,25,0,11,4,3,2

												Hitman: Codename  ""I Need to Use the Bathroom"" 47 is the first entry of the series and lays down the core mechanics for future Hitman games.It's not surprising that Codename 47 is the least played game of the entire series.Although it's not uncommon for people to completely skip the earlier games of a series in favor of a more updated and relevant experience, C47 is without a doubt a classic. However, like many underappreciated classics, you have to ignore some of the game's flaws in order to reach the best parts of the game.The controls are a bit strange at first, but after rebinding keys to something more intuitive, the only thing you have to get used to is pressing a separate button to run forward. The main flaws of C47 are the completely oblivious AI, the lack of an extensive rating system, and the sometimes linear level design. The enemy AI functions more like walking sentry guns than actual guards. No matter how many times you run up behind someone the AI never turns around and the moment you acquire a disguise you're free to run around restricted areas without any suspicion.Even if the stealth isn't rewarding, the fact that 47 isn't a bullet sponge will encourage a more strategical approach. The game shines because each level plays out like a puzzle. The reward of figuring out how to assassinate your target without any prior knowledge is unlike any other game.Some of C47's best levels include Traditions of the Trade and The Lee Hong Assassination because of the expansive, non-linear level design and multiple approaches to completing the objectives. The sheer replayability of these levels are what defines Hitman as a series.While Codename 47 is noticeably flawed, it provided the framework for future games of the series to refine. The AI is forgiving, but at the same time the levels will require multiple playthroughs in order to find the solution. The age of the game may put some people off, but if you're really interested in the Hitman series, Codename 47 isn't a bad game to start with. At least, it's definitely better than Absolution.

												If you go into this expecting an actual stealthy Hitman game you're in for a big surprise. This is more of a straight shooter with disguise mechanics. You don't even get penalized for murdering guards, just civilians. But it's riotous good fun when you learn the pace of it.Also the keyboard controls are ♥♥♥♥ing mental.			",211,22,2,16,19,3,24

												Although lacking the amount of content of Hitman 2, Codename 47 is a fine start to the series. It has some of the finest levels that Contracts failed to recapture. Levels such as ""Traditions of the Trade"" and ""Say Hello to My Little Friend"". It's also the hardest in the series, just to beat (Silent Assassin♥♥♥♥♥♥in Hitman 2 was crazy as ♥♥♥♥).This game was great. Just get used to the controls.			",45,4,0,10,0,0,4

												This game was released on November 19, 2000. If you have been gaming since before 1990 and have patience, buy this game. I have followed the Hitman franchise but played the 2nd game first. I appreciate the older graphics and more difficult gameplay to a degree. If you purchase this game, bare in mind that the mechanics, AI, and gameplay will be completely different from the way games are created and played now. It is a difficult game to play but after a couple of  missions, it will be easier and you will understand how everything works. I enjoyed the large weapon selection, the fact you can sneak up on enemies, kill them and then drag the body and take the clothing. That is how basic the game works. You cannot hide bodies unless you just basically keep them out of site. If you are a Hitman fan, buy this game because it explains the beginning of the story and how Agent 47 came to be. If you decide not to play this game, Hitman: Contracts (3rd game) is a remake of Hitman: Codename 47. Still, the game is a classic nonetheless, and is definitely worth the buy if you have patience. We all have those older games we grew up playing and would recommend them to others. Although this was not a game I grew up playing, I still give it 4 out of 5 stars. Without it, we wouldn't have the new and improved Hitman games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hitman Codename 47 puts you in the shoes of a born and bred assassin and sends you off after a variety of bad guy targets in a surprisingly open environment that lets you pick and choose how you will go about dispatching death this day.You start off waking in a hospital gown, in a cramped room somewhere out in the world, the only hints to your identity a bar-code stamped at the back of your head and a computer chip in your brain. You are then quickly taken through a series of training exercises and then given your first assignment. You never ask why, nor question who it is that sends you on these missions. You simply are a hitman, devoid of any ethical dilemmas or personal identity. As you progress through the story you will eventually begin to discover clues as to your origin but for now, there are people alive that shouldn't be.Each mission sets you into a open area with guards, civilians, cops and others roaming the place. Various events within the missions are timed, as your targets goes about their business and it's up to you to pick the time, place and method by which you dispatch them. Different missions provide different obstacles and while all the missions have a path of least resistance you will often find yourself experimenting with different plans.Which weapons and items you bring with you is chosen at the start of the mission at a fee although you can also pick up and use what you find throughout the mission as well as take the clothes of any unfortunate henchmen or passerby you happen to kill or incapacitate and although it requires some effort to get past the suspension of disbelief it requires when a 7ft. blad psycho with a bar-code tattoo on the back of his head passes for an oriental chef with only a change of shirts the mechanic works wonderfully in the game and the many disguises and the various places they allow you to go opens up many more avenues leading towards your target.In general the open-ended nature of the missions is what separates Hitman 47 from the pack. An early mission has you recreating the classic Sollozzo assassination from the Godfather movie. You can play along with the movie, stashing a gun in toilet, go to the meeting, excuse yourself and then come out shooting. You can also walk through the front door with your gun cocked taking out the targets henchmen first, or you can wait for the target to go to bathroom himself and shoot him through the window, or one of a myriad of other possibilities that the game gives you.The game looks stunning for it's time, with high quality graphics and textures. The maps are big but never devoid of life. Sound quality is acceptable but nothing out of the ordinary.It is not all roses however, the game hasn't aged well and what was great graphics back in the day is now all but unplayable to a modern audience. The lack of a proper save game function was not acceptable, even back then.All in all Hitman Codename 47 is a great experience, the open maps and the many paths to chose from makes this one of the few true assassination games. A definite buy for any fans of stealth and subterfuge.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												The first PC game I have ever played.Just bought it for the nostalgia.A Third person shooter game with stealth elements.Gameplay is pretty good for a 2000year made game.Stealth element is well done for that year but don't expect so much by comparing it with todays games.At the start of most missions you get an e-mail and you read it to get some hints and important information after that you are on the field and you get more hints and information through cinematics and chats, it kinda felt like a puzzle(detective) to me because of this.Worst thing about the game is when you die or fail, you have to play the whole mission from the very start which means NO SAVING.***SPOILER***STORYAt first 47 escapes from an asylum by the instructions of someone.47 is a genetically modified assassin, killing many targets for a mysterious and strong client.First 47 starts a war between china triads and assassinates : Lee Hong.After that, 47 goes to Colombia and kills the drug lord : Pablo Belisario Ochoa.In a hotel located in Budapest 47 kills a terrorist and secures his bomb : Franz Fuchs.In a dock 47 gets on a ship and kill a weapon smuggler and defuses his nuke bomb : Arkadij ""Boris"" Jegorov. After these assasinations your client sends you to where you originated from, an asylum and you kill a doctor who made experiments on you : Odon Kovacs , but before his death he reveals a truth about Ort-MeyerAnd 47 finds the truth about himself and his client : Ort-Meyer, being a part of the cloning project.47 goes to underground and clears out the 48's den after that 47 kills Ort-Meyer.47 learns that he is the son of these 5 people he murdered. Lee Hong, Pablo Belisario Ochoa, Franz Fuchs, Arkadij ""Boris"" Jegorov, Ort-Meyer.These 5 were once part of the French Foreign Legion(47 learns this through letters.)Ort-Meyer killed other ""fathers"" because he did not want others to use 47.48s were also an upgraded version of 47 but 47 managed to beat them all.

												The first game in the Hitman series. Great entrance. Now, this game isn't perfect, especially when it comes to technical aspects. But everything else is really good. The atmosphere in this game is amazing, every mission has a special music, that special feeling that it's unique, not just another useless task. 3 difficulty levels - easy, normal and hard, but they only differ in combat, no effect on A.I. intelligence whatsoever. Once you pass a mission at least once, it then becomes only a question of time when you'll master it. Training + 12 missions. There's no room for major mistakes, because there are no saves during a mission, so basically it means that in certain situations one would have to restart a mission in order to succeed as restarting from a checkpoint does not reset alarm level.Graphics are really good as for that year's game. Gameplay is great, default controls aren't comfortable, but you can change that in the options without a problem. If you're playing this game for the first time, you can only imagine how good it must have been when it was first released, a real game changer and a top notch stealth genre king.All in all, it would be difficult not to recommend this game, unless you don't have patience and don't like stealth games. But what you get in this game is a trademark - Hitman. Something that very few games have. The ability to choose between going berserk rage mode or trying to be as silent as possible, like a shadow who destroys his targets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic old school game.  So, if you plan to play this expect to deal with antiquated game mechanics.  The whole challenge of this game is figuring out what to do in each level.  Once you figure that out, it is quite easy.  If you like the series or really just want to play the series from the beginning, then try this out.  If you don't mind playing old games, then this one isn't bad.Score: 7.5 / 10			",173,3,0,13,11,0,12

												Surprisingly a really fun game for being so old. Blending in is rather difficult and there are definitely trial and error situations. The plot isn't much to talk about for the first number of missions, but 47's background is worked around with cut scenes in between missions and the last few missions where 47 finally involves himself with his creation. The stealth mechanics can seem clunky, but again, this is a decade plus year old 3rd person stealth game.8.6/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												If one can get past the control-scheme (or learn to adapt to it) one can enjoy a game ""for the ages"", even if the game's content itself might not be for all ages.This game deserves to be at the top of the board, especially considering its age.If somebody doesn't like this game due to its difficulty (and is found without the needed skills for it) . . .

An oldie but a goodie! That needs a cane and a hip replacement. Despite the big blue thumb above this text, I can only recommend this game to some. It's quite an old game (Older than myself), but old games can still be good, Doom being the prime example. But the thing is with Hitman: Codename 47, it REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY hasn't aged well, the controls are strange and archaic, but with some fiddling, you can get somewhat modern controls. (The run button is completely independent of the walk forward, so you hold it to run, without holding the W key, which is weird at the start.)Now, onto to pros and cons:Pros:Quite big open levels.A nice roster of weapons.A purchase screen at the start of some missions, which lets you take what you need for whatever your playstyle maybe be. (Though some missions don't give you this option, and instead carry over weapons from the previous mission.)The story tells you about 47 and the five men who donated DNA to create 47.There's a fair few ways to go about things, gun blazing (wouldn't recommend it) or all stealthily like.Some missions have RNG to spice things up, like the safes in The Lee Hong Assassination.Pretty sweet music!Its levels are all quite different visually, each hit (Which consists of a mission or possibly multiple.) takes place in a different place. One takes place in a Columbian forest looking for a lost relic, getting around a tiger and breaking into a camp to kill a Tony Montana wannabe. While another takes place in a Chinese restaurant/brothel in Hong Kong. Plus, unlike some games *cough cough* Hitman *cough cough*, the NPCs have accents. I can't really gage some of them, but to me, they mostly sound good. (Though the Budapest accents sounded a little strange)Cons:The graphics are pretty yucky, with pixel heavy textures.The controls. Ohhhhhhh, golly God, the controls! All hail rebindable keys.The AI is very... Unpredictable. Sometimes, you can do something, say stab a guy and get no indication anyone heard, no guns firing or any of that, but then you round the corner and somebody shouts something like ""Alarm! Alarm! He's packing!"" annnnd, your health bar magically empties. The end. Bye.Wacky resolutions from 16 years ago. So, if you're planning to record this, it's going to be shrunk in the corner doing its thing. (At least with OBS)Not the friendliest with it mechanics and such, I mean the tutorial is all right, and it serves a story purpose but besides that, ehhhhh.Not a very good entry point to the franchise, if you're new to the series, stay away unless you become a big fan who wants to see where their beloved series was born. (In a mechanically awkward, poorly textured house. Even for the time.)No checkpoint system. You die, back to the load out screen. Yeah, it's real annoying.So, in conclusion:/TL:DR;This, at least I'd say, is a good game. Good ideas, some levels really are quite nice (Such as the Thermal Bath hotel in Budapest, that's my favourite level.) but ultimately it's aged horribly and can be a chore to slog through at times, but overall it's a good game. If you get through the gunk, of graphics, controls and it's generally archaic nature, it can be pretty fun. But, if you're new, I hear Contracts remade some of the best levels from this game, so go check that out, or, if you do fancy getting this, you may as well pick up the Hitman Collection like I did! It includes all the Hitman games, pardoning the new, weirdly released one. ",88,9,1,4,7,2,9

												Ahh yes, Hitman: Codename 47.It's a fun little game that involves Mr. 47 hitting men :)Waking up in a strange place that gives the protagonist an opportunity to escape that said strange place, we see 47 signing up for the ICA in the latest game and a year later back in the original game, we see Agent 47 hitting men in five locations including the mysterious Hong Kong, the corrupted Colombian jungle, the virtual representation of an actual hotel in Budapest, the ugly docks of Rotterdam, and that strange place that I already mention which is a Romanian hospital which is actually pretty strange.Here we see that the contracts that 47 received involves hitting men who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or 'soon-to-be-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s' but what's interesting is that if you pay attention to your briefings (or read more of the lore) or read the letters that your dead targets left lying around, there's a sense of connection going on between your targets which leads to the horrid truth for 47 once he takes out his final target. Though nothing is really shown too explicitly that 47 realised the purpose of his existence, if you use your head and discover that the five targets are actually the five ""fathers"" of 47 since they donated their DNA for a project of creating an army of perfectly-skilled men.The revelation of being designed to kill haunts him, and so we never to get to see 47 again until two years later in Silent Assassin.I thought the gameplay still holds up somewhat well after 16 years since release.The controls is quite clunky though such as in order to run, you only need to hold one button and if you attempt to hold the 'Forward' button as well while running then 47 will walk instead.Something you need to get used to if you play games including the latest Hitman games that involves running by holding two keys that involves movement.At times, the 'Use/Action' key won't do anything on certain things and that can only be solved by right-clicking on the object which brings up the action menu.And the AI would be either too dumb or unfairly annoying (as demonstrated in mission 7, I mean Jesus, the AI is such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥. There's no manual save/load system during missions so if you messed up then you have to restart your entire 10 minutes of progress all over again and even though there's a feature that would place you at a checkpoint once you die, the enemy AI will still be alerted of your presence so you'll have to gun your way to your objective if you really want to continue (and despite years of training, 47's aiming is awful as the bullets flies everywhere so I wouldn't exactly recommend 'Rambo' your way through this game at all).You should be able to play this game on any computer, even the weakest of this generation, but if you're unlucky then this game can be quite unstable including random crashes. In 3/4 of my playthrough, whenever I drop my items, they'll float in the air and some sound effects such as choking people with fibre wire went missing.And also the game sometimes freezes for me in a couple seconds whenever I talk to an NPC. I won't post a benchmark because as already been said: this game can run on any computer with smooth performances (60+ FPS).I recommend go to this site if you need to fix or tweak your game: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hitman:_Codename_47Graphically, the game looks charming for its time but the draw distance is too low which can be increased with this tool[hitmanspeedruns.boards.net] though it will affect the framerate, even if you have a beastly rig.And the music is perfect and suits the ambience of the game very well.Good job, Jesper Kyd. You nailed it.

What else is there to say? I thought I wouldn't like this game very well due to instability on modern hardware but months later with a new PC, I managed to run it almost flawlessly in 1080p resolution with high draw distance.The game is great to pass the time and is important for the origins of 47 and to understand the overall timeline of the franchise.Memorable Quotes:He's packin'!This guy is loaded!Goon!We have a situation here!Well I mean I hear those quotes all the time when I eff-ed up, but here's the best one yet: I need to use the bathroom.TL:DR-Game is around five hours long.-It involves hitting men :)-There's actually a conspiracy going on around here.-Gameplay holds up alright.-Controls is a pile of wank.-AI can be stupid or unfair.-Game looks aged but it's nice for its time.-Can be quite unstable for modern hardware, requires tweaking for an optimal experience.-Music is beautiful and fits well.-Try not to do anything stupid if you don't want to restart a mission after 10 minutes.-Game is fun, I have fun, you will have fun, so I recommend that you buy this game.

												Codename 47 attempts to execute on a complex and unusual premise. The game is focused heavily on stealth - primarily of the social variety, using disguises. While the game is marred by several design flaws, such as a lack of mid-mission saving, it remains an interesting game for those who won't be turned away by its extreme difficulty. There are several memorable experiences here under the (somewhat frustrating) surface.			",300,66,3,37,11,1,45

												Coming back to this game after 16 years makes you realize all the improvements they made in successive Hitman games(until Absolution, anyway). The concept of a game revolving around a 'hitman' was novel at the time and the ragdoll physics were quite advanced. The huge environments are fantastic to explore, but the lack of an ingame quick save makes some of the missions insanely frustrating(Jungle God). Another reviewer mentioned the AI and stealth in some missions feels unbalanced and I would agree. Even still, if you're a fan of these games and have never seen where the series came from, I think it's worth going back to. + Bald Man with Barcode+ Lots of Guns+ Hilarious Dialogue+ No Nuns with Guns- Jungle Mission- No Quicksave - ""I need to use the bathroom""			",161,20,1,10,7,1,21

The Villans, the character, the story and dialouge holds value and can be given as example to this day.The Sandbox system, The Atmosphere and everything.Some people say there is a problem with gameplay, and can be a tedious task at times, i say then no worries even if you use all guns cheat you will still have fun because of good gunplay system.There is a fun example of some of small detail examples in comparison to new Mafia 3 check this out:

												Game is pretty whack. Obviously the developers learned from their mistakes with later installments.Still, it's a pretty great game, and was one of my favourites around its release.Some really confusing decisions with the control scheme, although it's actually kind of cool when you get your head around it.If you think the other games are trial / error type gameplay, then this one is like that amped up to infinity. Some objectives are just really vague and opaque, you sometimes just have to stumble upon them. Not only that but the game is unforgiving when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan (I mean you're still a badass and can blast an army away if need be, but if you make mistakes, you're gonna get hurt)Hasn't really aged too well.

												Playing this is a clear sign of how far the Hitman series has come in regards to improving its gameplay. This game is riddled with problems that honestly I'm surprised I kept playing it all the way until the end. In theory, this game gives you objectives and then lets you figure out how to handle them. In practice however, the levels only really allow for one specific strategy in order to complete them. It ends up becoming a game that, rather than being about finding creative ways to brutally kill people, is really just about figuring out what you exactly must do to finish the level and then executing it.So there's basically no variation. Also the AI is beyond terrible. I've shot guards and, so long as nobody saw me shoot them, I could stand right next to the body as the guards run up to investigate without thinking that I was the one who did it. I suppose I should be grateful about this though, because you need to kill plenty of people to finish each level. And if you get caught, expect to end up in a massive gunfight that you can have serious trouble surviving. A single witness or one unsilenced gunshot can ruin everything. Sadly, while there are a few levels that truly allow you to be a sneaky hitman, there are more levels where you are just gunning people down. And the last level doesn't even try: it's a straight shootout without any chance for subtle tactics.If you want to be a sneaky assassin, this is not the game for you. This game's only real value at this point is that it messed up enough that the game developers had to learn from the mistakes made here. And that led to them making the fantastic Hitman: Blood Money.But there's no real reason to play this one. Save your money and your time.			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												A classic game with a lot of old school appeal.  Be warned that there is no hand-holding involved.  The lack of a save function in-game, combined with the trial and error approach to missions means you are guaranteed to be restarting entire levels numerous times before making the hit.  The result can be a great deal of frustration, but the payoff when you get things just right is well worth it for those who don't give up easily.  Don't buy this if you're looking for a fast-paced shooter experience, gameplay is reliant on patience and smart timing.  Presentation-wise, the visuals have aged surprisingly well, and Jesper Kyd's soundtrack is, as ever, immersive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hitman is a series of games from Yo Interactive where you get to control a bald, well-dressed clone assassin named 47, with a subtle bar code printed on the back of his head. The game's goal is for you to be as stealthy as possible while killing your targets. You'd think that would be hard, with the bar code and everything, but no, because the game's A.I. is slightly superior to a doorknob ",387,116,5,52,58,2,60

												The starter of my favorite game series right here. However, I played this one after finishing the other games in the series, and purchased this to see how it all started.First thing you'll notice, is that this game really shows its age. If the graphics don't turn you away (I really don't pay attention to graphics), at least the controls will be very painful to learn. Moving is stiff, picking things up is clumsy and the inventory system is the biggest hunk of♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever seen in my years as a gamer. And yes the graphics are horrible nowadays. The draw distance is legit 20 meters, which is espesially annoying in missions like Say Hello To My Little Friend or Plutonium Runs Loose, which are mostly flat with very few obstacles, so the enemies see you before you can see them.After dealing with the obvious technical issues that you'll encounter right out of the gates, we'll go check out how the game actually plays. To make some comparison to the later games, here you can't sedate innocents, but you have to kill them whenever necessary. There's no lockpicking, and if there's a locked door, you have to find key for it. There's no rank system, and you are rewarded with money. This game really made me feel like an assassin and there's some really good, action film like atmosphere. Also the soundtrack is already as good as we are used to know in Hitman. I also like how clone-ish agent 47 is in this game. He moves, speaks and looks like a zombie, and shows no morale. He does whatever he's paid to or dies trying. This game is also very hard. But unlike Hitman 2, this is actually a fair game for the most part. See, here the AI isn't as overly paranoid as h2, and this game includes more puzzle solving than hiding from lunatic AI. In this game the disguise system is very close to the one in Blood Money If you are wearing right clothes in right place, and you don't do anything obviously criminal in public, guards will hardly notice you. As much as I love h2, I think that this type of AI suits Hitman better.And now to the actual missions, the core of the franchise. There are few highlights, that really are on the same levels as the other games, like Lee Hong Assassination and the original TotT (which is imo better than the remake), but other than that most levels are either very non-memorable of just very bad. Some levels feel very unfinished and thrown-in, to increase the game's lenght. Some levels have good ideas, but they fall flat for poor execution good example is the ending level where  47 goes to kill his creator and the other clones of him . It sounds so cool, but it's actually one of the worst levels in the game. A good example of a filler level is Jungle God: no targets, linear jungle track, that you can complete pretty much by holding ""W"" for couple of minutes. There's overall the feeling that the devs weren't quite sure what kind of game they wanted to make, since some of the missions seem so absurd. I still have to give credit for making each and every target memorable in some way. They just have somewhat more character, than most targets in the later games. From a pedophile-ish policeman to an egoistic drug lord, and from a suicidal terrorist (the one with Hawaii-shirt) to a mad cloner, everyone is somehow memorable, and all of them are total scumbags. This game makes you really hate your targets with passion. Also the changing atmosphere and music in each country is something really special.Afterall this game left a good taste in my mouth. Maybe it's because it's so damn hard and satisfying complete levels stealthily, but overall I enjoyed it a lot. I'd recommend this, but not for everyone. I don't really care about graphics in video games so that might be a problem for someone else. I'd also recommend to play some other Hitman games before this, because they are easier to get into, and better way to find out, are these kind of games your thing at all. Even though there weren't many good levels for me, I still enjoyed the atmosphere and the best missions hold up to this day.			",53,1,0,2,2,0,2

												A pretty damn solid game despite being dated. The first thing most people would notice about this game is that the levels are completely open and many of them are huge, which is both great and daunting. Some of the levels are so big and have a ton of things going on in them which makes getting through them stealthily very challenging. I personally enjoy the graphics that these old games used and you'll find that many great games were around the time using this same style, i.e. the old GTA's. Playing these games with these kinds of graphics really bring you back to the mood you'd've had when you played this new. The diversity of weapons is wide and sometimes a little out there for a game based around stealth, like the minigun on Plutonium Runs Loose, but that just adds to the game because it gives you options to have fun with. One problem I had was with the bugs, especially with the old AI, which is understandable but still frustrating. Another problem that must be said is the difficulty of actually getting the game to run in your native resolution and keeping it stable so it doesn't crash after every action in-game. There were a few times when I was very far into a level only for it to crash and have me restart. I'd suggest looking up on Google for an .ini that reconfigures the controls and resolution.Regardless,8/10 ",193,24,1,20,6,0,15

												Hitman is a series of games from Yo Interactive where you get to control a bald, well-dressed clone assassin named 47, with a subtle bar code printed on the back of his head. The game's goal is for you to be as stealthy as possible while killing your targets. You'd think that would be hard, with the bar code and everything, but no, because the game's A.I. is slightly superior to a doorknob ",387,116,5,52,58,2,60

												I am going to support JAX's review here. My reason for this is because I can tell you EXACTLY how I found out about Hitman Codename 47 and I was with my family and I remember asking my father to buy it for me and it's just a long story and a very sentimental moment for and this game only deserves respect. For a 2000 game it's an amazing work and an inteligent story line. I definitely had hard time adjusting to the controls and the graphics... Well you know it's not going to be outstanding but if you are in your early 20s or mid 20s you will definitely understand why I am attached to this game. It is amazing how much the Hitman franchise have evolved and I would never imagine there would be a movie when I got the game 15 years ago. I feel old being able to say 15 years ago and clearly remember everything but this memory is one of the things that made it very well worth it. It introduces you to the Hitman series in an amazing light and you gotta bear with it since nowadays game are a lot easier to control and technology have evolved to the point we have Virtual Reality. Even in Sci-Fi movies this idea was ridiculous 10-15 years ago. You don't HAVE to play this one in order to understand the story line but it definitely makes it easier to understand the idea behind Hitman and gives you a mental trophy; do not be fooled, this one is a tough one. In the more complicated levels you get a few chances to complete the level and pretty much restart a couple time after you died but don't expect convenient Save Games. You gotta really think here and beat the odd bugs here and there. I could keep on rambling for another 3000 words but point is this game is worth it, you don't judge a game just by how it looks and operates comparing to games noawadays. There are at least 10 major factors you have to take into account. This game did a great job portraying the life of a hitman and had an amazing story-line and really put you in the game and feels somewhat like a puzzle because it's not just aimless shooting and you die realistically after a couple hits or like 5-10 shots if you are hit in the kevlar vest. I enjoyed this game a lot and also enjoyed being frustrated with this game, it definitely brought back memories from when games took more than 5-15 hours to beat. I give this one 8.5/10 (could be less buggy and the saving system could be more intelligent and other very small factors made me rank it as 8.5/10) I tried ranking it without keeping in mind this became a successful Series and just ranked it as if this was the only Hitman game out there. Buy it, play and go back to the past :) Thank you kind developers and the publishing team.			",155,17,9,9,20,2,4

												This game started it all and is still one of the best games to date in the Hitman Series.While the controls are indeed clunky i would still suggest playing this game. The Storyline and idea of the game is great.As many of you probably already know you play as Agent 47 a hitman for hire whos job is to hunt down and deal with his targets he works for the ICA (International Contract Agency) and travels around the world from Europe, middle east to south america and more.Now the Pros and cons of this gamePros:* Classic Stealth Gameplay* A great in deapth storyline * Countless Hours of gameplay and enjoymentCons:*The Game controls could be slighly annoying to new players due to the amount of keys needed to do some of the moves in this game.Overall i rate this game a 9/10 I enjoyed it back in the days before steam i enjoy it now and will enjoy it in the future.

												I never managed to beat the first Hitman game - until today. I remember playing demo version as kid, and then the full version but it was way too hard for me to beat later missions. After so long time, it's still really great and worth buying game. You don't get nowadays games this hard. Maybe first Hitman have a little bit outdated graphics, but story is still strong, music is great and overall this game will make you feel like a real assassin. Sadly I can't say for sure how it is compared to later titles in series, since I spend even less time playing them than Hitman: Codename 47. I'm glad I can finally move to next game.

												I didn't start the series originally with Hitman: Codename 47 (I started with Silent Assassin), but, playing it now, it actually makes me appreciate the ones afterwards more. The Hitman series actually is really great in its storytelling, and this game - while slightly different from the ones later - adds a lot more depth to the series as a whole, and really explains 47's life from the beginning.If you're a Hitman fan, as I am, and haven't already played it, this game is a must-have!

You're doing just fine, my friend!The original game that started it all. I'd suggest this should only be played by hardcore Hitman fans as there's no help at all nor any kind of freedom in choices how to assassinate and complete the missions, as there is only one scripted way. Trial & error is the only way to beat most of the game.Click here for controls, resolution & draw distance optimization.[✔]> solid level design (17 years old)> mission variety> soundtrack> interesting NPC interaction> decent stealth mechanics[✘]> lackluster AI> bugs occur often> no save/checkpoint systemOld but gold.

												Hitman: Codename 47 is the first PC-exclusive installment in the series. Be warned this is not an easy game as it requires lots of patience combined with a hefty duration of trial & error. Also, the default controls doesn't do this game justice as they are horrible, I suggest you tweak the controls to your liking before playing. In addition you can't save the game so if you get killed or spotted you might aswell restart the mission by pressing Shift+Esc as the checkpoint system sucks and it will put everyone on high alert. Some missions can be long and tedious especially a level called  plutonium runs loose  iff you know what you are doing as most missions should take no more than 10-15 mins to complete. However, if you are willing to go for the ride you are rewarded with an amazing experiance. There is a feeling of satisfaction when completing a mission, taking out a guard and hiding his body then using his disguise to traverse the level undetected. The graphics are tollerable but there is alot of jaggies when you run this game in high resolution. This is easily fixed by applying AA in your graphics control panel, I personally applied 4xmsaa in the nvidia control panel and it worked like a charm.The steam version has some flaws, which are listed below with some fixes:When you first launch the game, you might get ""Failed to find Steam"" error. To fix this Verify integrity of game cache or Copy the steam.dll in the steam folder to the ""Steam\SteamApps\common\hitman codename 47"" directory. Now the game will launch.To fix some in-game crashes make sure to run the Hitman.exe in Windows XP (Service Pack 2) Compatibility Mode.To run the game in widescreen resolution, you need to edit the Hitman.ini file in the install directory. There is a problem with the steam overlay not displaying correctly and in my case it didn't appear at all. I wasn't able to fix this problem.Here are my recommended .ini tweaks:Include Setup\Locale.zip 
//DrawDll Render3DFX.dll 
DrawDll RenderOpenGL.dll
//DrawDll RenderOpenGL.dll 
SoundDll Sound.dll 
ScriptDll GSC.dll

ColorDepth 32
Anisotropy 2

DisableLight
ShadowDetail 2
TextureResolution 0
DisableDXT
DisablePAL
Window
StartUpperPos 0,0
Note: In order to make the .ini tweaks to work do not run the configuration utility, do not change the graphics settings in-game. If you verified the game cache, the hitman.ini file will be restored to default, so make sure to back up your .ini file just in case. To sum up I recommened this game to old school stealth fans or to anyone who likes challenging games. ",603,170,22,55,24,3,85

												The combination of ""Thief""-style sneaking with smart enemy A.I. and the use of realistic weapons-piano wire, silenced pistols, sniper rifles, and even M-60s-creates an intense experience, though many gamers will be frustrated by the lack of in-game saving.If not for the lack of a save game feature and the incredibly high difficulty factor, this game might be the best shooter of its time. Even despite these defects, it comes damn close.The physics model in Hitman was a definite milestone in computer gaming. No other computer game at the time had been able to achieve the realistic effects you’ll find here.The wonderful, colourful graphics, the realistic and well-suited sounds, and the game's challenging difficulty make it great.

												히트맨 프렌차이즈의 뼈대를 만든 작품이다. 이번에 한패를 만들면서 다방면으로 뜯어보고 분석해본 결과. 이 작품은 명작이라고 불리는 히트맨4, 사람들에게 강한 인상을 남긴 히트맨3을 비롯하여 전 시리즈의 모든 것이 시도된 작품이라고 할 수 있겠다. 안타깝게도 1편에서 시도된 여러가지가 실제 게임에선 구현되지 못 했을 뿐. 구작이라 세이브에 관련되서 많은 불편함을 야기하지만, 구작이란 원래 다 그런 법. 난이도 상승의 원인이 되긴해도 그걸 파훼하는 재미가 있다. 애초에 나온 당시 생각해보면 상당히 파격적인 작품이라, 시리즈 1편부터 해보는 것도 좋을 것이다. 히트맨 1은 암살자가 되어 자신의 출생 비밀을 깨우치며 엔딩까지 이르는 게임이다. 후속작에 비해서 자유도는 좀 없는 편이지만, 아예 없는 편도 아니다. 몰래 위장하여 잠입하고, 타켓을 어떻게 요리할 지 머리를 쓰는 그 맛이 일품인데 어차피 가장 효율적인 방법은 정해지다시피해서 어느정도 숙지한 유저는 빠른 클리어도 가능하다. 도전 욕구를 자극하는 난이도와 미션 구성. 매력적인 47의 설정.. 한 번 해볼만 하다. 참고로 시리즈1편의 미션들이 3편인 컨트렉츠에서 리메이크 되어 나온다. 3편이 사실상 1편의 리메이크 작품이기 때문. 불편한 시스템과 구작인 것이 걸린다면 3편만 해도 상관이 없다.

												Still the best Hitman game. With almost no premarked paths that you HAVE to go, this old school sneak shooter will give you hours of pleasurable challenges. On other stealth shooters, your path is usually one dimensional. It is allready layed out for you and you can only divert from it in the smallest details. In Codename 47 this is not the case. Sometimes it feels like there is no damn way at all. That's what I love about this game. Testing your skill at patience and improvisation, Codename 47 gives you a very realistic experience without getting boring. In this game, a hit is how it is supposed to be. Prone to mishaps, uncertainties and with a million or no way to pull the thing off. This game is no walk in the park.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have mixed feelings about Codename 47 on one hand its a excellent steath game on the other hand it has one of the worst rendering mechanics I ever seen.The story isn't by any means good , voice acting is embarrassing but what you really want if you are buying a hitman game the is stealth aspect of it that is where the game delivers.I like to divide levels Very Open and Very Small, now the Small levels where their are corridors and hallways are where you'll enjoy the game you study your enviroment , guard's paths , where to accquire weapeons, etc essentials slowly form a plan and execute it, the Open once are just broken not because of how the game but how it renders its graphics because it is a very short distance and thats why Small levels are better, now to play Open levels your going to use ur binoculars every 15 seconds to scout if their is an enemy because they will be difficult to see and most likely half your health is gone, I have no idea why they implemented a life system where if you die you are given 3 more chances and your actions are still done because if you get spotted with a weapon the guards shoot at you and its either you or them who dies, I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were a permanent death were applyied but thats my opinion...Now if you want a stealth game I recommend this for you even thou the Open levels suck they don't ruin the whole game and besides you could spend hours trying to find the perfect plan to complete a level, and that is where the game shines			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Because of the improvements and developments in the later installments of the Hitman franchise, Hitman: Codename 47 might be concidered a bit flat. The controls are different and somewhat limited as are the ways to complete each mission as a true hitman - there's really only one way on most of the missions. Put aside these differences (because that's what they are, not flaws or negative features) the game offers players to see the history and story behind Agent 47. If you don't plan to buy this game for nostalgic reasons you'd be best off expecting less of everything compared to the newer games in the series.Needless to say, if you're a devoted Hitman fan you won't be disappointed.""He is packing!""

												Well, I like it! Be sure to start with this one before you play the rest in the series. I actually like that you can't save during a level (just like in Absolution on hardest difficulty). It kind of felt a real achievement to progress. The game itself has smart levels that require thinking, planning ahead and split second decision making. It's notoriously hard and any mistake can be punished mercilessly. Or if you're lucky you might be able to get away with it...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As the opener to the Hitman series I have to say this was a good opener. The overall gameplay can be buggy but its very rewarding when you line everything up right and you get that""Silent Assassin"" score and feel. This game is by far not easy and NEEDS better controls and quality but an old game to PC port, I'm fairly happy with my time spent playing. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 If you can look for the gold beneath the rust, you're in for a treat. 7.3/10  Ah, the beginning of an era in the stealth/action game genre.  Hitman: Codename 47  is where the revolutionary  Hitman  series began in 2001. Being a fan since  Hitman: Blood Money , when I saw the series on sale, I was delighted, and am now in the process of playing through them. Gameplay: 7/10  The  Hitman  series' use of difficulty and required creativity have their beginnings here. You  WILL  have to pay attention to guards, their movements, what they react to, and their overall patterns. Some are quick, some are not. I'll admit, the gunplay in  Codename 47  is lacking, but not by a huge margin. You really do manage to get used to it after a while of practicing.  There are also additional bugs that may have to be worked around when encountered. The stealth mechanics, though, even for its age, are well kept. Dragging bodies, disguising, slitting throats; what's  not  to love?  Storyline: 9/10  This is where it all begins. Agent 47's long trail of bodies begins as he wakes up strapped to a bed, and explores more about his past and origins through the game. As far as an origin story goes, he's got quite a load here.  Graphics: 5/10  The graphics, mediocre even for the game's time, are nothing to guffaw at, even for nostalgia fans, and this particularly where the game falls short. Textures are dull and sometimes conflict with each other. Severely pixelated and blurry textures are not uncommon.Overall,  Hitman: Codename 47 , despite its age and its shortcomings, can be thoroughly enjoyed through the nice tint of some rose-colored glasses.

PROS:+ cool assassinations+ nice weapon variety+ (mostly) free choice of how to complete a mission+ good & challenging AI (most of the time)+ okay storyCONS:- somewhat outdated graphic options- a bit clunky gun fighting- some level designs are confusing- a couple of bugs & glitchesComment:Ahhh, this game. The pioneer of the Hitman series. I remember it being recommended to me by a friend who said it was a ""nice & relaxing game""... he lied. It is not relaxing although it is nice, well, if you think murdering people by strangulation via piano wire is nice. You start the game and almost immediately you realize how difficult it is. You either have the marksmanship and sneak/timing skills ... or you just simply never finish the game. I did rage quit myself. Years later I tried again (although I admit that with some help of a walkthrough guide for 2 levels). This time around I got to complete the game. The story is okay although nothing really extra, but it provides an occassional laugh. Overall the gameplay is cool and if you do not mind the older graphics you might have fun from the challenge. I can recommend this game to gamers who like the old games style that punched you in the crotch until you finished them ... or until you rage quit. Good luck!P.S.: I had a physical copy of the game and finished it years ago, thus the reason for the short game time here on Steam			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

SummaryHitman; Codename 47 is a third-person stealth shooter and I/O Interactive's sleeper hit, which allows you to assassinate contract targets for cash and to unravel the past of the man known as Agent 47. Gameplay HItman Codename 47 plays smoothy allowing you to bind controls to stealthily drag enemies, holster weapons, talk to NPC's, drag away bodies from the sight of other enemies, assume their identity temporarily, use the environment to kill your foes, fire upon them with silenced (or unsilenced) firearms and amongst a huge list more. Hitman has unparalelled freedom in allowing you to take down your target as you want it, not how the game wants you to play.Plot Codename 640509-040147 is the designation given by the Prof. Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer a German scientist who worked on the genetics to create the world's best assassinator, with the recombinant DNA of 5 fathers all belonging to criminal overlords known as; Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer himself, Chinese restraunt owner Lee Hong, Columbian drug lord Pablo Belisario Ochoa, International terrorist Franz Fuchs and finally Arkadij Jegorov, a international gun launderer from Kazakhstan. Agent 47, his demeanour is cold, calculative and as sharp as a .338 Lapua Magnum round in your Cerebral Cortex, is set out to join the ICA, his base of operations that deliver him contracts to take up in assassinating his marks for money, however the marks set by his client may not be exactly say who he actually is.GameplayThe gameplay in Hitman Codename 47 places you in an open area with different places to execute killshots or strangulate your mark. Killing too many civilians will severely reduce your paygrade and the ability to purchase ammo and other equipment for the job and committing mass murder of innocents will inevitable cause you to fail the mission.GraphicsCodename 47 features detailed mipmapping, radiosity shadowing, high polygon counts and high resolution textures and use of physics ragdolls which were impressive for their time (near 2000). Though the repetition in the use of urban buildings is overused and the sprite/flat shaded sprites and textures for foilage are not very well done. The draw distance is terrible however due to time and the antiquity of the engine used. SoundThe games audio has high use of fidelity (16 bit, 48Khz was considerably high) in its soundtracks and is focused mainly on its theme which has a Jungle and Classical genre feel to it, sound effects are done to great effect, representing a solid bullet shot out of a Sniper Rifle into the flesh of someones face.

												Hitman is a very detailed and difficult stealth game. It draws upon earlier titles like Thief, but relies more on disguising yourself and using technology. There is also a great deal of planning involved with accomplishing a mission. Like Thief you achieve a far better score with not killing anyone during your approach to your objective and with not being detected. Not for the faint of heart or players who prefer to run and gun. This is a game that you have to take very, very slowly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So hard, I had to cheat to finish the final level correctly without loosing my sanity. The game is not broken, but it tries its best to use the technology of the time to present a semi-authentic stealth/dress-up simulator experience. Worth playing, even if you only play through once. However, if you're unsure, it's perfectly fine to try the most recent Hitman instead.Gameplay:

												Loved this game when it was first released. There weren't many games back then that had this kind of freedom. There were so many different ways to kill your target or complete your objectives. It was awesome. Good times, good times ! Only thing that annoyed me was the fact that it didn't really run all that well. Unfortunately, IO Interactive isn't really capable of creating a decent engine. It's still a game that's worth playing though.[Rating: 85/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game expecting a ride into the past, to see what I had missed in the early days of PC gaming. Let me tell you, I didn't miss a thing. The controls for this game felt like I was playing this on a TI-84 calculator, and the difficulty of the game is only multiplied by the sheer lack of directions of actual mechanics. The graphics make up for everything though. Had I not installed my trusty Nvidia 1080 GPU,  doubt I would be able to run it at 4k, but let me tell you, this game will blow you out of the water. The Witcher 3 has nothing on the sheer jaw dropping beauty the develeopers have released into the world. If you have a potato rig, stay away, as the graphics for this game are far beyond the bell curve. Some people say that graphocs don't make a game. Those people have not played Hitman:Codename 47.

Hitman: Codename 47 is the first in the Hitman Series. A Game that was released in November 2000. I only got into this game recently due to only being a Hitman fan since the release of Absolution (Then buyiing every other Hitman game).If you are unfamiller with the Hitman series, it's basically about the most amazing Assassin, traveling around the world killing peole.Unlike the new entry in the series, where there are so many ways to do one thing, Codename 47 dissapointingly doesn't have many ways to finish the levels. It's like there are one or two ways of getting past guard, one way to kill him, one or two ways to kill him.The game isn't bad in any way, it's just a bit dissapointing in comparison to it's years older sequals.Looking at the game itself, it looks good for a game that game out in 2000. The levels are pretty unique and it's really good fun at most times, though one mistake and your screwed, I am unable to shoot out every guard like in the newer games or run around a corner and hide.I would recommend this game to people who have already played the newer games in the series and want to continue playing Hitman because as a Hitman game, it is great. You buy your weapons at the start of every mission so you have to plan  how your going to do it before beginning. So, overall I would give this game a 6.5/10, good, not terrible or great.

												100% Try & Error game.No logic, no saves during the missions and no time given to explore the map, to figure out the (in most cases) only way accomplishing the mission, makes it a frustrating experience.If you really want to play it, you should consider using a walkthrough and cheats or you're gonna have a bad time. I gurantee it.I recommend to read a summary of the plot or watching a Let's Play of it and then starting with the much better ""Silent Assassin"". You can come back later to it if you're still hungry for Hitman, but as an introduction for Agent 47 the game might leave a bad first impression.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was probably good back then, but it aged badly. It has less stealth than sequels, forcing you to go on shoot-outs most of the time and there is no accidental deaths and penalty for being seen or killing non-targets. The AI is bad : people will shoot at you for reasons you don't even know without warning. You can carry guns when disguised but for some reason people will shoot at you if you carry a specific weapon which makes no sense, and even less sense since you find that weapon from their own base. Like for the two parts of columbia you can take a sniper from them and walk normally, but once in third part they'll suddenly shoot at you for no reason. One annoying thing is that people will see you ready your weapons even if you're behind them, you have to crouch so that they don't see you. I have to check guides to see how the AI works before starting a mission because of how random it is.The voice acting is also hilariously bad. I love the Hitman series and I say skip this one.

""I need to use the bathroom""Hitman: Codename 47 is the first installment of the now popular HITMAN series. It takes place as the first in the series, being made in 2000. It follows the contracts of Agent 47, a clone bred for the sole purpose of assassinating others, as he travels to places such as Hong Kong, killing key targets as the story unfolds.Additional Notes: Got with the HITMAN Steam bundle during Steam Summer Sale 2016Pros- Very rewarding - no saves or checkpoints- Fun missions- Mission variety- (some) expansive maps- Hard at timesCons- 'Meh' gunplay- Bizarre starting key binds (Can rebind however)- No saves or checkpoints can get tedious- No clear way to do each mission- Must do each mission VERY specifically (differs from Absolution's many choices)- Aged badly- Forced gunfightsWorth it?Full Price- YesOn Sale- YesVerdict: A fun little game to play one or two missions before going off of it, cheap price of £4.99, worth it if into hardcore stealth\Third-Person Shooter games or want to see where the series began.

												Not bad for the first in the series.However, this game hasn't aged well. Graphics aside the game is plaged with bugs and the controls even when rebound are atrocious, even compared to other old games.For me, i couldnt get far, as no matter what i did, i couldnt equip weapons.Needless to say i would highly recomened any game after codname 47. Especially considering story is almost nonexistanti give it a 2/3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hitman: Codename 47TL;DR - Skip this, buy the second gameI would like to start off by saying that, as of writing this review, I have played every Hitman game, with the exception of Contracts. This gives me the opportunity to compare the games with each other and how well they (still) hold up.Unfortunately, “Hitman: Codename 47” does not hold up very much. Time was not very kind to the game and it surely hasn’t aged all too well, making it rather difficult to recommend a playthrough. There are a number of issues that plaque Codename 47. Being made 2000, it sure looks and plays like a contemporary game of that era. The graphics are okay at best, but like many early 3D games, everything is kind of blocky, which might be the result of IO-Interactive being a very small developer with limited resources back in the day. The gameplay is just plain clunky and overly complicated for no apparent reason. Seriously, different buttons for normal walking speed and running, sidestepping (strafing) and turning around? It took a while and a lot of key rebinding to get used to these controls personally. Anyone who played other or modern FPS/TPS will likely have the same issue.Regarding the music, it’s good. Jesper Kyd, whom you may know as the composer for other games such as Assassin’s Creed, Borderlands and Kane & Lynch, is doing a fantastic job with very ambient, moody pieces, setting a perfect tone to a gritty game full of wetwork. The sound engineering in general is okay, nothing to complain about. However, the voice acting is atrocious. Thank god they casted people with their respective dialect to fit the correlating character, but none of them are any good. Especially Agent 47 himself sounds just really silly and it’s hard to take him serious. Then again, a lot of games had this problem and still have, so it’s hard to fault the game just on the VA alone. David Bateson, voice actor for 47, reprised his role in subsequent sequels, doing a lot better in those thankfully.Now, the biggest problem with “Codename 47” is simple: it just isn’t very good. What first appears to be a game about being sneaky and confronting targets with care and silence quickly just turns into a game that feels like a run-and-gun shooter, a pretty bad one. With the exception of two or three missions, the most part of the game is spent on gunning down the henchmen of your targets, before executing the targets themselves. Normally I don’t have a problem with blasting my way through waves of bad guys, however the problem here is A) we’re supposed to be a silent killer, so what gives? And B) the enemies have an unforgiving pin-point accuracy, leaving you dead before you can even insult the game for the cheap enemy fire.Things that are supposed to aid you in your quest are meaningless. Taking on disguises of dispatched enemies often times doesn’t work in your favor, simply raising an alarm for the AI, which, in this game means “Everyone knows who you are, even in disguise. Why? Because the game hates you”. The AI WILL see you, disguise or not, from across the map. They will follow you, find you and they will kill you, because apparently everyone absolved with a diploma from the Liam Neeson School Of Premeditated Murder. And did I mention some missions have a failstate? So when the alarm is raised, you’re pretty much out of luck and will have to restart the mission if you’re not quick enough to get to your target. Simply put, the AI is broken beyond belief and leaves a bitter taste on an otherwise promising game.Although I’ve been very critical about “Codename 47”, I want to address that I’ve had my fair share of fun with it. I loathed it more than enjoying it, but I would be lying if I didn’t enjoy some aspects, like the few missions which feel like actual Hitman games (the missions “The Lee Hong Assassination” and “Traditions of the Trade” come to mind).“Hitman: Codename 74” sets the foundations for a fantastic and still mostly unique video game franchises. The debut game is sadly overshadowed by subsequent games in every conceivable way. With the second game in the series, “Silent Assassin”, IO-Interactive out-done themselves already.If you would like to know how the franchise started, give it try. However, if you want to play a game that feels more like a proper Hitman, skip this one and just continue with the second game, Silent Assassin. Otherwise, try “Hitman: Contracts” which is basically an expanding and proper remake of the debut.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I probably will get minuses for this, but I just can't lie about it.Original Hitman was one of the games of my childhood. This was the first assassin-theme game I ever played. I instantly got into it, and carried out a little obsession with assassin's, thieves, spies and other people of that kind to present days.  So it was fun back then, I even recall a moment when I called a friend to help me figure out the level, sweet memories.The reason behind negative review is because we became spoiled. Times back then we didn't had that much variety of games and stuff we have now. Games like this was jewels. When I came back to this, I haven't got even half of the fun I had back then. This game have alot of problems. It all begins with a some bugs and glitches and end up in sometimes just terrible level design. Some events have no logic behind it, like say a mission in harbour, when a guy comes up from guarded doors, you can kill him and take his clothes, but guards still won't let you in for some reason. Beside all this, the game is relentless - you will die in a matter of seconds even on low difficulty. You of course have a restarts, but they have a little sense, since the guards already know that they need to kill you, and so you die, again. To a matter of fact, enemies sometime attack you out of spite, with no reason behind it, and you will have to replay level all over again coz' game only saves between levels. Also, why they would give you immense amount of money, when you can't even spent 1/4 of them, even if you buy everything on every mission. This all leads to a complete frustration - the game you might admired so much back then doesn't seem so good anymore. To enjoy this game you need to get a time machine, otherwise it's just not worth it. Returning players may get some nostalgia out of it, but it will remain good if you won't push yourself. Newcomers might aswell read the plot and move on to the next part, which is alot more better in every way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best of all Hitman series. There was a remake called ""Contracts"", but this is better.Itches a scratch no other game can. Especially after a long day at work.The interface is shunned by some people, but I find it better than in the rest of the series. You can aim precisely with your ""eyes"" standing still - this is what hitmen and bodyguards do under those sunglasses I presume. basically you can ""unhook"" your reticle from the character and move his aimpoint around. This is important because, like in real life, you aim with your mind first and then take out a weapon to shoot that target, this brings another level of immersion, especially knowing that your character is a cunning assassin who is meant to be as inconspicuous as possible until the last moment. There is also a more realistic representation of weapons in the game, for example you can pick up two different guns and use them akimbo-style, if you so wish, and have a beretta in one hand and a hardballer in the other.It is not easy to create a game with same game mechanics, but also suited for different playstyles. The mission diversity is just right. From creeping in the shadows of a hotel, to starting a Rambo-style war in the jungle. Some see this as a drawback, but I prefer variety in games, especially inventive stealth ones like this title, where you can pick from a myriad of approaches to eliminate your target.

												While it maybe a ""Classic"" in some eyes I don't have nostalgia for this one at all. If anything Im really starting to dislike it.So first things first. Nothing really works correctly. Its a stealth actiony game right? But stealth is bugged most the time. Try to sneak up behind a guy with fiber wire or a knife to silently kill him? He will turn around and shoot you in the face. The AI is like your mom in that they have eyes in the back of their heads. Thats a creepy thought....Also sometimes disguises will cease to work. Get into a shoot out and run off and put on a new outfit and some AI will still try and kill you on sight while others....just are okay with you. Its confusing and goes against later installments in the series. Some AI will instincively know it was you who killed some random guy so they will go out of their way to shoot you in the face. Its completely broken for me in the Lee Hong mission and thats where I stopped. So it feels more bugged in this way. Theres alot of other smaller things that just seem weird or broken like occasionally things get stuck floating that should have physics applied to. I suspect it would have been very easy to patch the AI in this so that the encounters like I mentioned don't happen in the ways they do but nope. This is just the old game.Lots and lots of trial and error. You need to go through missions by the book or you outright fail the mission. You might make it to the exfiltration point with all objectives finished only to find you attracted to much attention so you still fail anyway. Enjoy replaying that mission. You have the illusion of choice but in reality there is right and wrong ways to finish the missions. Atleast thats my experience up to the Lee Hong Assasination mission since I can't finish the same thing.Also, no save states? No saving at all inside a mission? Only a horrible respawn system that respawns you a set number of times upon death but the mission remains the same the moment you died? Its really the worst way I have ever seen for handling player death and checkpointing as its the easiest way design/programming wise but probably the most jarring and confusing gameplay wise.The games just not very good. I would suggest playing Blood Money if you just want to play a good Hitman game (don't touch Absolution as its absolutely garbage!) or any of the later games. I can look past the graphics and sound, but when the gameplay is meh....its just meh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried to play this game. I know it's an older title. But I hate it. It's impossible to get past the Lee Hong Assassination because guards can see through areas they shouldn't be able to and will one-shot you with gunshots to the head. Controls are blocky and make no sense, and objectives are not clearly explained and usually end in failure for reasons beyond your control.Don't play this older title unless you want to be frustrated for a while.

												So I have to give this game a little credit, since I started off one of my favorite game series of all time. But that's about all I like about it. This game has not aged well at all. The controlls are clunky and don't feel very natural. Graphics are very poor looking. Some of the textures in the early levels I played had a reflective and low-res look to them. I love old games like Deus Ex and Half Life but this game hasn't aged as well as those. I'd say you should only get this game if you have a nostalgic connection to it, or it is on a great sale and you want to finish your hitman collection. Otherwise, don't buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very cool game, but obviously really dated now. Some missions are really cool where you wear your classy suit and steal hotel room keys out of the doors as we walk down the hall and do some classy type stealth. But there's some missions that require you to go shooting like a madman and they're so difficult. There may be ways to do this game super stealthy, but I don't have the patience to figure them out.

												If you played a whole lot of Blood Money, Absolution, or anything else but this game, then you better get used to the controls. The controls don't really age well but it's still usable once you get the hang of it. The game is pretty challenging too, even though I played the tutorial and the first level. I couldn't get past the first level. And that's why I'm getting a refund of it. I didn't really enjoy it, but at the end, it's a good Hitman game. I really won't recommend buyying this game, but if you're curious, go ahead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately I didn't get to play a lot of this game. The only reason why I could not recommend it is the lack of save feature. The game only saves after you finish every mission, you make one little mistake and you have to start over. I don't mind games that are challenging, but not being able to save my progress is very frustrating and I will just move onto the second hitman.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game-serie was recommended to me already a looong time ago, but never had the time to step into this hitman series. Recently there was a sale of hitman games on steam, so I decided to buy the first 4 games. And of course, I started with the oldest: Codename 47 from the year 2000. I read some reviews after finishing the game, but 1 thing I should have read before playing the game:Open Hitman.ini in the game's installation folder.Add these lines:Resolution 1920x1080WindowStartUpperPos 0,0I played the game in 800x600, because otherwise it didn't work. With these lines (i checked it), you could play full screen and the game looks better as well. I also changed the keys, because the standard keys are not playable for me.  I think Codename 47 is a good entry point for the series so that you learn who Agent 47 is and how he came to be. I am used to play games in 2000 as well (heck, already since 1987), so I am used to bad A.I. like in this game. Although sometimes situations in the game really don't make any sense. Read the story very carefully before a mission, because that is the only help you get and there is many times some hints and clues how to fninsh a mission.  + good music+ good atmosphere+ sometimes multiple ways to finish a level+ still worth to play- opponents shoot very accurate, once detected you can start over the level- no savegames- some levels are very dificult to finish without checking for some hints and tips- your second life/respawn is in many cases worthless since you are already discovered- figure things out on ur own by dying and dying and dyingOnce you know how to beat a level, it will take you next time between 5-15 minutes. But before you know that, it can take you hours by finding it out by dying. There are some levels that you can finish the first time you play it, but most of them will take more tries, and some of them many, many more tries. Not a highly recommended game, but if you play newer versions of hitman and you like it, you should also have finished the first one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heyyo,The original Hitman game. You went around, assassinating or rendering people unconscious and sneaking through levels doing sneaky stuff like disguises... It was amazing back then, and it is still an amazing game. Hitman: Blood Money is still my favourite in the series... but this game? easily my 2nd place pick. :)Controls take a while to get used to... changing the default binds I used W as my walk forward and SHIFT as my sprint... Sprint key only makes you SPRINT FORWARD... there's no sprinting backwards or sideways... only forwards. You've been warned. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first Hitman game. If you are new to the Hitman series and you want to start playing all the games from the beggining, avoid this one. The controls are very clumsy, and the game is very hard. There are no checkpoints on the missions. If you make a tiny mistake, you have to repeat the whole mission.The story is very good and interesting though, so to understand the rest Hitman games better read the summary here: http://hitman.wikia.com/wiki/Hitman:_Codename_47#PlotThe game was good for the year it came out, but now it will get on your nerves because of the lack of mechanics and the clumsy controls.Story Rating: 9/10Gameplay Rating: 6/10TL;DR?

												The original story about the worlds best Hitman, is a difficult one, but worth it. Outdated graphics, controls and gameplay are all bearable, but the reward is hours of fun. And frustration at the Scarface reference. The game gives you many options to complete your objective, some of which are not as obvious or easy to execute as others, so you start experimenting while carefully weighing risk versus gain, since there is no save function. If you die, you restart the level.To the end, missions get more complex and way more difficult, so difficult, that at one point I had to abuse the AI and wait with a drawn gun behind a door, waiting for the enemies to parse through it one by one. Compared to newer games (Hitman: Absolution for example), this game is worse looking, has clunkier controls, but gameplay that is a thousand times better than Absolution.That said though, if you want the best Hitman experience, get Hitman: Blood Money. You can skip Hitman: Silent Assassin and you should most definitely skip Hitman: Absolution.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It’s not a hard game by itself (except the last mission) but what makes it frustrating, is the planning part of your mission. Clearly there is one intended solution and it can contain a rather easy to miss element. These sorts of obstacles are not fun to figure out and on a few cases, led me to follow a walkthrough instead. There were a couple of fun missions, but most of them are a grind. As far as combat is concerned, it is the most inconvenient system I think I’ve ever come across. Also the controls are f*cking mental. Combine those two things and it is virtually impossible to shoot your way through any mission, or out of a sticky situation for that matter (on hard difficulty). And to top it off, the stealth thing I found is very inconsistent. You could die wearing your suit, respawn, acquire like a triads robe or smth (undetected of course) and you will still be shot on sight by some enemies. Generally this happens when you’re following the unconventional path and the game I guess tries to cut you down for it. The ‘check-point’ system in this game is more of a nuisance than help. And it crashes constantly right before some cut-scenes. Extremely infuriating if you haven’t reached so far into the level before. The story, mission layouts and soundtrack are all good though. I realise some of these issues are really down to the fact that this is a 17 year old game, but If I had known those things beforehand, I wouldn’t have had to waste 16hrs to find out. I think if you want to start the hitman series, then you needn’t worry about playing the first game.PS. No need to be alarmed by the negative review. If you are interested, don’t be afraid to buy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sometimes art can be powerful enough it's life changing. Video games are art so thus they can be life changing. From this game I learned one of the most valuable lessons since Donald Trump told me never to apologize for anything.When people tell you not to give into hate or anger, they're just holding you back. Hate and anger are what bring change, they're there for a reason. Don't listen to those hippies, they're everything wrong with the world.So the next time you think of something wrong with the world that makes you mad let it grow inside of you like a disease until it bursts out and infects everything around you. Who knows, you might just save the white race.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The controls are atrocious, but more importantly, the game gives you absolutely no idea what it expects from you, so every mission is just dying over and over again in trial and error until you figure it out. That's just not fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Such a good game fair enough the graphics arent the best but its an old classic. Gameplay itself is very fun with quite smart A.I and it requires you to plan out every move and be tactical and steathly when it comes to making killings. I enjoyed this game from a young age and i love it now its a defient must buy escpially for a 1 pound (:			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good storyline, but the gameplay ruins it all for me. I know this game is very old and it's the first in the Hitman series but the lack of options killing your target(s) and big maps with barely any interactivity where you just run from point A to B makes this only worth buying if you're here for the story and have tolerance for spending hours to try completeting the missions in one run without messing up.

												**note**: this is not actually a not recommend, but an *I can't think I could like this*. also, there are minor spoilers about the tutorial. I know that 1 hour is not that much to actually decide if I like a game or not, especially since I had to repeat the training mission FOUR times.the first one, I managed to fall through *the last* of the elevators. so I had to quit and restart.the second one, I didn't know that the guy in blue getting me will mean restarting everything (the game didn't pointed it out)the third one, seeing that the guys in blue were baddies, I killed the second one. before he opened the door. then the game said that my mission could not be completed. so restart again.the fourth time I actually managed to finish the tutorial. then I get to my very first mission. first, I find an invisible wall. great, now I understand the map, or something. then, automagically, a blue guy (seriously, tutorial said that the RED guys were the baddies, but it wasn't right) spots me and fires. restart mission.I try to approach silently, and take the binoculars. then a blue guy decides to go on patrol, and stumbles upon me. I'm dead. restart.then, I go to the same place, hide until he passes by, and kill him silently. NOBODY saw me. and then, out of nowhere, guards suspect of a civilian and start chasing me. (heh, I think I *scared* -as in he saw me- a guy before, but WAY before.... it could have said it then, and not a long while later). they find me. I supposedly was holding the gun, or something, but suddenly, I aim at them with the binoculars. and I'm dead. add the clunky mechanics, and the either-dead-slow-or-too-fast movement, and.... I can't like this. I mean, the mechanics are not that big of a downside, since I could get used to them. but... please. at least give me a hint on how to proceed. I don't want to learn a difficult game just by trial an error. especially since I have too many games to play that don't require me to do so. (note: I'm not against trial-and-error games. but I don't want to have to *learn how to pla*y by trial and error. )man, I was trying it to see if I should buy the rest of the humble bundle, with all the modern ones, and all that.... but if they are as... irritating as this one, I better pass. after all I already have a ton of games.

												First, Public service announcement: DONT USE Direct3D as a renderer, use OpenGL or you'll have trouble. Also follow the display guide on the guides section.Well, this is the game that actually got me into games. I remember my father playing it. I was like OH GOD STEALTHY, DAD WATCH OUT, DAD WHY DONT YOU CHANGE TO THOSE CLOTHES, DAD LOOK THE IDIOT LEFT A MASTER KEY ON THE DOOR. Good times. Now that I'm older I can notice the terrible voice acting LOL. The worst actor is actually 47, and that makes me laugh a lot. But well. YES I recommend this game. It's old? yes. You'll have some display problems that are quickly solvable? yes. Worth it? YES. There's even a fix for you to expand the default drawing distance. This was a time when the game didn't actually have any guide or reference for this particular way of tackling the ""stealth"" genre so not all the levels are pure stealth. You'll kind of hate the jungle levels, one in amsterdam and the final one (kind of a Boss fight) since they force you to reveal yourself and shoot and kill heavily armed, non final target NPCs. It took me hours (even now that I'm an experienced player) to pass the final jungle mission. Buy a freaking Kevlar jacket :D I have to say though, It's rewarding to place a good headshot.Other than those things, there are memorable missions: Lee Hong's, Frantz Fuchs', Boris' that, despite being featured in Hitman Contracts, they are played differently here. One warning though. The game's hardcore and unforgiving. Depending on the difficulty setting, you're given a number of lives. Resurrecting doesn't make the guards forget about you LOL. In the hardest setting you are given one extra live only in the hardest missions. Be patient and play well. Plan your assasinations, choose well your targets and weapons. ""Wake up! Wake up my friend!"" :DConclusion: This game is a classic, it has its flaws but its enjoyable. I'd recommend buying it on a sale. It's worth it. If you have a config problem just leave me a comment. Maybe I'll be able to help.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Clunky controls, and weird camera angles. Most mission are pretty linear and straightfoward. Though the method can be pretty cryptic because the lack of info/intel throughout the missions. Might be hard without the use of guides.There also some missions that are incredibly boring like on the Colombian Jungle chapters, where you have to walk mindlessly and play like John Rambo instead of the Silent Assasin 47.Game doesnt age well, and not optimized for newer pc's. Bad draw distance and lightnings can make the game harder just because of graphical problems. Also some crashes still happens.Not a bad first entry to the series, but not so good either. Skip this one Unless you're a die-hard Hitman fan. Or you can just go ahead to play Hitman Contracts and wont miss out much in the story because of the ""revisiting"" levels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not really bad, but the lack of saves during levels turns it into a super annoying trial and error simulator. Let's say you plan your move carefully, you're almost finished with the level, and when executing it, you ♥♥♥♥ up and die.You'll have to restart the entire level.The game isn't even very good, and becomes somewhat of a chore after a few tries.At least it's not absolution.
