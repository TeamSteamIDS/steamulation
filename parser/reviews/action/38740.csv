""VERY POSITIVE""Now this might seem like a classical indie game or maybe tribute to 8-bit era or some cube game that it's not even worth playing but hold up hold up and give it a chance.I don't even remember where I got it, but I believe it wasn't even part of some bundle, but I did actually bought it back in 2013. It didn't cost 9,99 like right now. I believe after discount it was roughly 1,20€. So boom, I got it. And guess what, I was playing that every day I woke up before school. Yes, 4 years ago I was still at school. Now, every day I woke up at 6:02 and I was leaving at 6:46 (yes exactly, those timestamps because I don't like round numbers). I had like 5-10 minutes of free time so boom, I was playing EDGE. Rating might not be objective at all because as you can see I already put some personal connection with the game into the review so in order to keep it at least little bit objective we'll move on. As the description in the Store Page says, it has over 100 levels, there was free DLC which added 40 more levels, and game itself has 47 achievements which are pretty challenging. It's not like you'll go through all that to get them, you'll need to do more than that. Levels are not easy. First half kinda is, but second is rage. Not everytime, it really depends on your focusing. Is it really tribute to 8-bit era? I believe so. Music is on point and so are levels, difficulty and whole feeling out of the game. Game can last you in big range of 5 to 15 hours, depends on how you play and if you want everything. Typically, at the end of review I'll sum things up and/or address price and if it's worthg getting so those who don't have it can decide. Right now, I'm really confused. As you know I got it for roughly 1,20 which was really great buy. Full price at the moment is 9,99 and with discount it might be 4,99 or 2,49€. It really depends on where you like to spend your money. In case of this EDGE game, I can't give you any advice about it tho. But for those who already own it and didn't play, you should think again.Bonus Point: Cubes, cubes, cubes, cubesRating: 8/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												I have much to say about this game, I got it last sales for 0.99 and I’d say it’s worth buying for that price.But about the whole gameplay, I’d say there is much you can do to make it better.————CONTROLS————Before I start I want to talk about the controls because thats what most of the thumbs-down say aren’t good. Luckily in the settings there is a way you can change this. The default is more for left-handers, but you can change it for right-handers in the settings. It’s called North-west or North-east something like that. Once you have it set your way there should be no problem at all. If you’ve ever played Bloxorz you should have no problem. ————GRAPHICS————Ok now about the graphics, what made me want to buy this was defiantly because of the clean and colourful design. The movements and animations are smooth and the cube is beautiful. A comment said “ letting you’re cube flash won’t make your game better “ Maybe thats true but the flashing cube sure made me want to buy this.————GAMEPLAY———— You are a cube that has to reach the end platform for each level. You use AWSD or up down left right to control yourself around obstacles. Now the game is called EDGE for a reason, they had a great idea of you balancing on your edge to stick to the sides of platforms. If you do it right you can hang on for 10 sec and beyond. Normally 5 average for me, which is enough to get past all the levels.————RE-SPAWN / CHECKPOINTS———— Thank you, thank you for having this or I would have stopped playing after half and hour. This game is based on speed which means your ranking and score is based on the time you took to complete each level. I usually get the lowest score LOL, but I’m just glad I finish it. The thing is you can almost respawn after each mistake, each checkpoint is only like 2 meters apart so you can finish a level even if you suck.———— READ THIS———— Now here is where I want to talk about this game. YOU HAVE NO GOAL. NO SATISFACTION. Humans like to think they accomplished something, even if it is the stupidest thing. Maybe its about their reaction time, or how smart they are. If they beat a level they thought was a challenge, they would want to play more. It is a complicated balance - hard enough to be a goal but not too hard to make them quit.You see, you saved your game by giving all the checkpoints, that is sweet. But now to the game play!!! All those fancy platforms flying around and transforming is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It has no help to the player and nothing to do with the game. It’s just like showing off fancy graphics, so yeah , I have to wait 10 seconds for this platform to come over just so I can go on it and take me to the next platform. I’d rather just walk on a bridge to the next place. The thing is it doesn’t help and is annoying. Also something I wanted to say is that you have these random blocks fall out / push me /transform in random directions, and you somehow assume the player is going to know your crazy moves on their first attempt. What happens is I die 5 times. Yeah ok, I know the pattern now so its simple and thats it! So easy!! The player does no feel a challenge because it wasn’t, It was just frustrating. And at the end it was easy because I died so I know how to do it now. !!!NO!!! you must let the player think they can do it on their first attempt !! LET them think they can do better ! Not you NOT the developers. Make obstacles that actually have a pattern. Let the player know there is danger ahead. Let them see how they can avoid something as long as they think fast enough! THIS GAME COULD HAVE BEEN SO INTERESTING! It’s not that pleasant to right a long review, But I actually care about this game. Thats why I made sure I played all the basic levels before commenting on it. I just wanted you to know how much better this could be, and I love the edge time concept. You can add in a release button. Sometimes I’m stuck on the wall and I want to let go, but I can’t. Let there be a release button so the player can jump off when he/she wants.Anyway, yeah, this game is relaxing because of the respawn, usually just when you want to play a game but don’t have too much time, 1 or 2 of the levels should do the job.P.S music is awesome			",86,35,0,2,9,1,15

												This game is actually quite special. It feels like a platfomer but you mostly roll around on an isometric level (ie. Super Mario RPG) hitting switches and solving puzzles. The controls are really tight, allowing you you manuver this... block around.The charm really comes from the level design, the music - everything comes together into a really slick game.Originally developed for mobile devices, this one is updated with full resolution and frame-rate unlock support. It's really quite sharp.Highly recommended!			",224,59,4,9,10,3,39

EDGEA great little puzzle game that requires quick reactions and some lateral thinking. Rating 6/10The main objective of EDGE is to traverse your cube through some ingenious and rather convoluted levels made up of blocks, buttons and platforms whilst avoiding all manners of death as quickly as possible. Picking up small prisms that are dotted around the level speeds up your cube and gives you a higher rating for completing a level. There is also the ability to perform 'edge time' by balancing your cube on one of it's edges which allows you to hang off the side of walls. It's a mixture of balance and timing but it rewards you with time reduction at the end of the level.Each new level, of which there are over eighty, represents a new challenge and new gameplay mechanics, learning these new mechanics is fairly simple as there are clues along the way. Its success lies in its simplicity. Get your cube from point A to point B in the fastest time you can manage.It can be frustrating at times and there are a couple of fiendishly tricky sequences that can verge on annoying/frustrating but it's also incredibly addictive and rewarding.It's not a traditional puzzle game nor is it platform game, it's something in between and it's great fun.

												Developed by Two Tribes (PC, WII U) and Mobigame (iOS), EDGE is an astounding platform/puzzle game that feels like a platformer with puzzle elements in it. Each level is different with a mixture of really neat gimmicks that definitely add to the gameplay and make it REALLY enjoyable and nowhere near boring. Add to that this game has an AMAZING soundtrack that fits like a glove and is ear-wormy and you have a game that you could spend hours upon hours playing. However, that's not all. The game feels amazing when moving the cube around (it's tight enough that you have full control over the cube) and it even has CONTROLLER SUPPORT (as noted on the right on the game's main page on Steam).Recommended completely! If you don't buy it, it's your loss!			",137,27,6,5,8,0,6

												The tag ""platformer"" doesn't quite fit EDGE, but neither is it a full-on puzzle game. You're not often required to make pixel-perfect jumps and leaps, but you'll need to think and react quickly to make it through levels efficiently. Likewise, there's very little traditional puzzle elements in EDGE, aside from a few button-sequence puzzles, but you will need some smarts and lateral thinking to figure out how to get past some parts of the game.

EDGE ReviewCuration text - With deceivingly difficult puzzles and an excellent soundtrack, EDGE is a mind-bending puzzler for the ages. 9/10DIFFICULTYEDGE is a medium difficulty game. All the puzzles have one or two tricky parts, but you'll have more difficulty because of the camera angle than the actual level. You will need to use the top-down map to get through these parts, as sometimes your own block obscures obstacles or holes. One of the hardest parts of the game is hanging on to the edges of blocks, but more about that later.ISSUESThis game, as I mentioned before, suffers from a camera perspective issue. This affects the game mostly when you have to differentiate between blocks of different levels and heights. As of now, you can work with this mostly as a trial-and-error situation. However, it makes speed runs or flawless runs very difficult.PERFORMANCEI tested this game in both integrated graphics (Intel HD 4600) and dedicated graphics (GeForce GTX 860M 2GB). The performance of the game was phenomenal with both types. It ran well both in 1080p full screen and 900p windowed. Even on dedicated graphics, the game didn't generate too much heat. There were no unexpected crashes in my experience. Another game by the same developer, Rush, suffers from huge performance issues, an I'm pleased to see that the devs have really stepped up their game (no pun intended) with EDGE.SOUNDTRACKPersonally, I loved the 8-bit feel of the game's sound. It is not distracting from the game in any way, and is in general just really enjoyable to hear. One thing to point out is that this game can be played 100% without the sound, making a great quick-fix game when you don't have headphones available.GAMEPLAYIn EDGE, you are a block that can pivot on its edges onto other blocks. You can also hang onto moving blocks, shrink down in size and scale walls, and find shortcuts on many levels. The hanging-on-moving-blocks is fairly difficult; when you progress into the game, many of the movement times get longer and therefore harder to hold onto. To complete each level, you have to find your way to the end while collecting colorful cubes along the way. Some cubes are significantly harder to find than others, but it is not necessary to find all of them to pass a level. At the end of each level, you are assigned a grade based on your time, number of failed attempts, and cubes found. You'll find yourself constantly replaying levels just to get the highest grade you can.OVERVIEWEDGE is without a doubt one of the most fun and addicting platformers I have played. Although it is fairly short, it has great replay value and once you start, you'll want to keep playing.  Aspect Rating   Difficulty 7   Performance 10   Gameplay 10   Graphics 8   Issues 6   Overall 8 TL;DRI got this game on sale for under a buck. It was a phenomenal deal. This puzzler has plenty of levels and is challenging enough to keep you playing, failure after failure. Having played this dev's other games (Toki Tori and RUSH), I can say that this one is probably my favorite. Great deal on sale, but still worth the whole 8 bucks if you like puzzle games.Be sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

												Quick review:Short Verdict: First of all, it's more of a platformer than a puzzle game. Well, this game grows on you. At the beginning, I was kind of disappointed in Two Tribes. Then, I decided: ""ok, I'll just beat the levels"". After I did, I was ""What the hell, I'll get all the achievements!"" (and I did). One thing though: I started playing it on an old computer and the gameplay sucked. Unless you're running the game way above recommended settings (maybe just a video card with some decent dedicated memory will do), your experience probably won't be as good as it should be.Pros: Over 100 levels that are nice and feel unique It's challenging, fun, and you grow to like it more as you play it BGM is varied and all tunes are nice Nice minimalist graphics (it's a pro for me) You don't get thoughts like ""If only this game had this feature..."" or ""Too bad it's missing from the game"", which is a great sign. It feels like a 100% completed game Has some replay value if you aim for high scoresCons: There's not much of a difficulty curve. It isn't rare to play a easier level after a tough one (and that's the only con I can think of)Bought on / for: Steam Store for R$ 2.79 (US$ 1.22) - totally worth it!			",2593,1146,60,256,279,22,324

												This ""platformer"" is secretly a marble madness-like puzzle adventure game! The music is Astounding~! I listen to it all the time!You can really just explore the levels and what they have to offer, or you can batten down the hatches and try to solve all the little mysteries of the game. There are some strange difficulty spikes for those that love to be OCD about collecting and solving. Its probably still one of the best games Two Tribes has to offer! Lots of replay value simply because of the music.Its a great casual desktop game at work too, and still really accessible for kids.			",96,18,3,6,9,2,12

												There's a particular style of game that seems to rub everyone the right way, and I'm not sure if it has a name or not. It's that ultra-minimalist look found in REZ, Lumines, and Chime, lots of right angles and primary colors, attended by a light-electronica soundtrack and synthesized voice. Everyone loves it for some reason, maybe because it feels like a friendly sort of futuristic. EDGE is another puzzle entry in this unnamed genre, but it does a lot more than just ape a popular aesthetic.EDGE is so named because you control a perfect cube, pulsating with color, that rolls around on its edges. This isn't the imprecise flailing of Gravilon or square golf balls in Golf With Your Friends, this is precision movement across a grid of blocks suspended in some vast void. Holding the arrow key in a direction makes the cube tilt that way, and holding it long enough will make it tip into the next grid space. Your cube can tilt up elevations equal to its height this way as well, allowing you to scale stairs. Feathering the button lets you balance on your edge and rack up Edge Time, a bonus scoring mechanic that can also save you if a platform drops out from under you.This tight control scheme is the cornerstone of EDGE, because the sprawling levels will assemble all manner of paths, tunnels, platforms, and obstacles to navigate. Some might have you following a one-block-wide path, some might have you flipping to and from speeding platforms, some might have you tumbling across falling blocks, and so on. There are even some complex scripted level features like robots and trains formed out of the moving landscape. Each level has a theme to match, and it is always presented in some recognizable way using the basic two-tone blocks that comprise everything.You'll come across a number of colorful prisms in each level as well, which factor heavily into your scoring. Time is another factor, as is how many deaths you racked up. You can die, in a sense, by plunging off the side of a level. Sometimes this will be because of a flip in the wrong direction, other times it will be because an obstacle shoved you into the void. Regardless of what gets you it will happen often, but you lose very little thanks to the copious checkpointing in each level.It's a simple premise, but the execution elevates it to something special. EDGE is polished to a mirror shine, with sharp graphics, a pumping soundtrack, and lovingly-crafted levels. There's around a hundred of those levels to get through, and the challenge is steep enough that it'll take you quite a few hours even without locating all the prisms. And mastering the movement of your cube is extremely gratifying when you finally start pulling off complex flips across harrowing hazards. After just a few levels you'll see why EDGE deserves to be counted among those classic games I mentioned above, and its look and feel are the least of many reasons.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												--------------Pro's:--------------* The game is unique, with its own idea of the puzzle genre, using a cube to roll around and navigate a constantly changing, atmospheric world.* The music is great, and is one of the main elements to the game that will cause you to have random nostalgiac dance sessions.* As the price is considerably low at 7.99 US Dollars, I would reccomend to wait for a sale, as I have seen two 90% off sales within `30 days.* Can be played as casually, or as rage enducing as you would like, with the level completion system being an A-D grading system, alongside counting the amount of fails and checkpoints you have.*A fun ""Pick up and play"" game, not having to have any knowledge or skill prior to using this game. (However, I would reccomend that you already know how to use your keyboard, eyes, and reactions.)* Quick download, low amount of space required, and little to no set up. This encourages people to jump right into the game, without having to mess with tons of configuration files to get a smoot, nice gameplay experience--------------Con's:--------------* The settings tab doesn't have very many choices in terms of render quality. (But the game isn't graphically intensive, so this is ruled out.)* The controls are solid, but it is hard to enterperate what it will do sometimes. This is only very few amount of times, so don't let it deter you from getting this masterpiece of a puzzle game.--------------In Conclusion:--------------This game is alot of fun for anyone, with interesting gameplay elements that get you engaged, without giving you a lot of stress like most puzzle games give you nowadays, as at some moments, it will get you on the EDGE... See what I did there? Anyway, I would give this Indie title a 9 out of 10, and I strongly reccomend you BUY THIS GAME AND GO PLAY IT!			",72,7,2,2,6,0,4

												For the price it is sold and the time you CAN spent with the game (and I have spent a lot of time) it is one of the best purchases i probably made for a game. The thing I like the most about ""Edge"" is that you can choose your ""level of difficulty"" in each stage for your own. If you decide to only go for the exit it will be pretty easy. There are a lot of checkpoints and they are mostly placed fair and reasonable. If you are playing this way ""Edge"" ist a normal platformer and getting to the end is not a question of knowing where to go but of your ability to move the cube the way you want. The next step would be collecting all the prisms scattered through the levels which is still easy although you have to think for some of them. The next thing to do is trying to get better times either way for the S+-rank (you need to collect all prisms for that) or competing for the leader-boards (just getting to the end the fastest way possible). At this point I would consider ""Edge"" as a puzzle-platformer since you need to find out what the best route is, where you should go first, looking for shortcuts and paying attention to timing for moving platforms etc. You also have to consider where you can and have to use the Edge-Time which is basically your cube clinging to a wall with just one edge. All the time spent as Edge-time will later on not be counted to your total time and therefore influence your results largely. So getting the best time possible is not only a question of sheer ability but also cleverness and like I said before is the part of the game I, personally, would consider as a puzzle.Although the graphic is minimalistic most levels give a different feeling and are unique and interesting with many interesting themes. Beside the games main 48 levels there is a free DLC with another 44 brilliant levels and additional 17 levels can be obtained by joining the Edge group at least if you are playing on Steam. To round this experience up the game comes with a catchy soundtrack which mostly will not annoy you.			",91,44,0,11,1,0,7

Live on the edge, and be sure to hang on tight!EDGE is a puzzle game at its core, but it also has a great set-up for speedrunners. You play as a cube with one main goal: get to the end of each level. In some stages, this is simple. In others, prepare for an onslaught of obstacles that will push you to your limits. Both casual players and hardcore ones will find appeal in EDGE. Don't believe me? Take a look below to see everything it does right.Pros:EDGE has a grand total of 109 levels, all of them having unique traits and different ways of swiftly completing them. If you like the gameplay, you are not about to get bored.Speaking of the gameplay, it's awesome. The few controls the game needs work flawlessly on the keyboard, which is what I used to play it. It is one of those delightful games that is quick to learn and difficult to master. Edge Time in particular can be very difficult to become good at. It may sound easy to tap a key and stay on the edge of a stage piece, but be warned, it is a lot harder than you might think.The tutorials are well-constructed. In levels with new mechanics or potentially obscure paths, there are glowing squares to move your cube on. A ghost cube will appear to show you what to do. Thus, you can either watch the tutorials as many times as you want, or ignore them completely.For a game like EDGE, the graphics do not need any sort of intensity. They are simplistic and they work perfectly. The colors are easy on the eyes and the levels look great.I really enjoy the music. There are lots of catchy tracks, and the electronic theme throughout the soundtrack is fitting. They are a good pace for the gameplay, too.Each level can get anywhere from a D-Rank to an S-Rank. Want to play the game leisurely? Ignore the scores and do as you will. Want to be an expert at it? Keep coming back and memorizing those levels. There is a fantastic amount of replaying potential, even after an S-Rank, because your best times will be saved!The menus are crisp, clean, and easy to navigate. There are not too many options that you have to juggle between.It runs smoothly. Not much space is needed for EDGE, and most computers will have no trouble with it.There are achievements that range in difficulty. A lot of them can be gotten without too much trouble. Completing all of the levels with S-Ranks, though... I raise my nonexistent hat to anyone who can pull that one off.The price is reasonable. I've put a lot of hours into EDGE, and for a base price of $7.99, you will get a lot of bang for your buck. Want to be cheap? You can wait for sale, where the Two Tribes bundle of four games (one being EDGE) is about $0.99. That's how I got EDGE, and I feel kind of dirty for that after experiencing how much fun it is.Every time you enter the game, it says ""hi"" to you. How nice of it! Not many games take the time to greet you.Neutral:While there is partial controller support, I really see no reason to use a controller. The keyboard works perfectly. It is there if players want it, and having more options is good, if nothing else.Some of the achievements are difficult to figure out without any help. Some people might like the challenge. Others will be hitting the guides ASAP. I liked most of them, but when they get obscure, they get obscure.The plot is nonexistent beyond, ""You are a cube. You have to get to the end of the level. Go."" It also has no need for a plot, so there you go. Hand-in-hand with this is a lack of characters or characterization, unless you count how smug the Dark Cube seems to be at times. Evil little jerk.There are no trading cards. It is kind of funny to wonder what they would be if they existed. ""Cube."" ""Small Cube."" ""Dark Cube."" ""Ghost Cube."" ...Okay, I guess it could kind of work, but the game really doesn't need them.Cons:Trying to get Edge Time can leave your fingers rather sore. It requires precise tapping, and sometimes you need to do that for a long period of time. I understand why it works the way it does, but I wish a method existed that didn't leave your fingers scowling at your life choices.A few of the levels are pretty darn hard. Even with frequent checkpoints, they can be rage-inducing.The levels with the Dark Cube force you to speedrun them. Most of the levels are lax about whether you want to speedrun or not, and I prefer that option instead of being made to rush ahead.Overall experience:I had no idea what to expect when I first started playing EDGE. It was a surprise to me when I got hooked so quickly. I was really glad I had gotten it, especially since it was a bundle with the other Two Tribes games. I plan to try playing those sometime soon as well. As a side note, check out their upcoming game, RIVE. It will be their last game before they retire, so let's show them our support for their final masterpiece!Rating:8.5/10. EDGE was made with a clear goal in mind, and it succeeds. I had a blast playing it, and I plan to continue revisiting it in hopes of S-Ranking all of the levels. Someday, I might manage it. Someday...Looking for more great indie games?

												What's great about EDGE is that the solutions are not exclusive; they're multiple in possibility. Our goal is to decide the best way to execute the solution, and then put it into motion. It's a puzzle of action, more than traditional puzzles which only exercise intellect.A good amount of skill is certainly required to master the cube, as its shape and weight make its movement distinct to the game.There's a ranking system per level, and some not-so-hidden areas (see the map on the upper left) so that gives you lots of replay value as you strive to earn the highest ranking. Any game that encourages you to keep practicing is doing something right.You'll be ripping your hair out as early as Level 10 ('Metro' will mess you up). It's a grand opportunity to practice patience, persistence and perseverance.Definite recommendation for puzzle lovers and enthusiasts. Bonus for music lovers: the soundtrack is gorgeous. It gives each level personality, as the platforms move appropriately as if to the beat.			",12,11,0,3,2,0,4

It's one of the best games in my opinoin in this catogry. I just got hooked. Gameplay was intresting, tho probably there is alot of games with the same mechanic this one got me good. The art style is also amazing, simple but stunning. The music is also great, it gives you a real 80s vibe. In all honesty i think you should buy it.			",172,19,10,4,16,3,3

The arrow keys and turning takes a little bit of time to get used to but becomes natural after a few levels. Not an overly hard game, but definately some challenging points.			",52,3,0,2,5,0,6

												A great and puzzling game, with challenges that will stump you at first, but you will eventually conquer. Right now, I have barely finished the game, and there's alot to play after the main levels. The visuals are nothing to write home about; it's less detailed than Minecraft! Yet it's so fun, and such a great experience, Even though the game is great and all, there's very few, (and I mean VERY few) negatives found. The detail... none exists. And depth perception is an issue. But, other than that, the game is simply superb! 9.5/10			",174,20,7,13,12,0,7

												EDGE is a fantastic example of what you can do with a simple concept and crank the creativity up to 11. You'll need a mix of quick reactions,lateral thinking and completionist pride to power through  the 110+ levels,but it doesn't outsay,it's welcome and most of those are fairly short. I completely recommend this game,best puzzle game i've ever played.			",257,62,9,15,26,0,17

												Sort of finished this game. Some levels are locked until you collect all of the collectibles in all of the other levels and I just gave up trying to find them all. Otherwise it’s a pretty solid puzzle platformer, the controls are a bit awkward and finicky, but it’s fairly easy to get used to. I did notice some weird bugs and glitches that caused me to have to reload some of the levels, but nothing game-breaking.			",1264,476,34,165,92,14,156

It offers levels of cube puzzles that are funny to solve and it's a perfect game for one of those ""I'm bored and I dont know what to play""-moments. You can just start up the game and relax playing it, because it isnt that hard either. I say you should go for buying it, because why not, the game is worth the money and doesn't dissapoint you.

												A beautifully  meticulous game that does not fail at angering you, however, you cannot really get mad. Instead of waving your fists in the air when your cube falls, gets crushed or is pushed off a ledge you smile a great smile. A curse or a gift. Split-second decisions will force you into fast-paced, ""anti-gravitational"" situations which will oddly grab you and pull you in!I bought this game while it was on sale, however, I would totally have paid the seven dollars.

												For fans of Marble Madness for the NES, this is essentially their re-master (aside from the difficulty and well, you're a square instead of a sphere). This game puts you in the middle of a ""maze"" to reach your goal with a good score to possibly get your A+ ranking. You follow through set paths with many bombs, turns, and twists to take you on a possibly very non-linear experience, which is good. You collect items and get to your goal alive, it's as simple as that.You're getting a lot for what you're paying for. A unique puzzler with bright colors and enjoyably simple patterns. The largest conflict is controlling the cube. Astonishingly similar controls of Marble Madness make it just as frustrating as before, and no doubt requires practise, but one you've got it down the controls, you've still got a decent puzzler.Only other negative is checkpoints. Personally I'd prefer the challenge of starting over each time, but that's just me, and there might be an option for that somewhere which I haven't checked for yet.7.0/10			",174,23,6,7,12,1,6

												It's a very interesting game where you have to manipulate a cube around to collect points. The addition of movable platforms and platforms with special effects help to keep up the interest level. Unfortunately the keyboard controls don't work well with the game. For example, pressing the right arrow key once doesn't make the cube move one square immediately; it makes the cube start to tilt. Holding down the key makes the cube tilt and move to the next square. This makes levels which require precise timing and control a lot harder than necessary. Other than that, it's still a very interesting game, so if you can get past the difficult controls, you'll enjoy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Puzzle-Platformer. Simple graphics, nostlagic. Great soundtrack. Theese are the things you'd liek to hear in a game like this. EDGE is a fun puzzle platformer, where levels get harder as you progress. From discovering prisms help move you faster to new secret ways to obtain them hidden on levels, or alternate ways to finish levels faster. You don't want just to finish the game and the levels, but master them. At first, it's easy and given you interrogation marks as tutorials/guides. The more you progress, the harder it gets, from real puzzles to timing problems. You ahve to learn how to grab by the edge and hang, move over blocks in timing and, the soundtrack each level has, express them as you progress.It's another indie gem by Mobigames. You can fight for the leaderboards too but, no one might care for that. You got achievements, some being quite challenging.Don't just learn he levels, master them. How to get all prisms in a level and obtain the majestic S+ rating on levels and become the EDGE master. You'll enjoy this. It's fun. It's challenging. You will want to beat your time over and over so you can play better.It's an 8/10. Sometimes, it can be very frustrating.			",60,1,27,1,4,0,4

												If you're a casual puzzle solver and not tempted by achievements, you're in for a light treat. Solving the levels can be tricky, but checkpoinits and infinite retries make it inevitable if that's all you need. Get the game on deep sale because it won't take you very long.Difficulty and gameplay time ramp up fast if you want a decent score like ""B"" or ""A"" on every level. You'll need some patience to redo levels over and over until you get them right. Any sale price is worth it.And if you want all the achievements, be prepared to retry levels dozens of times as you shave a few seconds off them here and there. Cheating's not really an option... you need dexterity and skills to achieve the best times. The game is worth the full price if this is your idea of fun.I'm in the last group. Dying over and over is frustrating, but getting that ""S+"" is hugely rewarding. Clawing my way up the global leaderboards, a fraction of a second at a time, is even more satisfying. That's why I'm S+ on 34 levels so far, and why I've enjoyed most of the 57.5 hours it took getting there.			",16,4,0,0,1,0,2

												EDGE is an enjoyable puzzler that does its best to get the most out of a clever and simple idea. Even at the cheap price, though, it still feels like a mobile game that would be a better fit on the device in your pocket than the comparatively huge monitor of your PC. However, it is a great port for PC and the music included is incredible as well. Definitely worth it at full price, even though I got it gifted to me.It's minimalistic, ambient and fun. You should buy it on sale beacause the price drops by 90% and it sells for under a dollar. -3 points for no Steam Workshop.Originally posted by Undead_Skeleton: It's a ♥♥♥♥ing fun, fool. 97/100			",48,3,2,0,7,0,2

												Edge resembles a Puzzle Dimension type of game where you maneuver a cube from start to finish on a variety of different levels collecting prisms along the way. Some of the movement effects are pretty trippy and the isometric view creates some optical illusions which makes you think platforms exist when they really don't. The mini-map turned out to be a necessary feature to retain my sanity in many cases. Puzzle game lovers will get some enjoyment out of it, although this wouldn't qualify as my favorite pick in this genre. Overall, a very likable game.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Ee very awesome game, like the retro, haha.Here's my option:Pros: Great music, such 8-bit & then chiptune..., amazing graphics & quality, all colorful opacity, obviously great gameplay & the controls aren't hard for me, they're pretty okay actually.Cons: Well... some levels are too tricky. For me that is.Thanks to whoever invented this super awesome game that god will return our luck!			",44,2,1,1,3,0,2

												This is a linear platformer where the levels constantly ""troll"" you. I hate using that word, but that's literally what it does.  Controlling the cube is tedious at first but I can get over that. The mechanics are original and work well. However, most of the levels don't use those mechanics in a clever way. The game isn't hard or challenging, it's just annoying. It's the level design that's atrocious. Obstacles aren't layed out for you to clear, they just appear out of nowhere and push you out of the stage, or they make you wait for platforms to stop messing around before you can take them. Plus, gray cubes in space, really? Making your cube constantly flashing doesn't make the levels more visually appealing.Quite a few of my Steam friends own this game yet none of them played past the first few levels. Less than 20% of the players have cleared 24 levels. That should tell a lot about the game.I haven't played the extra levels so maybe they're more fun to play, but the main levels are really, really annoying.			",148,17,2,5,6,2,10

												Full of isometric win, brings back memories of so many ZXSpectrum games !Controls are completly responsive and correct for an isometric game, can't imagine how anyone can complain about this.Would be perfect with workshop support.EDIT: Half way through the game, feeling guilty for buying it on sale, I feel it deserves more.Each level has pleasantly surprised me with a new behaviour of the moving blocks, contrary to what some people are saying, there are very few random things, and even with those, you don't have an excuse for failing a second time.The most fun I've had since Portal2 (not that they are anything alike).

												Your a block, and you gotta get to the end of the level, while collecting floating colored cubes as you go. That's it. But, is it? You must have good timing if you want to succeed. A mechanic of the game is being able to balance on blocks as they move. This is nice because it breakes up an otherwise repetitative (think I spelled that wrong) game and adds some fun trying your balance your block as long as possible. There are easily 50 levels, which can take 5-10 minutes each. It would be cool if there was a level editor, but there isn't. If it's on sale then buy it.			",195,33,6,16,20,2,15

												EDGE is a fantastic example of what you can do with a simple concept and crank the creativity up to 11. You'll need a mix of quick reactions, lateral thinking, and completionist pride to power through the 100+ levels, but it doesn't outstay its welcome and most of those are fairly short.The fine-tuned retro style and 8-bit soundtrack makes every level a joy to play through, as well as go back through to collect all those juicy prisms. Mmm, sweet S+ ranks.			",147,24,0,9,6,1,7

												You control a cube through a series of standing and moving platforms. You can use your keyboard or controller to do that. Generally it's a great platformer (not really a puzzler though) which has cubes in it and features a chipmusic-inspired soundtrack. Pure awesomeness.If you just want to get through the levels and have some fun, you can do that. But if you want to max the game out by getting every prisms and achievements, you find a good challenge here.Pro:- Cubes- Great music- Entertaining both for casual and hardcore gamers- Gives a challenge when you want to max it outCons:- No volume slider in settings- There was a single level which was pretty frustrating. One bad level is quite fair among these bunch of almost-perfect challenges, but it left some negative feeling in me.			",371,72,16,35,19,5,44

												I love this game, when I buy a game I play it for a little bit (5-10 min) and then leave it to play later. But this game made me play it for alot longer, I couldn't stop playing for some reason and i loved it. The music is beautiful and where it needs to be upbeat and energetic it does that very well and where it needs to be low tone again, does this very well. I love how the Cube is designed to be colourful and rainbow where as the background is dark and black & white. Every moon has it's dark side however i think this game has a light shaded dark side, once starting the controlers are a bit of a challenge to get used to (For WASD format) however apart from this this game is beautiful and I would recomend it to anyone!

												Mostly videos at store page describes how this game works. I just love how the game trolls players. Sometimes it's like ""step on this button, I'll guide you""... and it does. Sometimes when you step on some button it makes you fall down and you have to repeat whole sequence and even get your own way. I've bought it at discount for 0,4€ which was worth. Music is awesome too. It doesn't take much space which is a great advantage of this indie game. The worst thing? It doesn't have workshop. It would be much better and then even those 8€ would be a fair deal.			",81,22,1,7,6,1,6

												I played the 3DS version before finding out this was on Steam. I remember playing various Q*Bert games when I was younger, so the isometric view and controls was nostalgic for me. But combine that with the blocky theme and retro aethetic, as well as some really cool music, and I was hooked on what I'd call the funnest puzzle platformer I've played since Portal. Two Tribes does not disappoint here. Edge is incredibly fun and addictive, and I found myself laughing and praising the game when I was tricked by some of the levels, rather than getting frustrated and raging. If I had one gripe, it'd be that I was kinda sad to see the Steam version doesn't have a level editor and Workshop support.

												EDGE is a simple game, yet difficult, 3D, singlpleyer platformer that is really fun. It reminds me of a mobile game that I used to play, but I can't rememeber what's it's called..In EDGE, your only goal is to get to the end of each level. well, at least, that's all I can get out of this game. There are a bunch of obsticles, such as moving platforms, buttons, and even a thing that lets you turn into a miniture version of yourself. the game is simple, but the controls are a bit weird, and even tripy. I find myself playing with the controller more, to satisfy myself. Now, when I say weird, I don't mean that they're bad controls. It's the game's diagonal view-point that makes them weird, and why I use control when playing this game.Overall, this is a decent game.  It's difficult, i will say that, but it is fun.

												This is one of those simple, straight forward puzzle games that doesn't try to do anything particularly amazing and instead focuses on delivering simply, good gameplay. The level design and pacing of the mechanics/timing go hand in hand and make for a fantastic, albeit very shallow learning curve where you're constantly trying to push on to the next level. EDGE generally doesn't have anything to rant nor rave about, but it's a good, solid, fun game, and that's often enough.HighlightsWhat makes this better than average is its combination of sharp graphics and art-style, serene and ambient music and incredibly good level design. They serve to keep each level fun and keep frustration to a minimum and keep you engaged and wanting to get further.* Originally designed as mobile game, the Steam version came with the removal of the FPS lock and full resolution, which shows a level of respect for the players and platform* Simple, timeless design and graphics and a minimalist overlay and title screen mean this game wont feel out-dated for a long timeMistakesTwo Tribes, who went far on the success of Toki Tori, are a small Dutch company who have worked on a ridiculously large range of platformers, and with a ton of big developers, and the polish and testing that you see in their games is the result of this. Everything works well and you'll be hard pushed to find mistakes, problems and things that take away from gameplay in their titles.There are a few levels where you might be frustrated too much to continue, or suffer more than you want, but they're few and far between and actually add a higher level of challenge.RecommendationsAt £5.49/7.99€/$7.99 and with at least 4 hours of main gameplay across 100+ levels, and plenty more for completionists, EDGE has plenty of content, but may feel overpriced, especially when you consider the fairly simple mechanics. I'd recommend waiting for a -50% drop or more before picking it up. EDGE is also available in the Two Tribes Classics Pack and Two Tribes Pack (which also includes Toki Tori 2+ for around double the price). Since Toki Tori 2+ is fairly poor, and both EDGE and Toki Tori are above average games, if you like the look of either of those two you will benefit from picking up the Classics Pack instead, especially when on sale.* There're 4 hidden levels and an Edge Tool which you can use to edit game files and install new levels and add a bunch of new content.

												First off, I really enjoyed this game on the iPhone a few years ago, so I thought I'd give the Steam version a try when it was on sale for 70 cents. Knowing the mobile version, I can say that EDGE just doesn't feel like it's meant to be played on a computer. This is mainly due to the fact that the handling is horrible. Even with a gamepad, it's extremely hard to get the hang of the controls.So, as much as I loved the iPhone version, I can't advise you to buy this game. If you want to try it for its cool graphics and mechanics, 70 cents surely won't hurt anyone. Just don't pay the full price, which in my eyes isn't justified.			",37,13,0,3,2,0,2

												You roll a cube over obstacles. Hold the key long enough to force it up stairs, but not too long otherwise you fall off on the other side. It is very frustrating to time this inert cube. I didn't enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The concThe concept of the EDGE is okay but it quickly turns into a “guess right or die” game. It has rules that aren’t consistent and due to the isometric view, the way to control yourself felt very strange. It is visually pleasing but after 5 minutes into it I felt bored. I found the overall game lacking, missing a certain charm or element. Perhaps I felt that way because I have seen and played better that are of the same vein? Whichever the case, would rather play other puzzle games then.			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												I am not into puzzle themed games too much. This one, however, quickly grew on me. Edge is more than just a puzzle game, it's a puzzle platformer that progressively gets harder, but remains fun and relaxing.At first glance, I was thinking ""Oh great, I'm a cube""... 5 minutes later, I just couldn't put it down (had to force myself). I never thought being a cube could actually feel interesting and challenging in a isometric platformer. - The level design teaches you something new every level. - If you mess up, its physics / game mechanics feel too solid to blame the game.- Most relaxing game I have played. It makes you think, but it doesn't overcomplicate / confuse.- Graphics/Audio are amazing and consistent.- While the game's highscore focuses on a completionist/time scale, its game design makes it a solid experience for those who just want to pick up and play a puzzle platformer casually.- Highly recommend for any (new/veteren) puzzle/casual/platformer player.

TL;DRIt's a love it or hate it kind of game. For me, it's the latter. While I appreciated the soundtrack and the detail put into the game, it just didn't reverberate with me.Get a ControllerOne of the big turn-offs for me was the controls, while I understand the need for ""stickiness"" to get the Edge combo and finish certain puzzles, basic movement was often challenging. I'd miss simple corners because I thought I'd moved one block over when the ""stickiness"" brings me right back down to my original position. Perhaps this game is better with a controller and joystick, I do not have that luxury however, so I can't say so for myself.BreakdownPros Great soundtrack Level design is solid, the puzzels were clearly well thought out and the scaffolding is on-pointCons Weird key layouts Movement is kinda janky. If directional movement had no ""stickiness"" or resistance and hitting an additional key, like Shift, triggered the ability to do Edge, that would feel more fluidScore: 5/10 (if you like the game, it's a solid 10/10, if you don't, it's easily a 0/10, so I'm giving the average here with recognition that I am of the ""not"" party)DisclaimerMy time spent in game is actually around 3 hours, much more than what is reported. Most of that time was on a friend's account as my computer had a weird driver issue running this game.			",77,14,1,4,4,0,10

												EDGE is a wonderful game that takes simplicity and makes it ten times more awesome. The music is great, along with everything else. There really isn't a 'difficulty', so you don't have to worry about levels being too hard. It takes a long time to finish, but when you finish you'll want to replay all the levels again and wish there were more. But wait, there is more! EDGE extended is a great addon to this game, since it adds a bunch of more levels with even more of what this game started off as. I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to play a fun and casual game that doesn't take just a few hours to finish.(At the time I am writing this, EDGE is on sale for $1.59!)

												EDGE is a great little platform/puzzle game where you roll a cube around an isometric world formed out of blocks. Your task is to find and pick up a number of little 'prisms' scattered around the level, before making your way to the exit. This would be easy, if each level were not so precisely and fiendishly designed to hinder you in your mission.EDGE originated on the iPhone where it had an innovative finger-slide control system. Luckily, it has not suffered from the conversion to desktop formats, and I found it easy to play with a joypad or keyboard.The level design is the reason I am writing this review - it is masterful, with only a few mis-steps. The way the game establishes a language of cubes, switches and sliding blocks and then makes humour out of them needs to be experienced by any student of game design.This is one of the few retro styled games that actually captures the spirit of 8-bit gaming as well as the appearance. It has the same kind of feeling as Nebulus or Marble Madness, and seems like the kind of game Ultimate: Play the Game would release if you sent a modern PC back in time to 1984.I must mention the incredible soundtrack, which while completely modern, constantly recalls the sounds of 8-bit gaming, both Western and Japanese. Highly recommended.			",59,23,1,6,7,0,7

It's Just A Bunch Of ♥♥♥♥ing Squares - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Games can take on many different forms. Some are super complex, and feature a robust art style. Some go for a simpler approach, and may use realism as its drawing factor. Neither is superior to the other, it's all a matter of taste. The options are limitless for what form a game may take. Even, say... squares. Lots of squares.The ♥♥♥♥ is going on in this game? That's a very good question. You see, there's squares. Cubes, rather. Because they're three-dimensional.This is Edge. Original title, yes. They came up with it all by themselves.Edge is a game about squares that must roll around other squares in order to collect squares and make it to the square at the end of all of the other squares.It's easy to see where its simplistic roots come from. Edge originally launched on iOS, with ports later coming to many more platforms including the Wii U, 3DS, PC, and Android. A mobile game, of course. That explains everything.Edging is a simple concept. Masturbate until you're right on the verge of climax, and then stop. Right at the edge. Wait for your body to settle down, and then do it again. Pushing slowly closer and closer to the edge, building up the tension in you as the sweet release of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lies just out of reach. Sometimes it's a little kinkier, with a dom policing your edging. If you♥♥♥♥♥too soon, they beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.This game is kinda like that.It's not really a puzzle game. Calling this a puzzle game is like calling a traffic light a puzzle game. Green means go, red means stop. I mean, I suppose that's kind of a puzzle. Especially if you're colorblind. Or completely blind, that usually makes things like crossing the street or driving kind of difficult. Especially if it's an ambulance, with a lady giving birth inside. She's all grunting and pushing and trying to get the baby out, and her husband is all ""What the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing, who are you, stop please, you're gonna kill us all"" and getting on your case for stealing an ambulance that just so happened to be parked outside someone's house. It might not even be an ambulance, it might just be a family's SUV. In labor, having a panic attack because you forced yourself into their car, same thing.It's not really any kind of game. There's what could be called obstacles or puzzles all around each course, but they're always simplistic and easily maneuverable in a way that's only vaguely stimulating.Edge is pretty good for a mobile game at least. It's relaxing to roll squares around while you're pooping. And the art style is extremely satisfying. Some very striking minimalism. It's very nice just to look at.Don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening in this game, but there's some damn fine lookin' squares. Mmm, mmm.If you're looking for a game to really push you, challenge you, and get you riled up, Edge is not it. There's no climax to Edge, much like actual edging. There's just squares. Lots, and lots of ♥♥♥♥ing squares.It's a perfect example of the great things designers are capable of on mobile. And, at the same time, the many drawbacks of mobile. It's designed with simplicity, accessibility, and ease of getting into in mind. It's easy to pick up a level, play it, and stop. It's not something that could realistically hold your attention for longer than an hour, but poops don't usually take that long anyway. Considering it's only a couple bucks, it's definitely worth it.Short, sweet, and simple. But clever, smart, and stylish. By far some of the nicest squares I've ever seen. But still, this game is literally just ♥♥♥♥ing squares. That's all it is. All there is to it.Like they always say. Every square has its edges. They usually say that about roses, actually. But a game about roses would be even stupider than a game about stupid ♥♥♥♥ing squares.			",156,15,0,29,5,0,7

												Fairly average game. Controls can be a bit slippery - it's too easy to accidentally roll your cube too far and a lot of levels require fairly precise movements.  Some people might enjoy that aspect of the challenge.On an isometric layout the controls are a tad confusing (e.g. left keyboard arrow moves the cube north-west, you can work out the rest).  You'd almost think a gamepad would work better because the directions on a joystick would make more sense, but there is less precision so in the end the gamepad works even worse, unless you use the d-pad.Good retro soundtrack.Demo shows you pretty much exactly what the game is like so try that first before buying.

												Ever heard of 'Marble Madness'? Imagine there's a cube instead of a ball, wall climbing mechanics, catchy music, Steam achievements, minimalistic pseudo-retro graphics and a bit unwieldy controls; so they're not exactly alike, but the main idea of ""lead a thing to the end of the level""  is still present. Very fun game, definitely give it a try.			",225,64,3,27,20,1,41

												The controls are frustrating because it's tilted at a 45 degre angle and you have to guess what buttons do what if you're not used to it. Also after getting really far in this one level it just glitched me out and I had to quit, would have been able to go back to a check point if there was a restart button but alas there wasn't. Also most of the game is guess and check which is really bad for puzzle games.			",170,37,2,8,13,1,17

												This game is what happens when the Tofu Survivor mode from Resident Evil 2 and Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions have an unprotected one-night stand. But seriously, this is a great pastime game. You are a cube who takes on levels that are much like the VR missions in MGS: VR, only instead of sneaking around to get to the goal you have to go through many series of obstacles intricately put together by the level designers. The faster you go and the more optional stuff you collect along the way, the better you're ranked (I think). The levels are designed in a progressively difficult pace, training the player to increasingly ""get good"". And creative obstacle placement, along with the eventual introduction of new types of obstacles and new elements of gameplay, ensures that EDGE remains fresh throughout.			",86,6,10,14,5,0,10

For five hours without playing any other game, I was hooked. This game is very in depth too with over 90 levels and bonus levels. EDGE can also be a SpeedRun game for anyone who likes to get WR times but there is no global leaderboard unfortunately. Okay, let's actually explain the game. You are a super physicy cube that rolls around collecting other cubes. Sounds lame right? That's what I thought. The levels get really creative with moving platforms, coding puzzles, and even turning tiny to fit through small holes or to climb up a wall. The difficulty curve is perfect and as you learn different ways to play, you see them in the future levels and are like, ""oh I remember how to do this!"" The game teaches you almost everything within the first 15 or so levels. The controls are also spot on. They are very simple: the arrow keys. The more you hold down a key, the more the block rolls over (hence the physics part of the game). I rate this game 9/10.			",120,8,3,1,5,0,4

												In a world made entirely of cubes (undoubtedly the inspiration for Minecraft, I'm sure), your job as a fellow cube is to make it to the end of each of 109 different levels. Each level features three different additional goals: a survival element, a collect-a-thon element, and a time trial element. The amount of nuance put into the last aspect is what makes the game perfect for speedrunners. Not only do the collectibles, in addition to being necessary for an S+ rank, increase your speed for a short amount of time, but any extra time you'd normally incur can be negated with the use of EDGE time - that is, your cube will stick to walls and edges, and any time spent hanging there does not factor in to your final level time. This adds an additional layer of strategy and timing which is sure to have you replaying the same levels again and again.The controls are a bit clumsy at first, but you'll become acclimated soon enough (and you can change the direction of ""up"" in options). The graphics are not the best, but they at least accomplish what they're supposed to, and there's no ambiguity with what's traversable and what's not. The soundtrack is stellar, and makes it difficult to get very mad at the game. Overall, a rousing success, and as it's only eighty cents in the current sale - well, it's really a no-brainer.

												Эпическая битва псевдофизики с бинарной логикой. В целом идея довольно интересная, но как это всегда бывает при реализации игр с имитацией физики - всё работает не пойми как. Кроме того у куба случайным образом меняется масса и предсказать его движение бывает сложно.Внешне игра выглядит стильно и приятно, звуковое сопровождение вполне стандартно, музыкальное подобрано хорошо. Планировка уровней разнится: иногда попадаются абсолютно неинтересные уровни с запредельной трудностью прохождения, а иногда очень интересные, но слишком лёгкие. ",1149,447,60,172,143,12,270

												This is a puzzle game that doesn't use harldy any puzzles. Requireing timing skill isnt the same thing as a puzzle. You are often forced into a set path with literally nothing else you can possibly do other than what is set in front of you requiring absolutely no thought. And dont worry if there ever is something that might be tricky they will show you a ""hint"" of exactly what to do, every single time, so you cant possibly need to think. At best it is boring, at worst it is tedious, (requiring you to hit the same couple of switches which are right in front of you over and over again) and/or frustrating. (as you will need to perform some actions at JUST the right time)Edge has done themself no favors by making their controls unintuative. The levels are at a 45 to the POV so ""up"" takes you up-right, and ""left"" takes you up-left. Seems simple anougha nd other games use the same concept without much trouble, and maybe im just being stupid on this one, but this game seems to continue to confuse on that till nearly the end where I gave up on it. To make worse for themselves the controls are inconsistant. Sometimes a single tap of a key will flip your cube fully to its other face. Other times you will merely bring up the one end to begin tettering on an edge. (EDGE EDGE get it, get the joke? no dont worry they shove it in your face quite a few times. lol they're soooo funny right guys?) The controls seem all other the place, which doesnt help the frustration of the timing ""puzzles"".Lastly and worst(ly) the ""logic"" of your cubes movemnet is inconsistant. In a game that uses platforming timeing as a puzzle, the one thing you NEED is to know what action your avatar will take at a given command. You wont find that here. On the exact same part of the same level, I put my theory to the test.           I tried typing out how it doesnt work, youd have to just see it. Suffice to say it, it was not fun.

												Edge is a mind blowing game. This game is where you are a cube and you have to flip to get to the finish. This is a really good mind game to be played. This game is very addictive for a person like me. Of Course this game is not as better as Skyrim or TF2 but this is a good game and is totally worth the money. Below are listed Cons and Pros of Edge with a detailed description.Pros1.Colors: Edge is a very colorful game to be played. The cube(you) always changes colors even when its resized to a smaller size. Whole game is wonderfully made with great textures and colors.2. Brainy: You have to figure out a way to get to the colorfull boxes surrounding the finish. On the way to the finish, you will discover great mind power you will need. This game has about 45-46 levels(i think). All from easy to hard.ConsNothing:)Is this game worth your money?Of course it is! Its a great game to be played as i explained. After this review, you might be inspired to buy this game. Please give a Rate up if you liked this review. Thank you ",35,1,1,1,5,0,1

												Interesting 3D perspective game. Can change the direction ""UP"" for the cube, NE or NW (will also change the others arrow keys in their respective places).The map on the top left will help you on finding the rainbow cubes and if there's a hidden platform.Do need some patience for this game though, and do highly recommend taking breaks after five levels or so.The extended is a bit more challenging... the last one in the extended is a race, litterally.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												As much as I love all the other games from Two Tribes, I just can't get into EDGE. So far, the levels are not challenging in their design, yet they remain tedious to finish because of the strange physics. It takes too much time to start moving, and once you start, it moves quite fast. Everytime you want to change direction, your velocity starts from zero (or at least seems to). It just makes everything so frustrating. It wouldn't be that hard to beat the first few levels if the controls were tighter. Even if this problem was solved, I don't know if I would enjoy the game that much (I'd say it seems empty), but it's hard to evaluate. I played it some years ago on mobile, and from what I remember, it suited this medium better.			",102,55,0,10,19,1,13

												It's an ok game. Not reccommended because it's just not a captivating game. You are a cube and you roll around board after board trying to get to the end. You collect prisms along the way, although there doesn't appear to be any use in doing this unless you want the achievement. The levels get harder and harder, but getting to the end isn't really that hard. You are basically just trying to finish as quick as you can. Some of the maps are long and interesting, but alot of them are a pain. Too many levels where your cube dissappears and you have to move around and then your cube falls through the floor and you start over. Decent idea for a game, not executed as well as it could have been.A no for me.			",128,78,0,14,16,0,24

												For the price it is sold and the time you CAN spent with the game (and I have spent a lot of time) it is one of the best purchases i probably made for a game. The thing I like the most about ""Edge"" is that you can choose your ""level of difficulty"" in each stage for your own. If you decide to only go for the exit it will be pretty easy. There are a lot of checkpoints and they are mostly placed fair and reasonable. If you are playing this way ""Edge"" ist a normal platformer and getting to the end is not a question of knowing where to go but of your ability to move the cube the way you want. The next step would be collecting all the prisms scattered through the levels which is still easy although you have to think for some of them. The next thing to do is trying to get better times either way for the S+-rank (you need to collect all prisms for that) or competing for the leader-boards (just getting to the end the fastest way possible). At this point I would consider ""Edge"" as a puzzle-platformer since you need to find out what the best route is, where you should go first, looking for shortcuts and paying attention to timing for moving platforms etc. You also have to consider where you can and have to use the Edge-Time which is basically your cube clinging to a wall with just one edge. All the time spent as Edge-time will later on not be counted to your total time and therefore influence your results largely. So getting the best time possible is not only a question of sheer ability but also cleverness and like I said before is the part of the game I, personally, would consider as a puzzle.Although the graphic is minimalistic most levels give a different feeling and are unique and interesting with many interesting themes. Beside the games main 48 levels there is a free DLC with another 44 brilliant levels and additional 17 levels can be obtained by joining the Edge group at least if you are playing on Steam. To round this experience up the game comes with a catchy soundtrack which mostly will not annoy you.			",439,119,34,59,74,2,118

												This is a game you'd play if you're really bored, or just like puzzle games. My daughter likes these sort of games, and steam has a few more similar to it, like roogoo and rush, and she's pretty much the only one that likes those games. I wouldn't buy any of those games unless they are really cheap, and you're bored, because once you've played them you'll probably never play them again. If you never play it, you won't miss anything. There are better versions of these type of games elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cheap and very simple game. I don't really think it deserves the name ""puzzle"" as it is so easy that it's always clear what you have to do. Not mechanically challenging either. It even tells you where to go at times. It runs fine on Linux, which is a huge plus for me. Still can't recommend, though, because the gameplay is just that unrewarding ...Pro:- runs on Linux (++)- cheap (+)Con:- too easy (---)- not really many different things you can do / lack of content (--)Subjective final score:2/10Could have been much better if they included actual riddles.

												This is almost a decent game. I kind of like the ""edge"" mechanic of literally hanging off the edges of things with your cube you're rolling around the maps, but it's a port and it feels like it. If it were more polished (and it weren't so much more difficult and just plain weird with a controller, which it seems like it should be more suited to than the keyboard), I'd probably kill some more time with it, but...it's not.

												EDGE is psuedo puzzle game with heavy platformer elements. You play as a rotatable cube in an isometric space, which makes the controls at times frusturating and at others fascinating. While the game itself may be short, it offers replayability in beating previous times. One thing I can not praise enough is the sound track. It is truly amazing, offerring a wide variety in terms of mood and tone for the game itself. In the end EDGE's greatest strength and weakness is its controls. Some will love it while others will be quickly frustrated by it. ",15,0,0,0,7,0,9

												It's a kind of a puzle 3D platformer.It introduces levels that use all or a number of the mechanics like,for example,using the edge time to get past a gap with the help of a moving block.The graphics are simple but the music is awesome! And in comparison with the mobile version,it has a LOT of levels and some bonus ones if you become a member of the EDGE community group! Pretty challenging,gives me a smile (and some laughs,in a number of levels) and I love the music.			",99,8,3,7,9,0,11

												The first thing to note is that EDGE is an isometric puzzle game, so it may not be for you if you're looking for something to blast at. You play as a cube whose goal is to collect colourful bits and to get to the goal.Now, this game will throw some unexpected twists at you as you progress through the game, so be prepared to think on your feet. There's a nifty checkpointing system in place, so you don't end up ever getting a game over, so the flow of the game isn't ever truly broken.It's a good game to pick up and play, then to come back to in a few days and resume what you were doing without forgetting the mechanics of it. With good graphics, sounds and visuals, EDGE is a great title to play, even on an older rig.			",115,26,4,8,14,2,19

												Pretty good puzzlerEdge is an indie puzzle platformer where the gimmick is that you are a cube. You need to flip yourself to the end of the level which has obstacles in the way. The controls are a bit confusing at first because the board is isometric but the movement is controlled by the arrow keys. But you get used to it after a while. The game is pretty good as the puzzles are interesting. Not a bad game. Get it on sale.			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												Edge if an Iphone port originaly created by mobi-games,and what made Tim Lagdel Infamous.In it,you control a strobing cube that rolls around as you control it.Your objective is to reach the end of levels,while rolling,climbing and balancing on edges(hence the title).Graphically,the game reminds me of those earlier puzzle PSX games,only less pixelated and more Shaded and Anti-aliased.Graphical options might seem missing ,but there are a few extra options hidden in an .ini file.(V-Sync is still oddly missing).The game contains 100 levels out of the box,,more than 30 steam achievements and my personal favorite steamworks feature:steam cloud.If you still have doubts,do try the demo.(A thank you to Two Tribes for my free copy)			",869,262,44,129,82,10,133

												EDGE is a fun little isometric platformer that somewhat reminds me of the old Playstation gem, Kula World (Google it!). The difficulty is fair and justified. Levels have no time limit, you have infinite lives, there are little hint nodes that introduce you to the more obscure mechanics and there are mini checkpoints before the more tricky sections. My only real criticism is that small precise movements can sometimes be a pain because of the way your block tends to teeter on it's side.			",212,60,1,19,10,0,5

												An agreeable little action-puzzler. It never really gets that sophisticated or combinatorial with its mechanics, preferring instead to just hide things (in the normal levels at least) and test precise execution of some moves, but gathering all the prisms can take a degree of exploration.Just don't forget to turn off the ""special effect"" that gives you a headache by pretending your crisp new TFT is a defocused old CRT.

												This game is incredibly frustrating and not all that rewarding, in my opinion. it has a nice style to it, a good soundtrack, but it's also quite challlenging, bordering on the outright frustrating, thanks to its relentless level design.It's obvious that this was the goal here, but it's main source of challenge seems to be the isometric perspective and the control scheme. I highly sugggest a gamepad if you want to enjoy the game instead of rage after it.EDGE is Pain. EDGE cuts you. But, if you like your games to push back, if you like to best yourself and beat time trials, you may very well enjoy this game a lot more than I did.			",405,118,8,68,38,2,67

												EDGE is a pretty simple game in its core. You're a cube and you cube around levels to get to the end point. It's fun and innovative, but gets a bit frustrating at times (at least for me it did.) In the end, I mildly recommend it. At the very least it's a decent time-waster.			",90,22,0,13,6,1,8

												This is a challenging, if relativley short game. The Main levels can be completed in about two hours, with bonus and extended stages adding on the amount, but you can find yourself going back to stages to try to get the S-rank. I purchased this game when it was 95% off, and I personally think that, while this game is worth more than that, I'd still wait for a minor price drop, or, at least, try the demo for yourself and see what you think.

YouTube™ Video: Edge PC Steam Review 

			Views: 269		

			Edge is a rewarding, unique, and gorgeous action-puzzle game revolving around the constrained maneuverability of a three-dimensional cube.		

Edge is an action-puzzle game revolving around the constrained maneuverability of a three-dimensional cube. The goal is simply to traverse minimalist, isometric levels by tumbling end over end in any of four directions. The cube has a distinct weight to it that makes movement a meticulous balancing act. This is made even more precarious when delicately clinging to moving platforms. I was first introduced to Edge on the Android platform, and I liked it until I played the PC version. Now I love it. Rolling the cube with a joystick feels so much more natural than touch controls and accommodates the high level precision that the game requires. Even with the improved controls, there were moments that required such exact timing that I was sure it was impossible. Yet I continued to come back for more. While some of the early stages are too easy, Edge is overall a well balanced game. Frequent check points help alleviate some of the more stressful segments. This is a rewarding, unique, and gorgeous game that I highly recommend. The Steam release also includes Edge Extended, so there is plenty of content to keep you busy.			",346,143,5,25,34,4,60

												An abstract cubic obstacle course with an electronic score and wildly clever puzzles, EDGE is nothing if not unique. There's no story (although you can make one up as you get further into certain levels), and no goal other than getting from point A to point B. You can move and Edge hang along walls, and that's about it. This simplicity is stretched to an unfathomable length by creative puzzles and obstacles to navigate, forcing you to think in multiple dimensions. It's complex enough to provide a challenge, but minimal enough so that virtually any player can get into it. Most levels have their own charm to them, and got more than a laugh or two out of me. The electronic music is vast, varied, and catchy. The controls aren't too precise, however; you rarely ever feel like you have control of the cube unless you find that ""sweet spot"" with the arrow keys, Plus, the isometric perspective doesn't help. Despite this, the game rarely gets frustrating, and death is more a learning experience than a punishment. Despite the touchy controls and a stale art style, EDGE is an addictive and clever obstacle course that is more than worth your cash,			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

												A real gem of a platformer, this one. Over 100 levels, with great level design and really impressive variety. The time-based ranking system and the hard-to-get collectibles and achievements give it true replayability. The core skills needed are timing and 3D thinking, and they're pushed to the limit. The difficulty curve is almost perfect, bordering on the forgiving side. The soundtrack is fun and varied, if a bit simplistic. Don't let the simple graphics fool you, as the simplicity is this game's true strength.If you're the person who didn't stop 'til you got all 120 stars in Mario 64, you NEED this game.

												Edge is a puzzle platformer in which you navigate your cube through isometric levels that grow in size and difficulty...:[ I purchased this game on sale therefore my opinion on value for money is void ]:I feel that Edge is comparable to Super Meat Boy and at the same time not. The Difficulty in Super Meat Boy comes from the growing complexity of levels and the eventual precision to survive some of the more demanding levels. I do however feel I have got more frustrated with Edge though.The main reason for this is the type of obstacles. Unlike Super Meat Boy where the danger is visible and conspicuous, In Edge it is not. I have died many times to unexpected movements and blocks causing me to fall or get crushed. It became more a game of trial and error and preparing for the movements after previous failures which was not exactly what I was looking for when I picked this title up.I do however love the graphical style and OST. It is polished, runs well and the amount of gameplay you can get out of the game on a casual level is great. The additional mechanics that are introduced as you get to the more complex levels really make this game standout.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cuby poppy electronic fun. The levels can be quite challenging as they require sequencing and a lot of timing, as well as exploring ""properly"" because you may not be able to get back after collecting the gems (collectables).The audio is fantastic. Some of it is reminiscent of early chiptunes (before dub-step style stuff) and there's an echo of Earthbound or some other SNES games.			",274,60,7,22,21,3,69

												Honestly, I never really understood the point of EDGE. You play as this cube and you have to navigate through an actually impressively big catalog of levels. That's basically it. You get bonus points for doing it faster and for hanging onto edges. The music/sound is actually not bad, but this game is not very fun to me. You may also notice that as of the time that I'm posting this review, I have very little time played on this game. This is because there is a glitch that has turned the screen completely white for me recently, making it unplayable. Until the glitch is fixed, my reccomendation for this game is that you should not buy it, but that's just my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mostly videos at store page describes how this game works. I just love how the game trolls players. Sometimes it's like ""step on this button, I'll guide you""... and it does. Sometimes when you step on some button it makes you fall down and you have to repeat whole sequence and even get your own way. I've bought it at discount for 0,4€ which was worth. Music is awesome too. It doesn't take much space which is a great advantage of this indie game. The worst thing? It doesn't have workshop. It would be much better and then even those 8€ would be a fair deal.			",162,38,2,12,11,3,16

												I really enjoyed this game at first, and then I got to the later levels. The game is super easy, but the controls are HORRIBLE. The cube attaches on whatever it wants, and it moves freely in a way, it doesn't just go from one square to another, you could press the button to go forward and it will barely tip forward, and then if you hold it go to the next one, you go right off the edge!I will say the game has a great art style, idea, and soundtrack. I loved those aspects of it and most likely will continue to play it for those reasons, and I understand that being a cube would be slow and tedious, but if you're going to make a game no matter what shape or size the character is, at least let it control well.I would recommend it for the first few levels, but after that it becomes unfairly difficult because of the controls. I tried it with a keyboard and controller, but both were slow and pretty bad.I personally got it really cheap with 2 other Two Tribes game, but it might be worth the full price to some people.

												Edge is a very interesting psuedo 3D platformer that is incredibly fun, uniquely stylized, and above all else... Addicting. I sat down just to try and kill a few minutes, ended up completing 22 levels in a one hour sitting. The soundtrack is very reminiscent of older 8-bit platformers with a modern twist and is extremely well done. Sincerely, I would buy the soundtrack if it were available. The level design is pretty solid overall, somewhat repetitive at times, but some levels are phenomenal! (I'm looking at you Level 18...) And the edge mechanic is really well done and shows very well in the later levels.Short and sweet:- Very pretty simplistic graphics- Banging soundtrack- Level design is pretty sweet- Lots of content with the main edge challenge levels, extended levels, and bonus levelsAs someone who usually isn't a fan of platformers, I highly reccomend giving this a try if you catch it on sale. At the full price, its a bit much since it does get a bit repetitive mechanically. But I picked it up for a couple bucks during a sale, and it was well worth it.Now if only this game had workshop support.............			",130,8,0,16,11,0,3

												I got this game on sale for $0.99 and it was definitely worth it. I like to play a few levels at a time for a short bit. I feel relaxed while playing and I find the flashing colours amusing. Here is a formal rating: 8/10 graphics - the style is clean and colorful, but sometimes the intro to the platform is so complex that it feels like the designers are showing off (however, it /is/ pretty)8/10 game play - so far the puzzles require trial and error instead of any quick thinking. It is still enjoyable to replay for a perfect (all cubes collected, good time, edge time, ""A"") score9/10 soundtrack - the soundtrack adds to the mood of the different puzzles. Lovely.

												This game is amazing. Have you ever played that game from website where you become a rectangiar block and you have to fall into a specific hole in order to advance? Well this game is pretty much upgraded from that. Only, much more complicated. It may look really simple in the first levels you play, but you can get the WTF reaction on the later levels. The game is similar that I just stated. Move your block into the rainbow spot. What suprised to me the most is that you can edge grab. But if you get smaller, you literally go up walls. I am trying not to put it out of context when I say that. So yeah, has the, ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of thing. But I do warn you, always predict what is going to happen next, or you are going to have a hard time.Overall: 9/10: Really worth the sale price of about $0.45Or for a ProJared rating: A Dance Party/10Here's a link to the game I'm talking about: http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-bloxorz ",16,3,0,2,6,2,1

												An abstract cubic obstacle course with an electronic score and wildly clever puzzles, EDGE is nothing if not unique. There's no story (although you can make one up as you get further into certain levels), and no goal other than getting from point A to point B. You can move and Edge hang along walls, and that's about it. This simplicity is stretched to an unfathomable length by creative puzzles and obstacles to navigate, forcing you to think in multiple dimensions. It's complex enough to provide a challenge, but minimal enough so that virtually any player can get into it. Most levels have their own charm to them, and got more than a laugh or two out of me. The electronic music is vast, varied, and catchy. The controls aren't too precise, however; you rarely ever feel like you have control of the cube unless you find that ""sweet spot"" with the arrow keys, Plus, the isometric perspective doesn't help. Despite this, the game rarely gets frustrating, and death is more a learning experience than a punishment. Despite the touchy controls and a stale art style, EDGE is an addictive and clever obstacle course that is more than worth your cash,			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

YouTube™ Video: Edge PC Steam Review 

			Views: 269		

			Edge is a rewarding, unique, and gorgeous action-puzzle game revolving around the constrained maneuverability of a three-dimensional cube.		

Edge is an action-puzzle game revolving around the constrained maneuverability of a three-dimensional cube. The goal is simply to traverse minimalist, isometric levels by tumbling end over end in any of four directions. The cube has a distinct weight to it that makes movement a meticulous balancing act. This is made even more precarious when delicately clinging to moving platforms. I was first introduced to Edge on the Android platform, and I liked it until I played the PC version. Now I love it. Rolling the cube with a joystick feels so much more natural than touch controls and accommodates the high level precision that the game requires. Even with the improved controls, there were moments that required such exact timing that I was sure it was impossible. Yet I continued to come back for more. While some of the early stages are too easy, Edge is overall a well balanced game. Frequent check points help alleviate some of the more stressful segments. This is a rewarding, unique, and gorgeous game that I highly recommend. The Steam release also includes Edge Extended, so there is plenty of content to keep you busy.			",346,143,5,25,34,4,60

Levels use different soundtracks and the maps really love to mess with you after lvl20 or so! Some levels even use optical illusions, similar to Monument Valley.			",15,8,0,2,3,0,1

												I mostly played EDGE on my phone (humble bundles rule!) but I figured I could give it at least 5 minutes of steam play to write this review.Edge is not a platformer.  Edge is its own genre, too smart for a platformer and too quick and reactive for a puzzler.  I really respect this game because of the intelligence and detail that goes into every level.With all that being said, I preferred the experience on a phone.  The short, bite-sized level format works very well on mobile.  I'm giving the game a ""recommend"" because it is good, but you should consider getting it for your phone instead of your PC.

												One of my all time favorite games.  Puzzles aren't too punishing in the begining and the difficulty level rises just right. Reminds me of ZX Spectrum games, Chips Challenge and even Sonic 3D(but S3D is the worst example). Music tends to be real good but there are a few songs that have a bit nervous soundtrack.

												The simplicity of this game means you have to be really precise. The difficulty gradually increases along with your mastery of maneuvering the cube. Getting through most levels therefore doesn't require anything extraordinary, but getting good scores om them usually does.Game works fine with X360 controller, but my experience is that the controller isn't precise enough when trying to get top rating on maps (or just completing a very hard one).PS: Great game if your shoulder is out of joint or your hand is in a cast and you can ony use one arm, as you only need WASD, ESC and SPACEBAR to play and navigate menus.

												I really enjoyed this game at first, and then I got to the later levels. The game is super easy, but the controls are HORRIBLE. The cube attaches on whatever it wants, and it moves freely in a way, it doesn't just go from one square to another, you could press the button to go forward and it will barely tip forward, and then if you hold it go to the next one, you go right off the edge!I will say the game has a great art style, idea, and soundtrack. I loved those aspects of it and most likely will continue to play it for those reasons, and I understand that being a cube would be slow and tedious, but if you're going to make a game no matter what shape or size the character is, at least let it control well.I would recommend it for the first few levels, but after that it becomes unfairly difficult because of the controls. I tried it with a keyboard and controller, but both were slow and pretty bad.I personally got it really cheap with 2 other Two Tribes game, but it might be worth the full price to some people.

												Edge is interesting. It only shows me having little play time because I did most of it on the Wii U. But anyway, it's a very literal take on platforming, in that you have to roll your cube onto different platforms to slide it across abysses (abbisi?). Anyway, you make your cube go through many different paths, and I enjoyed it a lot. Some levels like the freeway one were a bit harder because you would have to think quickly on the spot of what you want to do, but overall it's worth your money.			",54,6,0,5,7,0,9

												A casual romp through precision platforming.  Though this is definitely a casual game, it does include a significant amount of challenge.  The toughest part is mastering the manipulation of the cube, the player avatar, which can both require a very large amount of practice and cause a great deal of frustration.There needs to be name for this kind of casual game.  The kind that centers around the mastery of a new skill, and focus on practice and gaining finesse to fully enjoy, similar to games like Tetris.  No context; little gratification; only challenge.  The only name I can think of is ""Frustrators"" because I don't care much for them, but I can certainly see an audience for this kind of thing!			",272,94,3,15,13,2,14

												There's alot to admire with Two Tribes' Edge; much like their last 8-Bit Retro Platform Puzzler, Rush, Edge is an even package of decent gameplay, minimalist visuals, complex level design and catchy soundtrack. Its a clever little title that you can pick up and play in small bursts. HOWEVER there is a caveat to that.You see, I don't seem to get far into many of Two Tribes' games because I often find them far too hard, and being puzzle based platformers, far far too repetitive. I stopped playing both  Rush and Toki Tori because I was replaying the difficult sections over and over. It also doesn't help Edge that its controls (WASD or up,left,down,right) don't translate well when your perspective of the level is at a 45 degree angle.There is fun to be had in Edge, and I think I will revisit this game again when I'm not in the mood for bigger games. But I don't love this game, i found it too easy to mess up and too punishing. And too me, redoing parts on a level is simply grating.			",118,44,4,5,5,2,9

												There's a good old-school feel here that I totally love. Just a few drawbacks. If you're using a keyboard, the controls are a bit awkward as the board is at an angle but you're using arrow keys or WASD to control the cube,I DO NOT RECOMMEND if you get motion sickness from games. I had to stop when I did because I couldn't look at the screen anymore. The nausea came quickly and hit hard.If you don't get motion sickness and you're playing using a controller then I definitely recommend this if you're into retro puzzle platformers.

												Edge is a great game, with a lovely soundtrack. The controls might be a bit hard at first if you are a moron such as I am. Later on they will be natural. It is never to hard to do it, but it is hard to do it with a high rank, so there still a challenge, even though everyone could complete the levels. If you are running on a mac with OSX El Capitan, just press command f a few times, otherwise the screen will stay blank. All in all, a really nice game, certainly worth it.			",36,4,0,3,5,0,5

												A cool platformer with light puzzle elements. And you just guide a cube through levels, with a hanging mechanic. But the levels are well designed for the most part. There's over 100 levels, and a lot of achievements. The music is also cool. But controlling the cube is kind of hard at first, especially changing directions suddenly. And the game is both easy and hard. If you're just trying to finish the game, the game is easy, with plenty of checkpoints and no death penalties. But to get max rank and compete in the learderboards, you'll need a lot of patience. So it's a game for everyone. And a cool one.			",267,164,6,31,13,4,38

												All of this polygonal action is aesthetically pleasing, thanks to the simple lines and colorful contrast of the visuals. The rainbow colors of prisms and moving platforms stand out nicely against the gray levels, and the ever-shifting hues of your cube are an enjoyable sight. The electronic soundtrack adds a dynamic element to the relatively static levels as it moves from peppy and adventurous to moody and atmospheric, perking things up and staving off sameness. There is a certain repetitiveness to Edge born of its simplicity, but to its credit the game manages to entertain for the few hours it takes to complete all the levels. The novel fun of moving around as a box holds up despite some control awkwardness, and there is a good amount of content here for the asking price. Edge may not herald the coming of a new platforming hero, but it may give you a new appreciation for the powers of a humble cube.			",25,1,1,0,2,0,1

												EDGE is psuedo puzzle game with heavy platformer elements. You play as a rotatable cube in an isometric space, which makes the controls at times frusturating and at others fascinating. While the game itself may be short, it offers replayability in beating previous times. One thing I can not praise enough is the sound track. It is truly amazing, offerring a wide variety in terms of mood and tone for the game itself. In the end EDGE's greatest strength and weakness is its controls. Some will love it while others will be quickly frustrated by it. ",15,0,0,0,7,0,9

Edge is an action-puzzle game revolving around the constrained maneuverability of a three-dimensional cube. The goal is simply to traverse minimalist, isometric levels by tumbling end over end in any of four directions. The cube has a distinct weight to it that makes movement a meticulous balancing act. This is made even more precarious when delicately clinging to moving platforms. I was first introduced to Edge on the Android platform, and I liked it until I played the PC version. Now I love it. Rolling the cube with a joystick feels so much more natural than touch controls and accommodates the high level precision that the game requires. Even with the improved controls, there were moments that required such exact timing that I was sure it was impossible. Yet I continued to come back for more. While some of the early stages are too easy, Edge is overall a well balanced game. Frequent check points help alleviate some of the more stressful segments. This is a rewarding, unique, and gorgeous game that I highly recommend. The Steam release also includes Edge Extended, so there is plenty of content to keep you busy.			",346,143,5,25,34,4,60

												EDGE is a nice puzzle platform-ish game.  The level layout is reminiscent of a classic 3-D platformer, and you will need a similar amount of patience to complete a few of the levels.  Still there is no jumping involved, so I cannot consider it a true platformer.  The puzzle part of the game comes from how you move about the terrain, and how long you can stay on the edge, hence the name.  Great Music, the song Kakkoi from the game is now one of my favorite 8-bit songs.			",2427,890,80,224,291,26,357

												Kind of strange, but in a good way.  The visuals are bland white, gray, and black punctuated by garish rainbow colors.  The music is electronic with some nods to old video game sounds thrown in; I wouldn't necessarily agree with the description ""8 bit inspired,"" however.  The game is described as a platformer, but you can't jump as in most traditional platformers-- you roll your cube, which falls onto platforms or clings to the side of them.  Simple enough, but the level design really makes it enjoyable, and I know I'll be going back to improve my score on a few levels once I complete the game.			",56,5,0,2,3,0,6

												78/100Why EDGE is a good game? It's simple to start and hard to compete every challenge. You can just pass through all levels. You will get nice experience anyway. You can also pick all collectibles. It's harder and makes game more interesting.  You will find some funny tricks.And finally you can speedrun. As faster as you can. Leaderboard included. In my opinion this is most competitive part of the game. While speedrun you can show your skill and patience (retrying level again and again).Levels. They are good. Some are just amazing. And if you would play EDGE try bonus levels. They are brilliant. Every level is new idea. Ideas combine and make play more and more exciting.Soundtrack. Nice dynamic 8bit tracks that fit to game a lot.So what we have? Creative levels, competitive and collectible factors and good music. Enough for good game? For arcade indie game? I think yes.

												It's more or less really just a dumb iPhone game, with lazy yet attactive visuals and a simple mechanic elaborated upon to some satisfactory extent over the course of way too many much too short levels.The one-room stages really cheapen the experience, there's no sense that you're going anywhere that matters. The music is not very good at reminding you that you're playing a video game.This game is really too easy, there is no punishment for death and surviving yeilds no sense of accomplishment. It's like most indie games, it will let you commit cube suicide 56 times in a row without making you repeat any content. The gameplay is fun but the experience is mediocre.Out of the near-limitless selection of bargain bin iPhone conversion shovelware with sparse, me-too indie graphics, this is the cream of the crop, and I mean that. Certainly buy this metered, bite-sized gamelike experience on sale for 1-3 dollars. Just don't expect an epic journey.			",241,8,9,3,4,0,1

												This game is amazing. Have you ever played that game from website where you become a rectangiar block and you have to fall into a specific hole in order to advance? Well this game is pretty much upgraded from that. Only, much more complicated. It may look really simple in the first levels you play, but you can get the WTF reaction on the later levels. The game is similar that I just stated. Move your block into the rainbow spot. What suprised to me the most is that you can edge grab. But if you get smaller, you literally go up walls. I am trying not to put it out of context when I say that. So yeah, has the, ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of thing. But I do warn you, always predict what is going to happen next, or you are going to have a hard time.Overall: 9/10: Really worth the sale price of about $0.45Or for a ProJared rating: A Dance Party/10Here's a link to the game I'm talking about: http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-bloxorz ",16,3,0,2,6,2,1

												Be it the music, the colors, or the entire experience as a whole, EDGE is utterly lovely and manages to make something that should be repetitive and boring into something that is constantly surprising. Getting the negatives out of the way first, my biggest problem I have sadly is the controls, specifically because you cannot change the camera. While this is often done for effect and purposeful confusion, it's hard to tell which direction your cube is facing, and often found myself going forward instead of right. Since the camera is at an angle and not directly behind the cube, you will find moment like that a bit common, but it's more of a nuisance than a game breaking problem. While I had a better time the more I played, it was a problem that never truly went a way, but never got in the way of my enjoyment. Still, as a game all about speed, I can see it getting annoying for those looking for the best time, even with the ability to cut down time by balancing on the edges.The entire game is fully benefited through an abundance of creativity in its level design. The sheer genius and clear amount of fun Two Tribes had coming up with the level design shows the amount of passion they have for their work, and it's all amplified with the sublime, amazingly varied electronic soundtrack that's played throughout the game. Weirdly enough, I think I had more fun finding out what weird and vaguely familiar minimalist challenge I would face next. The amount they achieve with minimalistic colors and cubes is rather stunning, and the impressive difficulty curve really does rise in accordance to the player's skill. That is something I highly respect. Top this all off with the fact that outside of the base game, there are just as many extended levels and an entire community hub for user-made levels, (plus even a few seasonal ones that come up depending on the date), you can get lost in this game for a long time. It's also one I wouldn't be surprised to come back to again even if I'm finished. Seasonal levels aren't something you see that often, and I think it's a cool little touch to keep us playing months later.Between the insanely cheap asking price and the impressive amount of game presented, you can't get a better deal than this. Minor flaws aside, this is one of the most polished, beautifully presented indies I've played inn a long time, and it's one I'll probably finding myself come back to again and again whenever the mood hits. Definitely worth picking up if you want something a bit different. ",435,225,7,73,34,5,72

												A casual romp through precision platforming.  Though this is definitely a casual game, it does include a significant amount of challenge.  The toughest part is mastering the manipulation of the cube, the player avatar, which can both require a very large amount of practice and cause a great deal of frustration.There needs to be name for this kind of casual game.  The kind that centers around the mastery of a new skill, and focus on practice and gaining finesse to fully enjoy, similar to games like Tetris.  No context; little gratification; only challenge.  The only name I can think of is ""Frustrators"" because I don't care much for them, but I can certainly see an audience for this kind of thing!			",272,94,3,15,13,2,14

												Remember that time when you had to put the block in the hole? You were damned sure the block would fit, yet the hole seemed to be possessed! No matter which direction you turned the block it just wouldn't fit. There came a point where you just couldn't take it anymore. On the brink of tears you took the block into your hand and threw it across the room as hard as you could. Surprisingly no one was hurt, yet that block was never seen again. Why wouldn't that darn square block just fit into that round hole?!?EDGE is that same experience except it's a video game.			",458,105,9,57,37,4,65

												Mostly videos at store page describes how this game works. I just love how the game trolls players. Sometimes it's like ""step on this button, I'll guide you""... and it does. Sometimes when you step on some button it makes you fall down and you have to repeat whole sequence and even get your own way. I've bought it at discount for 0,4€ which was worth. Music is awesome too. It doesn't take much space which is a great advantage of this indie game. The worst thing? It doesn't have workshop. It would be much better and then even those 8€ would be a fair deal.			",162,38,2,12,11,3,16

												Brings back memories of playing Bloxorz on CoolMath, but loads more fun.Pros Include: Beat-thumping soundtrack (along the lines of Com Truise or Neon Indian)Colorful, vibrant, minimalist visualsEngaging, relaxing, spacey Atmosphere (despite the later difficulty)Hits that perfect combination of addictive and challenging.Cons: One, and only one. Mind you, this has nothing to do with the design of the game, which is rock solid, just a warning for any potential customers. The puzzles, while engaging, derive their challenge from reaction and dexterity, rather than careful planning. This isn't a slow burn type of deal, but a ""jesus christ I accidentally hit the left key, ♥♥♥♥ingfhdklajl;f"" one.In short: If it's within your budget, and you're looking for a quirky, engaging puzzler with a great soundtrack, look no further.

												This game has a lot of different levels of satisfaction to it. For me at the moment, I'm pretty pleased when I manage to figure out how to make it to the end of a level. Then I can go back and try to collect all the shiny bits before finishing. And even after that, if I eventually get good at the game, I could go back again and try to get the S+ ratings, too.I totally dig that there are no real ""lives"" and that you can experiment within each puzzle without any huge penalty other than perhaps loss of bragging rights. It's also nice that they put ""checkpoints"" in each level so you don't have to start over at the beginning every time you're an idiot and manage to get yourself squished or fall into the endless pit.

												For less than a dollar it's not a bad puzzle game. Kind of annoying that the view is on a diagonal but the controls are up/down/left/right.			",64,34,0,1,14,1,5

												A challenging and fun little puzzle/platformer game.  The amount of content is great, and design elements are very well executed.  I'm not a fan of puzzle games, but I beat something like 100 levels and spent 4 hours in this game, I really enjoyed it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												¡Está usted viendo un juegazo como la copa de un pene!Seguro que estas pensando -¿Como un juego que manejas un cubo puede ser divertido? y yo te contesto -Ni♥♥♥♥♥♥idea oye...pero me he metido una enganchada de órdago. Creo que puede ser por el acertado diseño de niveles, mecánica de plataformeo del cubo, estetica y música 8 bit y un sinfin de cosas que lo hace propicio para tenerlo siempre instalado y echar unos vicios rapidos antes de coger el bus o mientras calienta el horno. Creo que llegados a este punto en el mundo de los videojuegos, tenemos una esperiencia y  sabemos valorar a un juego por sus detalles y fijarnos solo en lo que de verdad importa... por cierto, no te has dado cuenta pero he escrito pene al principio.

												Edge is a great game, with a lovely soundtrack. The controls might be a bit hard at first if you are a moron such as I am. Later on they will be natural. It is never to hard to do it, but it is hard to do it with a high rank, so there still a challenge, even though everyone could complete the levels. If you are running on a mac with OSX El Capitan, just press command f a few times, otherwise the screen will stay blank. All in all, a really nice game, certainly worth it.			",36,4,0,3,5,0,5

Product received for free
												I originally played this game on a small low level phone that could only play java games. I instantly fell in love with it. When I discovered that there was a desktop version I went for it. I love the simple design and all the hidden secrets. You can tell they put lots of time into this. This goes down as one of my top ten favorite games ever. 10/10			",69,16,0,1,7,1,9

												Rather positive, relaxing casual game. Its main disadvantage is having some unique mechanics but not using them often enough. The best thing about it is that it's nice and pleasant to play, you don't get horribly punished for mistakes, you just respawn next to the place you failed at. It's a bit tedious and thus best played in bursts of 15-30 minutes. At some point the concept gets tired and the later levels get rather frustrating to complete. EDGE seems to have massive discounts during sales, and it's worth trying out when that it's priced at around a buck.			",118,14,0,8,11,0,18

												Great puzzle game to keep you busy for a while! Especially with the added challenges of finding all the prisms, the normal/extended/bonus levels, timers for scores, and some added Steam challenges, there's plenty to keep yourself entertained for quite some time. And all of that with just blocks moving in four directions! Very much recommended.			",20,14,0,3,3,0,6

												In general, many people don't expect too much from these cheap games, but this one... It's totally worth every penny. Different from many others, It's not even necessary ""to learn"" how to play. It's really simple. Graphics are great, sound effects and music are good (it matches well with the atmosphere of the game) and the interface is clean.			",25,0,3,0,9,0,7

												I first played this game on my Corby 2 and I spent a couple of hours with it. Now, it is on my PC and it sucks because I cannot freaking touch and swipe the cube to make it move(you know the reason why). But overall, this game is awesome! It brings back memories. Would recommend it to my friends.			",23,8,4,2,1,1,0
