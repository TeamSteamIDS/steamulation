Introduction: Tomb Raider Anniversary is a love letter to the fans of the original game who for many years saw a decline is the quality of titles being released for the franchise being developed by it's creators CORE. This is the second title developed by Crystal Dynamics, who were given the task to return the series to it's once respected and celebrated roots atop the action adventure genre and they not only accepted this great challenge but, as we all now know have continued to exceed gamers expectations as to what's to come from our most eye pleasing raider of tombs. If you truly wish to see exactly how the series progressed to what is now considered by many as the only franchise able to challenge and possibly best the Unchartered series as reigning action adventure royalty, Tomb Raider Anniversay although the second title released by Crystal Dynamics is where the evolution of their titles truly began.Overview: Tomb Raider Anniversary is a remake of the original classic game released on the Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation and PC. Now many years after the originals release, it not only began to show it's age but, seem more like the grandmother of gaming instead of it's symbol of female stregnth, resolve and sexuality. Crystal Dynamics has returned our once royalty of the action adventure gaming scene to her original glory by completely overhauling the graphics and gameplay for the modern age. They have successfully retained the gameplay elements of the original all while enabling the player with a more fluid and responsive control scheme for combat and navigation.Gameplay: The gameplay of Tomb Raider Anniversay is a blend of the previous entries with a more modernized execution. Gone are the tank like controls of the original which are now replaced with a scheme more suitable for a three dimensional space. The player will now be able to comfortably navigate our protagonost Lara through her adventures with a fair amount of ease and grace. Traversing areas overall feels much more natural than before as you perform platform jumps and general movements (combat etc.) throughout each level. With that being said, there are some areas which you will encounter less fluidity such as the under water sections which, in comparison to her ground level areas seem much less intuitive and a less than perfect camera that can at times make the journey a bit frustrating yet, even with it's flaws won't ruin the experience. The puzzle aspect of the gameplay is kept fully intact retaning the original elements that many considered the series stregnth and are executed on a much more professional scale than the 1996 release. With the change to a more intuitive control scheme comes less headaches when trying to place objects in their necessary positions along with a free camera which will assist you in getting a better look at the challenge at hand. The puzzles are of increasing difficulty and can at times seem like a daunting affair which only heightens the experience. As you solve the puzzles, you will marvel at the the genius displayed by the develpers and see why this game is considered such a figurehead in the industry. It's this very element that Tomb Raider Anniversary displays time and time again throughout your adventure that makes it easily understandable once again why Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider Series are considered one of the most influential games created. Graphics: Crystal Dynamics has done a fantastic job at bringing the original Tomb Raider into the modern gaming age. The entire world that you may or may not remember from 1996 has been painstakingly recreated with surprisingly beautiful results. Although anniversary saw it's initial pc release in 2006 the graphics are still something to behold. The indoor environments specifically can at times leave you in awe and shock that this was now released nearly ten years ago. Developed on a modified Legend engine which was first seen in the 2005 release Tomb Raider Legend, Crystal Dynamics have displayed their knowledge gained and applied it masterfully within their newly crafted world. There are a variety of features found in the graphics options to suit the pc gamers taste and configurations. From resolutions of up to 1080p, multiple aspects ratios and an assortment of graphics features such as anisotrpic filtering, multiple AA, shadows etc., Tomb Raider fans can rejoice that their title will remain relevant and playable for years to come. The only feature lacking which, oddly enough was found in Crystal Dynamics initial title Tomb Raider: Legend released in 2005 is an option to turn on high end graphics effects. Why they chose to limit the options available are beyond me but, regardless even without these, it still remains a beautifully constructed world.Sound: Within the first few seconds of launching anniversary, you will be welcomed back by the easily recognized soundtrack of the original remastered. For gamers who had the privilage of playing the original 1996 title, this will immediately send a chill down your spine and emit feelings of generations past. I immediately felt like a child again upon hearing the woodwind instrument solo echoing during the intro and it set the stage for an incredible adventure to come. The sountrack found within anniversary is perfectly suited to eash sequence at any gven time during your adventure and a stregnth at every turn. The sound effects serve their intended purpose and are general standard fair. The only sounds a bit lacking are during gun fire which, show their age in comarison to more current titles. They simply lack an ability to give the player a sense of power while weilding the many firearms found in game.Story: In Tomb Raider Anniversary you play as the protagonist Lara Croft, an archeologist and adventurer whos beauty and athletic grace is matched by her intellectual abilities which, serve her well whilst traversing the many dangerous ruins found across the world. The story takes a back seat to the gameplay aspects but, serves the game well. It establishes a sense of purpose and creates a nice sense of pacing to ensure you continue further into your adventure without feeling forced. Simply put, the gameplay is just as much of the story as any dialogue found within it as any true action adventure game should be. Balanced and not overbearing, it exists and knows it's role at all times. Replay Value: The replay value of anniversay is all dependant of the player. There are many hidden artifacts to discover if you wish to let your inner completionist enjoy a bit of obsessive compulsiveness during your adventure. There's quite a bit to discover along the way and overall it's a fairly legnthly adventure. That being said, like any action adventure title, there are some that will get more out of it than others and that all depends on what you're looking to achieve within the game. Although there is a seperate standalone mini-adventure that extends the content, what it adds isn't really geared towards the standard player and the gameplay found within it is mostly puzzle based. So overall the replay value found here is moderate but, most definitely worth the asking price.Final Review Score: 8.1/10 After being passed the torch, Crystal Dynamics successfully resurrected a franchise that was quickly being destroyed by it's creators CORE. In Tomb Raider Anniversary, Crystal Dynamics re-established the series as a viable contender for the action adventure crown and have done so since this 2006 release time and time again. Although Tomb Raider Anniversay isn't the incredibly polished title the most recently released Tomb Raider (2013) reboot was, it is very much so a classic example of how a remake can be achieved successfully without alienating it's fan base. If you're a fan of the action adventure genre, Tomb Raider Anniversary absolutely deserves a place in your library.			",405,45,10,43,23,2,49

												I need to start with the the bad first, because while not changing the fact that I definitely recommend this game, I feel it really needs to be stated.The bad aspects of this game really come down to one thing: it makes too many assumptions on what you are trying to do VS what you should do.Let me explain.The badYou can say what you want about the original, requiring quite a bit of precision with its blocky walls and ledges, as most of the moving around was made by jumping and grabbing ledges that were always facing each other. But it was clear when and where to jump to and from. The game knew what it did, and didn't make any assumptions of any kind on what you were trying to do. When you died, it was entirely your fault and your fault only.The Anniversary edition has gone beyond that and allows you to grab onto a ledge while jumping from another perpendicular ledge. While this is welcome and freshens up the game feel most of the time, it gets tiring when the game does not agree on your trajectory and lets Lara fall off to her doom without having her trying to grab said ledge. Next time, you try an identical jump and surprisingly the game now agrees to it.This is but an example. Overall, what happens is that the game does not allow you to do things it is not expecting. The most infuriating aspect of this is when the game decides wrongfully what is allowed and what isn't.You can reach that pole from where you stand? Lara won't grab it because you are expected to pull that cage over there to be able to reach that ledge over there that will in turn allow you to grab the pole.This leads to some really cringe-worthy moments were you will fail sequentially until the game finally decides to let you do what you actually are trying to do.Finally, and this is more of a detail, but still thought I'd mention it.Remember that animation in the original, when Lara lands on her feet and hands when she falls off a high platform? That is an animation that tells you ""this is as high I can fall from"" and you're like, ""phew, that was close"". You could really feel that fall through Lara.In Anniversary, Lara falls off, lands on her two feet like nothing happened physically, still yells and loses some health, but that animation is not there anymore. Tough falls do not feel like tough falls (except those you die in). Too bad.The goodAll of this being said, this remake of the first Tomb Raider is everything a remake ought to be: it freshens up the original with new ideas and does not try too hard to be like its predecessor.New graphics (2007-wise, but still look good in early 2015) and environments. If the sensation of vastness was there in the original, Anniversary builds on top of that and adds a more detailed architecture that improves that sensation of vastness.New controls that use the gamepad perfectly (don't know about keyboard, playing with a xbox 360 controller).New combat system that works way better than the original's jumping around. You still jump around here, it is just more dynamic overall. Even though combat is not frequent, there are enough to break the slow going pace of the puzzle solving. Also, boss fights! That means you have to find that specific thing to do to beat them.New cutscenes, cinematics and new voice acting. Some cutscenes have QTEs, but this remains very rare and anecdotal and does not add much to the game except giving you the impression of control when Lara does some badass stuff on screen.Collectibles that will have you rummage through the levels if you want to get all of them. These unlock rewards such as new costumes, artworks, developer commentaries, etc. There is also a time trial mode in which you must complete a level in one go, without checkpoints or anything: you fail, you restart entirely.Some of the old puzzles have been replaced by new ones, but old ones that worked well have been kept. In the original I sometimes found myself wandering aimlessly until I eventually came across all the pieces needed to solve a puzzle. I never felt that in Anniversary. It was almost always a straightforward but still rewarding experience. In addition to the ability to jump to perpendicular ledge, there are other new gameplay elements such as a grappling hook, swinging poles and climbable poles, all of which open up new possibilities for exploration and puzzle solving.I played Anniversary along with the original to fully appreciate the differences, and in my opinion, Anniversary is a great reverence to the original. It stands out on its own, with fresh ideas that definitely make sense for a game like this, while not casting any shadow over the original which has its own merits over Anniversary.

												Anniversary is not as action-oriented as the 2013 reboot: combat is scarce and boss fights are average. It's all about exploration, platforming and puzzles, and these elements have been the series trademark since its beginning.For me, this is the best Tomb Raider, despite its not so great reception at launch.PS: Controller is strongly recommended.

												Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a solid re-imagining of the original game which makes use of the Tomb Raider: Legend engine, meaning a game that's much more user-friendly and playable control-wise, and of course packs quite the graphical upgrade. Controlling Lara is a breeze with her acrobatics and various feats of parkour coming out smoothly and naturally whether using a gamepad or keyboard and mouse.  This makes the fact that a good 70-80% of the game is straight platforming and puzzle solving all the more enjoyable.  A keen eye and critical thinking are required to leap, grab, and grappling hook your way out of each scenario, and the game has a fairly generous system in place to help guide Lara to platforms, but most of the work is still up to the player.  The only real downsides of this remake are the combat and sometimes dodgy camera control and how that can interfere with some late-game platforming segments.  Combat in general feels very mushy. Gunplay never really felt satisfying, though the lock-on and shoot mechanic does help smooth things out a bit.  Issues arise however when enemies are able to get close, and especially if they're enemies capable of flight. The camera really loses track of what to do and can often cause a lot of seemingly unfair damage to be taken because of the obstruction. The camera particularly fails in one of the final areas of the game (The Great Pyramid), where a long series of timed jumps are required to proceed. The camera gets positioned in ways that obstruct the path and you may find yourself making blind leaps and grappling hook attempts in vain. Even worse is that movement can end up completely fudged in this sequence since the controls are relative to what the camera is doing and leaps and grabs you were capable of earlier in the game suddenly have to be performed with different or nonsensical button combinations because the camera hasn't decided what forward and backward are or hasn't communicated it properly. Even with its faults though, this is a fantastic puzzle platformer with a silly as all hell story and some great locations to parkour around in.			",280,60,2,29,8,1,17

												***I'm 50% into the game, but cannot resist the urge to review it.***This is a TRUE Tomb Raider game, meaning your experience will be enriched by awkward camera angles and rage-inspiring trial-n-errors.  But it also means you'll be solving interesting though not always intuitive puzzles while listening to soothing soundtracks and all at the same time admiring Lara's ridiculous buxom.If you are fond of TR Legend, Anniversary may intimidate you with its significantly more challenging combat and puzzles.  If the original TR I II and III were your cup of tea, however, Anniversary is your game.PROS:- Beautiful, glitch-free graphics.  Game looks ""next-gen"" without suffering from the fps drop or freezes that haunted Legend.- Wonderful sound effects and background music.- Fluid, precise control that inspires confidence.- Varied locations, each with its unique settings.- Top notch cutscenes with lots of emotions of Lara showing her exact thoughts of the moment.CONS:- Trial-n-errors, TR's staple feature, is worsened by the check point saving system.- Solutions to certain puzzles may not be immediately apparent; this leads to potential backtracking and wasted trips.- Old-fashioned, non-streamlined inventory system that requires arrow keys, TAB and Esc key to cycle through.- Significant hike in difficulty of last level.  I must have died more times in that level than previous levels combined.All in all, in the books of a old time gamer who had immense fun and even great frustrations over 90's TR games, Anniversary delivers a truthful TR experience.  It's challenging, but equally rewarding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9 out of 10Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a HD remake of the original. The story, weapons and badies are the same as the first Tomb Raider but enhanced with better sound look and even better AI.Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a fantastic remake upgrading the graphics to full HD quality, upgrading the sound and the controls and gameplay mechanics without losing touch with the feel of the original game, even keeping the originals level feel from the original but re-envisioned TR:A features some great extra content like past tomb raider costumes to wear in game, concept drawings and in game commentary from Tomb Raider creator Toby Gard and Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider: Anniversary creative director Jason Botta.You join Lara Croft on an epic gun blazing journey to recover an ancient artefact known as the Scion.

												Good remake to the original game that initiated this extensive and acclaimed franchise.Being a remake of the first Tomb Raider, the gameplay is predominantly focused on scenario puzzles. There's action sequences and combat, but they are few in number, thus the pace might not suit gamers looking for something more dynamic. Despite old, the game features satisfactory graphics and mechanics as well as a good sound quality. There is also a good variety of scenarios and their puzzles, which contribute to not become a repetitive and predictable game. The plot is dispensable and the end doesn't excite.It has some problems with the camera which sometimes irritates, and despite having full joypad support, the commands presentation are for the keyboard/mouse, which can lead to disorientation. In the end it's a good game, but I would only recommend for those who love and have played the old Tomb Raider games, or enjoy games based on puzzles.7/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Tomb Raider. Oh man, Tomb Raider. I remember 1996. I bought a Voodoo graphics accelerator to make a Lara that was basically three cubes into a Lara that was basically three smoother cubes. But the first game really nailed it when it came to exploration, artifact-hunting, cool acrobatics and that odd sense of wonder- stumbling into acient ruins had never felt so awesome. Right up to Tomb Raider 3 you could actually argue that despite the hype, despite the always growing bust, despite the recycling, Tomb Raider was a great game. Then things got downwards rapidly.Well, Legend rebooted the franchise, for good, with better graphics, smooth controls, an overhauled moveset and an actual story. Legend is the game you want to play when you really just want to play a cool action title.But Anniversary is the game you want to play when you have seen the series rise and fall. It's a remake of the original Tomb Raider. It has the same plot, and you will recognise some key locations. It's more focussed on exploration, carefully timed jumps and feverish backtracking to get that last bonus idol for your collection than Legend, where gunfights started three minuted into the game. There's little shooting here. Instead there's the feeling that you are back. Back where it all started. I bought this game three times now. That's how good it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best Tomb Raider game ever made. A wonderful combination of everything that made the previous games great with none of the bad.Not too easy, not too hard, pretty graphics and fluid controls and movement. Everything I ever wanted when I started playing the series.The sense of isolation you get when you go further and further into the tomb is back, with no token black guy screaming ""You crazeh, gurl! You crazeeeeh!"" in your ear every 10 seconds or magic binoculars that tells you what to do.There's a very nice little addition to the game that I really liked. The notebook. Basically you can click on it and Lara'll give you a vague clue on what to do. I found it virtually useless since the puzzles were JUST the right amount of difficult but it was nice to know it was there as a compromise from radio help or the binoculars from Legend.Lara's home is back which is great, it even has the boxes from the original games which I thought was a delightful little reference and I truly enjoyed doing the puzzles in the house this time. Not only because they were fun and interesting but also because they taught me how to control Lara which is wonderfully fluid this time around. Something I've sorely missed in previous entries. The old inventory rings are back as well but you can use your D-pad to access most of the items so it doesn't feel as clunky as before.Lara looks great! They did a wonderful job re-creating the original model with updated graphics and looking at it just plain makes me happy. Her top also changes color when she's wet to a more darker tone which I thought was a really neat touch.Another great addition (or omission) is the lack of human enemies. This is the most realistic and sympathetic portrayal of the character thus far and it adds a great deal of depth to both the game and its narrative.I feel like it really all came together in this one, to me this is the culmination of 10 years of Tomb Raider games. They finally got the blend of difficulty and fluidity right.			",116,19,0,10,2,0,4

After playing through the game, I found it very useful to be able to move my camera freely as I have noticed some things I would otherwise not have.  Bottom line:Great game!

 One of the best games to just play for hours for a nostalgic trip. 9/10  PROS  Has a truly breathtaking story line with unexpected turns and twists, and an amazing architecture. Every country, place and pyramid looks just like I had imagined them in my head before playing this game. Offers a serious challenge, especially if you're willing to collect all the artifacts and relics. It's totally worth it because at the end you unlock a bunch of awesome stuff like artworks, cheats and a special note. The atmosphere is simply beautiful, the ambience of the music sounds very suiting for every level. Will keep you busy for hours, no doubt. CONS  PC version should be optimized more, since there are some annoying bugs that make the gameplay more difficult than it should be. ",109,7,0,5,3,1,7

												I Highly Recommend this game for anyone who is looking to get into the Tomb Raider franchise. I also recommend for those seasoned players who have not picked this one up yet. it is by far my favorite in the series, competing close with Last Revelation.Why do i recommend this to Newbies? It has all the basic mechanics and puzzles at an easy starting level for everyone. It throws you into the action with an easy and slow first level. the puzzles are simple, such as moving blocks, and gets slightly harder from there. The other games get harder from there.Why do i recommend this to Fanboys? it recreates the original in a very casual environment, with beautiful new textures. it does not need to be challenging because, quite frankly we beat the game in 1996. For those who would find this easy, think of it as a refurbished museum to a historical game.The game is just the right length to not become boring and tedious, which is always a plus. You will visit Peru, Greece, Egypt, and the City of Atlantis in this exciting adventure. There are only 4 Weapons, but its ok, combat is not the focus here. There are annoying Quick Time Events, but they are short and maybe only 4 or 5 encounters within the entire game. Puzzles are fun, and will make perfect sense once you figure them out. There are plenty of costumes to unlock, paying homage to outfits lara has worn in the past. My favorite part of the game was the bonus level of Lara's Mansion, which is a nonstop puzzler that has you exploring the entire inside and outside of her estate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My mother played the original Tomb Raider a great deal back in the day; it became a family favorite to get together around the screen, fending off wolves and searching for treasures. I was too young then to play along, but as I grew up, I eventually borrowed her copy of Tomb Raider: Legend, and found myself quite enjoying the chance to see Lara's adventures for myself. I eventually bought Anniversary for the Xbox 360, and had a wonderful time finally experiencing the isolation and exploration of the classic games. I logged many, many hours there, and had an absolutely wonderful time, sometimes getting stuck on puzzles and finding myself mulling them over everywhere else; between schoolwork, when lying in bed before sleep, and in one case, a solution in Egypt came to me during the Super Bowl and I immediately abandoned the Big Game to go play THIS game.Finding this PC version in my library all these years later, I figured I'd give it a go for nostalgia's sake. The controls felt a little wonkier than I remembered, and the collision detection was especially strange (Lara tends to rotate and clip through platforms, falling down instead of climbing up them, especially if they aren't modeled with an entirely solid base), but it was still glorious to be able to experience the adventure again. Maybe it was just rose-tinted goggles as far as my problems with it went.And then it forgot my settings between play sessions. A bit odd, but hey, I'll deal with it. Re-enabling captions is fine.And then two hours in, it crashed to desktop mid-level and completely deleted my save.You should absolutely play this game. I recommend this game. I do not, however, recommend this rather wonky and broken port of it. A fine experience marred by technical issues, it feels like the content of Anniversary hastily jammed into the port of Legend.

												THANK YOU EIDOS! For the longest, I've spent ages wondering why in the world left didn't mean go left and not turn left. The same thing that has HAUNTED my experience with this as well as resident evil. But for the latter I was perplexed as the publisher pushed out games like gex 2 and 3, akuji the heartless, legacy of kain, meanwhile this game was carrying this annoying movement all the way through angel of darkness. Why is beyond me.Tomb raider anniversary takes the experience and intensifies it without making it as atrocious as not having ammo in the regular games. You get all of the fun whilegetting the experience you were supposed to get from tomb raider in my opinion. Dedicated exploration, optional puzzles, and a world and character worth looking at, and very playable to boot. I wonder why everyone turned their face at me when I mentioned how I loathe tomb raider because of the clunky movement control. They changed it, and now it is another entry to worthwhile platform games that everyone should give a try. You probably won't find everything on your first go, but taking a nice stroll through it and trying everything will do the trick, as well as  stump most normal platform gamers who think that everything that happens is accessible and valid instantly. Where that is not always the case here.I'll probably enjoy tomb raider games from here on for sure. Because I couldn't get enough of the older eidos platform games. And this is just tomb raider that moves just like the rest of those games. I couldn't be more pleased with that. As the rest of the game is or should be self explanatory.			",593,159,18,80,29,5,66

												Another great installment of the Tomb Raider series. This is an awesome remake of the first game from 1996 (The name itself explains that),most of the original stuff is included but with way more advanced graphics and systems. The story itself is original,never seen before and a must play! Some puzzles and parts may be frustrating but after you solve them you feel a great amount of happiness and relief. 10/10 would play again after 7 years of the release			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Overview  Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remaster of one of my favorite games of all time, the original Tomb Raider for the original Playstation console. This remastered version holds onto the original story, levels (with a few added areas) and idea that made Tomb Raider such a great game. With a new graphics engine and an overhaul to the controls, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a nice step up from its predecessor, though it does fall flat on a few areas too. Let's have a look:For those that have never played a Tomb Raider game before, Tomb Raider is a platforming, puzzle-based game with limited gunplay when enemies creatures/humans appear. Throughout the game, you'll face increasingly dangerous creatures, but very few human opponents. The game is centered around Lara and her environment, as opposed to human interaction. There is some, but it is limited to key points in the story.For the game itself, you take control of Lara Croft, an archaeologist, adventurer, gun-slinger and overall badass. She's a globetrotter, exploring ancient worlds on her quest to recover three pieces of an artifact, known as the ""Scion"" and uncover the mystery of the lost city of Atlantis, among other secrets along the way.The game's plot will take you to a multitude of dynamic environments, solving puzzles, dodging lethal traps and killing indigenous and unexpected foes along the way. Your arsenal is small, but effective, consisting of a few weapons (including your trusty dual pistols), some acrobatic flare and your wits. What I loved about the enemies was the blending of reality with fiction, giving the places you visit a mystic feeling, but still maintaining the core of its history in the places you visit. While I loved the remake with the added features, level areas and different puzzles, there were some flaws that I felt the first one did better. For those that played the first installment, and for those that did not, saving and health packs were limited, making every decision difficult and enemies a lot more dangerous. Saving involved maybe one or two blue ""save crystals"" found during the level, making death costly and keeping you on your toes throughout the level. In the remake, those are removed for a save option that can be initiated at anytime, which also ""heals you"" when you do so, making the game relatively easy and death a mere inconvenience instead of something to fear. However, combat has been improved and the controls have had a much needed overhaul from the original and the game still keeps hints to a minimum (usually none) making the need to explore, think and instill a bit of detective work in the player, which I always enjoyed (your experience may vary). Lara's acrobatics have been streamlined and platforming has become a little more forgiving, though it is still easy to die if you're not careful.The remake also kept the side quests alive, leaving hidden artifacts to collect and health/ammo to those that seek them out, or for those of you who want more to do that just find the end of the level.When it comes to the remastered version, I greatly enjoyed it. It's filled with nostalgia with a hint of polish and finish. My only complaint lies with the severe lack of difficulty that the remastered version has over the original and how saves are handled and how plentiful ammo appears to be. With that being said, it is still a joy to play and I see myself doing multiple playthroughs.  Pros   Updated graphics engine, control overhaul and movement Keeps true to the original while adding its own flavor with new areas, puzzles and scenery. Puzzles - Seamless to the world around you, tricky and notably deadly. I love how the puzzles are introduced. Music  - I've always been a fan of the music; the feelings that transpire from them are intense, yet pleasant.  Cons    Difficulty - It has been scaled down tremendously, which I disliked.  Healing - Saving the game heals Lara, which makes no sense. It makes health packs often useless. Ammo - It's plentiful. It's everywhere. Overall, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a fun platformer for those who are new to the series or veterans. The upgrades are nice, though not always the best decision, but the game tries. It holds to the original while being new at the same time. I still recommend it despite the cons, as I feel the game is well worth the cost and the investment of your time.

												TRA is for me the best game from the Crystal Dynamics old 'trilogy', even though there are many things I dislike about it now.This game is supposed to be a remake of the original, which is probably why I liked it so much. It's different to the show-off that was TR Legend. It's once again about Lara, being alone in this GIANT tomb, solving various puzzles and defeating various enemies on the way to get a priceless relic. As it should be. I think they got this isolated feeling from the original quite well. However, they decided to create their own little trilogy, focused on Lara and her daddy issues. CD shamelessly stuck this non sense into the original story and I will forever dislike them for that. The gameplay is pretty much the same like Legend's. There are many, many areas in which you have to jump away from a ledge and either:1. you can't turn the camera to see where you're jumping2. the camera sluggishly attempts to show you but instead spazzes out and you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥br>3. you somehow jump in the totally opposite direction4. you can't make it to the ledge despite jumping a similair distance minutes agoAll this makes a game full of ledge jumping really frustrating. A lot of times something looks like a ledge, but it isn't. The level design is pretty good, but half of the credit goes to the original game, which had fantastic level ideas. What really sucks is that a lot of those super memorable rooms are usually connected with long♥♥♥♥♥empty hallways, that have like 3 repeating textures in the style of each level set. The combat is okay, reminiscent of the old game as well. Although I'm not a big fan of that slow-mo bullet-time thing. Also QTEs, no need to have those in this game at all. Graphics are good for 2007, still keeping the cartoony feel of Legend. Overall a good remake, because its base was fantastic. Lots of unnecessary stuff added in though.			",48,8,0,8,3,0,1

												Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a superb game in almost every way.  As a video gamer new to the franchise,  I can now fully understand the reasons behind the tremendous popularity of the Tomb Raider series and the fervor of its fan base.  The extent of my previous experience with the internationally celebrated Lara Croft amounted to about 20 minutes of game play on a roommate's Playstation back in the year 2000.  Thus, I had not been truly prepared for how fantastic a journey I would embark upon in Tomb Raider: Anniversary for PC on sale from Steam.PROS:Artistically, the four geographic settings are vibrant, colorful, and immersive.  Coupled with the wonderful music score, the sense of depth and immersion allows you to get lost in the game play and fully embrace the Lara Croft character and her story.  Architectural designs are fun, pleasing, and accurate to their respective time periods and cultures. Compared to other games, inventory control and weapon selection are perfectly adequate and simple without being unnecessarily clunky or unwieldly.  The same can be said of the combat and avatar movement controls.  This simplicity was a refreshing change for a gamer such as myself who has played much of the Assassin's Creed series and finds much of the combat and movement controls, as well as the overabundance of weapons, mostly superfluous. Tomb Raider: Anniversary was a sincere challenge for me, and I found this splendidly refreshing in a sad era of dumbed-down video games, crafted with constant hand-holding, slap-in-the-face obviousness, and/or effortless boss fights.  Level puzzles in TR:A  required strategy and (oftentimes) foresight with a healthy dose of trial and error in their completion.  Pathing through the map required keen observation and a healthy (and often fatal) dose of trial and error as well.  Most combat engagements were harrowing (especially toward the end) and boss fights required a combination of skill, attentiveness, and diligence.  I cannot remember the last time a video game made my palms sweat as profusely as this title.CONS: On the downside, I cannot remember the last time a video game spiked my blood pressure to such unhealthy levels either.  Three to four level sections were downright diabolical, if not cruel in the difficulty scale.  Even with the help of a walkthrough as a guide, some spots took me HOURS to complete. Once or twice this was due to poor checkpoint (save) placement or miscommunicated controls (""Jump LEFT Lara! Not backward into the bubbling sea of LAVA! GAHHHH!!""). But mostly it was due to timed climbing runs with way too little time and way too many stages of jumps and maneuvers, sometimes intermixed with combat.  Two boss fights in particular were frustrating to complete, even with guide help and when doing everything correctly. Lastly, I was disappointed in the implementation of a few extraeneous game elements.  Gradually unlocked outfits for Lara could not be worn during the first play-through of the game.  The Croft Manor side-mission was especially enjoyable for me, but any progress could not be saved on the PC version, even after level completion.  It had to be solved on one go, and then the level reset itself upon future visits.  Admittedly, these cons are largely nit-picky, but I see no logical reason why the developers implemented these (otherwise fun) elements this way.Overall, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a phenomenal video gaming experience offering MANY immersive and challenging hours of fun and thrills.  It's a true bargain at $10 or less, and was a sinful steal for me for under $2 bundled with the Tomb Raider Reboot.			",47,4,0,8,0,0,1

												Tomb Raider… This saga has been a pillar of my childhood, source of many fond memories along with Spyro the Dragon, Oddworld and so on. So, I was understandably excited in finding out an anniversary homage to the first game of the Core series, which crashed and burned after the embarrassing Angel of Darkness. And Tomb Raider Anniversary was (of course) the first game I ever played on Steam.So, after 30 hours of gameplay (20 in the first run not on my profile, and about 10 in the second), I think I have a pretty accurate opinion about this game.First the pros:1) I found Lara’s movements incredibly smooth, and it was pretty easy to get used to them and do things a bit more quickly than in Legend.2) The beautiful, sometimes even breathtaking sceneries (and the fact that no spot of the areas was covered in darkness, no matter how far it was);3) Adaptations of the structure of the levels: while I could still easily orient myself (some paths are pretty much the same) many things changed to adapt to Lara’s new abilities, but it was done in a very natural way;4) Bossfights: I had fun during those. They aren’t a “just-shoot-until-it-dies” kind of bossfights, you actually have to use your brain. Which is awesome!And now, the cons:1) Bugs: There are bugs everywhere! You don’t know when the next one is gonna hit you in the face, and the more you are far from your last checkpoint, the more you get nervous, because: “What if she doesn’t grab that ledge, falls and dies, and I have to do it all over again?”. And that’s just one of many.2) Checkpoints: seriously, what the heck? I have no idea how they thought it would be a good idea to set the checkpoints the way they did: one after every lever, but not even one right before and/or right after a very difficult piece? Are you kidding me?!3) Pyramid ascending: the first time I ascended the Pyramid with that series of timed runs, I thought I was going to cry. It's difficult and that’s ok. What is NOT ok is that Lara points her guns at everything BUT the flying mummies (which, instead, do a very good job at killing her), or that she bugs and doesn’t grab what she must in order to finish that piece, thus wasting all of your efforts.4) Lara Croft: Now, thing is, while one may appreciate her being more human… She is not as I remember her in TR1. She was way more cold, and killed Natla’s lackeys without a care in the world. “What? You want to kill me? Over your dead body maybe!” or “My piece of the Scion? Not before you catch my bullets with your eye, honey!”. That was Lara’s attitude, and that way I liked her. But maybe I’m just grumpy because she was the strong, devil-may-care woman every little girl (me first in line) wanted to be…So, did I like the game? Yes. Would Recommend it? Absolutely.But take some Xanax first. Or morphine. Meditation is fine.Whatever relaxes you the most.And good luck.			",14,2,0,1,0,0,0

*** QUICK SPOILER-FREE REVIEW ***An amazing game! I've played the others by Crystal Dynamics and I'd place this with the gritty reboot as the best.THE GOOD: Damn near everything!The puzzles are actually puzzling, the platforming challenging, the dialogue and acting are actually good and the story gives Lara some surprising depth! The music hits both the atmospheric and action themes perfectly, and the game is more than its money's worth in terms of length (expect 20 - 40 hours). Oh and it still looks great in 2015!There's tonnes of extra unlockable content included too, such as costumes, concept art and in-game commentary, and Croft Manor is a nice side-mission that you can play whenever you feel like taking a break from the main game.THE BAD: Camera/control problems, A once-off lack of conveyance...There are some rare problems with the controls (like holding forward to jump back and to the left? Wat??) and on modern computers there's sometimes a bug where Lara simply refuses to grab a ledge, but there are solutions out there if it's a problem for you. Of course, this is Tomb Raider so the camera will be your worst enemy at times, basically wrestling with you for control (especially when wall running) though in fairness it could be a lot worse --- 90% of the time you won't notice it, and 9% of the time it will zoom out to make everything look more epic.Also, you might find yourself wanting to consult a walkthrough every now and then, but try checking Lara's journal first as it might have crucial information. I have to crticize the game here though, since during a particular battle there was literally no way I could have known what to do unless I stopped the game, opened the menu and read the journal --- only I forgot about the journal since I hadn't really needed until then. This only happened the one time though, so I can't say it's a deal breaker.THE SCORE : 9/10The problems are really very minor and don't detract too much from what I would consider an otherwise flawless game.Highly Recommended!NOTE:I played this on easy as the difficulty options just change the damage values. I don't mind taking lots of damage, but it's just an immersion breaker when I have to expend 100's of bullets to kill anything. So if you're like me, play it on easy. If you want an extra challenge, don't use medkits. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A faithful recreation of the original Tomb Raider game, but has a few gameplay issues, ranging from artificial gameplay lengthening to confusing map layout, and forced checkpoints (but with a manual save feature?)Platforming is generally more solid than Underworld, with less ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" moments, but the game is still very easy.  Dying gives you all your HP back, so why even bother with medkits?I still enjoyed it despite my gripes, but keep a walkthrough handy, or you'll find yourself frustrated, A LOT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game, Im happy to have it, however I'm on the fence about reccomending it on PC. The port is just awful. The T-rex fight is broken.(Kept clipping into the wall) and the manual save feature doesn't work, it takes you back to the last checkpoint no matter what. Its a GREAT game, but be warned, the port is dreadful.			",155,13,3,13,11,0,19

												This game is broken AF which is putting it mildly. I would go as far as saying this is the most broken commercial game I have ever played. Which still is putting it too mildly.- Not a level goes by when you don't have to reload a save because Lara gets stuck floating mid-air on a ledge.- Levels will be broken when you fall somewhere and don't die. Buggy physics is the main key to discovering secrets.- The symmetry in levels will leave you crying in confusion until you replay each portion again and again to just memorize everything well enough to know where you are.- The save system will leave you crying in confusion. After dying and reloading randomly shows items you've already picked up and/or loses your artifact collection entry.- The level not-changing system. How on earth does this play together with level-specific artifact collection and secrets? It doesn't.- I've had the game freeze in a cutscene where physics would not trigger as they should. And it was the sole most frustrating spot in the entire game where I had to reload and replay. - The grapple will not stick to things as it should despite hitting them. You have to use manual aim after which it sticks.- The enemies will magically teleport-lunge at you if you dodge them by jumping instead of the quick-time button. - Wall-running grapple jump direction is randomized because the camera goes haywire and everything is camera-relative. Additionally at random that can happen to any kind of jump.But still, I can't but recommend it. Great adventure, sense of exploration, traps, secrets, story. Everything TR should be about.

Product received for free
												I have been a fan of the Tomb Raider series ever since I was a child. Even though it was sad to see Core Design leave and all of its projects gone, many fans thought this would be the end of our dear Lara Croft. However, Eidos did the first ""good"" thing and managed to hire Crystal Dynamics.I'm going to be honest and say that I would have picked the Angel of Darkness trilogy over this new trilogy, but I can't help but state that Anniversary is indeed a good and solid game. It pays much tribute to the original game and the puzzles can be tricky, but still fun to do. For a 2007 game it still holds very well. You can expect a smooth frame-rate and gorgeous graphics. Lara Croft definitely feels alive. I will miss the old actress, but this one does fit a more mature Lara. The game is fun and properly introduces newcomers to the series. I've had this game for my PS2, PS3 and PC(several times). I cannot get ired of it. It might be the worst Tomb Raider in terms of sales, but it honestly deserves a shot. The first boss battle is still one of my favorite.P.S: Yes, the game has jiggle physics. They're realistic and well-balanced.			",31,7,0,5,1,0,0

												Quitensential Tomb Raider and how a remake (not really a remake more an update) of a classic should be done (now we just need that Final Fantasy 7 one). Greatly visually updated (even looks pretty great now), tight controls, intelligent puzzles and platforming (the type that makes you feel smart when you figure it out and progress / find that relic).The game offers that same great sense of adventure, puzzling and challenge mixed in with mild combat and treasure finding as any great Tomb Raider-eqse game should.NOTE:It is pad native and works great but not screen native (shows the keyboard keys instead of the xbox buttons) but it's easy to figure out what is what unlike in say FF7 where it's consistently a nightmare.

I remember playing the originals as a kid but got frustrated by them and never really fell that much in love with the franchise; since playing this however that has changeedddd. I've bought Tomb Raider 2 so i'll certainly try again.This remake thooooo by Crystal Dynamics is just wonderful and listening to the commentary that's unlocked you can tell they put so much love and attention into the production. My bloody excitement to discover they also made previously Legend and then Underworld. I'm off to play then soon as possible. I thoroughly recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whilst the enviroments and a lot of the platforming is enjoyable I find the controls and combat to be lackluster. Lara is a lot more free in her movement unlike in her older games, which is quite a nice change from when she moved around like a tank, unfortunatly it does hinder pinpoint jumps and grabs. I would say it is a decent attempt at a remake but still a rather mediocre game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although years of sequels that ranged from unremarkable to borderline offensive did a lot to tarnish the Tomb Raider name, developer Crystal Dynamics undid a lot of damage with last year's Tomb Raider: Legend. That game focused on the strengths of the series--exotic locales, thoughtful puzzles, and incredible acrobatics--while modernizing the gameplay, as well as streamlining the whole experience. Crystal Dynamics continues its good work with Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which effectively goes back to the original Tomb Raider and rebuilds it from scratch. Anniversary has now arrived on the Xbox 360, looking as good and playing about as well as it did on the PC.This is one of those rare cases when the remake is better than the original.                                                                                      Like the 1996 original, Tomb Raider: Anniversary follows the tale of Lara's hunt for the Scion of Atlantis as she does battle with conniving businesswoman Jacqueline Natlas and her various henchmen. You'll explore ancient tombs and forgotten cities in Peru, Greece, or Egypt. You'll also perform plenty of death-defying acrobatics as you work your way through massive, ancient, and often deadly puzzles. The whole experience is highly evocative of the original, and there are certainly plenty of moments that seem specifically designed to create an odd sense of déjà vu. Nothing in Tomb Raider: Anniversary has been regurgitated verbatim--everything is bigger and better. The environments are larger and more detailed, while existing puzzles have been elaborated upon, often to an incredible degree. The experience just feels bigger, and there's so much new content that it honestly feels more like its own game than a remake.A big part of that feeling comes from how much more talented Lara has become since the original Tomb Raider. Aside from a few, nominal differences, she's basically got the same abilities here as she had in Tomb Raider: Legend, which made her one of the most nimble action adventure heroes this side of the Prince of Persia. Her proficiency around ledges is incredible: She can shimmy across ledges, leap from one ledge to another, and scramble from one ledge to a higher ledge. She can swing from dangling ropes or horizontal bars, perform tumbling maneuvers to avoid projectiles, and climb up, leap from, or balance precariously atop vertical poles. All of these acrobatics feel natural and not overly difficult to pull off, with the game allowing for just the right amount of margin of error. As good as Lara is, though, she's got her limits, which is a big part of what makes the action feel dangerous. If your timing is off just a little bit when jumping for a ledge, Lara might catch it with only one hand, which will have you furiously mashing a button to help her recover. But if you miss the ledge completely, Lara's likely to expire or at least incur a serious amount of damage.She'll need to exercise each and every one of these abilities to their absolute limit in Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which features no shortage of ridiculous acrobatics. The game is essentially made up of a series of gigantic, unique set-piece puzzles. Sometimes the puzzles are traditional find-the-key, flip-the-switch-type of affairs, but more often than not, the real puzzle is figuring out how to use Lara's ability to get from point A to point B. What's more, the puzzles are often nested several layers deep. While your overall goal may be to find four keys to open a door, you'll first have to figure out how to get to the bottom of a gigantic, crumbling tower. After getting to the bottom, you'll have to figure out how to access four different doors. Then, after accessing the doors, you'll have to figure out how to actually open those doors. Of course, behind each of those doors lies a series of tricks and traps that you'll have to traverse before you'll get to the keys. Solving one of these overarching puzzles can be an involved process, with some of them taking well over an hour to complete.The environments are your biggest adversaries most of the time in Anniversary, though through your exploration, you'll regularly run into some antagonistic fauna, such as rats, bats, wolves, bears, tigers, gorillas, raptors, and the occasional Tyrannosaurus Rex. Combat is limited to gunplay, which operates with a simple lock-on system. Lara can also tumble and flip through the air while keeping a bead on an enemy. New to Anniversary is the adrenaline dodge, which at specific moments allows Lara to dodge a charging enemy in slow motion. When time slows, a target will also slowly move toward the enemy, and if you fire the weapon right at the moment it locks on, it'll produce an instant kill, usually when the ferocious beast is just inches away from your face. It still feels like Tomb Raider combat, which has always been a minor part of the experience, but the adrenaline dodge is a nice little touch that adds a little more drama to the action. Tomb Raider: Anniversary also makes use of the same type of interactive cutscenes seen in Tomb Raider: Legend, where you'll have to quickly react to an onscreen button cue to keep Lara alive. It allows for some beautifully choreographed action sequences, but they're rarely very challenging.What keeps Tomb Raider: Anniversary engaging throughout is the strength of the gameplay, as well as the quality of the presentation. Even though you're basically just going from one tomb to another, they feature enough individual detail to make them unique. The environments are also huge, using the occasional curvy hallway to mask load times, and aside from some minor gameplay contrivances, they feel pretty real. Lara looks great and moves with a natural grace that makes her incredible acrobatic feats look feasible instead of ridiculously superhuman. The various wildlife creatures you confront also move convincingly. It's the little touches that bring the whole thing together: the way water glistens on Lara's skin when she gets out of the water, the way light refracts differently when she's underwater, or the tangible difference in atmosphere between different locales.It's almost enough to make you forget about Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness.In the months from the initial release of Tomb Raider: Anniversary on the PC and PS2 to its arrival on the Xbox 360, Crystal Dynamics appears to have done little, if anything, to change the experience. The graphics are on par with the PC version, though we did notice a few, isolated instances of frame rate chop, despite the fact that there's nothing in here that should be taxing the 360 hardware for that to occur. The environments might not always be rich with detail, but Lara looks consistently great. It's also a really great-sounding game. You'll hear plenty of small ambient effects, such as animal calls and dripping water. Lara's grunts and yelps as she scales these incredible antiquities will also resonate differently depending on the size of the room. Music is generally used sparingly, but it always swells to a flourish at all the right moments.Tomb Raider: Legend did a lot to make Lara Croft feel relevant again, and Tomb Raider: Anniversary is another step in the right direction. The acrobatic action is consistently exciting and challenging throughout. Yet despite being a remake, the experience feels new and fresh. This is the best Tomb Raider game in years, and for the first time in a long time, that actually means something.THE GOOD Strikes a balance between homage and new, exciting content Acrobatic action adventure gameplay is challenging without being frustrating Lara looks great and moves effortlessly Adrenaline dodge makes combat more excitingTHE BAD Doesn't take many chances with the Tomb Raider formula Minor frame rate issues7.5/10GOOD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anniversary is the middle chapter of Crystal Dynamics' trilogy that began with Legend and concluded with Underworld. It's a faithful re-imagining of the original Tomb Raider from 1996, while deftly tying it into the story of the other two games that take place in the present (it's still 1996 in this remake). Anniversary is visually beautifiul and the puzzles are incredibly elaborate and complex. Lara travels the globe to places like Peru, Greece, and Egypt, while you solve the mysteries of some of the most enormous and intricately designed tombs ever in a Tomb Raider game.The story is a rehash of the original, with Lara hired by the mysterious Natla Corporation to find an artifact. What's good about it is the way they tied this into the back story about Lara's mother.The only knock I can give is that on the pc there is a well-known bug in one of the Egypt levels that prevents you from making a simple jump to a ledge so you can exit the level. I had to download a cheat to let me move Lara past that point. Then there is the infamous ""pyramid tower of terror"" segment near the end which had me smashing my mouse and keyboard in frustration. Even watching You Tube videos and knowing exactly what to do, it still took dumb luck on one of the jump sequences to make it after about a hundred tries. The problem is that they made grapple wall running/jumping to the next handhold very unforgiving, and you are constantly fighting the camera angles and the controls to get Lara to do what you want her to do. It's hard enough to get enough momentum, jump from the right height and the exact right moment so you can barely reach the ledge, but then to have Lara jump back instead of to the side, or to the side instead of back, because according to the camera angle that's what the game thinks you want her to do...that can be maddening.Despite late game bugs/control issues, Anniversary is still a great game and very satisfying to finish.

												It has been a very, very long time since I played the original Tomb Raider so my memory of the old version of the game as compared to the new one is probably slightly skewed. Tomb Raider Anniversary, for already being over 5 years old, looks quite excellent, has a series-typical great soundtrack, and is generally a greatly superior rendition of the concept of Tomb Raider than was the original.However, the difficulty and controls can be genuinely unmanageable at times, particularly in the last half of the game. Also of note is the poor edge detection that persists throughout the game and the penchant for getting stuck on the vertexes of things that both Lara and many of the creatures have (see the T-Rex fight for example).

												Just beated the whole game today, and I'm happy to say that this game was quite the real challenge, I can also state that this game is somewhat the hardest of all other hard games, if you're not up to the task, then don't bother, but if you seek some real time challenge, than this game is definitely for you. The gameplay is quite grueling, but perfect, my guess is that I believe that they've made this game harder because Tomb Raider Legend was easier which in my opinion I think is true. This game also reminded me of another game, Star Wars Jedi Outcast, because the developer of that game worked hard to make the game a real challenge, which in my opinion applies to the same as the developer of Tomb Raider Anniversary. Anyway, great game with great challenges. Hardest game I've ever played LOL.			",143,9,5,3,10,0,10

												Tomb Raider Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider from 1996. Of course the biggest thing it changed were the controls and the graphics. The game plays identically to the previous game Legend, and runs on the exact same engine. It pays homage to the source content, and yet at the same time adds it's own touches.All the levels are remade, and some are merged into others. The characters are fleshed out a bit more, and are definitely more interesting then they were in the original.For the price, it's hard to recommend this game any more, especially considering most other Tomb Raider games on Steam suck. But unfortunately it still suffers from the lack of replayability most of the modern Tomb Raider games face, and this is one problem the original didn't have. Upon retrospect this game is probably one of the better remakes I've had the fortune to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Remake of a classic that keeps the core game, levels etc. intact and only slightly improves on the gameplay. It was groundbraking when it came out and solely defined the 3rd person action adventure genre. Even though it may feel dated in some ways, it still is what makes Tomb Raider great: exploring, environment puzzle solving and some shooting. A must play!!!			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												Hard to recommend. It's very similar to the original game with a few things tweaked or added. Still has a decent sound track and some tense platforming. Controls are sooooo much smoother than the older games. Overall its enjoyable but its still kinda buggy. Huge no-no for a platforming game. There are a few spots where you will die because she decided she can't grab a ledge until the 5th time. Save somehow got corrupted lost all my progress and all my unlocked stuff, since it lacks steam cloud it officially screwed me over. Needs some more polish and man I wish it had cloud support.

												Wow, what a game! Probably the best Tomb Raider I've ever played. The puzzles demand a lot of attention and the game doesn't hold your hand unlike some other games I know *cough cough, the reboots*.  Lara is as beautiful as ever and I much prefer this design with her dual pistols and short shorts. I even prefer the more intelligent sounding voice actress.If you want to know what a Tomb Raider game should look like, play this NOW!! Not every game has to be Uncharted!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this Game a while back in a Huge Tomb Raider Sale and I am glad I got it.Whilst I owned this Game back when I was younger on Playstation 2 and almost finished it there. I decided to give this Game a go again and buy it on PC. Now before we start what does the Game come with? It comes with the Singleplayer Campaign & Croft Manor. Once the Singleplayer is finished you can unlock Cheates to just mess around the Game. (Remember its not really cheating if its given to you by the developers).You can explore Croft Manor at any Time you want, so if you want to take a break of the Story and just solve puzzles that are a bit less challenging you can pay Croft Manor a visit.First of all compared to the Playstation 2 Version this Game has alot of buggs where Lara just completly glitches out and gets stuck on. However its not Game breaking and usually is fixable by just reloading your latest Checkpoint. But it also looks alot better then it did back on the PS2.Now I haven't played any of the Original Tomb Raider Games back from the 90's. Since I grew up starting with this Tomb Raider Trioligy ( The Trioligy includes Anniversary, Underworld & Legend). Which is why I can't compare it to those Games.However if you are new-ish to the Tomb Raider Series this one is a great one to get in. It is a 'classic' Tomb Raider Game with mainly raiding Tombs and Action secondly. There is some shooting in here as well and I do admit the Auto Aim did♥♥♥♥♥♥me off a couple of times but it is after all secondly and not the main focus, which is why you don't need to worry about it.Now let me just drop in here quickly that I do believe that you should play the newest 2 Tomb Raiders ( from 2013 & 2015 ) first to fully understand the story. Although I thought they have not been connected it seems they sort of are. Maybe not graphic wise, as the newest 2 Tomb Raider Games of course are waay more advanced when it comes to the graphics, but story wise they are, even if just a little bit. I don't think I would off understand as well as I did, if I would off finished this before playing the other 2.To the actual Gameplay:Besides being sometimes buggy and the Aim Assist not pointing to where I want it. The Controls are very nice and easy to Master. Since this Game is mainly about Tomb Raiding more then Shooting, you are in for a blast if you love solving puzzles. The Puzzles in Tomb Raider are very clever and are challenging. A 12 year old (especially new age gamer) might will have some trouble but if they stay on it I am sure they can solve it! (Or they just look at a guide).I personally found the Puzzles a bit to hard when I was younger. Now almost 9 Years later they are still challenging but once again they are very clever made and if you keep on it, you will figure it out (Not impossible!).All in all the Tomb Raider Series has one of the best Stories to this Day and I am glad to see all of them existing on PC. I am also very Happy that these old-ish once are sort of connected to the Revamped once that just came out a couple of years ago. It really gives you this connected feeling.I do recommend Tomb Raider to any Puzzle & Adventure Fan. Otherwise I also do recommend it to anybody that is in for a  great Story, as I honestly think it is one of the best ones here on Steam & Gaming History.I also do Recommend Tomb Raider Anniversary for its full price as the Campaign on Normal Mode will take you up to 10 Hours + 1-2 Hours of Croft Manor. But of course its never a Mistake to get it on Sale!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some frustrating camera/jump problems taint the expereince. The AI is abit braindead. But, the slower pacing and puzzle solving is very enjoyable.

												Review by xTzharkz.Tomb Raider: Anniversary was nailed in spot, even if it was a remake of the first game, the gameplay was perfect. -Shortly, gameplay perfect, movement perfect, story perfect, graphics nice, combat system perfect, relic hunt perfect, puzzles perfect. Little more detailed version then.Comparing to the previous games I enjoyed this game gameplay the most. Everything was smooth. The story of the game was interesting and more detailed than it was in previous version. Was more connected to the gameplay. Which made it more interesting. Was fun to compare old version to this one, can see all the improvement and changes.Character had no issues with movement, shooting enemies etc. Like said everything was smooth and nice. Puzzles were not impossibly hard which kept the mood to keep playing. The amount of relics they had was perfect. Not that you find them in every corner which they did in last game. There were two kind of hidden rewards ones that were really easy to find, run past and notice - didnt mean you can pick it up tho right a way, but also ones that you had to work for to even see them. I found it cool. If found all in one level, then got more content open - art, costumes, etc.Croft manor!!! Purrrrfect! Puzzles and challenges, what else to say. Overall, was great gaming experience.xTzharks [Eric]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy the original instead then thank me later.I've played TR:A on the PS2 and PC and all I have to say is that this game is nowhere near as good as the original Tomb Raider. You might be thinking that the Original Tomb Raider is overpriced but TRUST ME you are getting your money's worth. This game is way too easy and just doesn't have the same scope of the original tomb raider.I will still recommend tomb raider anniversary but you would be better off buying the original first if you haven't played it yet.P.S.I just realized that when using Texmod Steam doesn't track your playtime. I played all the way through to Saint Francis Folly just last night.			",93,4,0,8,11,0,6

												I'd like to start out saying that I have never played any of the Tomb Raider franchises. This is very completely new for me, and since my PC woudln't want to run the original games, I got stuck staring out with it's Anniversary remake. So until I get a Sony Playstation, here is my review~Story/Presentation: 7The story was really bland, to be honest. I wasn't looking anything too crazy like Indiana Jones style, but seeing as how popular Lara Croft is in the gaming community, I expected more of a good story to come out of this. If this was just fo the story, I would of given it a lower score, specially from it's awkward animation in the cutscenes. For it being an HQ remake, I expected a little bit more, it even makes the Twin Snakes remake of Metal Gear Solid look Amazing. But the reason it got a higher score was from it's gameplay atmosphere. The tombs themselves, the outdoor life, and even when she comes out of the water, her clothes actually look wet, and I personally thought that was impressive. Nothing out of this world, but it really is lovely to look at, even from it's time of release.Gameplay: 8Now the gameplay itself was a Lot of fun, I remember. I can see why people do like this game. It's no the story, it's the movement, and the puzzles within the game. It was told that old and new puzzles were made for this remake, and I thought they were all fun and challenging. Even Lara's movements are great in the game, with such manuevers like rolling, running, spinning while rolling, swinging, climbing, and my favorite, swan diving. The only issue I had was that sometimes when you jump and reach for something to hold unto, the game won't read it and makes you fall down and do it again. There were times when I would jump towards a rope and she woudln't even try to reach it and she'll just jump through it, and it irritated me a bit.Overall: 8It's not the best game in the world, but it's not bad, either. I had a lot of fun and memories with this game, and I personally can't wait to try out the original. It's short, it's fun, and I would recommend it for anybody who's a puzzle lover who doesn't mind a bit of shooting here and there.			",177,21,4,12,6,2,15

												Yes, this is a TRUE Tomb Raider game!If you are fond of TR Legend, or TR Underworld Anniversary may intimidate you with its significantly more challenging combat and puzzles epecially if you are not playing with a controller. If the original TR I II and III were your liking however, Anniversary is your game.PROS:- Beautiful, clean graphics. Game looks ""next-gen"" without suffering from the fps drop or freezes that haunted Legend.- Wonderful sound effects and background music.- Fluid, precise control that inspires confidence.- Varied locations, each with its unique settings.- Top notch cutscenes with lots of emotions of Lara showing her exact thoughts of the moment.- Its not a high demanding game. If you have an older laptop that is having trouble playing old games like Team Fortress 2 this will run way better. CONS:- Horrible checkpoint system. There is plenty of rooms in this game that you will spend 5-10 min that will restart if you die.- Hints are subpar for this game when it comes to puzzles; this leads to potential backtracking and wasted trips.- Old-fashioned, non-streamlined inventory system that requires arrow keys, TAB and Esc key to cycle through.- Random difficulty spikes in some of the levels make this game harder than other Tomb Raiders like TR Underworld.  - There are a couple of rare glitches that occur for some people that has Lara unable to grab a ledge that's needed to be grabbed to progress the story. You will have to exit out to start menu to fix. For a 2007 remake this game was immense fun and even great frustrations over 90's TR games, Anniversary delivers a truthful TR experience. It's challenging, but equally rewarding. Even if you already beat the original a handful of time back in the day I can still safely recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*No Spoilers Review*After playing for 14 hours and I still didn’t beat the game, but nearly there I felt like writing this review. First of all, I never really finish any other Tomb Raider game, so I dont really know if this one better or worse than the others games, with that said let me begin by saying this: Tomb Raider is like a woman mind that you like\love, you try your best to understand how it works, but you cant.. its frustrating! You love that woman, but you can’t take it no more. Its like you didn’t choose to love her, but to love her you have been chosen. Now lets get into it, STORY: The story is not that deep, but surly the places in the game are, for some reasons the atmosphere of the environment tells you more about the game than the scenario that was put in the story line. If you didnt  or even did play the original Tomb Raide, this is it just in HD. GAMEPLAY The gameplay surly better than the previous games, you can feel it, the new you era impacted Tomb Raider in a great way and it didn’t lose the flavor of Lara two-guns style adventurer puzzle game. One thing for sure, since I’m reviewing the PC version of this game I’d recommend playing with a controller! Seriously, its frustrating to play with\out one still, but its surly better than playing it with the keyboard I promise you!  Oh yes, did I mention that the game is frustrating?! I mean you try to do a single jump based on four to six jumps ahead, and that jump is so hard that you take a lot of time to get it right and when that happens!! When that happen you get that feeling of satisfaction “Ohhhh shiitt!!! I’ve done it! AT LAST!! AHHH!!” that’s basically why I kept playing for till this point (this review). GRAPHICS: As much as I don’t care about graphics, I do. In this game graphics plays a great job of showing you a great environment, not the best, but surly great.  I got to mention that, its always a good idea to take a look around you when in a new place. Additionally, there is Lara, she’s a beauty and she might be one of greatest reasons that anyone will play this game and I got to admit they did a great job fixing up her body! BOTTOM LINE: Should I think of playing this game? YES! Should I buy it? YES, its not that expensive and its great, it will surly keep you satisfied for a while.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												5 out of 10This game gets a thumbs up with an if.  A BIG IF.  If you have the patience of Buddha then you can consider playing this game.  Know that it will torment you to the point where you want to smash your pc to pieces.  This game could be used as a means of punishing criminals. This is a reboot of the first Tomb Raider, a true classic and a game I loved.  Obviously the graphics is much better.  The level layout and controls have also been updated. The good:1. This is a true Tomb Raider game where it is mostly about Lara vs the environment.  It's not like Tomb Raider 2013 where there is an enemy or ten behind every corner. 2. I am glad the levels have been redesigned.  It sort of works.  Maybe it is just memory but they do feel dumbed down a bit though.  3. Even though this game is some 7 years old the scenery looks really great.  Character models and textures are nothing like modern games though. 4. You can take selfies of Lara as she roams ancient locations. The Bad: 5. The controls.  The original Tomb Raider was genius with its minimalist controls.  The reboot does not emulate it unfortunately.  On the original you could jump forward, to one side, backwards and to the other side an infinite number of times and Lara would end up exactly where she started.  Forget about it with the reboot.  The introduction of the mouse changed a lot. 6. Related to the above point, in the original you could control Lara very accurately.  She'd jump when you press jump; do front and back somersaults at will; jump at exactly the end of ledge or slide.  No more.  You get used to ledges but slides are atrocious. 7. How difficult could it have been to keep an autosave that the player can load at will?  You have to manually save after each check point.  No matter where you save, you reload at the last checkpoint. The ugly: 8. The two major additions the game, the grapple and timed dodge and shoot are the worst though.  Even after completing the game I have no confidence that I can get any of these two right at will.  Lara's responses seems very random to the input you give.  The shoot dodge works ok if you face only one enemy but when there are more - good luck.  The grapple though is what really gets me. 9. It feels like the game developers thought how they can make the world a little worse place to live?  Hehehe... lets make a really nice game with a bug witch acts up randomly at critical times.  The grapple is perfect for this.  When the player press jump to side we make Lara jump perpendicular and vice versa but remember only at some random critical times. 10. The make matters worse the checkpoints seems to come just after a long sequence of activities punctuated with one of these random grapples at the end.  Possibly half of my game time was doing bits over and over and over again until Lara did what I instructed. 11. Lara's Mansion introduction mission.  I owned this game for many years but only now played it.  Each time I would start with the introduction and then stop playing because it would irritate the living daylights out of me. I recommend this game with big reservations.  After playing I think that if the developers took the original and only gave it a new coat the game would have been infinitely better. This game is 95% good and 5% bad.  A pity the 5% bad takes up 50% of your playtime.  Really consider playing the original in stead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well this reboot version of Lara's first adventure seems more better as well got more complex controls -- as well as solving more challenging cryptic clues and mysteries. I cannot argue much on this reboot game appart from the Lara's Home Stone Bow statue glitch. Buy this game if you prefer more crisp and smooth GFX over the first original game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lara Croft. The name itself brings to mind an internationally recognised archaeologist who is not known for her mind-blowing discoveries, but instead is known for her strong-will and no nonsense demeanour.Journey with Lara, on a life-changing quest to obtain the Scion, a mystic artifact that was said to be the downfall of Atlantis. Lara's abilities are really put to the test on this quest, with life-defining moments where moral will and survival are pitted against each other.The game is brilliant, never feeling too expansive to the point of getting lost, but neither feeling so tight and constricted that it's a one way passage. Puzzles are mind-bending, with some skill involved since they are usually coupled with hazardous jumps. Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a brilliant game for new and old Tomb Raider fans alike, with many having played the original and being pleasantly surprised at what Crystal Dynamics has done with the series.

												I cannot recommend this game via Steam. I really would but before you hit that dislike button, please hear me out.I have played this game before ever since it came out on PS2 when I was 10 years old. I played the almight s*** out of it, literally beat this game multiple times already. I loved it so much I even bought the PSP version when I couldn't play on my PS2 anymore.While I do recommend this game, I don't recommend this versions ""export"" of the game. I dislike the fact that people gave so little effort in fixing anything. Zero bug fixes ever since this was released in 2012. To this day, I cannot pick up shotgun ammo, hang onto walls without glitching out and having bats frail around on the ground with sound effects of a ramming truck. Surprisingly, the PSP export has had the same issues but I still managed to beat it.Aside from that. It's a beautiful and mesmerizing game of its sorts. This will always be my favorite game aside from The Last Revelation. I am not stating that you shouldn't buy it. Yes, the puzzles are challenging, but that's what it makes this game fun. It's a childhood classic and to me it will always be my favorite.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game was released in 2007 celebrating the 10th anniversary of the original Tomb Raider Game from 1996.When I write this review now, nearly another ten years have passed.I played through both games multiple times when they were released.Now, I did the same with Anniversary again (with all secrets and time trials) and I must recommend it even in 2017.Positive:+ Excellent platforming and riddles+ Very good atmosphere (excellent music and sound design, good graphics)+ Catches the tone of the original, but has also new ideas+ Good controls (supports XBox 360-Controller)+ Also runs quite nice on older PC'sNegative:- No Achievements (although available on PS3/XBox 360)- This is a relatively hard game (platforming, riddles)- Combat is ok, but not perfect- Characterdesign is a tiny bit too comic-style- Dated Game Engine/Grafics (but holds up pretty good)My rating: 8.5 out of 10 points.

												Tomb Raider: Anniversary is the 2007 ""remake"" of the 1996 original Tomb Raider. Crystal Dynamics, also notable for their Legacy of Kain series, decided that instead of a 1:1 graphical remake, they'd revamp the game from the bottom up for a modern perspective. This is the second time I've purchased and completed the game, the first time on the PS3.The general graphical and gameplay improvements are palpable. The game looks fantastic, while emulating the often iconic setpieces and level design of Tomb Raider perfectly. Gameplay was transformed from its own miniature tank-controlled nightmare to better-than-average third person shooter, with the RAGE-dodge mechanic actually managing to be legitimately fun. Also to note that the game is brilliantly optimized, and at notable times (several rooms in Greece and Egypt) runs better on my 1.8 Ghz laptop than it does on a PS3, with no notable slowdown.However, the ""modern perspective"" has brought with it some drawbacks. The ledge/rope hit detection is shoddy, with Lara having at times a 50/50 chance to recognise that she's collided with a ledge at all, as she proceeds to slide off it gently and gracefully to her death. This is compounded by the occasionally awful camera (which will actively decide not to show the platform you're aiming for), and when under a strict time limit or in an area that demands precise platforming, is infuriating.On a less technical note, there are two bosses that return as pure QTEs. Not even difficult inputs, just cutscenes with prompts. Subjective as this opinion may be, QTE bossfights are a disgusting blight on the industry and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth whenever I replay those parts. That these bosses were originally fully-fledged fights instead of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cutscenes makes it all the more sour.Aside from the respectively sized campaign, there is a sizeable amount of optional challenges. Relics - now individually modeled - and artifacts return, along with Time Trials. Time Trials now being challenging to the point that, even after beating them on the PS3, they require practice runs and multiple attempts; which makes them all the more satisfying to finally nab. There's overall not as many unlocks as, say, Tomb Raider: Legend, but the quality of the unlocks and the quantity of raw content more than make up for that. Anniversary supports gamepads - but it makes a fatal misstep that will probably lead to it being a major headache. Instead of taking advantage of the 360 degree input of analog sticks, it locks Lara's movement to eight directions. This means no minute changes to directional movement and involves a lot of frustrating jumping out into nothing. On top of that, it has a bad habit of not registering rapid-fire pistol shots - perhaps a productive of my low-spec computer, however.Tomb Raider: Anniversary isn't a perfect game, but it is a fantastic game. If you're looking for a platformer with level design that stands the test of time and has some pleasing fluid gameplay to boot, then Tomb Raider: Anniversary should be right up your alley.

												The game developed 10 years ago is still entertaining and challenging. There's no guides for you to jump or grab to reach your destination. Impressively, the game gives me a very strong feeling of reality. You have to stop and stand still to observe the environment to solve the puzzle or to find the way to get to somewhere. I love the feeling and it really excites me and urged me to continue playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												5 out of 10This game gets a thumbs up with an if.  A BIG IF.  If you have the patience of Buddha then you can consider playing this game.  Know that it will torment you to the point where you want to smash your pc to pieces.  This game could be used as a means of punishing criminals. This is a reboot of the first Tomb Raider, a true classic and a game I loved.  Obviously the graphics is much better.  The level layout and controls have also been updated. The good:1. This is a true Tomb Raider game where it is mostly about Lara vs the environment.  It's not like Tomb Raider 2013 where there is an enemy or ten behind every corner. 2. I am glad the levels have been redesigned.  It sort of works.  Maybe it is just memory but they do feel dumbed down a bit though.  3. Even though this game is some 7 years old the scenery looks really great.  Character models and textures are nothing like modern games though. 4. You can take selfies of Lara as she roams ancient locations. The Bad: 5. The controls.  The original Tomb Raider was genius with its minimalist controls.  The reboot does not emulate it unfortunately.  On the original you could jump forward, to one side, backwards and to the other side an infinite number of times and Lara would end up exactly where she started.  Forget about it with the reboot.  The introduction of the mouse changed a lot. 6. Related to the above point, in the original you could control Lara very accurately.  She'd jump when you press jump; do front and back somersaults at will; jump at exactly the end of ledge or slide.  No more.  You get used to ledges but slides are atrocious. 7. How difficult could it have been to keep an autosave that the player can load at will?  You have to manually save after each check point.  No matter where you save, you reload at the last checkpoint. The ugly: 8. The two major additions the game, the grapple and timed dodge and shoot are the worst though.  Even after completing the game I have no confidence that I can get any of these two right at will.  Lara's responses seems very random to the input you give.  The shoot dodge works ok if you face only one enemy but when there are more - good luck.  The grapple though is what really gets me. 9. It feels like the game developers thought how they can make the world a little worse place to live?  Hehehe... lets make a really nice game with a bug witch acts up randomly at critical times.  The grapple is perfect for this.  When the player press jump to side we make Lara jump perpendicular and vice versa but remember only at some random critical times. 10. The make matters worse the checkpoints seems to come just after a long sequence of activities punctuated with one of these random grapples at the end.  Possibly half of my game time was doing bits over and over and over again until Lara did what I instructed. 11. Lara's Mansion introduction mission.  I owned this game for many years but only now played it.  Each time I would start with the introduction and then stop playing because it would irritate the living daylights out of me. I recommend this game with big reservations.  After playing I think that if the developers took the original and only gave it a new coat the game would have been infinitely better. This game is 95% good and 5% bad.  A pity the 5% bad takes up 50% of your playtime.  Really consider playing the original in stead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game.Didn't played the original trilogy when released, but I got to say I liked this game.Its quite like a prince of persia 3D with guns instead of swords (a better done prince of persia in 3D, unlike sands of time)THe only negative about the game is that it has some glitches (nothing too big, but also easy to happen, specially when falling)Also, some areas are hard to manouver correctly with the grapling hook and cause a lot of deaths (some areas require you to just jump, while others require you to unhook, point the movement in the right direction, then jump, something you could only figure out if you watch someone else on youtube)Overall, a good experience specially for people that love exploration and finding secrets on each level.

												Hello people, so I see your looking at one of the many great Tomb Raider games! I, myself, have all the games and I am working on completing all of them. This one is a remake of the first one with alittle bit extra added, and I am glad they remade Lara because the first one was godly. Of course though, to all games there are pros and most definitly cons so lets jump right into that! PROS!!! The game has beautiful senery that you can get lost in which is a lovely touch. Going from a ruined city to a thick rain forest is amazing.The fighting in the game is simple and fun, having a feature to slow down time and jump over enemies and such is also an amazing aspect.The puzzles in this game are fantastic, from little contraptions to huge doors that have to be opened quickly and as you run for the door breathing hard.The climbing is great, you have a grappling hook, and of course your hands to go around the amazing senery and get to new places that could possibly hold relics and such. CONS!!! The AI can be a bit derpy, but I only ran into that maybe 1 or twice.This isnt really a con, but at some points I got confused where to go and fell and died alot at the same part.The game has some crazy plot twist that are hard to follow if your one of those people who skip every cutscene.So if I were to give with from a 0 to a 10 I'd give it a definite 9 because I love the Tomb Raider games and I love the art style to them. Of course the game has its bugs and issues like sometimes you might now be able to grapple and you fall, but it is always fun and never get bored or tired. Its also pretty fun to speed through and collect all the costumes. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I grew up on Tomb Raider, it was probably one of the first games I ever actually played from start to finish. Back in 2006 when this game came out I did not hesitate to get it, the same happened ten years later when it went on sale.I was a bit cautious at first as I couldn't exactly remember what the game was like on the PS2 and what with all the negative reviews regarding camera angles and controls, I was scared this was going to be a terrible port.Having completed the game, story wise that is, I can say that, yes whilst the camera angles are sometimes terrible, I can't deny that I've actually had SO much fun with this game.Pros: The Soundtrack is actually in this oneCombat is fast and tense in some cases, especially on smaller platforms in later levelsLong but not at all tedious puzzlesAtmosphere is pretty damn good for a game that's roughly a decade oldGraphics ain't too bad either, few bits of clipping here and there but nothing major.Some boss battles are Brilliant!Some redesigns of enemies made them signifcantly cooler without them feeling too different (Centaurs, Pierre, Larson)Replayability through difficulties, timed runs and searching for artifacts and relics.Dangerous areas and climbing puzzles lead to tense jumps a sense of urgency (Saw Blade traps in Egypt)Cons:The Grapple becomes necessary to pass levels and the controls for which can actually be very difficultSome of the later levels don't look or even resemble the original levels in Tomb Raider 1 (1996) (Lost Island Levels)Some of the puzzles were altered and in the case of St. Francis' Folly, a complete different direction has to be taken to get to a certain area, removing the nostalgia of the level.The Boss A.I can be freaking awful (T-Rex and Torso Boss getting stuck on a corner)Some of the redesigns of enemies cause them to look completely different (Mummies, Mutants and Flying Mutants)The Second to last level causing me to have a brain haemorrage because of the jumping platforms and grapple hooks ffs.Bugs regarding ledges and combatI mean the grappling is a serious issue in the game and so can the camera angles. Controls are odd to start with but by the fourth level you will have already pretty much gotten the hang of them. The cheats you unlock later on for completing time trials make the game both easier and a lot more fun. If you're in it for the story or the nostalgia then get it, but don't expect too much from it if you've not played Tomb Raider before, as a matter of fact, if you HAVEN'T played Tomb Raider before, give the first game a go, then you might be able to appreciate the work put into this version of it.From the time racked up on PS2 and on steam, this game is defo worth at least a gander at.

												I actually really like the remake.I'm prepared to conceed there is probably an element of nostalgia here, but I think this is a really fine effort. Graphically with all the options maxed it actually looks pretty good given the era (I think actually it is an excellent example of how solid sound and level design can help a game hold up over time even after the graphics tech has aged - you can still get that 'ah' feeling when you come out of a claustraphobic tunnel into an open and complex area).But the other thing I notice playing this title is what an excellent 3d puzzle platform the old Tomb Raider games were. The control is accurate enough that you can do precision maneouvers cleanly and without glitch frustration, and the puzzles are genuinely enjoyable, pitched at pretty much the right level - not so hard you give up, but difficult enough you can experience a feeling of achievement when you figure something out.Unlike some I quite enjoy the new version of TR also - I enjoy story-heavy gaming and I like bleeding-edge graphics so I'm all there. But the original TR games really were there own thing, something that was clear from sales at the time presumably but is even mroe apparent I feel with the passage of time. I really can't think of many other 'puzzle platformer' titles which worked so successfuly in 3d. (Most 3d puzzle platform games are glitchy horrors.)Atmosphere, puzzles, enough story to keep you engaged, plenty of Raiders of the Lost Ark tropes, really clean control. I'm kind of surprised how much I am enjoying playing Anniversary.Well done those who did the rerelease of this classic title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anniversary is a remake to the original Tomb Raider retooled to be connected with the Legend game. Making this a prequal to that story. The game has the same control scheme as the Legend game along with slightly updated graphics. All of the locations and enemies from the original are all present except with more detail and more cinematic cut scenes. There is more dialoge along with tons of bonus material to unlock such as costumes from the older games for Lara to wear. Not as many outfits as Legend had but the replay value to this game makes it worth while. The added elements to the plot helped made this game not be a carbon copy of the original. The original will forever be a classic, though it is great to see a revised version of the game that started the franchise. With hours of gameplay to endure, any Tomb Raider fan will enjoy this game as much if not more than the original game. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy exploring and solving puzzles, you'll enjoy Tomb Raider. It feels old in a good way, nostalgic and not dated. I wouldn't call it a must-play, but it's definitely fun. I had never played the original Tomb Raider, so this is a good way to experience how the series got started without having to worry about MS-DOS compatibility. Plus, since I'd never played the original, I wasn't expecting the EPIC T-REX BOSS BATTLE. Kickass.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/09/tomb-raider-anniversary.html ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is hands down one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played, and I enjoyed myself through the whole game. Having never played a Tomb Raider game before, this was a very pleasant surprise to me.Now I’ll actually tell you about the game. As you probably know, you’ll be playing as Lara Croft, a British archaeologist (and parkour master) who wields two pistols and swings on a grappling hook. The gameplay itself reminds me very heavily of the 3D Legend of Zelda games (Twilight Princess in particular) in that it’s all about solving puzzles, activating switches, fighting enemies, and discovering secret areas to finish levels and move on.Since this game is a remake of the original 1996 Tomb Raider, it shares the same story and environments with that game. However, although locations may look similar, the levels have been completely redesigned and are much different than the original, often involving much more puzzle-solving and combat with enemies than before.Controlling Lara can be a bit cumbersome for you at first as the controls and camera take some time to get used to, but after you play for an hour or so it becomes very simple. The controls are greatly improved from the 1996 original, and it feels much more natural controlling Lara without the tank controls present in the original game. Now WASD actually moves Lara in the direction you press, and the mouse freely controls the camera.The graphics are stunning for a 2007 game – the animated cut-scenes that play at some points during the adventure are very nicely rendered, the environments are extremely detailed, and the in-game models of Lara, enemies, and other characters all look great. There are, however, some minor problems with shadow casting, and Lara can on occasion appear to be floating due to wonky collision boxes on some objects, but these are largely ignorable.All in all, Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a wonderful game, and a great title to start with if you’re looking to get into the Tomb Raider franchise. Anyone who has either played the 1996 original or is brand-new to the series should definitely give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does the original Tomb Raider game justice. Controller support is fine, only issue is that all of the hints about controls are in reference to the keyboard so playing with a controller means you are pretty much going in blind. Otherwise it's a good game. Great remake of the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm just getting into PC gaming, I'm playing on a general use laptop so my gaming capabilities are limited until i can get a better setup. Im already in love with the specials section of the steam store, i got this gem of a game for less than $3. I remember playing the original Tomb Raider back on PSOne and when TR: Anniversary was originally announced, I was excited. Its been roughly 10 years since i first played TR: Anniversary, so playng this again is a serious nostalgia trip for me. I'm also glad i found this game for cheap so i have a jumping off point into PC gaming, im still getting used to a keyboard and mouse but this game is just as amazing as i remember it to be, minus the poor camera controls of controllers.

												Anniversary is a remake to the original Tomb Raider retooled to be connected with the Legend game. Making this a prequal to that story. The game has the same control scheme as the Legend game along with slightly updated graphics. All of the locations and enemies from the original are all present except with more detail and more cinematic cut scenes. There is more dialoge along with tons of bonus material to unlock such as costumes from the older games for Lara to wear. Not as many outfits as Legend had but the replay value to this game makes it worth while. The added elements to the plot helped made this game not be a carbon copy of the original. The original will forever be a classic, though it is great to see a revised version of the game that started the franchise. With hours of gameplay to endure, any Tomb Raider fan will enjoy this game as much if not more than the original game. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased the boxed version back when it was released and decided to give this another belt through upon learning that  Anniversary, Legend and Underworld are all part of its own trilogy that expands and condenses the Tomb raider franchise. So first things first, Graphics, cause I mean c'mon, first thing you notice in a game is looks. Still impresses me, though the textures are looking a bit muddy by todays standards. Sound is great, weapons sound like they feel...if you know what I mean. Gameplay, much more streamlined and easier to control than the original Tomb raider, quicker movements, faster action etc. As a whole, I remember the original TR to be a little longer, maybe it was just me taking my sweet time but I feel that this version is a little more diluted and quicker paced. I've just reached egypt and I'm about 9 hours in through the main game. Anyways, great game if you are new to TR or an old hat to the franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a faithful remake of the original Tomb Raider. The graphics are pretty true to the visual style of the series while also bringing them up to date with the current generation of gaming. Gameplay, however, remains an archaic throwback to a much simpler time. There is very little plot to speak of in this installment (most characters are developed only in the unlockable extras you read after finishing the game) and dialog is few and far between. There are some excellent platforming elements here, but some can be absolutely frustrating due to the uncontrollable camera and loose movement controls. Despite the short length of the game, many platforming sequences and puzzles are repeated with only minor variations. There is very little combat in the game until the final chapter, but that's to be expected. If you've never played a Tomb Raider game before, this isn't a bad place to start. If you're a veteran, the nostalgia along with a few surprises here and there will satisfy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In Anniversary you will visit a variety of beautiful locations from Greece to Egypt, fight all manner of beast from lowly rats to a gigantic T-rex and solve slew of deadly and complex puzzles within these trap ridden tombs. This is how tomb raiding should be and is what made the fanchise as popular as it is today!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great reimagining of the original - smooth controls, immersive environments, tons of content for its price. Only small complaint is the checkpoint system as it sometimes forces you to replay 20-30 seconds of a level over and over again just so you can retry a single tricky jump, but other than that it's fantastic.

												I agree with almost everything what has been said. If you like solving puzzles, this one's for you. I have to say that some of the monsters definately scared me, because they always come out of nowhere (I'm scared very easily though). Despite the remake of this classic has the game some flaws:- The difference between a jumpingledge and a regular ledge isn't always clear.- Sometimes you have to try a jump multiple times because the difference between her grabbing something and falling is small.  I've had multiple occasions where Lara jumped right through pillars, while the next time she'd grab it.This will make the puzzle-solving harder, but it could also be annoying. I still like the game though, but I wouldn't play it for 2/3 hours straight. If you're looking for die-hard shooting I would recommend another game, eventhough there are definately some action-scenes. If you like solving puzzles with some action: Pick this game!I would give this game a 7- out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy exploring and solving puzzles, you'll enjoy Tomb Raider. It feels old in a good way, nostalgic and not dated. I wouldn't call it a must-play, but it's definitely fun. I had never played the original Tomb Raider, so this is a good way to experience how the series got started without having to worry about MS-DOS compatibility. Plus, since I'd never played the original, I wasn't expecting the EPIC T-REX BOSS BATTLE. Kickass.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/09/tomb-raider-anniversary.html ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a good idea to revamp the original title but I still wouldn't say it was a perfect one. The begining was pretty easy but as you go to the later levels it wasn't that the puzzles were hard, its that the usual horrible tomb raider camera angles with frustrating platforming that can really suck the fun out of you, expecially in a few areas. The combat wasn't bad though the boss fights forced you to use different tactics to win which kinda sucks. The game isn't bad but its a shame they didn't just revamp all the old tomb raiders instead of just this one. Still it is fun and I'm glad that the new tomb raider is such a fantastic franchise now. I don't know if I can stomach to play the really old tomb raiders from 2-7 but we'll see what happens. Maybe, just maybe I'll get a hankering to playing them. Until then, I would say this game is decent but not extremely great unless your into such things.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was but a wee lad when the Original Tomb Raider came out. I remember watching my brothers play it.Though when it finally came my turn, I couldn't get around the clunky controls.This game fixes that issue. While it is not flawless, the flow of control (Xbox360 Wired Controller) the game is much smoother. The Graphics are nice, the music and atomosphere is great. The game all round was a delight to play.There are a number of cheap deaths due to glitches where you can grab a ledge or simply go through it at times. But those minor issues aside. I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anyone interested in some old school adventure puzzle platforming with a newage graphical revamp.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This remake/update is a very nice mixture of atmosphere, gameplay, sound design, and fun.  If the original Tomb Raider was anything to shout about, this is certainly worth enjoying as it is a refinement in every area.  It fits a description for ""game"" that few do   Puzzles, gunplay, platforming, exploring, hidden items, mystery, surprises, replay vaiue - it's got it all, and while not perfect it is most certainly the product of care and effort that shines through all elements.

												Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a classic TR game with a new graphics sheen. In my mind, it's a huge step up from Legend. It's a remake of the first game, but it makes some great changes throughout. Most of the maps are more interesting, the environments are opened up and there's a bit less of the endless stone corridors of the first one.Unfortunately, the combat is not so great. The ""power dodge"" maneuver adds a bit of interest, but combat mostly feels like a chore. The controls can be a bit clunky, however. The puzzles are great, however, and are the main reason I played the game. Stuff like the Atlas-Poseidon-Damocles-Haphaestus puzzle are really rewarding to work out.All said,  if you enjoy the old-school style of Tomb Raider play, you owe it to yourself to get Anniversary.

I did play this game years ago, I think maybe on wii or PS3.Only issue is the the screen prompts are for keyboard only and would prefer to show Xbox 360 game pad when plugged in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Понравилось то что в игре можна проходить помимо основных миссий еще и само ""поместье Крофт"" в котором нужно собрать определенные артефакты и реликвии а так же отгадать некоторое секреты,Так как я фанат данной игры, то рекомендую всем попробывать в нее поиграть. Удачи в прохождении. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is only a slight improvement over legend. It’s still a very average game but unlike legend this game has some aspects to it that I think are intriguing. The fact that it’s a remake to the original makes it interesting in the first place because if you have played the original you are constantly going to be making comparisons between them and seeing what they changed and what they kept the same and there is some fun in doing that. The way the levels are laid out is quite clever but they are not necessarily fun to play through mainly because the visuals are very basic and repetitive. The shooting is the same as legend which I didn’t like, the slow motion dodging head shot mechanic that they added didn’t do anything to improve or add to the shooting in my opinion. The platforming was slightly more fun than legend mainly because of the way the levels are set up, it gave a bit of Prince of Persia feel to it which is always a good thing. Avoiding traps was probably the highlight of the game. Very simplistic story it didn’t really add anything to the experience it’s very minimal and forgettable. I didn’t have much fun playing this game, the moments where I did have fun were too few and far between. There isn’t any good story, good music during gameplay or set pieces to pull you through the game without getting bored. The second half of this game is unbelievably boring, it picks up a bit towards the end but before then, it’s like they threw all their creative ideas in the first half and the second half was an afterthought. A lot of the levels in the second half are very open and empty, feeling lifeless and depressing. The first four chapters are really great I wish the whole game was just as good and judging from a lot of the positive steam reviews of this game, people only played those first 2 great hours of the game and then stopped and decided to review the game before finishing it which is a pet peeve of mine.  It was a choir to play through. 5/10 (Average) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was only a wee little kid when I last played this (on the PS1).I really had to rack my brain to remember anything.The new look threw me off a lot.I have to be honest and say that I spent a great deal of time googling and checking out Wiki articles to double-check it was in fact the same game I played ages ago.It really felt like a new(ish) game.It definitely is better than the original with the updated engine.Only fragments of the game are there in my memory.I do remember feeling that same old excitement you have for entering new areas to solve the new puzzles.By the time I had to stop playing, it was well into the next morning when I realized how much time went by and how much sleep I lost revisiting this gem.I would love to see the next 2 TR games remastered in this fashion.I remember having played 2 more than 1 (as we lost the disc to 1).

												As good as the pervious installment, this game is a remake of Tomb Raider I, the actual first Tomb Raider game in the series. The only thing that is interesting is that the developers edit the levels and combine parts of a level from Tomb Raider I to make the puzzles short, and replaces ""fetch"" objectives with platforming. So players that beat Tomb Raider I will recognize certain parts of the level and already know what to do. This doesn't mean you will finish the game fast, it still different than the Tomb Raider I, just a bit shorter since it is easier. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some remakes feel utterly unnecessary.Then there's Tomb Raider: Anniversary - a perfect example of why remakes should happen.Have you played the original Tomb Raider recently?It doesn't hold up well. It has aged terribly.The graphics are laughably blocky (let's face it, even for its time, Tomb Raider wasn't pretty) and we've got those terrible, muddy, low-res textures... but beyond the superficial cosmetic stuff, there's the unrefined gameplay and ESPECIALLY shoddy controls.If you want the authentic retro experience, you can get the original here on Steam...As a series continues, it is refined. The developers get a handle on what was good; what worked; what didn't... they can learn and grow.Tomb Raider: Anniversary is putting the lessons you've learned over time into practice and fixing your mistakes.Tomb Raider: Anniversary is the original, only better in every way.Visually improved, of course, but VASTLY superior mechanically, and with respect to the controls.What hasn't changed, is Lara's bizarre choice of a tank top and short-shorts for a snowy expedition.I'll accept that she wants to wear that for manoeuvrability, fashion, and/or for hot weather. There's nothing wrong with that. But good gods is it inappropriate for a bloody blizzard!So, poor Lara is sexualised and objectified, but she is still one of gaming's most badass leading ladies; basically ""lady Indiana Jones,"" which is probably one of the most awesome things ever.If you're looking to experience the franchise's story, this is going to be a better entry-point than the PS1-era classic.

												This game is a remake of the original Tomb Raider game from 1996, and it is also the best in the new series of games by Crystal Dynamics. It takes the core ideas from the original and updates them to behave like a modern 3d game should, but without losing the original feel and focus of the original. If you like your TR with giant multi-stage puzzles, a sense of isolation, harsh platforming and animal killing then this is the game you want. Crystal stayed pretty true to the source material while using the newer technology to update it in smart ways, like making areas that should have been big (such as the Colleseum) actually big. Memorable levels like St Francis Folly are back, but now the scale matches how they actually felt to complete the first time. The music is great and it has my favorite Croft Manor level in the series. Overall an amazing remake and one of the textbook examples of how to update a classic while still retaining what made it unique and interesting.For me this is tied with the Resident Evil remake for the Gamecube as best remake.

												If you can get over the game-breaking bugs, the terrible and incredibly touchy controls (the HORRIBLE ROPE SWINGING sections), and the outdated graphics and animation, the gameplay loop is actually pretty fun. The puzzles are all decent, but traversing (when the controls aren't working against you) is the real star here. When you nail a segment of really quickly timed jumps, the feeling is awesome. The story is throwaway and mostly uninteresting, but I still found enough fun in this game to mostly recommend it. There were still huge sections of the game where I thought I might have an emotional breakdown with how bad the controls are and what the game is demanding of you. If you go into the game expecting the worst and are okay with that, give this a go and you'll probably enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												pros: runs stable on win7, graphically updated to a higher standard than the original, varied environments, soundtrack fits the theme, some puzzles are very well designed, exponentially better boobs on Lara compared to the originalcons: clunky movement and controls, derpy camera angles, combat is basic and repetative, unable to scroll multiple targets when aiming, quick-time-events during cut scenes, bosses are tedious to fight (they always require bullet time), I found the fog/dust and blur effects disruptive, storyline and ending is dullOverall, this is an updated game to the first and classic Tomb Raider 1 (not to be confused with the lame 2013 title), and does deserve some attention from where the genre had its beginings. The general consensus seems to be that TB: Anniversary did the original TR1 justice - although I personally didn't play the original to completion, I would have to agree with the consensus from what ive played.Tomb Raider: Anniversary has my recommendation.

												great game, I loved the original, wanted to love the remake but I can not recommend it based on my experience. This is clearly a bad port with a ton of bugs and glitches. First ones appear in the battle with the T-Rex which got stuck in the graphics about 90% of the time. Then as the game progresses the glitches appear more frequently. The penultimate one took me about 2 hours to solve after searching a lot in the internet. The latest one seems to be game-breaking: a ledge can not be reached as it is blocked by another one which is not supposed to be there. After spending so much time with the bugs I am not willing to start again the level (without having a clue whether the bug will be fixed or not, a suggestion in the forum on the same bug proposes to use another PC, unbelievable...). Very bad, as the level design is awesome and the setting is bigger-than-life. But the bugs make the game unplayable for me. Too pity that the companies show no respect to the customers by practically eliminating the beta testing...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Story is a little bit flat (probably the worst in the TRL/TRA/TRU trilogy), but it doesn't mean you won't have a lot of fun. I know I did. Also, there are a lot of extras in the game, and Croft Manor that was present in TRL is still here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short review, based on approx. 36h playing TR:Anniversary (100% mastered)[Personal setup: never played TR:1 (on wich TR:Anniversary is based on) or another TR-release before, except for the latest release ""Tomb Raider"". Got lots of pleasant anticipation. Don't do Jump'n'Run games generally. I like trying to ""master"" games if they're fun, regarding the game-content as well as skill]- Nice graphics (as for the releasedate of the game) and superb leveldesign- Nice soundtrack- Smooth animation of the acrobatics and great variety of possible movements- Laras facial expressions and body language are decent- Very smooth gameplay; exceptions:-- The annoying moment when Lara got hit by enemies-- The autoaim when confronted by multiple enemies- Wide range of challenges and difficulties- Up to 30-40h fun (or temporary rage) with the game, depending on how much time you spend with collecting artifacts/relics or solving puzzles, or wether you do the time trials- Ridiculous story and characters. The storyline is utterly nonsense, but does not impact the gameplay. The cut scenes therefore are structuring the chapters and procure orientation- Quick time events are one nice feature- Lots of (more or less interesting) bonus content (such as drafts, soundtracks, char-bios, outfits)Conclusion: HIGHLY recommended for ambitious players.

												Best ""Tomb Raider"" of the new generation.If I was to decsribe this game then the first sentence would be it. It's true to the original format and idea of the game, has some very well made graphics and design that will not kill your computer, has puzzles that are in fact challenging and has nice hard to find secrets for the completionists. The story and cutscenes are made fun to watch and the game provides extra details like developer commentary and a little note to the fans. If your a fan from the first Tomb Raider then you will love this game and will enjoy some nostalgia. Likewise, if your new to the series this is the game I would recommend you start off with. The game will allow you to see the original idea and design in all its glory so if you enjoy it you can decided if this is a series you would like to play more.Keep in mind for new players, this is a puzzle game first and foremost, the combat and bosses can be enjoyable but this is not the main attraction of the game.

												This game is next in the series after Tomb Raider Legend. As such, I played Legend first and it was a good game. This game, however, has many more problems, some of which are literally game-breaking.For starters, the story is not made as clear as in Legend. I knew why Lara was doing things and there were enough cutscenes to keep me filled in. In Anniversary though, the cutscenes are few, and they are far-between. The main reason you should not get this game is the following: while the puzzles and parkour are much more difficult and challenging (not a bad thing), the game is WAY more picky about exactly when you hit the button, exactly where you are standing, small things like that that seem like not a big deal until you are browsing youtube for tutorials because you think you're just doing it wrong and find out you've been doing it right the whole time, its the game not letting you drag the block, or grab with your grappeling hook, or just simple things like that that wreck the game when they don't work, even after restarting the game, reloading the level, restarting the computer. Its like they released it without making sure small things like that still worked and when they don't, the game is literally broken and you can't continue even though you're doing what you are supposed to be doing.

												Do you remember the blocky original of the early PSX era?Well this version relives the glory days and at least Laras breasts are not triangles LOL XD.This game is ideal for the die hard TR fan who wants to remember the PSX version and make his/her own comparisons. Personally speaking I prefer this game to any other TR title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In some ways it is a decent game, but as I progressed, it became unplayable for me.It started off ok, but as the puzzles and boss fights got harder, they got more tedious, and the controls got more frustrating. After a while the puzzles feel repetitive (but this is largely a question of personal taste). 95% of the game is pure puzzle platforming (so you should only play this if you really like that sort of gameplay). My playthrough broke down to frustrating trial and error at times. I found the keyboard/mouse controls difficult and at times inconsistent and unresponsive - Maybe it plays better on a console. I got stuck on some of the platforming and boss fights, so I had to look up the solutions online. I'm not a noob, but better hints and tutorials would have been helpful for me. It is also a pity there is no manual save system, and that the save checkpoints are not very forgiving - they were often far away from the part I struggled with, meaning I had to redo a lot after failing a sequence. Also, you have to manually “save” the checkpoint, otherwise, if you quit/reload, you lose all progress since the beginning of the game. Dare I say it, but this game may be too “hardcore” for me (even though I usually don't like it when games are dumbed down). While the experience was too frustrating for me, this is quite a good game within its specific genre.If you like difficult platforming and old-school boss fights, you may like this game. Otherwise, there are simply too many flaws, so I sadly cannot recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this game. It is a huge upgrade from the original Tomb Raider, but it still suffers significant camera issues.  Often you will find yourself unable to figure out where to go without dying a few times just to find a platform to jump to which isn't right if the game doesn't have a quick save function.  The game suffers from clipping issues where you will find yourself jumping onto a ledge but you failed the jump and the character is stuck in a few pixels and she is in a state of constant falling but you can't jump or move because she is stuck and you have to wait for her to fall and die.  On top of that, the game suffers from terrible mechanics (or unresponsiveness to commands) where you are hanging off a cliff or ledge and there is only 1 direction to jump to and the character chooses to jump to another direction and ultimately failing the jump.  It is such a pet peeve for me that a game with such terrible mechanics dares to have time trials to make this game a challenge when the mechanics itself are the challenge.  A lot of the times the jumps are basically how lucky you are as a few pixels off and you're falling off a ledge.  The grapple-wall-running jump is the worst thing ever in this game.  The camera angle is constantly changing while you run along the wall and instead of a left right motion, you have to go from left to up and then down to right to gain maximum swing momemtum but when you jump at the end the direction you are pressing can impact the jump to forward or outwards, even though you have one direction you want the jump to (other direction will result death).  However, at the same time, these directions are inconsistent where sometimes you will jump outwards or forward with the same direction pressed.  This game needs a 3rd remake.  Honestly, people who rated this game positively has likely never finished the game (low game play time) or had tremendous luck getting those jumps.  This game has nice graphics and an interesting story for it's age but it did not age well with mechanics.  It is like old school 3d final fantasy games with broken camera angles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is fun and very challenging at certain stages. So if you can look past the bugs, this is a must have. 7/10Note: After playing this for several more hours the bugs have become an absolute joke to the point where i can't play it anymore, this is a joke and i hate to say this as Tomb raider is one of my favourite franchises ever. I can't belive how broken this game is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple review; if you like Tomb Raider, then this is the best Tomb Raider. All the environments and puzzles of the original game in a HD environment with modern controls and combat systems. The QTEs are a bit tacky, but sparingly used so not an issue. Great soundtrack, great level design, great game. Runs at 60+FPS on even the crappiest of computers, and like all non-Core Design games, best played with a controller (of which it has full support for the X360 controller/xinput).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  TL;DR  : A good Tomb Raider game overall (from what I've played, knowing 2 chapters), but this game is way too buggy to be played on PC. I don't know if it's better on console but I really don't recommand buying it on steam.   Story / SettingTomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the first Tomb Raider game, the story is absolutely the same, but they did a good job at creating a game that is very influenced by the first one but not exactly the same with better graphics. I didn't finish the game but the story is really typical for a Tomb Raider game.GameplayFirst of all: the reason I don't recommand it. The ennemies and certain parts of levels are simply not playable, its just too buggy. Most ennemies get stuck and there's not any challenge, I got to a point at a boss fight were all I had to do was shoot at it and wait for it to die. Some of the game mechanics are also very buggy, I often see through the textures and I couldn't access some areas. There's also this: http://i.imgur.com/Zg331C4.jpg . Which is pretty funny but became a bit annoying :p Except that, it's overall a good Tomb Raider game, pretty classic. It's really something between the very first Tomb Raiders and Tomb Raider Legend. As far as I played, the puzzles and secrets were too easy, especially compared to early Tomb Raider games and TR Legend, but hopefully they become more difficult later. PerformanceRunned at very high fps on max settings (i5 4690 / R9 390) Style / Graphics It really looks like TR Legend, with obviously a TR1 inspiration for Lara and the levels. A good looking game.

Posted: March 3, 2016
												My experience has been that the real challenge of the game is the bugs. I think it'd been a lovely game, if it wasn't so buggy in every aspect, which is surprising considering just how few mechanics there are to use in the game.AI bugs involve just shooting at the first boss for 20 minutes, because he's just stuck doing his walking animation in the same spot unable to attack or move. The same goes for some of the 8-10 total different kinds of enemy creatures(this is not an exaggeration) in the game.There's also annoying glitches, where trying to run over the edge of a ledge to hang from it ends with Lara just spassing out as she slowly falls further and further until she suddenly drops to her death.The checkpoint system is also pretty poorly implemented in my opinion. A lot of the puzzles are so millimeter precise, for example in terms of jumping, that you often have to redo them all the way through, because you end up falling to your death. Once you respawn, you have to watch every single cinematic again that might be involved in the puzzles, which gets really tiresome. Besides of how strict the puzzles are, you sometimes end up doubting, if you're doing the right thing, until you finally get it right.I've also encountered bugs, where I had no choice but to reload an earlier save. For example at the beginning of the Egypt chapter, where no matter where and how I grappled the rocks you're supposed to pull down, they just wouldn't fall down.As I said, if it wasn't for the incredibly, incredibly buggy, frustrating gameplay, I think it would've been an okay game. The story is extremely sparse. Considering there are only 4(?) chapters in the game, and you just skip straight from chapter 2 to 3 with no storytelling in between, it seems like the story didn't take the highest priority.The best thing I can say about the game is that it has some beautifully looking levels, but that's about the only good thing I can say. I've never written a review for a game before, but this feels like a product that should still be thoroughly tested. There are such few mechanics and types of enemies in the game, and considering this is an anniversary edition, I'm really, really surprised that two of the biggest aspects in the game are so buggy that I encounter these abovementioned things at what I'd guesstimate to be half the puzzles, and a fifth of the enemies.

												Nice platformer with weak fighting parts, that has aged very well in the last 8 Years, but has frustrating problems by design or glitches.Sometimes I gave up only to find out from some LP videos, that I already tried the correct solution (many times).I remember one simple 90 degree jump from a ledge to a platform that never worked because a small nose left and right of the platform (where it was attached to the wall) prevented Lara from reaching the platform ( worked for me when jumping while also pressing the right camera stick to look at the platform). There is one ring on the top of a wooden ramp (that looks like a door while closed) that cannot be targeted with the hook unless you switch to manual targeting (""R3"" on Gamepad). There are two rooms where you have to lift four columns - I think one of the rooms cannot be finished when you go down too early without lifting the first column on your way down.I had general problems jumping backwards from a swinging rope or Lara missing the tip of columns as targets.Near the end there are some jump combos for which you have to know how to do fast combos while a countdown is running and you have to be ready to try it dozens of times even knowing the correct solution.When I wanted to continue after the ""Lost Valley"" my savegame started in ""Lost Valley"" again and I hadn't collected any of the three cogs. Luckily I had a manual save.To survive later boss fights you need to know how to perform the ""Adrenaline Dodge"" action and it requires some timing skills. The last boss teases you that you will run out of ammo eventually. As you have unlimited ammo that isn't true, but you might run out of med-packs if you try to win by ""adrenaline dodging"" left or right.The game is okay for the low price and if you are happy only looking into it for a few hours.

												I just finished this game and it is probably the most frustrating game I have ever played. Controls and especially camera control is very unpredictable so in many jumps Lara just jumps in WTF directions you would never expect. That with combination with the possibility to save the game only at predefined checkpoints, which are quite poorly chosen lots of times, makes a receipt for many repetitive tries where you have to go trough a long pasage of jumps just to try your luck at a difficult one. And when I write luck, I mean it, the game is full of bugs, where sometimes under some circumstances (such as particular resolution settings) you just can't make it. Some situations are also very unpredictable, because the length of the jumps varies at different places, so you can't be sure, if Lara will make it. On the other hand sometimes you ignore a place because you are ""sure"" that she can't make it that far, but if you watch a walktrough - yay, that was the solution!All of the above could be forgiven if the plot and the puzzles were really good, but neither is IMO. The puzzles are really repetitive and because of the mechanics, controls and bugs really annoying. There are only two or three really original puzzles which I ejoyed. Boss fights are really boring as well, once you figure out, how to defeat someone, there is always a phase, where you have to repeat the moves dozen of times, before it is finished.In conlusion as I wrote In the first sentence, this is a really frustrating game with almost no fun aspects. The only possitive thing I can say about this is that some of the locations are really pretty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: - Great looking game. Laura character model is fantastic looking and the scenery is good as well.- Sounds are also quite good. - Puzzles are challenging but (mostly) possible (except one).- Runs decently. A huge improvement from Legends.Cons:- Can't alt-tab. Isn't a big issue for most but since I streamed the game, it's a huge concern. Alt-tabbing will cause the game to black out and not reload.- Camera angles. Camera can sometimes zoom in too close to Laura basically obscuring the scenary around Laura. The camera can also be quite restrictive while doing jumping puzzles, basically meaning you can't see the ledge that you need to jump to. The movement can also fail to coordinate with the camera, causing you to move in an unintended direction. While this is largely limited to wall puzzles again, this game also has a lot of timed puzzles, so wasting time trying to re-coordinate your orientation generally ends with dissappointing results.- Fixed animations. A lot of actions result in going through a short animation of a couple of seconds. Some of these a useful as they are a visual cue for things; the turning animation for wall running is the point where you are supposed to reverse jump for example. However, most tend to cause unintended consequences with interactions with other elements of the game. Getting knocked down is an understandable consequence for some attacks, but enemies' attacks are not timed according to those animations, meaning you can get hit multiple times while trying to recover, or worst, get knocked back again and wait another cycle to recover. Another annoying animation is the animation of holstering weapons after activating buttons with countdowns which can cost 2 seconds of your time before you regain control of the camera and proper movement. At the later levels, uneven textures, like walls in the cave, completely mess up the turning animation.- Jumping movement is inconsistent and glitchy. Doing the same jumps at the same spot can yield inconsistent results. At times, if you just happen to be at the wrong spot, your jump can go off in a random direction, except the direction that you intended of course. Because a lot of paths are scripted, a lot of jumps can also fail simply because you are not in the right spot to trigger Laura to catch the ledge/object. On occasion, she may decided not to jump at all despite you pressing and holding the jump key.The sliding slopes can also glitch out on you, starting the jump animation to make you think to jump only for Laura to stagger and just slide straight off. - Combat. Combat is like Legends (iirc), mainly lock-on but with manual aim for some instances. Now while the combat in Legends had issues, with basic enemies, it sufficed. Anniversary has a) significantly more flying enemies b) mainly melee enemies. The combat system in this game does not allow for much manual control on the move meaning you're completely at the mercy of the auto-targeting. The camera can't be moved manually as well and also has a very low ceiling. So basically the only way to properly switch targets is to untarget, wait for the holster animation to finish and hope to isolate the intended enemy in your view as you retarget. Also, it can auto-retarget at random.Another part of the combat is the slow-motion sequences where you need to initiate a dodge to get a targeting sequence. At times, the dodge won't work and or the aiming sequence won't trigger. There are also times, the camera angle can also deface causing you to be unable to see the aiming sequence occuring. You can also get attacked by other enemies in this sequence, which can cancel the sequence or make it impossible to react to an attack.For a game that requires precise timings in a lot of actions, it is both clunky as well as forces control away from the player in a lot of circumstances, this results in a poor gameplay experience overall. For a game where I enjoyed for about 60% of time, this quickly dissipated once more and more precision and reaction was expected of me, except that most of it was out of my control because of things like the camera not allowing me to see what I need to jump to or simply because I can't aim at what I need to shoot above my head. For all that I enjoyed in this game, it's basically meaningless when it comes to me actually needing to judge it on its gameplay quality, because a) this is a game, and b) the core mechanics that define this franchise and genre don't work properly.There are also other issues like the 1st boss getting stuck in a corner and me spending a good 15 mins shooting at it while it remains there, and one particular segment where the only way to backtrack on a error in the puzzle is to maually reload to the last checkpoint (btw, this game doesn't have a return to last checkpoint feature, it's completely up to you saving the last checkpoint if you want to return to them. Otherwise, the only option is to die, which will automatically send you to it.) Bosses are quite grindy as well. I honestly felt that there was more technique required in Legends. One of the puzzles, near the end, is also nonsensically difficult, mainly because of a combinations of the issues mentioned above coupled with a very tight countdown timer. It took me about 4hrs to complete that part and was almost the breaking point as there was no other was to progress. Otherwise, as I stated at the start, they are quite fun to do.In the end, I would only recommend this game to hard core fans of the genre and/or Tomb Raider and if you are willing to tolerate inconsistant movement and a lot of trial and error type puzzles. Otherwise, it can be a fustrating experience at core points that are needed to progress through the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Believe it or not i have never played through a Tomb Raider game.  Since the soon to be released reboot of the series is almost certainly going to wreck the franchise, I figured now was a good time to play through one of the seminal franchises of the Golden Age of Video Games.At its core, Tomb Raider is a puzzle game.  The gameplay was a well thought out blend of old school and new school, making it feel nostalgic yet playable here in 2012.  It was really fun to enter into a room, navigate the environment and piece together the puzzle to advance the game.  It was classic Tomb Raider to be sure.Visually TRA was an unexpected surprise, taking the 2007 era game engine and adding in an advanced set of PC options.  Being able to take nintendo's original sex symbol and max out the graphics settings certainly makes playing through this title easy on the eyes.The only complaint is the needlessly contrived boss battles.  Total immersion breakers for me.But all in all, TRA is a winner.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh boy, this game... I want so badly to like it, but there are things that just make this so difficult to enjoy. The controls are atrocious. For one thing, that wall-run mechanic makes so little sense. If you're used to modern Lara Croft or even just Mirror's Edge, be warned, the mechanics here are nothing like that. Combat mechanics are another reason why I so dislike this game. When I punch right, Lara goes left, right over a ledge and into a pit of fiery death. Then there's the awful adrenaline dodge mechanic, which is alright for users with controllers, but horrible for PC users. You have to be moving for that mechanic to work, and oh, don't shoot at the enemy until the targets line up! This mechanic works okay if you're in single-boss fights, but with multiple enemies, this is impossible. You have an array of unlockables available, but this game really borders on the frustrating rather than challenging side of gaming. You may lose your mind. I certainly did at least a dozen times. My advice to you: play the originals if you can, otherwise, pick this up on console. I got it for like $2 on sale, so if you really want it, wait for that. Don't burn your cash on this. PC controls are awful. The game was enjoyable up until the final couple of levels, where I am now stuck and deliberating whether or not to continue. Get the newer ones and skip this one, please, for your sanity, my fellow PC users!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is review 2 of 3 in my Tomb Raider Legends timline review series.Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a wonderful update of the original Tomb Raider (the very first one!). I'm not even going into the graphical differences (which seems too obvious and too easy to target; suffice to say that the Legends engine is a good upgrade), but instead talk about the level design. Platforming is more intense, since they can afford the bigger spaces. The puzzles are still based on the original puzzles in the first Tomb Raider game, but they definitely were amped up in the difficulty department. With better graphics comes more defined details, and so you get puzzles where you have to look closely at your surroundings to see where you have to go next. Similar to Legends, the next place you're supposed to parkour your way to is easily defined by the lighter color of the ledge, but this time, better accented by the dark niches they create in the rock. The worst part of platforming here was the rope swinging bits. The controls weren't very forgiving, and the timing of some of the jumps felt awkward. I spent the most time on this game than on the other two.The plot also followed that of the original game, so I was surprised to see this as part of the Legends timeline. Its impact to the overall story won't be seen until Underworld though, so the game is almost better appreciated on its own.Out of all 3 games, this one had the best combat system for me. Which is a total shame considering how underwhelming the final boss battle was for me. All the bosses in each level so far was interesting, and revolved around a neat mechanic that needed some skill to adapt to. However, in the final battle with Natla, once you figured out what you needed to do, and pretty much mastered the Adrenaline Dodge (which you will likely have by the time you reach this part), then the battle is pretty much in the bag.All in all, the new engine allowed for larger puzzles and larger areas creating new and interesting changes to the original puzzles, all of which, of course, were very much welcome. An awesome update to a classic, and definitely a must-play for any casual or hardcore fan of Lara Croft.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More challenging than Legend. The next path to take is not always painfully obvios (which is a good thing). Level design is wonderful. On the downside, the old T-Rex battle has been replaced with one of the worst boss battles I have ever played. Buy this if you are a Tomb Raider fan. Otherwise get Legend or Underworld instead.

If not a fan, but in a mood for a good adventure, you'd do well to buy this and maybe become a fan anyways.Tip: Force AA through your display drivers, not in-game. Enabling AA in-game disables shadows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recommended... IF you have a controller.I'm trying to play through this game with the keyboard controls, but it's so frustrating. One jump expects me to jump left, then activate the grappling hook. You need to hit the grappling hook immediately after jumping; there's just one problem. The default control setup requires you to use your ring finger (the weakest finger) for both left AND the grappling hook. Minor issues like these, coupled with the fact that combat is a complete mess (you use one hand on the mouse to shoot & move the camera, while your other hand has to handle moving Lara, jumping, AND rolling) makes using a controller necessary to enjoy this game to the fullest. I have this game on PS2 as well, and it controls like a dream with a dual analog controller. I personally don't have an Xbox 360 controller for my PC yet, so I have to make do with the keyboard for now. Blegh.Other than the awful controls, the game is great. The graphics and framerate are a big step up from the Wii and PS2 versions, although I personally would've liked to see the flashlight and the extra puzzles from the Wii version make an appearance. Got this game for like a dollar when the TR Collection was on sale, so it was well worth the money. If you like Tomb Raider, you'll love this carefully crafted remake of the original. Here's hoping for a Tomb Raider Anniversary 2!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the best Tomb Raider made (aside from Tomb Raider II). Controls are spot on, (mostly; sometimes glitchy in certain circumstances)  one of the main things I was looking forward to in the reboot, which failed miserably. Simple things, such as tapping the button repeatedly to move faster while climbing. The puzzles are genius. Gameplay stays interesting throughout the whole game up until the final boss- which was the only part I didn't like. I've played this game on every platform it's come out for and I have to say, despite the console, it really retains the quality one each console. The graphics are great and the PC version runs perfectly on even some of the most ancient computers. It really is a shame Square took over the series and seem to only focus on the graphics & ""action"" rather than the aerobics of which Tomb Raider was born in to. I wish they'd have remade Tomb Raider II before this series went downhill.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anniversary is a pretty good re-imagining of the original Tomb Raider. However, like many other of the Crystal games it lacks the difficulty that the classic possessed. I'd say if you loved the original you should play this. It's nice to see Lara's original adventure in another light.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heyyo, my second favorite Tomb Raider game just behind the latest ""Tomb Raider"" which doesn't have a number in the title or what-not and isn't the first game in the series... but Anniversary? It is a remake of the first Tomb Raider game and it's lots of fun. The combat has been revamped same with the clunky controls.. now you get an intense experience with a great way to control every aspect. Plus? Exploring the Mansion is pretty fun too. Highly recommend this game for adventure / platformer fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall an OK game.It starts as a good game but declines towards the end. There are times where everythings works fluently and then all of a sudden you have some parts where one easy misjudged jump makes you repeat a section over and over. At a couple of spots it is hard to tell if you have the right idea or not. And when you do the move and fail you might have to redo lots of previous moves to get to the same point, because there are no real saves, only checkpoints. These are mostly well placed, but sometimes I'd wish I could save anywhere. This way trial and error would be for fun and less aggravating.The camera ranges from good to bad. Sometimes jumping is more like taking a leap of faith than proper planning. It's really bad when the camera decides where you should look.Movement is generally ok, but there are some very difficult to pull off moves like the one jumping off a wall after swinging on a rope. It only worked by pure chance for me. This is also why the games becomes tedious at the end. More and more puzzles demand advanced moves and then it's less fun if they constantly fail.Moves were also sometimes buggy. So it happens that Lara moves hanging on a pole towards the wall even though I'm pressing and looking in the direction she should swing. Or... sometimes she simply doesn't hold onto a ledge after jumping down. It's not overall bad, but feels unpolished sometimes.I didn't like the gun play at all. Sure, it is easy enough with lock-on and unlimited ammo, but often you get in close combat with an enemy and then it's just frantic shooting until he dies, because it's impossible to follow the enemy with that camera.What's missing is a good journal that tells you at least a little bit what to do at the moment. The included journal is a joke and gives either no hints or cryptic ones that didn't help at all.But overall it's still worth playing if you are a fan of Tomb Raider. I did play the original an honestly, didn't notice any huge resemblences. Mabe I played the original too long ago :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short : 10 / 10 !This is serious stuff ! I have played the original back then on Playstation 1, the second one as well. Those were the games the whole legacy was built on ! This is THE Tomb Raider WITH modern looks: an Excellent HD-Remake! I just reinstalled the Tomb Raider Reboot, which i love really much, but this game man! The first 2 levels provide actually more challenge than the whole Reboot! That's a shooter with minor original Tomb Raider elements, while being also a really great game. If you want to know why Tomb Raider became legendary, this is the game to play! Excellent platformer which WILL bring you challenge even on medium ! Opening ancient gates have never brought so much satisfaction due to the amount of logic and effort required.Recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game because i remember playing it awhile when i was little but honestly its not worth playing,you will constantly die due to the bad camera angles and in order to get to the collectibles you have to repeat the puzzles a few times. Games is tedious and repetitive as most of the game makes you do the same thing over and over again as well as the combat.After collecting a piece you can always  expect them to throw in a couple of animals at you.Not really worth getting unless u like to do stuff over and over again and too much money to spare. Might as well play the latest tomb raider(2013) which was excellent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Broken Mess!I have the original disc of this game and although it had a few minor bugs it played very well....however the steam version seems to be pretty broken, way more then the original.  The bugs are game breaking, espcially on Temple of Khamoon.  Her hair is warping all over the screen and alot of the corners are very glitchy.  Many jumps, particulary for secrets get lara stuck in mid air.  Grapples fail and breakables dont break causing the end of the game as you cannot progress the level.I highly recommend this game and its one of my favourites of the Tomb Raider series however stay away from the steam version..go find it in a bargain basket at your local game store on disc and youll definetly enjoy it alot more...and be able to finish it aswell.

												Because this game lacks  a good save system it becomes an exercise in monotony.I find myself having to repeat the same obstacles over and over again because I makea mistake or die.This game only saves at certain checkpoints so in between them you cannot affort tofail without having to start all over again from the last checkpoint.After awhile I found it too repetitive to do the same thing over and over again.Which is why I really cannot highly recommend this to anyone.After an hour and a half of this crap I uninstalled it.While the gameplay isn't that bad and the mechanics are good the lack of a goodsave system prevents this from being an enjoyable experience.

												This game would be awesome if the save system wasn't so incredibly stupid. I basically have to save manually every time I pass a checkpoint because I can't manually load checkpoints. Besides that the controls are also unpredictable at times because the direction I press is changed depending on the camera angle. And the camera angle often changes on it's own accord in unpredictable ways.And she has some automatic grabbing that sometimes don't work. It's only sometimes, but since the checkpoints sometimes are a long way a part, I get really angry having to repeat my game play several times for a reason that doesn't seem like my fault. The old game I could save whenever I wanted, making the game a playground where I could take any chance I wanted and try funny stuff out. I hate checkpoint saves....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A shooting game with auto-aim? Ummm...okay.. might as well use a controller.*Picks up Xbox controller**In-game instructions only show keyboard and mice controls*Well, I give up on trying learn the controls myself. How can such a simple option be so hard to add? Either remove the auto-aim, or have FULL controller support. It's not that hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Boring because of the constant repetition when you are trying to find you way through many of the rooms and the correct jump sequences; which results in a lot of misses even when you know what to do; and there are far too few checkpoints for restarts.  The save system is largely useless.  Saves only artifacts found, which are useless in game and only unlock useless info later, but saves none of the useful stuff you need.  Game simply restarts at specific checkpoints after deaths, often erasing much work to be repeated over and over.  Soon you could care less about what should be the most interesting challenges: finding all of the artifacts and relics.  You just play to get what you have to.  Looking at walkthroughs destroys the fun, but is necessary to avoid much boredom.  You continue playing only if a friend is also playing and you encourage each other.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original TR games have not aged well at all (graphics and gameplay), and this remake, despite being eye candy, hasn't improved the gameplay of the original (very flawed) mid '90s ""classic"". Recommended only for those who like platform games with tons of puzzles, no matter how illogical, incoherent or downright repetitive they might be...for the rest, I recommend jumping directly to the excellent 2013 reboot...if you feel like playing old-school TR, I suggest Legend and/or Underworld (less puzzles, more action, more variety)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So where do I start? A game that does not recognize my dedicated video card could probably be it, but what annoys me most is this: wonky physics, deceptive hitboxes, unintuitive controls, lousy mechanics, no manual reload and HAVING TO ♥♥♥♥ING MANUALLY SAVE IN 2017!? It's like the developers went back to the 90s in the absolute WORST possible way, bringing back exactly what we dread of the era. This game feels old and outdated, the puzzles make no sense and are not intuitive whatsoever, and what's more, you can't experiment because literally everything hurts Lara! You fall from 3 feet? Damage. You missjudge a jump? Damage. You encounter a poorly placed enemy that makes no sense? Damage. You don't avoid a trap because the camera keeps giving you the worst possible angles? Damage.When I saw my Sherpa coated with a thick fur coat and snow hat, while Lara was wearing her tank top and short shorts atop a friggin mountain, under snow I said ""ok video game logic, let's ignore that"". But having wolves and bears in a friggin cave that has been locked for god knows how long, without sunlight or any discernible source of food? So much for my suspension of disbelief. If you want to go back to the 90s gaming era, remember what you hated about those games, and appreciate XXI century gaming, get this, no questions asked. If you want a game with good mechanics, decent physics and immersive, steer right away from this, this is all the issues of last century gaming rolled into one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal favourite Tomb Raider game... Perhaps only beaten by Tomb Raider 2013 this is essentially a HD remake of the original Tomb Raider but improved so much! it still looks pretty darn good graphics wise and plays beautiful it even has Lara's house to explore! (a feature i think should be madatory in any game calling itself ""Tomb Raider"") I will say i consider a controller ESSENTIAL for this game it has built in gamepad support and works so much better then using the Keyboard and mouse in my opinion.

												Seems like a decently executed remake at first, but eventually reveals itself to have some extremely poorly designed motion and combat mechanics.

												I do not recommend this game for the fans of the classic Tomb Raider series.Though, newcomers to the series might see this in a total different perspective then I do.Growing up and seeing my dad play Tomb Raider 1 on the PC and getting a PSX with Tomb Raider 2 as my 1st game around x-mas back when I was 8 years old made Tomb Raider an unforgetable experience and became one of my favorite game franchises to date.The original TR1 was way more open and not as linear as Tomb Raider: Anniversary. Yes, the graphical improvement is amazing (even now it still looks stunning at times - game dates from 2007) but the game is very linear and makes it so you can only follow one straight path towards the end, which is sad knowing that the original game you really had to spend time searching how to solve puzzles and not to get lost in the maze.Still, some places really brought Tomb Raider 1 back amazingly well. St. Francis Folly is one of the examples that made me happy to see it in a different way then what they were capable of back in 1996.In the end, it depends what you are looking for in this game.Diverse gameplay, searching around, solving puzzles? You'd better check out the original.Fast-paced gameplay with ofcourse a big boost graphic wise? Then TR:A is your thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIf your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a God-send. It is exactly like the original game, just with updated graphics and a few new tweaks. I'd say it's even better than the original. All of the levels are completely redone with similar puzzles that make more sense and aren't block-shaped. All the animal shooting and silent tomb raiding is back and it feels great. This is by far the best Tomb Raider game to come out this generation, I only wish they remade all of the originals!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(And almost non-existent.)- Auto aim sucks.- Monotonous jumping, climbing and swinging. I know that it is an adventure game, but the rarely broken cycle of 'jump, shimmy, repeat', gets old fast.+ Nostalgia.+ Graphics.+ Voice acting.Forcing myself to finish this.

												This game is faithful to the original: exotic destinations, beautiful sceneries, ominous creatures... The graphics are outdated but still manage to convey the atmosphere; the game design stays in the slow paced puzzle spirit. So it's a welcomed opportunity to rediscover a classic of video games.Unfortunately the developers did a terrible job at implementing the controls and the camera, resulting in extremely inaccurrate moves. In a gameplay consisting in half puzzle, half platformer, where mistakes are immediately punished, it makes the experience painfully frustrating.All in all, the only thing this remake brings, is 2000's graphics. Other than that, the level design is mostly the same (which is good though), the controls are bad, the menus are rushed, and there are bugs that can block the progression altogether.

												This game is yet another reason why I wish I didn't have to recommend or not recommend a game.  It's right on the border and should probably receive a push.The positive aspects of this game is it's an amazingly updated version of the original Tomb Raider, to the point where there's no reason to go back and play the original, unless you want to have a bad experience. The game is updated enough to use gamepads, better graphics, and better game play. But there's a major issue.  This game was released in 2007, the previous year Crystal Dynamics offered Tomb Raider Legend and honestly I think Tomb Raider Legends is a far superior game. The two games are night and day and I prefer Tomb Raider Legends, the previous year's game by a significant amount.  To me that makes it near impossible to recommend this.  The biggest difference in-between the game is Tomb Raider Legends is the game flow in Tomb Raider legend is more solid.  The game moves between puzzles and combat with ease, and while the combat in Tomb Raider Legend is harder (due to soldiers).  The player constantly feels like they are making progress.  Where as in Tomb Raider Anniversary, the small combat in the game is more an annoyance (or a total slog as in the T-rex Boss fight).  And the puzzles take the center stage, while they are bigger or more expansive, the player often doesn't know what he's doing, or what he's doing wrong.  This just gets frustrating.  The trick in Tomb Raider legend is Lara constantly talks with her friends, which while it can be annoying, it gives the player something to do, and a clue to know when they did something right.  Instead in Tomb Raider Anniversary, the first half of the game is almost dead silent.   The player feels alone, and not in a positive way. The biggest problem is Tomb Raider legends is just a more interesting game.  There's a story, and interesting and diverse levels, and something going on, where Anniversary is Lara raiding tombs but not even talking to herself about it, and after a long enough time, it's dull and tiresome.  This is a remake with upgraded everything, I really wish they made the story and game a little better, and didn't feel like they just changed the engine and called it a day. Is Tomb Raider Anniversary a bad game?  No.  It's not, it's extremely playable, and actually quite nice compared to the original game.  However it does very little better than Tomb Raider Legend, lacks a story and while it's graphics work with a 2007 sensibility, the game which might have worked in 2007 is no longer good enough in 2016I know this game is a fan favorite, or a nostalgic classic, and it's more difficult than Legend's puzzles but the difficulty comes from lack of guidance, and weak controls, rather than gameplay elements.  Good puzzle games can let the player know where they should go or what they're missing with out solving the puzzle.  Anniversary doesn't even attempt that.  It tosses the player in the deep end and lets them drown with out a word.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TRA is remake of TR1, but it is WAYYY TOO BORING why? Levels are too long and there is no back ground music like it was in legend + Enemies are just bunch of confused animals which dont know how to attack and what makes this game worse in the series is: You walk 10000 hours to finish a level once you reach the last checkpoint in most level it asks you to go back all the way you came in to finish the level wtf?!?! so yea you have to re-play almost each level and in re-play all enemies are dead and puzzles are solved so it is a dull walk to end a level. however it has some good boss fights but unlike Tomb raider legend which truely was a legend and in my opinion best TR game ever made, this one is so boring and dull.Good advise = Just play the demo on steam the best part of the game and most exciting level is in Demo but don't get fooled like me to think rest of game is like that....

												Keep in mine that this is my opinion on the PC version, I haven't played it on any other console, but would suspect it is a lot better on Xbox.As much as I love this remake and the interesting take on the puzzles that we are all too familar with from the first Tomb Raider, I have to say I'm highly disappointed with the PC version. Most people, who have bought and played this on Steam, will note that there are far too many bugs and at certain points make the game unplayable.  If TR 1 was your wife, then TR: Anniversary if the flirtacious chick you meet in a bar and have a one night fling with only to find out in the wee hours of the morning just how plastered you were, you didn't even notice 'her' one-eyed trouser snake.  You regret the experience and suddenly realize that TR1 is the only woman for you. And you try to keep the one night stand, and unusual rash, in the past to be forgotten about as an awful....awful... mistake.And don't even get me started on the pointlessness of the save option....

 WHEN A GOOD GAME SCREWS YOU OVER  A Fix included if you experience this issue I played this game a long time ago back on PS3 or Xbox 360... i cant remember which as i had both.Anyway, The game itself plays fine (at least as far as i got) however i got screwed over by some stupid save profile glitch. I must have played an hour or so (not far past the T-Rex) went and saved and then closed the game. (as any other working game) I come back later and the ""profile"" doesn't recognise my save and makes me start the game over, of course after some research the solution i found was ... make 2 profiles and for some reason that did allow you to return to a save but i lost my progress in the research and testing and have to start from the beginning. Now while 1 hour is not to bad to have to recover, but i was only interested in playing this game once then uninstalling it. Now i just don't care, the game gave me a crummy glitch and im not bothering to start over again. You might think this is a dumb review but i'm just being honest. So...  Conclusion The 1 Hour i got to play and from what i remember of it was a good game. Don't get me wrong, the game is good and i don't like giving it a negative review, If i didnt have this bug and or maybe was more keen to play this enough to start again, i would give it a positive.Again i'm just being honest, it P!ssed me off that i lost all that progress and found a fix too late. Maybe i'm in the unlucky group of people who had this happen to them... but it happened. So if you purchase this game and are reading this review for some insight or a heads up. (Fix found on the steam forums)1. Create a new profile and exit the game2. Go to C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Eidos\Tomb Raider - Anniversary3. Copy the content from the old profile to the new profile4. Start a new game with your new profile5. Once in-game, open up the options menu and you should see your savegames.6. Load your latest savegame and - just in case - save again, using a new savegame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice game.My playthrough info: I played on Easy, as always. Used an XBox-360 gamepad, and generally did not consult walkthroughs. I made the review after completing the game itself -- I haven't completed Croft Manor yet, and I'm still missing two secrets in the main game. I'm not a fast player, so it took me about 45 hours to get to that stage.I've started some old Tomb Raider games over the years, but never played them for long. This one... I finished it. And I'm planning to play the next one too. I didn't play the previous one due to Anniversary being advertised as a remake of the first Tomb Raider, but I might go back to that eventually too.One might have to take a break every once in a while. You get to explore caves and ruins of ancient civilizations, filled with magic devices and traps and the occasional monster thingy to shoot. When you've finished that you get to the next area, where you get to explore caves and ruins of ancient civilizations, filled with magic devices and traps and the occasional monster thingy to shoot. After completing that... well, you get the idea, I hope :-)So for me it did help to a take the occasional break. It didn't get ""boring"", though. Ok, maybe towards the end when almost every switch you flipped didn't just do the usual thing but also freed another monster thingy to shoot.Being a puzzle-platformer with secrets and stuff, don't expect to just rush through the areas. It may appear impossible at times, but after a few retries you get an idea how things might work. Lara has the uncanny ability to just come back from the dead at a convenient location when she dies, so experimentation is key: can I jump there, or can I not? Well, lets try it...Even finding the secrets works out ok: everything in a level is there to be used in some way. So if you've reached the exit, and there's a ledge or pole or box or something else somewhere that you haven't even touched, chances are that there's another way leading somewhere you haven't been yet.The game has plenty of checkpoints. In fact, on at least one occasion when I had to do a timed run to reach a secret (flip the switch to open the door, then reach it before it closes again) I had to make sure to avoid the checkpoint on the way, so I could just die and respawn at the checkpoint before the switch instead of having to reload that manual save or having to get to the switch again.In most cases, though, hitting a checkpoint is more of a reward than a curse: you've completed a section of the area, and it's now safely behind you.Just know this: search the area for switches and stuff. Take your time looking at the rooms. Swim through every pool looking for stuff underwater. Jump on every rock that you can jump on. If that's not something you want to do throughout the entire game, don't play this. In most areas there's hardly any enemies to kill -- this isn't Borderlands. The game is about reaching the exit, and there's never a straight and easy path with signs.For the bossfights, I did look up the dino since at the time I hadn't figured out the whole andrenaline dodge thing. Never used it on normal enemies anyway. I also looked up the centaurs since nothing I did seemed to work. For the other bosses, the game did a better job of ""guiding"" my actions, so all in all even the bosses worked out nicely. Even the final boss felt like it was supposed to be killed -- some games focus their bosses on merely frustrating the player.I did have the occasional problem with the gamepad controls, but that's probably just my skills. At one point I even checked a walkthrough to see whether I really have to take the route that I thought I have to take, and after confirming that I used a Flytool to get past that to the next checkpoint. But that only happened once towards the end. I'm still missing two artifacts, one of which I think I know, but having control issues again -- but these aren't essential, so I can just try it every once in a while.PS: since the shop page provides no trailers, here's two of them.

												Don't EVER buy this. Don't even play it if it's free. All the things that make Tomb Raider what it is; the movement, the navigation, the environments, the enemies...they are all glitched to hell. And I don't mean 'a bit glitchy', I mean completely ruined. Sometimes game-stoppingly so. This has been released on several platforms, but I would bet money that this has had zero testing on this version.There was one glitch where she wouldn't grab on to a ledge because she kept hitting something sticking out in the wall, and there was no other way round it. After some researching, I found out that lots of people have been having the same problem, and the only way for her to grab the ledge is to turn the aspect ratio down and full screen effects off. I'm not even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you, then and only then did she clip through the rock on the wall and grab the ledge.Plus, it saves checkpoints as you progress through milestones in a level. Sometimes you fall down or something and may wish to start at the checkpoint instead of making your way all the way to it again. The only way to do this is to kill Lara somehow. If there isn't any water around, you have to dive onto the floor from high up. If she survives this, whatever you do, DO NOT LOAD SAVED GAME! It puts you right back at the ♥♥♥♥ing start of the level. There is no 'Load Checkpoint' option. You either kill her or you make your way back to the checkpoint. I've lost about 2 hours of gameplay and counting so far because of this. I've learned my lesson the 2nd time now.BLAAAAAAAAM THIS PIECE OF CRAP~Solar out			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TRIGGER WARNING: YOU WILL BE TRIGGERED. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.I played this game for five hours straight today.  I wanted to like it, and for the most part, I did.  But today I reached a point where the player is in the Coliseum, required to kill not one, but four gorillas.  Standing safely on a ledge above the enclosed gorillas, the game left me no choice but to shoot every one of them dead.  I understand the historical context and the tradition behind animal combat in the Coliseum and the value of this as a gameplay element, but this feels like they're just making light of a recent events and the tragic and untimely death of my close friend.I miss my boi Harambe.

												TRA is not the worst platform game i've played, but that being said its still pretty forgettable. There are quite a few visual glitches in the game, for one. Not gamebreaking but lazy on the part of the devs.Extremely simplistic combat, just roll dodge until you can headshot in slowmo, nothing else to it. Really dull sound design, music barely ever plays, not much voice acting and the ambient sounds arent enough, this results in long stretches of the level where the audio is virtually nonexistent. And they are some VERY long levels. Also felt the addition of QTEs to cutscenes to be unneccessary.  The worst part of the game though has to be the camera. Its unhelpful at best and a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at worst. The sum total of the game just feels rather dull and dated, much like the game it is a remake of.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The camera is very bad and the awkward controls do NOT work with it. The AI and pathfinding is very VERY stupid even on the hardest difficulty meaning you're never going to die to monsters or even bosses because they will always be stuck on something. The game is not something I would suggest you pick up unless you have very high patiance to deal with gameplay for mediocore platforming			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd never played a Tomb Raider before the reboot and now I'm grateful I hadn't. There are plenty of huge issues with the game: at times cumbersome controls, clipping through objects when trying to grapple things that aren't the intended solution, terrible combat with awful AI, the checkpoint system in place that only lets you restart in said designated checkpoints when the game really needs quicksaves or something similar to the reboot. All of this could be chalked up to lack of polish (even if it is supposed to be a remake....), but that really isn't the case. This game is flawed at its core. It is so god damn boring.If you don't like the first hour don't even bother going through the rest. It doesn't change one bit. Most of the mechanics are introduced up front, and the aforementioned issues will continue to knaw and knaw at you until you're throwing your hands up in frustration. There is absolutely nothing to break up the monotony. I liked what few cutscenes there were but they didn't hint at a real plot or anything. I managed to get through Peru with much struggling and the first part of the Greek tomb before getting tired of falling off and having to climb all the way back up again because the checkpoint was at the bottom of a huge pit.Don't buy this game. Don't buy this franchise for that matter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this game. No, really. Don't do it. I love Tomb Raider so much, but this is just one huge buggy pile of garbage. You get stuck EVERYWHERE on ledges and against objects. Lara's hair keeps having physics stretching problems snapping all over the screen. A lot of times you get so hung up on the world geometry that you just stand there clipping over and over until you quit the game because you can't do anything to get out of it. Then there's the camera. The camera snapping in this is one of the worst I've ever seen. No matter how you adjust things, it jerks and shakes enough to induce epilepsy. This came couldn't have been play tested, or the developers simply didn't care, because there's non stop buggyness no matter where and what level you're on. And forget the combat. It's clunky and terrible. You know how in old TR you used to be able to draw your guns and have her aim and keep on the enemy? Forget that. Now you lose track of them constantly and if you aren't rushing towards something trying to kill you (getting mauled in the process) you can't get a lock on them. Worst combat of a TR game ever. Don't buy it even if it's 3 bucks. The shaking camera, constant physics problems and general stress literally made me sick.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had sex with pieces of fresh steak brought home right from the grocery store. And I still had a much better time doing that, then playing this game. First off all, I'm bombing nuts. That's a win/win at all times. Tomb Raider: Anniversary doesn't even raise a stiffy. I'm not talking about how dated the graphics are, or how Lara's♥♥♥♥♥isn't as phat as it could have been. I'm talking about the challenge of the game itself. When I think of Tomb Raider, I always think about Tomb Raider 2. That game left me questioning if there really was any good left in the world.This game might be a remake, but it's nothing to the original. I don't need lock on; I don't need bright as♥♥♥♥♥♥maps. I need that darkness that I can hardly see in, and more of Lara moaning. Just turning down the brightness wouldn't even hide the ugly that this game has going on right now. Think of Anniversary as in this prospect: It's that fat chick you ♥♥♥♥ed in the bar and try to sneak out of the house before daylight so your family/friends don't see your regretful/tasteless acts. Despite this series coming first, I also think that this game is the Alpha footage for the first Uncharted.I rather participate in an act of beastiality, than be forced to play another minute of this atrocious game.

												I do not usually downvote a game but i could not stand this one more than 40 minutes. If you played tomb raiders through your childhood, you may find something interesting in this game. I played last 2 games, 2013 and rise of the tomb raider, and this one is nowhere near fun as much as those two.Ok, tomb raider is a legendary puzzle - advanture game. But here is what i see in this game, considering the last two games:Cons (since there are no pros):- This is not a survival game. Just a 3d puzzle game without any concept. Just making your way through some ancient places.- Even though this game is released in 2007, grapcially there are much better looking games than this.- Even on easy difficulty, there is an unexplainable combat system. Animals attack in close couters, you are trying to manuever your way out, desperately trying to shoot at the write angle. Ii tried combat modes, hold and toggle targeting modes and neither did make any sense.- There is no story to be a part of or embrace. Just learn how to make your way around and kinetic dynamics and go.- It might get a bit exciting in the next chapters, which i am not intended to see, but i haev never been this much bored.- Soundtrack is older than the games timeline.- The movement dynamics are causing cheap deaths.If you can enjoy a monotoneus puzzle solving game where you fight with the strangest combat system in the history, give this a try. I am a patient person and could not take it more than 40 minutes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game awhile ago, and since i was a fan of the first Tomb Raider was happy with the graphics and beautifull sounds.The new mechanics and options also were amazing, everything looked great! BUT....!For some reason they managed to strip the expandable factor of the original by making mechanics with "" This is what you need to do rule"" So if you dont do the jump like it is ""meant to be done"" Lara will fail using her hook, ignore grabing edges and die/return to a previous place probably. Old Lara was uglier but more reliable and Trusty of her mechanics... If "" The game did not meant for you to go trough this that way"" your mechanics will be ignored even if obviously was possible to.My review for this game: 6/10 it would be perfect if it was not for the geometry factor.

												The start of Lara's adventure. Remastered, remade, redone for those that remembered her first outing fondly and wished that they could see her with bigger ...polycounts.The story follows closely to the original games release with visuals that resembles that which was possible on 2007 hardware. While not ""next-gen"" for its time it is a remake of the original game with alterations that are not too far off the mark. The bigger events in the game is replaced with boss battles, long stretches of nothing replaced with more compact traversal and sets it as a back story to Tomb Raider Legends and its horrible sequel TR Underworld.

												Recommended if you like long periods of exploring large temples, ruins, etc., minimal gun actions, confusing/difficult puzzles (at least for me), sometimes less-than-stellar controls and camera anglesThis is my first Tomb Raider game I’ve completed. I only bought this on sale because I purchased the latest Tomb Raider game and thought that game after playing an hour or so was cool, so I wanted to experience some of the games before playing that reboot (as silly as that may sound).As this is my first Tomb Raider game, and understanding this is an HD remake of the original game with additional features I presume and not drastically making an entire new game, I still got what I expected. It’s a game about raiding tombs…So, even though this is a remake of an old game, it’s a game released in 2007, and I’m playing it in 2015 with my personal standards adjusted to somewhat compensate the difference.Story 5/10Lara Croft gets approached to find some artifact. After long levels of jumping, climbing, exploring, solving puzzles, you get a short cutscene. Sound 9/10Fitting music, with mystical/mysterious tones as well as the typical fast-paced stuff when things get heavy for Lara.Graphics 9/10For a game released in 2007 and a remake of an old game which had horrendous graphics (I lived through that age of heavy pixels) I was satisfied with what was presented in this game. The surrounding environment, in the temples and such were not unpleasant to look at.Gameplay 7.5/10As I mentioned that I never played any previous Tomb Raider games, I still knew what to expect since it was based on the older games. It’s 90% running around, pushing boxes, jumping, rolling, climbing, and/or solving puzzles. 10% using guns.Side note: I wonder why Lara has infinite ammo for her starting pistols? And this is eventually relevant to the story in the final boss fight which made me chuckle, you’ll find out if you get there.-Jumping and rolling is cool, as Lara is acrobatic so she can do flips or a handspring. Also, for jumping onto far ledges you might lose your grip and have to press E to fix it, so that’s a cool addition to the genre of platforming games. When the opportunity is present, you can use your grappling hook to run across walls or swing across a room, though the controls combined with the camera angle made it annoying sometimes to jump to where you wanted to go.-Additionally with camera angles, they were sometimes annoying during climbing. E.g. you’re on a ledge, and you may need to jump to behind you (180 degrees). But sometimes I didn’t know that beforehand, so while you’re hanging on a ledge, the camera can’t move to see behind you for some reason.-As for guns, you get a few additional weapons that you discover. What’s cool is the rare enemies you do actually face, is the dodging move, where time slows down a bit and if you time it right you can deliver a critical hit after rolling out of the way.-Targeting multiple enemies is a bit of a pain. The rare time there are multiple enemies that can give you trouble, perhaps I just missed what proper way to do so, but I was using my mouse to switch targets but it is not a smooth transition at all, almost unresponsive at times.-Some puzzles and proper routes felt challenging, at least for me. I ended up looking at video walkthroughs many, many times to avoid wasting time. I’m a crappy tomb raider.-Sometimes controls feel shtty, this is probably the top two gripes I have with the game (the first being a lack of action/gun play). Jumping and reaching where you want to go is not as easy and smooth as I would like (It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s something that definitely negatively affects the experience). I probably swore more times from missing jumps than any other game I’ve every played.There was even one point, climbing up the same ladder, I pressed the same controls to jump (as I did successfully did before) but it wouldn’t let me reach the ledge. I ended up jumping onto a wall and then falling, taking some damage. This is definitely more annoying than the Assassin’s Creed games.All in all, I have mixed emotions on finally completing this game. I’m happy to finally complete a tomb raider experience cuz it has spawned so many games. On the other hand, this game is not one I will probably ever play again. I have no desire to touch Croft Manor, whatever extra gameplay it offers aside from story mode.Overall score for me is 7.5/10If I was a gazillionaire, I'd offer a million dollars to anyone who hasn't played the game before to beat this game (with the assist of a video walkthrough) with only ten lives. That's how frustruated I was at times with the controls resulting in many, many falls to my death.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Way back when the playstation brand had triumphantly detroned nintendo from the number one best console due to games like Tomb raider which created a felling of awe and wonder.It wasn't easy to get use to the controls but with a tiny bit of patience,the game opened up to the player and presented an amazing world to explore.With a rich back story to follow along and a voluptuous main character to control made Tomb Raider a must buy back then and it still remains the same today.If you haven't played Tomb Raider to date I dont know what you're waiting for.Jump in and soak up the rich story, adventure and gameplay that is on offer here.Good hunting my fellow gamers and I'll see you in my next review. ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game first on PS2. PS2. My god. That is so weird.This is an excellent adaptation of both the games, and the character. I feel like this Lara is closer to the Lara I wanted to see when the first game came out. She's kind of cold and distant, maybe a little aristocratic, almost. I've heard a lot of people complain about how she seems too ""angry"" and that she's not ""flirty"" with Larsen anymore. Those people are dumb. Lara is much more appealing and much more interesting when she's not whatever the scene needs to her to be; Lara is consistent in Anniversary, as a character, and as a person. Her character builds and changes throughout the game, rather than being a static mouthpiece for the original writers to act out childish, sexist fantasies. This may not be a character we always like--she's like an antihero in that way--but we can always empathize with her, because she's more human when she has flaws.The gameplay is fantastic, the game is solidly built/programmed--I've never encountered a glitch in this game, and I must have played it on my PS2 through at least 3 or more times. The game is also beautiful, even if, much like in the first game, it suffers from inconsistent lighting and sometimes a wonky camera.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful remake of the very first Tomb Raider, the level design is nothing short of brilliant, the puzzles will keep your brain gearing on and the action is fun. Some times there are problems with Lara clanging on to ledges and stuff, and some tight-space combat situations, but other than that it's ACE!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nostalgic journey to a time when 3D graphics were in their first steps and action games were rapidly evolving from top downs to first and third person. Highly enjoyable for any that fondly played the original Tomb Raider and a great introduction to the franchise for those that have not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
