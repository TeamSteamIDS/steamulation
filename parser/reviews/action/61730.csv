												相当有意思的小游戏，画风好可爱，音乐也好有感觉，还可以玩合作，不知道为什么玩的人这么少。今天心情本来不是那么好的，玩玩这游戏感觉好多了，曾经入过一次包，好像是Humble的。这游戏操作很简单，玩法很多样，有时候还要考虑如何才能多combo得高分，很有乐趣。各种combo还有食物链的设定，很有意思~ 好友里虽然有28个人有这游戏，可是只有8个人玩过。这游戏我给满分 10/10，能治愈人的游戏，给人一种放松感，大家可以试试哦~This is an interesting and relaxing game. It's easy to play and has many play modes. Have fun with this game.My game rating is 10/10.			",2126,879,92,327,314,27,407

A Fluffy Father's Feeding FrenzyFrom the creators of Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery comes one of my favorite puzzle games. It was the first game I bought on Steam and I went in not knowing what to expect. It is the definition of pleasant surprise. I found myself having giggle-ragefits and fistpumping at creating awesome chains. I love everything about it. I love the humor, the art, the diverse mechanics, the puzzles, and its surprising amount of depth. I don't say this often but it's worth it full price. I honestly cannot think of a flaw unless you hate cute things. The story is one you rarely see in a game: You're Biggs and you're trying to be a good father to your starving kid. Your goal is to keep the island free of cute critters and vomit rainbows into your child's mouth to keep him fed while a human traveler discovers new things about your homeland! The information he uncovers is pretty interesting.It has online multiplayer capability, single player, and has a leaderboard for people who really wanna challenge themselves and score massive combos. The online multiplayer has Co-Op and Versus mode, both very fun to play with friends. The single player mode offers an Adventure, Puzzles, Challenges, and unlockable Survival modes. For one puzzle type, you're given a number of moves to get rid of all the critters. If you deplete those moves and the critters aren't gone, you'll be mobbed by a flurry of adorable creatures. Succeed and you can proceed to more difficult levels.I enjoyed the crap out of this game and I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves puzzles, cute things, and/or something to sit back and relax to. Not enough peoploe play this game and I cannot recommend it enough.9/10			",239,84,5,40,28,2,19

												A charming little puzzle game that will grow on you the more you play.  A must-try for puzzle lovers.  The only real failing is that multiplayer is a bit of a wash--you'll have to hunt down folks on the forums if you want to play online.If this becomes (or already is) available as a mobile app, I'm sure it'll excel.

												8/10Pros:- Has multiple game types/modes.- Has a good amount of content to complete.- Is a 'real' release (Little or no bugs).- Allows for alternate/multiple methods to win tasks/puzzles. You can even complete tasks/puzzle with leftover turns/time/bonus items sometimes for more points.- Uses small amount of resources (As it should).Cons:- Has story section at the start of the campaign which is unskippable and have to wait/click through painfully whenever anyone starts new campaign. --			",96,17,1,27,4,0,27

												This is one of my favorite games.Sure, it's childish. That's what I love about it.Especially if it's with a friend where you can fill in the silence with random talk!You get to calm down, lick a few flies and make the obese critters pop.The creature you play as is absolutely adorable (especially if it has something in it's mouth and the cheeks bounce when you run around)!It's also fun how quickly people judge, so if you have a friend that's usually playing games like Dark Souls or CS:GO; buy it for them and force them to play with you in hopes that their friends will bully them for it.TL;DR: It's a cute game and it works for me in a therapeutic sense.

												One of the best puzzle games I've ever played.I owned this years ago on PS3, and bought it again on PC to continue my addiction. My wife and I shared the single player missions, and play the co-op survival very often. We keep coming back to it, it never gets old. It's cute and funny and simple to understand the basics, but after a while you'll also discover more advanced techniques to improve your game. Excellent balance, just a joy to play. Love it.

												9/10 - Critter Crunch at first glance might look like just another puzzle game. With the rows of creatures having similarities, it might even seem like a match 3 puzzler. But its not! In fact, its a quite unique spin on the genre. Instead of matching like objects, you will instead use the critters as a food chain of sorts. In Critter Crunch, you play the role of Biggs, a puffy orange and white looking creature who looks like he would fit right at home in a Nintendo game. He's cute, he's adorable, and he has a big appetite for gems. As Biggs, you will be running back and forth on the screen grabbing critters, and rearrangfing them or ultimately feeding them to each other. Smaller critters feed the critters one size up from them. 2 critters, or a stuffed critter, will make the bigger critter explode, releasing gems for Biggs to eat. There are in the spirit of these type of puzzle games, special objects to help or hurt you in the game, as they appear as pieces throughout the rows. For instance, bombs may appear, which can clear out a section of critters. Biggs' son even pops up if you clear a chain of 8 critters, allowing for a huge score boost. All in all, very fun puzzle mechanics in this title.What's more is that this game looks gorgeous. Probably the nicest looking puzzle game I have come across on Steam. It's not popping with particle effects, or 3D. Instead, it chooses a hand drawn high res sprite look, that you would expect to see in a game like Rayman Origins for example. the animations for Biggs are wonderful also. The game is very colorful, but not in a seizure inducing sort of way. Everything just looks extremely crisp, and smooth. Buy this game!			",2688,1008,120,316,352,31,452

												This is a great game, there's a nice single player mode with a funny story, some challenging puzzles and challenge levels, and there's multiplayer (online and local), both versus and co-op.I feel like the adventure mode does a pretty good job of pacing the additions, by the time I was at the end, I hadn't even realized how many types of critters I was disposing of and eating the crystal guts (You'll understand in time ;) out of, but when you're playing local multiplayer with someone new, you might have to explain some of those critters to your ally/opponent.The sound, art, and animation are on point, so there's nothing I feel I need to mention there, unless, of course, you don't like cute critters getting fed to other, bigger critters, who in turn blow up...Lastly, I guess I'll say that with the variety of powerups and everything, you can set up some incredibly satisfying combos. Well, you can do some cooler ones without using powerups, too, with a bit more work, but turning the whole screen into two colors then blowing up them all in one big chain is a great feeling.Originally I bought this game to play with my older sister after we tried it on PS3, but I've ended up playing it a lot by myself and even though she always loses, she still has fun with versus, though she prefers co-op, I think. ;P			",558,140,5,59,46,6,51

												Gameplay: Each campaign world introduces a new mechanic, gently expanding Critter Crunch's basic puzzle premise into a diverse field of interactions. The variety of special critters and abilities produces a deep optimization exercise. I had great fun with the puzzle and challenge levels - they encourage studying move consequences that would otherwise go unnoticed in the frenzy of clearing the board.Controls: Generally quick and responsive, which is ideal for what becomes a twitch puzzler at high levels. However, I wish it took the same time to interact with critters regardless of screen position. Waiting for Biggs' tongue to extend for high-hanging critters needlessly breaks the flow/pacing.Presentation: The atmosphere of Critter Crunch is beautiful - smiling sprites, vibrant colors, and upbeat tunes. Biggs has so many animation frames that it's fun to pause the game to see what expression the little fellow has at that instant. Funny storyline, definitely the most enjoyable ending within this genre!			",144,41,0,8,11,3,28

												I love this game ^^It has been a while since a puzzler managed to captivate me. Now this game not only looks great (of course the manga style, cuteness and humor is not everyone's taste, in this case I personally really like it), it is also one of the very few puzzlers with some new ideas, and they even work brilliantly. In the first few levels you might think the mechanics are too complicated for fast-paced puzzle thrills, but it's actually all quite simple and you'll get the hang of it quite quickly (plus the Adventure Mode slowly shows you all the different critters and power foods). When you're through adventure mode, there are still dozens of puzzle levels (very cool, btw!), challenge levels (very tricky, btw!), the survival mode (that's what these games are all about in the end, right?) aaaand then there's local and online Co-op and versus modes...the only set back: There is hardly ever anyone online! Why doesn't anyone seem to know about this game? Totally underrated! The only things that bug me a bit are that there's no indication of when the row goes down and that survival mode is over a little fast because it gets tough rather quickly.Anyway, get it and let's have a match :]8.5/10			",238,72,3,16,14,1,29

												This game is everything that I hoped it would be. Local co-op with a friend is excellent and we are currently ranked in the 60's. Local versus is a blast. The Xbox 360 controller works like a charm. And by using a program called DS4 Windows my friend is able to use his PS4 controller too. The graphics are exactly what the preview shots look like, somewhat anime-ish with painted backgrounds. I really like it. Music is great. The critters drop down slow at first but if you can survive then the game really does pick up pace, or there is a button you can press to make the rows drop faster. There are a bunch of funny items and tricks to learn. I recommend playing adventure mode first to learn how the game works. But it's also pretty fun to go into local co-op and versus blind with your friend and figure the game out together. Right now we are playing through adventure mode by taking turns and helping one another out (also yelling at each other and making dirty jokes). It's been hilarious. I want it to never end. But even after the main game is completed there are puzzle and challange modes, and always the faithfully entertaining versus and co-op.			",47,6,0,3,2,0,2

												Just when you thought you had seen all the puzzle games out there, along comes Critter Crunch that manages to be cute and do something different all at the same time. The game is being presented as some sort of silly documentary, with a host telling you all about the main character, Biggs. The goal is simple; feed Biggs. To do this you have to eat small creatures, spit them out into bigger ones, eat those and spit these out into even bigger ones. After that, you have to collect the crystals that drop. That's right, Biggs eats crystals. While it all sounds fairly simple so far, it really is not. Each level introduces a new rule or gameplay mechanic, making it increasingly more difficult, but also keeps it challenging and fresh.Oh, the game has some lovely, colorful 2D graphics, by the way. It really fits the game's theme.I don't even have to say this game is worth it... Oh wait, I just did (gently press Add To Cart and follow the instructions...).[Rating: 77/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This is a very pleasant and addictive game. Very simple in its rules, the learning curve is just right to keep enjoying the game. Each main level has 3 sub-levels and at least one of each sub-level from the puzzle and challenge modes. Puzzle gets you to clear the level with x number of moves and challenge mode asks you to achieve an objective within a time limit. Great to play with friends as games are very quick and can be both co-operative and player-vs-player.			",71,32,0,5,7,0,13

												Critter Crunch is almost as addictive as it is cute. The graphics are very attractive. There are plenty of modes to keep you busy. Some modes are fast-paced, others are slow and require extra thought. There are lots of bonus levels. Also, rainbow vomit. It's super fun, especially if you like puzzle games, so get it!

												It's a cute little game, unique too. You feed a critter twice and it'll pop any critter of it's same color in a chain. To feed a critter have to go from small to large. There are power-ups that can be eaten by any critter size.Eventually the game gets difficult and becomes more punishing. You have to think fast and react quick later on. Eventually it does get rather tedious but does throw in a few new mechanics as you go in deeper. There are puzzles too that'll leave you head scratching and attempting many times.I haven't had any experience with multiplayer though.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												A fun, light hearted puzzle game. Offers a lot of variety until the the end of the ~6.0 hour campaign with a lot of extra challenged and puzzles afterwards too. The game itself has a good mix of strategy and casual gameplay. It's really satisfying to setup the board and then clear the whole thing in one move. Has colorful artwork and a good sense of humor as well.			",390,113,6,33,22,5,38

												DO NOT BUY BEFORE READING THIS.  If you are under the age of 10 you might love this game, if you are closer to my age of 30 you will most likely not like this at all.  The era of good puzzle games for all ages is gone as this is a total kids game.  No challenge for me at all and it even felt like a waste of time :(  I grew up playing games like puzzle fighters, tetris plus, wetrix, tetrisphere, yoshi cookies, dr. mario, and so many amazing others.  This game was a tragic HUGE step backwards in my opinion.  Graphically it's OK, Gameplaywise it's a sad state of tedium and no real puzzlement at all.			",440,60,15,43,39,4,69

												I'm not a big fan of puzzle games, but I enjoyed this one. It is basically a twist on color matching puzzle games like Bejeweled (although it is absolutely unique as far as I am concerned).  I think Critter Crunch is about as robust as a game centered around a single concept could be.  There are four different single player game modes, as well as two multiplayer modes.  The main mode is Adventure mode, which unlocks the other modes and includes some of the challenges and puzzles. Challenges are usually a more frantic pace with a set time limit, and puzzles  are more peaceful with no time constraint.  Each Adventure mode area has its own unique background, and new gameplay elements are added as you progress for even more variety.  The story of a guy studying the critters is shallow but fun.  Challenge mode consists of 55 challenges.  Puzzle mode consists of 100 puzzles.   Survival mode is endless.   For multiplayer modes, there are co-op and versus.  I really enjoyed versus where you go head to head with another person with some new powerups.  The new powerups are used against the other player and some of them are very satisfying.  The mushroom causes hallucinations.   Lightning in a jar electrocutes.  Etc. The final powerup is unlocked at experience level 12.  In order to find people to play multiplayer with, you will probably have to seek them out on the forums.  The art style is very pleasing.  The characters are cartoony.  There are a variety of painted backgrounds that are nice to look at but don't in any way detract from the gameplay.  The gameplay is simple, but it does evolve into challenging and is quite rewarding.  The music got a little repetitive for me, but I was never annoyed by it.  As far as value goes, I got this game on sale for $1.46 and have gotten 40+ hours of playtime out of it.  Wow.			",2216,988,68,262,219,23,308

												Critter Crunch is easily one of my favorite puzzle games ever and has earned its place among the ranks of such classics as Puyo Puyo, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, and Money Idol Exchanger. The game's gorgeous high-definition 2D art, deep (but not overly complicated) gameplay, varied single player modes, easy learning curve (in Adventure Mode), and thrilling fast-paced competitive play make this a must-buy for hardcore puzzle fans and casual players alike. The game is a terrific deal at full price and it's an absolute steal if you can get it on a sale. Highly recommended!			",219,32,10,20,11,2,31

												I owned this on the PS3 and was pretty happy to see it come to PC, and it plays about the same.This game kind of plays like an... inverse Super Puzzle Fighter?  Creatures come down from vines, and you feed them to each other to pop chains of like critters, with upward-falling combos, chains of fed critters, and special cirtter types to spice of the action.  The aesthetic is charming and is a wonderfully strong aspect of this game.The game features a 'story' mode to introduce you to the game mechanics, a puzzle mode, score attack mode (with online coop possible), a challenge mode, and an online versus mode.   The online versus is likely not thriving but if you can get a few friends (like me since you're reading my review!) to play with you, you're probably set.Pretty fun, I'd reccomend picking it up.

												This game is ridiculously cute.  From fast-paced challenges to puzzles that make you think, there are plenty of different modes and levels to keep you playing.  I could happily feed critters and puke rainbows all day. The levels can range from easy to very hard and some may even make you want to rage quit. However in adventure mode you only need to complete 3 per area to unlock the next set and once the other modes are open you can always skip levels and leave the harder ones for later. Overall I think there's plenty of challenge and gameplay for your money and if it's on sale it's a no-brainer for any puzzle fan.			",45,17,0,16,14,0,9

												I got this game to play with my wife.  She likes it, so I like it. We play it with USB DDR Dance Pads.I just wish the adventure mode was full co-op.  Multiplayer consists entirely of either one verses mode or co-op mod.  Would like some form of cooperative progression			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a matching puzzle game with several twists; you aren't merely match coloured grubs together but you are feeding smaller critters to larger ones making them explode in over consumption and all their adjacent friends of the same colour. It's wacky, adventure mode slowly throws new elements at you as the game progresses so you get used to the mechanics, there are versus and co-op modes and it's obcsencely cute. It reminds me of Magic Drop... if you played that game, I can just recommend based on comparable nature.			",358,111,5,39,15,1,37

												Really cute, creative, and fun. Picked it up on a sale, and it's fun and easy to play once you figure it out. There is a story mode, which has puzzle mode and challenge mode included, but if you want to shortcut to those modes you can do so at the main menu. Story is not the greatest thing ever, but it's pretty fun. They introduce new power-ups, monsters (I guess they are monsters), almost once every new area. That really is a bummer, because my first time playing I decided to go directly into co-op survival and we didn't know what to do, and had to play a little of the story to find out. The challenges and puzzles get increasingly difficult, and I really like that about it. The best part has definitely been the co-op. My boyfriend plays this with me, and he thinks it's fun and cute too. I only wish there was a story co-op! As of now, there are only two modes that can be played co-op, and those are basically a survival mode (It speeds up and you just try to get a high score) and a verses mode. You can play with two people on the same computer, or connect to someone online, which is nice. It works great with both the keyboard and a controller. It isn't a game you can play straight for 50 hours, but still, it was on sale, it was co-op, and worth it, because it's relatively easy to pick up and play anytime. I'd recommend this for people who like creative puzzle games and have a soft spot for chibi like graphics.			",85,11,0,21,10,0,5

												Critter Crunch is a super fun action puzzle game that was locked to PSN forever and ever and ever and that is sad. I own it there, but bought it again on PC so I can play on my laptop, not use a DualShock 3 Thumbhurter, and actually find a multiplayer match. It's a win-win!Now that it's been freed and exists on Steam, you should buy it so that you may feed creatures to other creatures which you then eat and vomit into the mouth of your child.Also the colors are really pretty.

												Okay, I have no idea why I got this game, whether a humble bundle, sale or whatever. But it is way more fun than it has a right to be. The character style is very anime-like, which I like, and the humor is tongue-in-cheek on the game's entire premise. The mechanics are different than any other coming-down-from-top, pop-the-bubbles/whatever game that I have seen. Instead of shooting matching bubbles from the bottom, you grab a ""critter"" from one column and spit it out in another. Your goal is to pop the critters by over-feeding them and gobbling up the crystals that come out (which is another running tongue-in-cheek gag). Sometimes if you get a large enough chain, you get to barf rainbow juice into your son's mouth for bonus points. I'm only about 4 main levels in, and each new mechanic they have added has been interesting without being too hard to pick up.Probably my only dislike so far is that I can't find a way to restart a puzzle level without just wasting all my moves and waiting for the critters to come beat up the main character (which was amusing the first couple times, I'll admit). Oh, and that the only way to advance through the screens (like tutorials, final scores, etc) is to click on a mildly-small button in the bottom right. Just a little hard to hit it quickly after being used to the fast reactions in the levels.			",34,91,0,1,14,0,11

												A very fun and casual puzzle game!  I used to play this on my old phone and was glad to find it on Steam so I could keep playing.  There are several different modes (adventure, puzzle, survival...) to keep you interested.  It plays well alone or on local co-op, and my USB controllers were easy to set up for it (I prefer the controller to the keyboard and mouse).  The graphics are adorable and the story is plenty goofy.  I've never had any problems with lag or bugs while playing.  I wouldn't mind trying out online vs. mode, but have never seen anyone else online.I'm a fan of puzzlers like Tetris and PuyoPop and this definitely fulfilled my desire for that sort of game!

												An unbelievably adorable puzzle game that manages to do its own thing in a genre dominated by unoriginal match three nonsense. In a nutshell, the gameplay boils down to feeding smaller critters to larger ones, which sets off chain-reaction explosions, themselves capable of creating further chains. You then eat the crystals resulting from the explosions for points. Some critters have special mechanics, such as bomb critters that explode, wildcard critters that can connect chains, or glowing critters that drop various powerups. It's a bit reminiscent of Money Puzzle Exchanger, with a splash of Puyo Puyo's rensa mechanics, for good measure.The story mode is diabetes-inducing, and the humor is spot-on. It even has competitive and cooperative online play, and the whole dang game is less than the cost of a pizza!			",518,97,7,59,30,1,51

												While the player base is (and tragically remains) consistently small, this is an excellent game that is highly challenging and yet still quite fun. If you like matching puzzlers, this is an cheap and fun game. Be forewarned, since the player base is so small acquiring any online challenges is a bit hard. Its best to do versus matches against friends (such as me.. if you get it please do so. I am almost done with the main game but have only gotten to play a few matches. Any time with a friend to challenge would make the online multiplayer badge significantly easier)			",242,108,1,22,15,2,31

												So, for those that don't know, this was Capy Games' first game as their own publisher (better known for Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes or Super Time Force Ultra). It's a puzzle game similar to Magical Drop or the obscure Money Idol Exchanger, where you're trying to line up critters on vines, using food chain-themed matches to ""pop"" all the adjoining critters of the same colors. The critters slowly march down the vines, and you lose if they manage to reach the forest floor. When you get a particularly long combo going, your kid will show up to be fed, and you can stop to vomit rainbows into its mouth for a big score bonus and a powerup- though the relentless march of the critters continues during that time.In general, it's a pretty solid system. Various special critters and powerups are introduced through the adventure mode - through probably a bit too slowly - that vary up things. Most of these are solid additions, though a few only bog the game down, like the toxic critters that rain down score-draining items on their death, or the morphing critters that change type and basically prevent you from making long-term plans.Graphically it's gorgeous for its age. Though it only runs in 720p, it was one of the early PS3 releases and has some neat Ghibli-inspired designs and animation, even if it isn't vastly varied. In general, it still looks pretty sharp and has a very appealing art style. Unfortunately, the less said about the dialogue and humor, the better - I realize it was probably written for children, but even on that level the random messages you get on a game over screen is almost all cringeworthy stuff that makes ""dad jokes"" look sophisticated and wry.There are three main modes: a standard play described above, a puzzle mode where you have to pop all the on-screen critters in a limited amount of moves, and challenge modes where you have to play to meet special requirements. In general it holds up pretty well, but like a lot of puzzle games, you're somewhat dependent on chance to get good combos going. At the very end of the adventure mode, sadly, you're essentially dependent on the RNG serving up the right playfield to complete it at the punishing pace it expects, which is a dissapointment.In general, though, it's a solid game and worth playing around with if you pick it up on sale, particularly if you have a puzzling itch. The number of innovative match-3 games on Steam is surprisingly slim, and this is one of the standout titles on the service if you're into the genre.			",506,140,11,70,29,5,65
