												JoWood's crowning masterpiece, Chaser is majestic in both scope and ambition. With AI straight out of a computer virus and storytelling on par with an acid trip, players will lose themselves in a nightmare love/hate relationship with this timeless classic.

												The one major card it brings to the table is its size - I've never experienced levels as expansive as these. Many of them can take a couple of hours to blast through. However, the complete absence of innovation, linear levels, tepid multiplayer, irritating vocal effects, and unspectacular artificial intelligence keep this title from reaching its potential.

												Really old first-person shooter with futuristic background, heavily based on the movie ""Total Recall"". Somehow, up to the moment, Chaser is the best game its creators, Cauldron, made for all those years.If you haven't played it before, when it was all fresh and comparable to the actual FPS on the market (2003, before such hits as Far Cry, HL2 and FEAR) - well, the game isn't aged well. If you're not down with old-school gaming mechanics, you'll most likely shouldn't try to play Chaser now. The game has many obvious and troublesome downsides, it is a real pain in the back for any casual nowadays gamer.However, if you happen to know the drill of the old-school shooters (where, for example, you need to hit crouch button in the middle of jump to reach higher altitude) - I suggest you to buy and play the game. It is a real deal challenge, especially on the hard difficulty. If you manage to beat it now, without all those modern features like flashing directional arrows, checkpoints and all-mighty recovering chest-high wall - well, welcome to the club, man!Let me tell you what was interesting in the game.First, it's the space. Not the out-world nothingness we call cosmos, no, I'm talking about really big levels. Almost every level here is huge, by every FPS standard. Sure, it's still a shooter on the rail, the most of the times there is only one possible route from start to end. But, that means kilometers of walking. Or driving. Or diving (there is an underwater level). Yeah, the most part of those wastes will be filled with primitive copy/paste textures - same trees, same buildings with the same posters, same decals inside buildings... But that practice is still all over the industry! And even brighter in that parade of uniformity looks some noticable cool things on the background, such as actual rotating of the space station in the intro chapter, with different stars and views of the Earth in the portholes. Or the funny snowman somewhere in the middle of taiga.All those big areas were made for the game to add some sense of realism. That kind of great achievement, when you to obtain some new thing have to actually do something, walk somewhere, elaborate, strive... and not just click two buttons on your phone to get all in your place - right away.Sure, not too many people would like to change the comfort of modern games which telling you what you should do, for something odd-looking and not providing you with the safe and quick routes.Second thing I liked in Chaser was the variety of missions. There is a sniping mission, where you need to protect a transport on its way through hostile military base. Exoskeleton mission, where you simply shoot your miniguns and rockets, defending the base. Stealth level, where you need to sneak around some goons to pick up some valuable conversation between some mobsters. Underwater level, where you swim... Swim, and then swim more, to get to some harbor ""undetected"". Well, on the way there are hundreds of aggressive droids which you need to shoot, and the route isn't too obvious even with markers, so maybe, that would not be the best entertainment in your life... But the whole game isn't! It's about to see of what you're made from. A challenge for your reaction time, coordination and patience. And your navigation skill.Finally, the story. Yeah, it's trivial for the most part, and its major pieces you'll recognize much faster than the game plot shows them to you. But, it's a long story, really comparable with the Half-Life by its length and number of events and changes in the pace and alignments. It's much better than modern ""don't ask questions, just shoot'em all!"" standards.Downsides are plenty, as I've warned you before.The levels are so huge, that the most amount of the game time you'll be wandering, where to move next. In theory, it's quite simple - just follow the blood trail, more precisely, go where there are enemies waiting. But, in every level, there are some switches to click, holes to jump in or crumbled ladders you're still gotta climb. Well, train your wits about it... or just watch it all on the youtube, like all weaklings do.The AI of your enemies... They aren't gonna find the cure from cancer, that's for sure. But their reaction time... Even if you catch someone off-guard and will try to shoot him in the nape, in a split second he'll be knowing where you are and shooting at you. If you ever played Counter Strike 1.6 (or earlier) with tough bots - that's them. Which is more - sometimes game spawns them on the cleared territory, behind your back. That's tough, unfair... but manageable, if you have your guts around.Finally, the proposed layout of the game keys is outrageous. Just change it right before the game start. You'll need your nightvision, 'cause it's usually night time around. You'll need a quick button for ""reflextion mode"" aka bullettime/slomo feature. Yeah, it's not that cool as in Max Payne or at least in FEAR - but it's still useful, especially on the hard difficulty level.Let's summarize again. The game is bad, by modern standards, it's not worth your time and money. It will hurt you badly.On the other side, if you're a tough son of a gun, who have many old shooter games as kindergarten toys... try this thing. For example, it's much more variable, than Die Hard Nakatomi Plaza. More realistic, in many ways. And when it's not - it's a challenge for you to overcome. So come - if you're ready. In my library, I'll give it not too high mark of 6.8/10. But I'll honor the Chaser and its developers, Cauldron people, for at least one decent and sincere game.			",725,238,45,156,102,5,232

												Extremely long, old style fps with some efforts at early stealth mechanics and vehicles. Good fun but can be a bit repetative.

												I'm glad to have played this game, but I have suspicions that I hate it on a deep level.  If you have patience, can enjoy a single-player shooter, and can enjoy pulp mass market science fiction writing, Chaser’s VERY LONG campaign will make you giddy and/or content. I would recommend the Easy setting, and I never say that about a game, ever. The visuals stay consistently interesting through the entire game, and the music will keep you company during the slow parts of the story. I found the ending to be worth it, and there were many novel sequences that I’m glad to have seen and experienced. It’s not for everyone, but it is worth a shot. Just don’t expect  Half-Life, and you might be pleasantly surprised.  3/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start by saying that this is not game for casual or 'modern' FPS players. This game was considered old school at the time of its release. It is a raw diamond and if you don't enjoy games that make you rage quit and then start again in 15 minut, stay away.  This is a kind of game that was made for hardcore gamers, by hardcore gamers. The story is nothing special, animations are mediocore at best and sounds are...just to be there. The maps are huge and completing one level can really take hours, especially if you get lost and circle for good 20 minutes, enemies are deadly even on lower settings and you will learn to save before every corner. Yet, if this is what you are looking for in the myriads of modern games, you will love it. Guns feel real, environment is diverse and detailed. Completing every level will feel very satisfactory and you will be sad once it's over.			",117,53,0,13,15,0,8

												Hello everyone. Before i start i would like to say that i have 50+ hours at least in this game off steam . So i have played enough.      To start with cons i have to first talk about glass physics,yes you heard it right since no one else seems to give a single F*** about this majestic system who has spent many days to make .This game has great atmosphere and visually still looks good even tho it came out in 2003 ,yes 2003 ,seriously it CAME OUT IN 2003 so no need to give it crap because of graphics . I saw some comments about visuals thats why i'm stressing that out . The atmosphere sucks you in and they nailed it because every new location you feel the change.I have to stress this out :The atmosphere is very very good .If you love that as much as i do you will like this game .The ambient sounds , music ,lighting and overall level design is great . This game has a lot of guns to offer and they all different and serve their purpouse . Gunplay is dated BUT it is good and you expect that from a old school shooter . Solid ,chrispy and precise . This game also has a storyline believe it or not . A good one for that matter . I strongly recommend this game to all old school shooter lovers like myself .Also this game is very well optimised and runs gloriously on new systems and supports fullscreen and it has very good chrispy fresh mouse input . No acceleration or any of that variable horizontal mouse sens BULLC***       Now we come to bad stuff . There is no such thing as a perfect game . They all have many  flaws . And i think that actually adds to a game a lot . Let me elaborate. You see, this game was made by a small studio and a staff fueled by pure ethusiasm back in the days when all you needed was a good shooter to be happy in your life . So this game is missing some  polish and you can clearly see that in some levels more towards the end and you start imagining this level design guy working hard on this level and you see his vision of the level and see what he was going for . That is the most rewarding thing in a game for me .Some later leves do lack some detail but i think i can look over that because i'm sure they just didnt had enough time to polish everything . The other problem is AI .Its there its functional so you might ask what is the problem and the answer is  its kinda dull . Yes you can say that about the 90% of games out there but that doesnt mean you dont want the games to have great AI everytime . But writing AI is very tricky so this game i would say is ok . i cant think of any other drawbacks to be honest . I wanted to write this review for a long time ever since i saw Funhaus guys play it . Dont get me wrong i love funhaus and thats what they do,bash games to make funny content but a lot of people interpreted their show as a review of the game which is stupid and unfair towards the game which ended up giving this  game a bad name and that makes me very very sad. This is a good game . If you read this far i think we can be friends .on this note this review is done . Take care. Kanan out.			",156,11,4,5,13,0,2

												this game should have gotten more attention. Sure, some of the missions (like the underwater one and the ""protect the truck"" one) are teeth-grindingly unfun, but the game as a whole is an epic, almost oddesy-length tale with more than enough gameplay to satisfy you. The game is brilliant, but the voice acting is awful. However, it doesn't get in the way of the levels, and the levels are incredible.Get this game. Just buy it. Seriously.			",375,3,9,4,1,0,3

												WARNING: Even if you are not prone to nausea, headaches, or just plain blurred vision, this game will cause it. Something about the lighting-camera combo just is bad, but nevertheless if you don't mind stopping after every mission to heave a bit(exaggeration) this game is hella fun. Sure, story is a ripoff of Total Recall (the original not the remake) and the enemies have the IQ of an ameoba, but it's a good time. Remember, saving is not automatic so set the hotkey to F5 or something easy to get to and use it often. Definitely buy this on sale though. Anything more than $2 is just punishing yourself.

												You know what I love about this game...It exists at the end of that small window in time between the original ""forced 3d"" shooter era of games like Doom and Duke Nukem, and before the modern era style of FPS took over.  It feels like a lost relic from a past era, and a hybrid of old and new concepts.That being said...this game is ambitious and really dumb in a ""so bad it's good kind of way"".  You will quickly form a love/hate relationship with every aspect of this game.The area to area shooting and combat mechanics are really quite good, but also really unforgiving. You can save anywhere, and you'll need to!Cinematics and voice acting are really rough, but not dull or pretentious. It's a lot of tough talk and mafia stereotypes. Now, the bugs and glitches...yes, there's a lot. They don't break the game or make it unplayable, but they do provide many good laughs.So...enjoy this old school dumb shooter and buy it when it goes on sale.			",119,12,20,41,10,0,13

												an ok older fps. has alot of playtime (most of it you'll be lost) and 19 chapters with some rather large levels, also some fun guns. bad stuff: * level 5&6 (i think) are horrid submarine boards but they only give 1 short one to the fun heavy armor. * the last few boards everyone has a 1 shot kill rockets that's allways better than improved AI right? * the dev that hid a tunnel in a corner, under some big gray blocks at the end of the last level should be kicked in the nuts. * being a dated game there is no auto save but you can save anywhere so save often or its back to the start of the level.story was meh. a cute twist in the end but some of the stuff leading up to it was dumb. i feel most of the story was just to make levels. if you only look at the 1st few boards and the last few the story is ok but the middle is trash.

												Chaser is about as generic as an FPS can get. It even has a useless pseudo bullettime mode.You start off the game as John Chaser wakes up in some sort of cryogenic chamber on a space station with no idea who he is or why there is a small army destroying the space station in a rather over the top attempt to locate you.You are immediately thrown in the action as the mindless hordes of enemies start attacking you from all sides as you make your way off the space station, through streets and sewers and even through a rather peculiar mini-submarine segment. It all feels very familiar though, it's all the same generic shooting you have seen before with nothing to set it apart.The weapons all feel like plastic, the enemy AI is about as worthless as a blind guide dog and the maps are made entirely out of black and grey boxes.The story is some of the most unbelievable manure you will ever encounter, not because it's surprising but because John Chaser appears to have no willpower whatsoever. Despite not know who he is, and everybody else seemingly knowing, he never bothers to ask. He also lacks the capacity to say no even when warned repeatedly not to go into the service of a particular sociopath. All in all, this is one of those you can actually play twice without realizing it because it is all so generic and forgettable. Nothing stands out and nothing has been given that extra effort.

												I just finished this game in 12 hours and I'm not somebody who like to rush while playing. I played it on easy difficulty, as somebody in this forum reccomended to do so, as normal difficutly in his mind was too difficult. Only on the last level I found dying frequently from the enemies and loading again and again. So I reccomend to play this at normal difficulty if you are looking some challenge, hard might be painfully hard. The ladders were the biggest enemie for me, can't recall how many times I fall to death while trying to go down on them. The grenade weapons are totally useless, even the normal enemies needed around 5 shots before dying. The ending is little bit dissapointing, I was waiting something else.I think this game is underrated, for game made in 2002 I think its aged well, the weapon textures still look nice. For 1,25e (was on discount) totally worth it. 4/5			",122,34,5,24,4,0,9

												I too purchased this game because of the Inside Gaming, expecting to play a stupid game for a little while only to move on to the next horrible purchase (Uber Soldier 2 anyone?)However Chaser quickly drew me in. Despite it's rough, and I do mean ROUGH, presentation in terms of graphics, A.I, story and voice acting, Chaser is actually really fun. The controls and shooting are refreshingly old school and they are really tight. The game feels good to play and is a good time if you can get past the rest of the crap that the game throws at you. 6/10. Pick it up on sale and perhaps you will surprise yourself.Insert arbitrary Jo Wood joke hereAye Aye Papen			",243,25,0,19,11,0,13

												Solid shooting, bad AI, and really, really horrible level design. Having TWO long levels of nothing but figthing machinegun turrets deserves special mentioning.Still better than majority of what passes for a FPS nowadays.With pricetag like that, you'll get your money's worth even if you drop it to hell after few levels.

												A must-play FPS with no equals.  You'll find yourself gladly trudging through quicksave/load hell repeatedly just to see what joys await on the other side.  Never before has an action game so perfected the art of storytelling.  Oh and there's a bullettime mechanic that the game never tells you about even if you play the tutorial.

												Chaser is honestly one of the most innovative games of the past, present, and future generation. After playing over 100 hours of this game, it's obvious where the inspiration for Bungie's Halo: Combat Evolved came from. Sure, it came out two years after Halo, but that's because they only saw Jo Wood's amazing design. If the investors had given him his $17.26 before, Chaser could've revolutionized gameplay for PC and would've put the Xbox and PS2 out of business. My favorite part of the game is how the enemies just run into the wall in such a beautiful way. Sure, some might call it a glitch, but I know that was there by design. When Jo Wood presented the concept for Chaser to his two cats and a parrot (RIP Jo Wood the Parrot), he wasn't just imagining another game, he was imagining the future!By far the most interesting character is Thruster Man. (SPOILER ALERT) Thruster man is a deep and well thought out character that I know Jo Wood put hours into creation. His one goal is to appear for 30 seconds, shoot at you 3 times, then continue off into the sunset. You (John Chaser) must help him out by shooting him, otherwise he'll keep going, never to actually come back and do his one job, which is to kill you. The chemistry between him and John Chaser is one for the ages. I will be sure to tell my kids about Thruster Man when I grow up.Overall, I recommend this game, and look wish Jo Wood luck with his new developer team, Homeless Studios.			",23,1,0,3,1,0,15

												I don't think I've found myself saying how bad a game is so often as while I was playing Chaser. Chaser is a run and gun FPS that is overly ambitious, and falls hard in just about every possible gaming aspect. I want to say it feels like a cross between Serious Sam and Red Faction, but to put this title in the same sentence as those other two is blasphemous.There are just so many bad things to rip on: The graphics are decent for a 2003 release although they could have probably toned down on the shiny, over-glossed textures. The shooter aspects are bearable and the story is kind of reasonable, albeit extremely disjointed and severely lacking any depth due to the main character's case of amnesia. Voice acting is respectable, although the character graphics make for a stiff delivery.If one thing stood out it's that Chaser is god awful too long. It took me over 15 hours to finish, but I'd say there's only 7-8 hours of real content here. All the excess fat is just mindless killing of never ending spawning AI in a maze of bland and boring visuals.The AI just sucks, period. They spawn above you, below you, behind you and you never really know where they are until you are taking damage. Toward the end of the game, the AI difficulty ramped up exponentially literally requiring me to quick save after each kill which reminds me, there's no auto save here so save early and save often. There has to be at least 1,000 grunts that are trying to kill you and there's not a whole lot of variety in the bad guys.The multitude of hidden passages and usable objects made it a chore just finding where you need to go next or what to do--no waypoints here. Some passages you even have to keep jumping until you get lucky enough to move on. But be careful because one wrong jump and you might end up getting your character stuck in that invisible crevice. Good thing you quick saved it just a moment ago right?Too many useless guns. Most of them lacked effective damage, especially the grenade attachments. Five grenades to kill one guy--really? Yet the enemy grenades are a one shot kill on me.I'm not even sure why I continued to press forward and complete it. I guess it was just a mind numbing case of hoping the next chapter would bring some clarity. In the end, I was left pretty much as clueless as when I first started.I'm going to go sulk in a corner for a while and reflect on the nonsense I just played. In the meantime may I recommend to you either Red Faction or Serious Sam instead of this garbage.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												This IS a good game for a MINDLESS FPS with copy and paste backgrounds, AI enemies that all look the same, and levels that go on far too long.It's NOT a good game if you're expecting: Good graphics, gripping storyline, games where the words actually match when someone is talking, or games where you have a good saving method.Seriously, the saving method sucks. You have to remember to save every 2 minutes or so, or else you're screwed if you die and have to do (possibly) long parts over again.It does, however, have a pretty good collection of different weapons AND the reloading of all of them is very nice (maybe the coolest/best thing in the whole game).So, in short, buy this if you want a FPS that you can breeze through, rage killing everyone without having to think too much or if graphics aren't too important to you.PS: Don't stand in the doorways on the first level as they can kill you when they shut. YES, THEY KILL YOU. How cheap is that? Sucks when you forget to save almost the whole level and then get killed by something as stupid as a door. A DOOR!			",314,142,6,31,21,0,34

												Man this game is hard. Even the first level kept me from playing for a while! haha. You definitely need to bring your Countrerstrike twitch skills to the table in this one. I wish I knew how to mod games (probably couldn't even mod this game anyways I dont know) I would make a full conversion mod for this and turn it into Doom! Like I said this game is hard. You don't get much time to aim up before they get you  back, but it's still fair. You just have to do what is known as ""trying"" get unrelaxed, sit up right, widen your eyeballs, try to FOCUS really hard and think about nothing but the task at hand. Get through the level full of baddies who will kill you very fast. The snipers can kill you in 1 hit. If they don't get you in one hit, then you still have low health and die. I hardly pay attention to the storys in most games anyways. Even if I do I still have no idea whats going on most of the time.....lol.......anybody got a towel? Anyways this is a solid shooter with a good difficulty requiring your every ounce of attention. TL: DR  Game is hard, save a lot, cant remember if there was difficulty, choose less then normal.  I usually choose ""normal""			",27,1,0,7,2,0,3

												ok so.. ive played Chaser a bit now. and id have to say, as relitivly nice as the game is, it has a few quirks for an FPS action game.Pros -  - - The game has a simple, relitively easy to follow plot. with a few small, but maby predictible twists.   - - Length. the game is complete, decently thought out, with several areas to experience in playthrough. each area is fairly unique and works well to make you feel immersed.   - - Maps. maps can go from small and clustered to large and open, a nice way to keep the pace of the game changeing and keep you from falling asleep.   - - Weapons. The game has a very nice variety of weapons, and does a nice job blending near scifi weapons with relitively normal ones.Cons-     --  Jump hight. the MAX value for jumping seems to be right at or just barly below the hight of objects you need to jump over, such as crates or low walls. several areas of the game are irritateing if nearly impossible due to needing to 'jump over' items that are supposed to be average jump hieght. it seems whoever programed it didnt think to set it slightly higher. this gets to be more and more of an issue in later stages of the game when you need to jump over 'instant death' obsticles.    --   Bugs. there arnt many bad bugs, but in a later stage in the game, their is a crawlspace that goes no where, and once you reach the far wall, there is an optical bugg that messes up the graphics. its simple to fix by simply turning around and leaveing the crawlspace.    -- Jump Hight.    -- The AI. The enimies are hard coded (cant think of a better way to put it) as there dosent seemt o be any way at all to 'sneak' up on or past enimies. as soon as you are in a set proxcimity they start attacking. even if you are out of sight sometimes. and while the AI fits the simple nature of the overall game, it can be 'slightly' disapointing that the most thought they have is move a little to the side, but keep shooting,==Jump Hight.==jump hieght==JUMP height==jump HEIGHT==JUMPHIEGHT.  so as i said.. their are a few cons to playing this game (jumphieght) but over all its a straight up shoot your way through (jump) game that might remind you of (height) the first syphon filter on Play Station. graphics are relitively similar. though, sorry, no taser.just remember 2 wordsits (jump) great (height)			",80,18,0,37,18,0,24

												Chaser is a first-person torture simulator.This game has a lot of weak spots, but the plot is not one of them. You play as John Chaser who is slow (and can't chase anyone unless he holds shift all the time). He lost memory and wants it back. Chaser travels the world to find it, visiting various locations. Random people help him in his quest (usually dying afterwards). Even though motivation of some characters is questionable, it is still hard to say that the story is bad.What's bad then? Everything else.Weapons have bad sounds and weak animations, can't feel the gun at all. It's like you shoot using plastic toys.Enemies are horrible in general. They have 2 modes: Bugged mode where enemy is stuck and can't shoot you (but still aware of you); Rage mode where enemy enters uncontrollable rage.First mode is fine, but second one sends shivers down my spine. Raged enemy can spot you even being hundreds of meters away. He can land shots while running backwards and capable of twisting his hands to shoot you without going out of hideout. Most of enemies are in raged mode and capable of 100-0 in like 2 seconds on normal difficulty (quicksaves are almost mandatory). Sound detection is horrible. Enemies can hear you walking and there is no chance to sneak upon them. Why does this game has a knife if there is not a single chance to use it? Enemies also like to spawn right behind you, right in front of you and they do that frequently.Game features HUGE levels with a lot of empty spaces and labyrinths. Prison level with red mist is one of the worst ones. Underwater level is vomit-inducing - what were devs thinking? Have they ever tried to play it more than once? Syberia level was a huge mess as well.Missions have a nice variety: sniping level, train level, sneaky level, run without weapons level, defend the base in exoskeleton level and underwater level. Others are just plain corridors where you run around looking for objectives and shooting enemies. Music is somewhat nice. Voiceover is so bad that it's amazing. Enemy battle screams are perfect (such as REEEEEEEEEEE and HOTSHOT). Protagonist sounds like he has Down's syndrome (which can be explained by the plot).Camera work and character animations are terrible, but that's what makes them golden. Chaser's face moves like in gmod poops, other npcs are suffering from cerebral palsy as well.This game is acceptable only in video form. Just watch it on youtube to save nerves and laugh during cutscenes.			",523,145,25,56,47,5,65

												Honestly this is one of the best games I have ever played. Sure, the graphics are outdated, that's where the level design comes in, doesn't seem so bad when the stages are put together rather nicely, makes it difficult to even notice the sharp edges and such sometimes. And the story is probably the best thing about this game, one of the best plot twists at the end by far, the outcome of the main character's actions is really unexpected. I've finished this game two times already, but I'll definitely get back to it again one day.Wouldn't say this is a timeless piece, but it holds up really well for a fifteen year old game. If you are interested in some sci-fi FPS action without all the overly-futuristic weapons and gear (these old school guns make the game seem even more realistic) this would be a great game to play for quite a while.In my opinion Chaser is probably only second to the original F.E.A.R, just because of better graphics and overall atmosphere, where Chaser holds its ground with the quality plot.

And one of the worst final levels in a videogame I have ever played keep this game from being all that memorable. If you have played all the classic pc games (Deus Ex, Half Life) i'd say maybe give it a go, as it really isn't all that bad..A solid 5/10!

												-Pros-     *Variaty in game play!          - Stealth missions          - Platforming          - Puzzle solving          - Escort missions          - Defend the Base missions          - Underwater missions (although they are probably the worst part in the game)             and a few others!     *Linear AND Open World Environments.     *Gunplay is pretty solid.      (guns can feel very similar though)     * Slow-mo mechanic.       (I didn't really need to use it but it's another option for players)     * Nicely paced and lengthy game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons-     *Graphical glitches can rarely occure forcing you to either restart the level or load a previous save.          (happened twice to me)     *Game has a tendency to crash for no reason.           (Usually when loading the next level for me)      *Surfaces that aren't smoothed can cause you to become stuck to either floors or walls; forcing you to restart.          (be careful of jagged rocks or little trenches!)     *Some levels have very poor optimization. You might get frame drops depending on what settings you pick.     *AI pathing poorly developed.          (It can be funny from time to time with the enemy, but if your escort gets stuck running into a wall...)      *You might get stuck on a mission because a goal or objective is not fully clear.          (some levels have hidden passages or ducts you need ...it took me forever to find them)     *Jail Escape level is covered with bright flashing lights that shine in your face every time you turn a corner. WHY???     * The Underwater Level. Good concept, but this level was poorly execucted.          - Very poor lighting          - Bad level design (it's a linear level but half the time I didn't know where to go)          - Your body snaps during certain sections making going through doors a fickle process          - Controls can be annoying to handle          -This level can be disorienting and make you feel sick if played for a long time     * Explosive weapons are bad.            - All grenade launchers are weaker than rifles           - Explosions do 5x more damage to you compared to the enemy.           - You throw grenades like 2 feet in front of you......? lol--------------------------------------------------------------------------Story-     *Animation was bad but I thought it was funny     *Voice acting wasn't too great.     *Intersting plot twist, but I didn't really care about the writting.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Miscellaneous-     * It's an old game so I wasn't too picky with the graphics.     *You can crouch-jump.     * Last level is full of soldier that spam rockets. They kill you in 1 hit....so be careful.     *You need to save often. There is no Auto-Save aside from mission starts.     *MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD. Not a big loss though.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion-Fun game if you like old shooters like this. I highly, HIGHLY reccomend playing it on the easiest difficulty for less frustration and maximum fun.I got it for $5. Very much worth that price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Starts off promising, betrays the first impression. The game starts off pretty alright, but the difficulty and mechanics are poorly designed. The game is built around a slow motion mechanic that slows down the game. It doesn't let you shoot faster or move faster, you still get hit like normal and bullets also travel like normal and the enemies just happen to be awfully accurate and have no problem downing you in just a few hits. That would be OK if your weapons were just as accurate and powerful, but they're usually underpowered after the initial parts of the game.I thought I'd like this game as some Rainbow Six type, but it doesn't pull off even that part well right after the starting sequence. The story is trying too hard to imitate a gritty American action movie from the period, either that or they didn't really care to put the effort into it - the voice acting is hardly if ever mediocre, the worst of which being our protagonist. Chaser sounds like he's not even taking his VO job seriously.  Speaking of which, the subtitles don't match the actual spoken lines  a majority of the time. And lastly, this game made me save scum. I don't ever save scum in a game, but the game doesn't even have checkpoints. It only saves after a new map loads, not during one. You die so quickly anyway that it's necessary.			",131,15,0,5,9,0,7

												This is an interesting sci-fi action-adventure game! I love the level designs and the music on this game. I also love the characters on this game even though Chaser will give out the cheesiest lines you'll ever hear. The graphics aren't that bad considering the timeframe on when the game was released. I got this game when it was on sale for like a dollar and something cents. That's pretty darn cheap for a very lenghty game. Yes this game is really long. It's so long that it's worthy for a let's play or gameplay series for YouTube whether the game is good or bad. :)I definitely recommend this game if you're into interesting sci-fi action-adventure games!

												Been really undecided on what to think of this game, since it has some good aspects and some not so good. In general, it's not a bad FPS game. If you like single player FPS games, you might like it, but it's a very average shooter in every sense, and a lot of the time it may also feel rather unpolished, so I can't really recommend it.One thing that is commendable is that it has an actual story, something that FPS games normally lack, but the story is spaced out by overly long and repetitive linear levels, in many of which you only have a couple of weapons to use, and the same kind of enemy, so you keep ploughing through dozens of the same enemies in the same corridors. The progression through the levels also feels the same all the time. If you say come across 4 doors in the area, I bet you anything 3 will be locked and 1 is open for you to go through. And on a few occasions when every door is locked, means you just gotta find a good old vent.The game also never really autosaves during the levels and there are no checkpoints. So if you've forgotten to save for a while and die for some silly reason, like falling off a ladder, then you'll lose a lot of progress. My very first death was in the first level, getting crushed by the sliding double doors. I've no idea who would build the doors to actually do that, rather than, you know, sliding back open again if someone is passing through.The enemies always seem to be aware of your presence before you even know they're there. They'll spot you for miles and across the other end of a large map. Sure, it adds to the challenge, but it's also kinda cheap and annoying. If I am being shot at, I'd prefer to be able to see who is doing that without needing to squint my eyes.I had to leave the game on a sniping section, which is equivalent to an escort mission, except you're sitting in a lighthouse and have to cover your allies in a truck that's trying to make it through a military base with enemies shooting at it from everywhere. Not sure if I'd be willing to continue anymore.Not a bad game, but feels very rough around the edges and has a mediocre gameplay. I was only really liking the story. This game could've been better off as a first person RPG, akin to Deus Ex, in my opinion.			",267,51,3,33,6,0,17

												Game and protag are called ""Chaser"", but you are the one being chased most of the time because reasons;also there is a horrible underwater level I wish I didn't play,aside from that, this is a solid FPS without regenerating health and with the possibility to carry loads of different weapons, just don't forget to quicksave, unless you want to repeat the level because lmaonochekpoints.

												This is an underrated gem. It's an entertaining, fast-paced shooter with suprisingly well-done set pieces for a budget game. The slums level early on is particularly well done. For $5 it's worth every penny, and you will get your money's worth and not regret it. If you catch it on sale, it's an absolute steal. The plot is half-way decent, although the voice acting will make you groan. All-in-all a great way to kill a few hours when you're between major games.			",304,58,0,76,21,2,36

												One of the bigger problems I noticed was when I booted it up for the first time it turns out this is a port from CD and not a very good one at that as it asked me for a CD key so I just booted it again than when I first got into the campain mode of this game it started with a cut scene which than went on for about 3-5 minutes well now that I have listed all negitives that I founed in my time playing let's list some of the positives the games defult controle setup is fairly well done only needs a few changes,the A.I is rather good but my favorite thing about it would be how balanced it is the hit boxes on the A.I maybe some of the best I have scene from a game of this period and it's got a Halo esc style to it although in some ways maybe a bit to much.8/10 Good if you want a decent halo like shooter.

												honestly, i would have been on-board with this game if the late-game levels were similar to the early levels, or if the late levels were simply cut from the game. the later levels are just awful. massive stretches of flat, boring copy+paste levels with no enemies in them half the time. it feels like they just made these levels huge and empty to pad the playtime, which doesn't make sense because it's a reasonably long game without them. but they're bad enough for me to not recommend this game at all. it leaves a good first impression but falls apart by the end.

Posted: June 11, 2016
												I played through the entire game.Thought it would be a nice retro-thingy 'cause I grew up with these kinda games.Glad I missed out on this one...oops ..  there is my opinion in a nutshell.Gameplay :--Movement : Responsive and great for what it wants to be.The jump is a bit crap, but there is crouch-jumping to get you over most obstacles.Found it a bit to easy to get stuck on level geometry, especially with slanted/pointy bits.--Combat :Nice veriaty of guns. There is a gun design for each environment. Kept me wondering what the next new gun would look like.Some of them felt very weak compaired to whenever an AI was using one.Hitdetection is amazingly accurate. You can shoot through missing pixels if your good enuff.--Puzzles :Well, MAZE..... thats kind of it.Ther were a few that needed a bit of memory, but mostly just maze.Objectives could sometimes have been better worded though.""find the missing part to fix the truck"" ... that is great, but what part am I looking for?--Difficutly:I played it on normal.'cause that is the standard the game is made with.The AI can be really stupid, or wait to set on a pre-determent path.I know its from 2003, but Kingpin from 1999 had better AI then this.Also the further you get the more OP the weapons get in AI hands.Surviving 5 grenades to the face while I cant take a small splashdamage then on 100% health. F-off.Take an entire clip of OP gun-vaporize-everything, but I cant survive a single shotgun bullet?Maybe because my character is'nt wearing a helmet... I dunno.It's probably balanced with the aiming skill of the AI. That sometimes cant seem hit a freak'n planet, even it there on that same planet.--Levels:--Graphics :Its a game from 2003 so keep that in mind.Some textures just dont age well.Even if you set it all your setting to max, some bits will just look like crap.--Level design :I'm a level designer myself so I did see where the designers of this game where going with it.With the limited stuff they got, they did allot. Lots of veriety, combined with changing gameplay.I was generaly impressed....untill the later levels.When the levels where starting to get bigger, and more confusing, getting lost is way to easy.Repeating textures dont work in your favour either when trying to find where to go next.There is a logic to making levels like: a prison, railsystem, or an underwater level.I found myself inside one of the bigger levels just getting bored stupid.I know the scale of the world is a big thing of this game, but damn.Consistancy with level boundaries would have been nice aswell.Invisible wall here, but a solid walk into death there? And in the next level that does'nt kill me? *facepalm*Also the hitboxes of some environmental object can really mess up your day.--Atmosphere :Nicely done.Every location felt the way it was suppost to be.From isolation in a space station to freezing your butt off.Event the main menu's music has nice little touches that made me intregued.--Story :--Plot : Interesting.Your imagination can go buckwild with the little scraps of story it throws at you every now an then.Lots of potential To bad it does'nt deliver. I could not be more disapointed when the credits started to roll.	Everything is resolved with a bit dialog dump in the end. +endings without closure are crap.--Acting :The acting in the cutscenes was for a 2003 game very nice.And then my character started to talk.Like the voice-actor was in a differend studio, another timezone, not located in this universe.I kinda expecting my character to somewhere go : ""Yes my fellow hU-mAns. You want to go skateboards?"".The rest of the cast was fine. They sounded inversted in what was going on.I liked that. Made me feel invested in wat was going on. --Overall : --The game sets out to be something, and 80% of the time it get that thing right.Even though I might be disappointed with it, I cannot say its a bad game.Every game has high and low points, and we mostly remember the low points.Like getting lost for 20 min, or waiting for a train your riding to finaly get wherever.Looking back I had fun with this game, but lacked a few vital points that could have made it great.I just had a way to many : OMG why?!!?! - moments in this game.Lot of potential wasted, in my opinion.

												Before we start i just want to say; Chaser is by no means as bad as people make it out to be.In fact, this is actually a GOOD game. Not SUPER good, not mediocore. No, it simply is GOOD.With that out of the way, we can begin.When i got this game, i went in, expecting a mediocore, if not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience. However, what i got was a lenghty, entertaining and mostly well executed game.For a game that was released in 2003, it both looks and plays very well. What is very obvious to me, is that Cauldron set out to make a visually impressive and huge game, rather then a story driven game.What i mean by this, is that the game's dialouge is completely off, and so are many sound effects, aswell as plot points.But, the enviroments, the characters, serval other visual elements and the shear size of the game, are not only amazing for the time, but also make up for the cons. I also want to add, that the screenshots on the Steam page for this game, are mostly from the same level, and are very misrepresentive of the game's overall look and design.Personally, i love the setting and design of the game, now it does use alot of grey and brown nuances like so many games do.But the fact that the setting and level design is a combo of futuristic and present day architecture is making it all the more appealing. It also sets the tone for the game, humanity beat down by political and global crisis, rebels, savages and mafia scum all fighting for dominance, all helps to give the game a very distinct and depressing feeling.One thing that most absolutely be commented individually, is the amazing 'breakable' glass. The glass will not break in one single point, it will break where ever you shoot it. Try it yourself, find a big juicy window and shoot out the corners and watch as it breaks as you want it to. Effects of this quality have not been matched by many games since, and Chaser defintly needs commenting for this. It is amazingGameplay wise it's pretty solid, nothing too special or underwhelming here. It functions as any good FPS game should, you also have the ability to slow down time using ""Adrenalin Mode"" this especially becomes usefull at later stages, when you run into many enemies at once. In latter parts of the game, everything becomes far more fast phased, and i had a short moment of throw back to the days of Doom. The cutscenes are a real joy, as they have some truely funny dialouge, and often awkward yet funny situations. The main protagonist's look at the world is truely funny, and makes me believe he is not right upstairs... That making him even more awesome then he already is.Alot of people probably want to know ""Does the game have many bugs? Is it unplayable thanks to them?"" the answer is; No.The game does not have any bugs, that hasn't been disregarded completey in other ""cheerished"" titles. The only annoyance, and this is not a bug, is the fact that you do not recieve any kind of 'response' when you take enviromental damage, or fall from a ladder. This can often cause you to die, while you thought you were beefed up on health. But it is a small thing, and incidents with it, are far and few between.Overall, this is a good game, and defintly one i had alot of fun playing. The game is insanely long, and this is done very well, as it manages not to drop in quality the further you get. (Though some levels are abit repeatitive.) The game also holds a nice challenge to it, even on the easiest difficulty, it can still be very hard.It is essentially worth every penny, of the 5€ it costs. And if you are looking for an old shooter, that has aged well, Chaser is one to go for. (with that price, you got no excuse)Thanks for reading, i hope this review has hooked you on getting this game. I am really saddened by the amount of hate that is thrown towards it, as it hardly deserves half of it.I hope you will enjoy it as much as i have.			",122,7,1,3,5,0,12

CHASERCompetent Old-School FPS ( recommended only to ""hardcore"" fans who like to ""dominate"" ) - the game is a veritable maze with huge levels ( guaranteed you will get lost ) - playing on hard difficulty is a ""chore"" ( there is a huge bottleneck at defend the truck & kill kabir missions - i found out about adrenaline when i was 1/2 thru the game , recommend to not use it for a harder challenge )  - what this game lacks is a lean around the corner mechanic /  huge + ultra wide screen support and  this game is very , very , very  long compared to games nowadays - 7/10 !

												I'll start this review of by informing people that there is a slo-mo like ability mapped to the caps lock key by default. As far as I know (unless I skipped it somehow) the game doesn't actually inform you of this and I only found out by pure chance when I spazzed on my keyboard trying to get away from an explosion...so yeah there's that.Anywho as far as the game itself goes although I'm giving it a recomendation it is a real mixed bag game design wise. This is probably a game you'll have a love/hate relationship with. Overall the gunplay is great. I really enjoyed the old school twitch based no iron sights shooting and good old fashioned health and armour drops. It's the level design that really starts to let this game down in the last few hours. The first level has you going through a space station with very linier corridors with very little room for deviation whereas the next few levels open up a little more. About halfway through the game the levels start becoming a little too open, with unessessary doors and corridors becoming accessible and some just plain huge open spaces with zero guidence or indication where to go next. This is bearable though and it's not until the last few hours that it just gets tedious. The game starts resorting to horrible half-life like platforming (crouch jump and all) and extremely obscure and hidden paths like barely visible vents and holes in the ground. The end mission is definitelly the lowest point of the game unfortunately. There's also a terrible stealth mission very early in the game but thankfully it's the only one and is over reletively quickly.If you're looking for a game with a cohesive story I would look elsewhere as well. The plot is all over the place and the cutscenes and voice acting are laughable. It's a shame because the game takes you to some amazingly different locations like a space station, gang infested city slums, Russian bases crawling with soldiers and even eventually to Mars for the 'big' conclusion. The amazing variety of weapons is fantastic and they all handle differently making each of them very situational. So in conclusion, if you're looking for an old fashioned shooter with some fun gunplay I would say pick this up. Even if you don't play it all the way through to the boring conclusion (honestly the story ain't worth it) it's still a lot of fun.			",465,53,1,79,32,0,55

												Here's the thing. You said a ""trilby is a fedora.""Is it also a hat? Yes. No one's arguing that.As someone who is a classy g[ent][le]man who studies classy headwear, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls trilbies fedoras. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.If you're saying ""hat family"" you're referring to the categorical grouping of brimmed hats, which includes things from bowlers to homburgs to tophats.So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people ""call the big ones fedoras?"" Let's get westerns and pork-pies in there, then, too.Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how fashion works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the brimmed hat family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the brimmed hat family fedoras, which means you'd call bowlers, homburgs, and other hats fedoras, too. Which you said you don't.It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chaser is an old-school first-person shooter that was obviously heavily inspired by ""Total Recall"" (the original, not the remake). There was no ""cover system"". There's no leaning around walls. There's just shooting, and occasional jumping, and puzzles, and more enemies. You started with no memory of who you were or what are you doing on a space station. As you fought your way out of the station and continue on your own path of self-discovery (and destruction), you piece together your purposes,but it may not be the truth, as everybody seem to know you as something else... Graphics are lame as this is an old game, but the action makes up for it. Just be ready for the shocking ending. :)			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												I find this game to be underatted its not amazing but it is a good fps. Its kinda unique for the style of this first off it's a futuristic setting but the soldiers use modern weapons like the famas. The story i found to be quite compelling it's not great but it is interesting. Gun play is not bad luckily you don't have any weapon limits so it's all fun and games here. Missions are decent the problem with some of them is that the maps can be confusing for the first time. Also the ai isn't very good they just stand there and shoot but i find them kinda fun to fight. The sound design is meh the voice acting is laughable, weapons sound like water pistols, and the music isn't memorable. It's a good game qnd luckily it didn't cost me much which is a good thing7.5/10 good game but has some flaws			",340,5,1,7,5,2,4

												Awesome game...underrated. Took me 27 hours on first play through. Longer than the original half life but not as fun eventhough you have adrenaline mode (bullet time). Found myself skipping the long storyline cut scenes to get at the action. Some very good level design with a good variety of levels although some were too long. Lots of great action but also lots of annoying bits. Great value for money and a must for any FPS single player campaign fans. Modern FPS campaigns can be completed in 5-8 hours so I was loving some extended retro FPS action.			",298,17,8,2,14,0,3

												This game is slightly above of being a generic FPS and has a interesting story. But at the same time it has so many flaws and a very stupid AI, that you WILL become annoyed. Enemies spawn randomly around you and will simply stand there and fire at you - completely forgetting their cover.I played Chaser on Normal difficulty, but it felt like it was set on insane mode - you would die after three or four bullet hits.tl;dr: I regret buying Chaser. DO NOT make the same mistake!			",126,8,0,18,11,0,18

I didn't care for the 8 minute intro that wouldn't let you use the mouse, but that is a small complaint.  I give it a thumbs up.			",1119,447,27,150,145,7,166

												One of the best FPS ever.That's the short review, but here's the rest.This is definitely the best game from Cauldron, a small developer that was able to make their own, amazing, engine (kinda like few other small ones, like Croteam). It's weird because many of the other games developed by them ranges from ""meh"" to ""uninstall right away"", and most are just average.That's why this one comes by surprise when you play it: it looks awesome, it's huge, has the old-school feeling that, even in those years, was getting lost, and has that something that makes you keep playing until you reach its end.It's not perfect by any means, and it shows its age in many aspects, but once you get used to its bugs and the quick-save key, you'll be fully immersed in this fun, and very hard, classic FPS experience.The main problem about this game is the enemies, that are able to see you and ""snipe"" you with any weapon they are carrying from any place they are hiding in. You always have to be on the lookout for them, and always have a cover spot to quickly use in case of an encounter (which, in most cases, is a multiple encounter). That isn't making the game impossible, but you gotta have a very good aim, even at normal difficulty, to take them down before they do the same to you (headshots highly recommended). You also need to save often, and I really mean it.The good thing is that this game uses healthpacks and armor bonuses, so you can just not collect them until needed, like we all old gamers used to do back then.It's easy to ragequit this game, because some enemies are simply unforgiving, or because you died and forgot to save close to there, but you'll come back to it until you finally complete it if you like old-school shooters. The graphics still are enjoyable to this day, in my opinion, because of the nice quality of the textures and models, the amount of the special effects (including the spectacular glass breaking) and the sci-fi setup. Good music and proper sound effects, though the voice acting is the usual B-movie kind.Last but not least, there's some variety in the levels. Not only in their looks, that are very different from level to level, which keeps the experience fresh, but also because of some different from the usual objectives, like sniping enemies from a tower, or diving underwater. This game has basically them all, just like in AAA titles.I have no idea if multiplayer still works or is populated. When I played this game ages ago it was basically dead already, but it felt fun when I actually could find someone online, with some different modes than just DM/TDM.I think that if you're a FPS lover, this must be in your library. I already had it from back then but I purchased it again on Steam while on sale just because it's worth keeping it around, forever.			",882,342,54,85,44,7,131

												This game starts really nicely, but pretty quickly becomes boring and repetitive.It has nice glass mechanics, so props for that, although jumping is a bit too fast and low.Rarely, but still, maps are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥, that it's hard to overcome some obstacles, or you just get stuck. Sometimes they're very large, despite that you use only small parts of them, and you have no idea where to go, what causes LOTS of pointless wandering (unless you say ""♥♥♥♥ you, sadists"" and check some walkthroughs).Enemies are... hard to say. Sometimes they manage to constantly hit you with an automatic rifle, while both of you are moving, from the other side of a pretty big area, and on the other hand, sometimes they can't hit you if you are like 2m from them. Near the end they're OP, when they can kill you (with 100% life and armor) with one burst nade launcher shot. Also, sometimes you get shot through walls and other obstacles. Yay.And you die a lot.IMO definitely not worth the time I've spent on it.			",914,294,27,112,113,8,168

												Chaser is an early-2000s FPS, similar to maybe Blood 2 or Shogo: MAD, but not nearly as good. I pirated this back in 2003 back when I was pirating everything, but had to stop playing due to a crippling bug about 1/3 of the way through the game. This left me curious, so I just recently went back and tried it again, which was a big mistake. This game is boring, repetitive, and has an ""exploration"" mechanic that works in the exact wrong way. There is a story in this game. It has some decent music for an early-2000's game. This game came out after both Deus Ex and Half-life, and so has no excuse for being as bad as it is. Someone must have liked it, though, because there are STILL MULTIPLAYER SERVERS up for it.			",574,130,6,48,35,2,70

												One Word: Avoid!Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like this game, I wouldn't have sunk that many hours of my precious time into it if I wouldn't. The starting levels hold some promise. The graphics, well, not bad for its time.But the problems this game has get more and more aggravating the longer you play it.There's a story, but you can't really attach to the characters (including ""yourself"").The levels become quite bland, the color schemes later on have little contrast.And then you'll get killed. A lot. In the same spot. Reload, try, Reload... That's not something I want to do in my spare time. I usually try to play through FPS games once at least. But this, for my own peace of mind, was uninstalled before I finished.My recommendation: if you by chance happen to have it already (from a bundle or something), leave it in your library. Others: there's a lot better games on steam for that price, low as it may seam. :-)			",334,56,7,57,26,2,82

The only thing, which makes me feel uneasy - realising of that there will be no sequel of this precious game. Sorry, goodbye, Chico.			",62,7,0,1,0,2,2

												The game is pretty awesome once you start playing it,but it has a really long-streched campaing and it is not for inpatient people.the graphics are decent and music is absolutely great,it helps you concetrate and be on your watch for incoming enemies.The voice acting of the main character (John Chaser) is not that good,it's like they weren't even trying.Once you progress further into the gameplay it becomes just typical dying and quicksaving all the time (really hard game,play it on easy).But game is a must-buy because it gives you an oppurtunity of a unique FPS gameplay (Bullet time/Adrenalline time) and many different sortes of guns (I personally like the sniper).The game deserves more attention and it is certanlly downrated.My personal opinion from 1-10 i'll give it an 8.

												When I was younger I remember having the demo-version of this game, which featured the Little-Tokyo and the following underground level and playing it over and over again. Maybe that's the reason I like this game so much.Anyways - Chaser is a true old school first person shooter. Long levels in which you might even get lost in your first playthrough but even though it's a shooter you will have lots of different experiences in this game.  Some examples - you flee from a space station, fight your way through mafia goons, defend a truck from incoming enemies and even have a long underwater level in which you have to fend off sentry u-boats while navigating through boat wrecks. There's also a very big range of your weapon arsenal that changes throughout the game. And, even though its from 2004, the graphics are still pretty good (if you turn your resolution up enough).Aside from shooting itself you have a Adrenaline-slow motion function that you can use against your enemies.Another important aspect of the game is the story about the Protagonist John Chaser and his amnesia, which is carried on by cutscenes and dialogues throughout the game. I give this game 9/10 because it was one of the first real shooters I owned and I'm never getting tired of the plain but awesome shooting mechanics in this game.			",153,22,3,25,15,1,21

												Not sure why this game is considered a classic- it can be seizure-inducingly difficult at times, with pinpoint-accurate bad guys that can drop you at full health with a couple shots, some horrible map design, and weapons that all have a similar feel to them. More often than not, I find myself reloading saves constantly after getting ambushed by neverending groups of thugs that have a bad habit of appearing directly behind me at the most inopportune times. Still, it can be quite fun, and it's challenging enough for those of you who are ace at aiming with a mouse. Worth a look just for the overall dev design and old-school feel.

												I played Chaser back in the days and remeber it as an awsome game.The game was kept in mind for the hours of going astray finding that one lever in a snowstorm and making my computer crash by trowing a grenade in a room full uf glass plains since physics was not predetermined. And it was worth it.When i saw it in steam my nostalgia cortex in the brain fired up.must. buy. chaser. now. must. have. buy. chaser. I did as my brain told me to. Chaser was on sale and but I would have bought it full price aswell.Sadly the minimum system requirements seem to have an upper limit aswell.What ran silky smooth at max settings on my (very) old rig has a framerate of four (4) in the menu on new one.Huh. Why is that so? Because it runs on my CPU and CPU only. ""But im a geek!"" i said ""I can simply toggle that in the Nvidia Control Panel""But that does not work. The game keeps ignoring and resetting my Nvidia Control panel thus annealing my CPU because ""#u©к you. Thats why."" And this is how I became the prince Bel Air I got my geek status revoked.I can REALLY recomend it. Even today Chaser still deserves to be in the Hall of Fame since it was a and still is great game. Sadly there is the chance you can not run it on your new rig.  ==> Buy it on sale and pray it works. Have emergency pastoral care on speed dial. Just in case. ",128,5,0,11,17,0,13

												Chaser, a classic FPS from 2003.The CloakNT engine remains one of my favorites, as I love its scalability, looks, feel, and editing tools. Cauldron pulled off some interesting effects in the engine like dynamically lit particle effects, tesselated water surface that reacts to gunfire impacts, hybrid static/dynamic lighting and shadowing, realistic glass/wood breakables engine, environmental effects (environment impacts scope ring [fog, ice, dirt, etc], emissives from bullet impacts (shoot pipes or pressured glass windows), etc. A lot of these things are absent entirely from modern games/engines. It is a sad testament to the negative impact of console gaming.The engine also is capable of rendering very large areas with long viewsheds with minimal performance cost. They did some really awesome things behind the scenes in the CloakNT engine, which is made even more impressive by the fact that the engine was created in-house from the ground up. Combat is pure oldschool and twitchy; good stuff.Music is superb, visual style is great (if inconsistent), and levels sprawl! They're huge, if sometimes a bit lacking in interactivity.I love the variety of environments you find in this game, as well as the various play mechanics you'll use along the way. Story is a cliche made of tropes and other cliches, but it works to good effect.Main voice actor sounds like John Wayne. What isn't to like?Multiplayer is fun and quick, a nice mix of Q3A and CS IF you can find a low-ping server. Lag compensation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at best and anything above about 100ms you'll start to have lots of wtf moments.There are a few cheaters unfortunately, but a good game can be had most of the time.Do yourself a favor and get it for the massive singleplayer alone (20+hours)			",381,110,19,5,9,2,12

												Well, I'll say one thing for Chaser: You definitely get a LOT of game for your money, especially considering that I got it on sale for a little over a dollar. This game is perhaps the longest FPS I've ever played. I finally completed it on medium difficulty after 36 hours of gameplay, (I know it says above that I put 47 hours into it, but I started a new game with 11 hours already clocked in). In addition to being long, this game is also extremely difficult. In fact, you will find yourself quick saving and quick loading A LOT; over and over again to get thorugh many areas and still maintain enough health and armor to advance further into the game. I don't think it's how the developers meant for the game to be played, but it's what needs to be done in order to complete it.Chaser is a very well done  futuristic, sci-fi FPS with a bullet time mechanic that tells a very interesting story through well written cut scenes, has a good musical score, (particularly on the Siberian levels) and will take the player from a space station, to various points on the globe, and finally to Mars. Ammo and enemies are plentiful, and there is a terrific variety in both weapons and level enemies, from space soldiers, mobsters, ghetto trash and punks, to Japanese buisness men. All are out to kill you. There is one level fairly early in the game called ""Kabir"" that is in my opinion the worst mission in the game. You have to defend a truck from waves of enemies but they keep coming and coming relentlessly, and it is so difficult, that I actually quit the game and didn't pick it up to try again until several years later. Aside from that level, the game is pretty fun. I recommend this game. As I understand it, it has quite a cult following, probably thanks to Inside Gaming's unfair treatment of it, (that youtube channel ripped apart some very brilliant games in my opinion - especially ""Legendary""). But I will tell you that by far, the biggest flaw in this game is that there are WAY TOO MANY times in the game where you have absolutely no idea what to do. Ya, it's one of those games. Even after you've killed all the enemies in a level or a certain part of a level, you will almost always be wandering around forever trying to find that one tiny switch, or that one elusive ladder or hole in the corner that is too easy to miss, to advance into the next area. A few times there are level puzzels such as a board blocking a door that you have to shoot from a distance, so that you can open that door later in the level, but if you happen to not see that board, you will be wandering around forever trying to figure out what you're supposed to do. Every level of the game is basically like this and it gets old really quick. You will be scratching your head until you finally figure out what to do, or have to resort to a youtube playthrough. Also, I should note that the game has a very interesting twist at the very end with a completely unexpected ending. It's a challenging game that is best completed if, for nothing else, bragging rights. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.			",731,96,46,89,28,0,26

												Underrated gem imo.  I loooove the very urban environmental designs and how huge the levels are.  The high movement speed and precision is also very satisfying.  I was surprised that there's actually a significant amount of story here too.  It's not a legendary story, but it's presented well and definitely interesting.  Beautiful weapons and environments.  The rigid, generic, even sometimes bare nature of the environments actually appeals to me.  It feels so uniform, so strongly-structured.Then they added a slo-mo feature with an adrenaline meter.  A very welcome addition.  The occasional stealth and some interesting twists make this game definitely worth a playthrough.			",227,20,1,18,10,0,6

I had never heard of it until I watched gameplay of it from the Inside Gaming crew. So far all I can say about it is that it brings back fond memories from old shooters and its not linear like most shooters are today which is nice to go back to. I am also having fun with friends who are used to linear games trying this and getting extremely frustrating. All in all good so far more to come later.			",115,7,0,15,13,2,15

												This is a unique yet strange game. It is really fun and its kinda like a combination between halo and hl2. The maps are massive and the gamplay is actually really hard. I made the mistake to play it on normal and although I finished it, part of me wished I hadn't. The voice acting is terrable and the storyline is meh but the locations are pretty cool. I could not believe the shear size of the game. The amount of time I spent playing this game is longer then any other FPS game I have ever played, about as long as my usual RPGs. A fun but somewhat frustrating game that I think will challange you. Play it on easy and buy for a 2 bucks. I think you'll be satisfied if you can manage to get through it.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Oldschool FPS with awkward physics and sometimes too much close quarters, but with awesome soundtrack and lively movies. Also, the plot has some twists (predictable ones earlier in the game and unpredictable closer to the end). If you have played this retro shooter earlier, but didn't finish it (yep, it's quite tough, I also managed to finish it only last year), take it on Steam when discount is right and make it through. It is worth playing.			",377,89,12,50,32,9,59

												What a truly terrible game, good grief. I started writing down things I found wrong with the game after stage one and I filled over half a page in no time flat. I'm tempted to just list them rather than write a proper review.First things first, what few ""plot"" points there are are ripped directly from Total Recall. In this game you take control of Douglas Quaid John Chaser as he proceeds to get his ??? to Mars. The first part immediately after you land is kind of neat and has decent cutscenes, but once you actually start to head towards Mars everything just turns into a mess and nothing makes sense at all. Prior to landing all the cutscenes are heavy flashing lights and shaking camera, and after they're just boring until the end.But people don't play FPS for the plot right? So the devs clearly focused on the gameplay! Right? Right?! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah. Bullet damage and health spacing is reminiscent of the original Far Cry game  (that is to say very high and very poor) without any stealth mechanics or decent graphics. Further the AI is dumb as bricks and appears to be only able to open doors as part of scripted events. If a door shuts in front of them expecting them to be staring you in the face later. 99% of your damage taken will be from some enemy you never saw aimbotting you from above/below/behind/spawning out of thin air. There is absolutely no enemy variety, just guys with guns. And oftentimes it's only one gun per stage. One particularly badly designed stage only has one model for said enemy too (the rest of the stage is a tiny little area copy pasted about 8 or 9 times). The hit effect seems to be bugged or just not implemented right as well so oftentimes you don't even know if you're hit from things, especially falling or explosions.Did I mention doors? There are a LOT of doors. A lot. And the ones you can use and the ones you don't look EXACTLY the same. But you have to guess which one is right. I cannot emphasize enough how tedious this gets. There is a general lack of direction in the game that will have you wandering around aimlessly; everything looks the same in most of the normal levels. And some of the dead ends REALLY are dead ends; you can't get back. And the levels that attempt to mix it up... well... One of them is generic sniping mission where the graphics are mysteriously downgraded to N64 tier. You get to protect a truck with non-moving wheels as it glides along a port. There's a 'stealth' mission where you instantly die if you fail. But the worst offender is an underwater one with 6 degrees of freedom and seriously screwed up controls. I swear I spent 10-15 minutes where to go on one part of it.Unsurprisingly there are tons of bugs too. I:Got stuck on geometrySaw enemies spawning on top of each otherCrashed several timesFell through the level attempting to do a required jump to progressAbsolutely disgusting/10This game is not worth it even for a dollar.

												First off, this game is the very reason that cutscenes often catch flak today. In this game, they are literally five minutes long, often being slow and burning as much time as they can get away with. The first cutscene showed loads of action that the player is not allowed to participate in. The next one shows a space station breaking apart as slowly as possible, taking time to show off what is now laughably obsolete graphics. (Their attempts to show off their graphics are even more hilarious when strippers and cleavages appear.) In one cutscene, the character was warned against a danger that got him in the very same cutscene.But enough about stupid cutscene/gameplay ratios, lets talk about the gameplay! Fairly early in the game, I met one of those stupid mandatory stealth sections where an enemy seeing one square inch of you results in an instant game over. The irritation there is enhanced by the game's complete lack of stealth mechanics. Not to mention that this section opened a plot hole; if the character is so valuable to his new owners, why are they so quick to murder him?""What about the combat?"" What about the combat! It's boring and irritating. It feels like you are playing counterstrike against an army of murderous bots, but with less strategy and worse gun mechanics. You die quickly, which would be fine if enemies didn't regularly spawn behind you. This game basically demands that you save scum through it.All in all, Chaser promises a mediocre experience, but delivers far less than that.			",92,3,0,4,2,0,4

												'Classic'. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!HL was a brilliant game and has become a treasure for humanity. Chaser is a terribly dull mess of a story, with dreadfully repetitive gameplay and the WORST map layouts imaginable. It falls into every gamecrafting pitfall imaginable, and then decided to dream up some new ones. Just don't get it, spar yourself!			",111,18,1,7,4,0,1

												While I think I got my 1€ worth out of this game, Chaser can simply not be recommended. The shooting and the movement have the right feel to it. The music has the right ring to it. You even have a decent plot line with lots of skippable cutscenes. The maps are huge and range from cities and skyscrapers to space stations. Even the graphics are good enough for a game from it´s era. Sadly these things are not enough as Chaser has some *serious* flaws.When a map starts, you don't have any enemies anywhere. Instead they get spawned each time you hit a preset location. At best this can mean enemies spawning to a room you just cleared a few seconds ago. Naturally these spawns make no sounds so you will simply have an enemy taking a free shot at you from behind. Very annoying. The other major annoyance relates to the huge maps. Sometimes you have no clue where you are supposed to go or what on earth you are supposed to do. At least 1/4 of my gameplay time was simply running around checking which door can be opened in order to go forward. The best indicator of being on the right track is that enemies are still spawning around you. Otherwise you need to start guessing. To make this worse, it is possible to get stuck in some maps after which you are forced to restart the map. You can also get stuck in a lot of textures. Mostly this is just a minor annoyance cured by hitting your jump key a few times. Sometimes this means going for your last save. If you have no quick saves, this means restarting the map.Chaser claims to have ""Highly developed AI"". In practice this means that AI always knows your exact position aiming at you in advance. Enemies don't always run straight to you though so I guess we need to give some credit for that. Instead they try to do some sort of flanking manouvers. The enemy also knows when you reload and will atempt to attack you during these moments. In other words you can sometimes draw enemies from cover by simply reloading your weapon. The AI always aims at your torso even when it is behind a cover. This made some fights quite hilarious. Another hilarious thing relates to scoped weapons. They make more damage with the same bullets when you have your scope on. Very logical.To wrap it up, Chaser has some enjoyable moments but they are wrecked by aimless searching and enemies spawning from thin air. Add a few crashes with no autosaves and you will be feeling great for actually paying to play this game. Good thing it only cost me a few dota items. I'd give it a 6 ½ / 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot reccomend this game. To anybody. from what I played this game is very confused as to what it wants to be, especially in the first part of the game. Either it wants me to play it stealthy, but then it throws encounters at me that I have no chance of completing. Or it wants me to be rambo, but the only gun they give me is burst fire and has the recoil of a sniper rifle throwing my aim halfway to the ceiling every time I pull the trigger. Or it wants me to just run through the encounter, but I don't have enough health to make it through anywhere especially since they gave my enemies stronger arms than me so they can actually aim their guns.If you want a retro shooter, pick up something like doom or duke nukem 3d where they bothered with the guns, if you want a running game go pick up mirror's edge, if you want a better stealth game try thief or deus ex. But I can't reccomend this game to you.			",440,91,6,81,46,2,87

												Played few a fair few hours of this game, but really didn't find anything that made me want to go back. Gunplay is simple, enemies even more so. No real physics engine to speak of, nothing that jumps out at you. I wanted to like the game, but wound up dismissing it as overtly generic. As such, I wouldn't really recommend picking this one up, except for at a stupendous discount, and when stupendously bored.			",164,29,0,9,8,1,13

												Its very difficult to recommend this game, it has so many design problems its difficult to begin with.From too many ♥♥♥♥ing guns, to somewhat poor level design, to arbitrary game length, to bad voiceacting,  to only 9 save slots, to a poorly done slow motion system akin to max payne.....this game is only good for nostalgia.Buy it if you enjoy the good ol days with no health regeneration and having to scrounge for med kits and etc.To put it as simply as possible, this is a game that did one thing great (The fire fights with reasonably killable enemies) and then mucked it up by adding all this garbage like an underwater level, to a foggy snowy area to an underground cave (To show off the engine I'm guessing).You could cut out half the game and it would be 100% better.

												This game feels like it was a bunch of lost potential. In fact, I had some fun with this one, and I figure with a little more polish it could have been remembered as a classic. However, there are two really big problems that prevent me from reccomending (or finishing) this... two problems that suck the life out of what could otherwise have been a decent shooter. 1) Bad Level Desgin: In this game, YOU WILL BACKTRACK A LOT. For every path forward there are twenty dead ends... and most offer no reward whatsoever for exploration. In a linear, story-driven game, this is an extreme indictment! Huge chunks of gameplay waste the players time and only bring boredom and frustration.But there are also little problems to level desgin as well... things you would not normally think about until they go wrong. I will use an example from this game: There is this level with a HUGE arena where a battle takes place. That is fine and well. But after the battle I ended up spending nearly 15 minutes searching for the way forward. There was this pile of rubble you are suppsed to climb up  and then a ladder above that. However, THE LADDER'S TEXTURE BLENDED INTO THE WALL TEXTURE. I ended up climbing that rubble no less than four times trying to get out of the arena and it was only on the fourth that I saw, just barely, that damned ladder. Linear story-driven games, especially, cannot afford this kind of BS.2) General Shooting Brokenness:The second major problem involves a lot of minor issues with the shooting itself, but which add up to make a mediocure shooter downright frustrating. I will simply list them out:-Enemies often point towards you and are ready to shoot at you before they have line of sight. Not only does this not make sense, but it also give them an unfair advatage.-Enemies, thier weapons, AND THE PLAYER can clip through walls and doors, leading to many a BS damage (and the occational getting stuck).-When one enemy knows of you... all do (think about the point at the top and see what problems that causes).-Lack of varety. Enemies almost always consist of the same type (man with machine gun) with minor variations (now man has sniper).-Samey corridor shooting. Rather than challenge the player with novel situations and varied, complementary ememies... 90% of gameplay is walking down a corridor and shooting the samey enemies. -The game seems to depend on random health and armour pickups from enemies to sustain the player. Given how rapidly 100 health can go to 27 (which in most cases is as little as two shots from death) this turns certain portions of the game into peekaboo nightmares. -Finally, there are rare enemies (man with genade launcher) which can one-hit-KO you. This is OK in shooters provided there is enough warning and enough chance to dodge. In Chaser... you get no such chance and have to simply eat a couple of deaths. Fix the p i s s-poor level degisn and tweak the shooting? And you have something fun I would argue. But alas, Chaser has these problems, and I cannot reccomend it.			",71,5,0,0,2,0,6

												Well I was really enjoying this game as something to pass the time on my laptop. Then, I reached the lighthouse sniper chapter and the game became more frustrating that fun.That chapter is basically a keep the idiot in a truck from being killed. Some people like that kind of torture. As for me, I used the handy console command to skip to the next chapter hoping to get back to the fps fun.No luck. I suddenly found myself searching for hidden lights in an underwater submersible which was uncontrollable in several areas of the scene. I even managed to float though a wall and get stuck spinning. Well, at that point frustration won. I uninstalled. Good thing I only payed a buck something for the game or I would still be at it.  This game could have been great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nine years later, Chaser remains the gold standard that all FPS games strive to meet. From it's sprawling single player campaign, to it's award winning multiplayer. Cutting edge technology. Suspenseful storytelling. Compelling voice work, so inpressive that they only needed one man to deliver the lines of 35% of the cast. All of it comes together in a package that Gamepro Magazine calls ""A milestone in human achievement"". Don't delay. Take the plunge. Immerse yourself in the timeless spectacle that is CHASER.

												This game is truly a masterpiece. It offers a campaign that is both intriguing and lengthy. (Yes, lengthy, I mean it. Like ♥♥♥♥ing 17 hours long.)The voice acting is incredible and it's so amazing that the developers had to cut it off half way through the game, or else we would reach a state of nirvana and wouldn't be able to complete the game.AI movement in the game is flaweless. When playing, I feel I really am fighting a militia that does nothing but walk into walls and move their bodies around at a pace that makes them seem like they're constantly having a seizuree. Truly immersive. Also, this game has everything. It's missions range from swimming into a wrecked ship and having no idea where to go unless you get those ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BALLS THAT SHOW YOU THE WAY to guarding a truck that knows how to drive slow and take the long was in a crucial escape mission. This shows how Chaser reaches to a wide variety of people and the variety totally doesn't take away from the game at all.The story in Chaser is also flawless. It feels like the Gods came down to the Earth and handed Jo Wood a golden enchanted pen to write the greatest story ever. And that he did. From the minute you start the game, you have no idea who you are or what the hell is going on. Only the Gods would have the capability of creating a story like this. Now, onto multiplayer. The servers for this game are VERY crowded because of it's popularity. It's almost impossible to find one because of this. But, I was able to play on a server, everything was perfect. The hitboxes were fantastic and I had no problems what so ever.Jo Wood is truly a genius. This game is revolutionary and has made a huge impact on the gaming world. It's a shame he is only asking 4.99 for this work of art.			",167,22,1,15,11,1,6

												I got this in a bundle and  tried it on hard. Screw that. The enemies don't so much have AI as they know EXACTLY where you are at all times.  Requireing you to die. A lot. Until you know their layout. And on hard even then you'll die. A lot.The story is just plain boring.When you have explosives you can't do anything with them ahead of time because the enemies don't spawn in until you get close enough. Unless you read the controls you won't know about the adrenaline mode or nightvision as they never mention either one in game.The enemies went to the school of hide around corners and then blast your face off.There were many times when I was going down a ladder or something and they just killed me off of it as I entered the area. Terrible voice acting.Many graphics gliches.In the beaten up little Tokyo level underground I constantly got stuck on the stupid bricks on the ground.At the end of the little Tokyo level you exit in a car that instead of going through an alley. YOU GO THROUGH THE WALL. As in you clip through it. This was a cutscene.It's horrid. And don't EVEN get me started on the clunky controls and mission setup for the underwater level.

												i got through the first level and a half before i called it quits. bad writing, the visuals are horrible, and the guns all have crap kickback. and i don't mean ""well its a cheap gun"" kick back, i mean you have to basically aim down and the gun goes up in a straight line. i got this in a bundle, and its from 2003, but there are far better games from that era. it really doesn't stand the test of time.

												Deal lord ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.Look Im not going to pretend Im done with it, Im not, not yet, and if anything changes during the rest ill get back to you but gawd damn it this game is terrible.Its a basic simple oldschool shooter, the enemies are however massive aimbots (no kidding) and that means they will hit you, upping the difficulty or lowering it does not change that, it only influences how much damage they do.On hard....yeah it becomes the twitch shooter to end all twitch shooters, and not a lot of fun.But the worst thing about it: the ♥♥♥♥ing gawd damn pos amounts of padding this game contains.Like holy hell I cannot emphasize this enough, the damn padding is off the charts!You will forget all about the main story purely because you are doing so much irrelevant bs on the side.Example?Someone wants you dead, you escape, land on earth, the government sends out a warrant for your arrest, claiming you are responsible for a lot of crap.Then you get contacted by a friendly individual you knows you (oh yeah...you lost your memory) and he warns you for mobsters who will force you to work for them, he tells you to leave town.You leave and BAM run straight into those mobsters....and yes...they force you to work for them.So there you go, now you got mission to do for damn mobsters which has nothing to do with the main story, FANTASTIC.And it keeps doing this, you keep getting lengthy unrelated bs shoved inbetween you and your damn goal.Its the freaking worst.Urgggg all the hate in the world for this game.Edit:Completed it now and my initial conclusion standsWhat a gigantic piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥br>There is potential there but the devs clearly bit of WAY more then they could chew.There is no story for 95% of the game, you are just doing♥♥♥♥♥♥for no reasonAnd then there are moments with huge plot dumps and well in the end it does not even make any sense whatsoever.I would rate this game at a 4/10 purely because of the amount of desire behind the project but I wont NEVER recommend anyone playing it.

												This shooter is too long, enemies are too accurate with their weapons, AI controlled allies are too stupid, and the voice acting is horrible.  This is the kind of game that you hit SAVE before you go into an area, get killed, and then come back to that point to know what to do next.  This game is the exact opposite of ""fun"".  I'm done.  I put way too much time into it already, and it's not entertaining.  Good thing it was part of a bundle and I didn't pay full price for it.Go play Borderlands, Dishonored, or Bioshock instead.  It will be a much better use of your time.			",836,204,54,120,86,10,161

												I'll make it quick:+ Story (with surprising, yet disappointing ending).+ Lot of weapons.+ Graphics.+ Stage themes (Dam, Japanese Style Building, Russian Base, Space Station, Mars Colony, Underground Tunels, etc.)......- Maps are MUCH TOO LARGE and too complicated.- No hints at all. I learn you can use adrenaline by YouTube near end of the game.- Dubbing. Mother of f★★king god. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night had horrible dubbing. Chaser cross that border. it's horrible² or even horrible³.- Sick hit system (ex. Enemies dies by hit their legs with pistol, but they can simply survive 3 sniper riffle headshots... Or they survive 2 rockets but we die by single hit that exploded 10 meters away).- Music. One song per stage, looped, slighty different from previous stage. BORING.- Lots of illogical things (ex. you open cells to let prisoners escape... You simply make prison break. In return - all prisoners attack you. Just like that).- Horrible labyrinth. Do not approach without video guide. I tried find the way by myself. I lost around 3h of playtime because of that.- Escort/Protect missions. Holy Madoka, just f★★k this s★★t. Characters run and stop whenever they want and just get killed.- Later parts of the game (on Mars especially) is a ""Love Story of Keys F6 and F9"". Quick save, quick load, quick save, quick load over and over. 30+ times per mission.- Underwater mission - FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU...- Bugs. Lot of bugs. Your character can freeze anywhere and if it does - you have two ways with same effect. Or kill yourself by granade and load game or simply load game. Yes, game had interesting (at first glance) story. It does. And I enjoy it at some point. Then I reach underwater mission when I finally clear it, I pray to Holy Madoka ""Make this stage last one..."" And no - Underwater stage is somewhere around middle of the game. Afterall game have lot of positive reviews, that's why I played it but... Decide yourself if you want to spent ~14h in this game... And if you start - play it till the end.			",633,177,41,71,52,3,83

												This game is a disaster, avoid at all cost. Poor balance of weapons (85 % of equipment is useless ! Explosive weapons do really small damage. In exchange enemies will kick our asses really hard with them), boring levels (even those ""more creative"" have ideas from such titles as Red Faction or HL), tons of bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animation (espiecialy in bullet time - seriously in 2001 we had Max Payne that crush this piece of junk into pieces with just one finger !), stupid AI and stupid voice acting. The only good thing i can find in this garbage is unexpected story ending. Either way the story itself becomes incomprehensible and absurd as the game progress in various of reasons. Honestly If you haven't had a chance to play this game and have played everything else in this genre since 2003 then you may try it but not necessarily. The game have good graphic (for 2003) but that's not too much for me. There's a lot of better games than this.			",144,23,5,17,8,0,22

The intro to this game feels much like Halo. But the gameplay is exactly like Alpha Prime.Although the AI in this game don't have aimbot and are stupid, you still die real easy and it makes the game just as hard as Alpha Prime.I almost thought this game was a movie, I beat the first level by just watching.But it's a first person shooter with the non-ability to aim down the sight.Multiplayer also doesn't work because GameSpy is no longer with us Rest in Peace.Meh, I'd rather play Halo: Combat Evolved.3/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												This one might've been impressive in its prime, but that was like 2004. We're talkin' original Xbox levels of gameplay and design here. Big levels might've been cool when you were nine and you wanted as much content as possible out of your Blockbuster-rented game, but the way it's done here adds nothing. Voice acting is a foreign concept in this game, and there's really nothing new here that you haven't experienced before.If you want slow-mo gunplay, go buy FEAR. If you want sci-fi from the Xbox era, find Advent Rising. If you really need something long and bland to run on your laptop, this one just might do, but really, go play Doom instead.

												Okay, so, I can see where the developers were going with this. It was made by a small studio, the graphics are very impressive for the time and there's a wide selection of guns, and it has very ambitious level design.Now for the cons, the game is completely terrible by modern standards. Every door looks the same and often lacks visual cues to tell whether or not it's accessible. The game frequently leads you into deadends full of enemies with no rewards, the bodies disappear instantly, the guns are all flat copies of modern weapons with no variations despite being set in the year 2044, the protagonist and his mafioso friend have garbage voice acting, the subtitles do not follow the actual dialogue, the game often subjects the player to seizure inducing flashbacks and finally, the tutorial instructs that if you want to jump higher you should jump, then hold down the crouchbutton. This game is sanity destroying in its confusing mix of good ideas and horrible decisions.			",371,66,0,71,46,0,90

												Chaser is a horribly buggy semi-competent budget shooter. There are only two good things about it; the guns and the music. The story and voice acting are so bad it's painful, and good gunplay dosen't excuse many deaths that felt cheap. Additionally, I've become stuck in various objects that lay directly in my path, forcing me to reload from a past save. On multiple occasions I 've encountered horrible graphical glitches that made the game completely unplayable (see my screen shots for this game if your curious). Anything unrealted to shooting, such as a biref stealth section, is so poorly designed that I have to wonder why it's in the game at all.The gunplay itself is a lot of fun. There are several guns, and all behave more or less effectively. There is usually only 1 or 2 good weapons that you'll find yourself using throughout a level however, so there really isn't much point in the decent array you have to choose from.The terrible enemy AI is compensated for with a reduced ability for the player to take damage and a high level of accuracy on the part of the AI. Any single enemy can kill you if you arn't careful, and there are a lot of enemies, but the enemies themselves die so quickly that getting through a level without using the time-slowing feature is a completely viable option, provided you have good reflexes for whenever the enemies start popping out from behind corners. The time slowing feature itself is hugely dissappointing, as it recharges too slowly to be any fun.I've seen estimates of length that go up to 50 hrs of playtime and higher. I'm over half-way through the game at 5 hrs. Excluding deaths, I doubt this experience is longer than 8 hrs.Lots of people love this game, and while the shooting is good, the stealth section and an underwater section where I literally CAN'T SEE have me wondering why.

You don't get to do some things your own way, and you don't get to know deeper about the characters, because the game's story progresses way too fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Mostly Positive."" I'm going to assume most of these reviews are sarcastic. The game isn't garbage, but it's not even close to being good, nor would I recomend it to anyone.The graphics look horrible, even for 2003 standards. Devil May Cry 2, Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, Silent Hill 3, and Max Payne 2 all came out in 2003 and look amazing compared to Chaser. It's true that graphics aren't everything, but this game looks so much worse than it should. More than a couple of times, I've walked into rooms that don't even look like there are textures on the walls or floor.There was even an instance where I was watching a cut-scene where my partner was driving, and my character was sitting in the drivers seat just talking. My parnter was steering from the passegner's seat, only to have the characters switch places back and fourth two or three times during the cut-scene.I'm about 2 and a half hours through the game and I have NO idea what's going on. The story is jumping around like the developers/writers had a severe case of ADD. Characters are being introduced, only to have them die at the end of the cut-scene. In one instance. a commander was whispering to his boss while they were the only two people around, and his boss was speaking like the commander wasn't whispering. Also, the AI is pretty dumb.This game is just... really weird. And not in a good way; but the gameplay is at least on par with some shooters from 2003.I plan on finishing the game, so... maybe the story will come together by the end, but usually if a game doesn't seem at LEAST promising within the first couple of levels, I don't have much hope for it. Maybe the game will become a little more fun and cohesive, but I highly doubt that.As it sits, I'd give the game the benefit of the doubt and give it a 2/5.			",356,78,13,34,14,3,20

												""Mostly Positive."" I'm going to assume most of these reviews are sarcastic. The game isn't garbage, but it's not even close to being good, nor would I recomend it to anyone.The graphics look horrible, even for 2003 standards. Devil May Cry 2, Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, Silent Hill 3, and Max Payne 2 all came out in 2003 and look amazing compared to Chaser. It's true that graphics aren't everything, but this game looks so much worse than it should. More than a couple of times, I've walked into rooms that don't even look like there are textures on the walls or floor.There was even an instance where I was watching a cut-scene where my partner was driving, and my character was sitting in the drivers seat just talking. My parnter was steering from the passegner's seat, only to have the characters switch places back and fourth two or three times during the cut-scene.I'm about 2 and a half hours through the game and I have NO idea what's going on. The story is jumping around like the developers/writers had a severe case of ADD. Characters are being introduced, only to have them die at the end of the cut-scene. In one instance. a commander was whispering to his boss while they were the only two people around, and his boss was speaking like the commander wasn't whispering. Also, the AI is pretty dumb.This game is just... really weird. And not in a good way; but the gameplay is at least on par with some shooters from 2003.I plan on finishing the game, so... maybe the story will come together by the end, but usually if a game doesn't seem at LEAST promising within the first couple of levels, I don't have much hope for it. Maybe the game will become a little more fun and cohesive, but I highly doubt that.As it sits, I'd give the game the benefit of the doubt and give it a 2/5.			",356,78,13,34,14,3,20

												This isn't a game, this is never ending torture.Imagine that you are a lazy, incompetent game developer, and you don't want to write any actual AI for the enemies in your game. You don't have to imagine that if you've worked on this game. Instead of AI you'll just make ALL the weapons in the game hitscan and populate it with aimbot enemies with one tenth of a second reflexes. But then you'll think to yourself ""Well now it's too hard for the player! But I still can't be bothered to actually do anything about it..."" so you'll just add a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥slo-mo feature to the game, realize that it doesn't actually work when your weapons are true hitscan, and enemies still react too fast, but you'll leave it like that because you're a hack developer.It looks like♥♥♥♥♥for something released in 2003, too.I didn't actually play it for almost 52 hours — I would play it for, like, two hours, Alt+Tab out of it, forget it existed for six hours, notice that it's still open, and close it, repeat next week.It is an EXTREMELY long game, though.

												Mars, 2044. The UN establishes MARSCORP (Martian Security and Economics Committee) under the leadership of Samuel Longwood. In the years that follow, the UN gradually loses control of MARSCORP, mainly due to the non-transparent licence policy of its director. Longwood uses his autonomous status to create vassal relations between the corporations and MARSCORP. The unshakable power position of MARSCORP is supported by the companies and thus they acquire additional rights and licenses. Longwood and his consortium become extremely wealthy from this arrangement. However, dissenting voices in MARSCORP begin to challenge Samuel Longwood's authoritarian policy. They demand his dismissal as director and a complete redistribution of the mining rights.But Samuel Longwood keeps an ace up his sleeve for occasions like this…Chaser awakens on board the spaceship H.M.S. Majestic. He doesn't know who he is, what he's doing here, why he is being sought by men in black uniforms and what they will do to him when they find him…The player's goal is to find out who Chaser really is and why he is being hunted. The story leads the player from the H.M.S. Majestic to Montack City on Earth, then on to Siberia and finally to Mars, where the trail ends and hopefully the truth can be found.

												There's exactly 2 kinds of enemies i've stumbled on at this game.Spartans from Halo and doors.Watch out for them doors, they want to kill you more than anything or anyone else. The spartans are basically incompetent compared to those electric doors.Overall rating 9/11 since there's spartans and i like Halo. (i still no reccomend tho :D:D:DD.d.d.)And remember, never stand in-between the doors for more than 2 seconds or you'll be turned into an human pancake. *KABLAM* ",989,380,25,133,92,11,119
