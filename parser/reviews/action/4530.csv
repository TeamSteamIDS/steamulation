												This game shocked me when I first played it. You don't actually shoot in this game, you tell your team where to shoot. I thought this game would be something like Ghost Recon, but as it turns out it is far from it. If I had to make a comparison of it to another game, I would say it's like Company of Heroes, and the way you your tell your infantry where to shoot, throw a grenade, where to breach, etc. This game is a great strategy game, and pretty challenging. When I reached an hour of gameplay on this, I was still on the first mission doing the tutorial. I recommend playing on Authentic (difficulty setting).			",295,70,10,37,40,3,42

												I played the first game (for xbox/360) and loved the simple command system that allowed you to pull off complex orders and plans. Ten Hammers takes away some of the simplicity of the original with new and complex mechanics that are a bit hard to get the hang of but once you do it makes the game better than the first. The abuility to make a 4 man fire team into 2 two man teams replaces bounding from the first game, you are now able to aim individual soldiers wepons inorder to eliminate priority targets as well as the addition of breaching and clearing buildings.  I will recomoned this game to any person who enjoys tactical/sqaud based staratgy games although I do recomened that you watch all the battle logs/tutarial videos and us a game pad.

												if you like a rather slow tactical military game which is squad based, then this is your game! :-) highly recommended!edit: after being stuck in level 5 (on sergeant major difficulty which is medium) and some frustration, i read this review which really gets it to the point: it´s kind of a masochist´s game. http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_tenhammers_pc?page=2still thumbs up, but will put my thumb down after the next try (on the - hopefully - more enjoyable sergeant difficulty) and fail. gaming should be fun, not work.

												I had this game when I was a kid on my old PS2 system and it was a massive part of my childhood. I loved every minuet of the first level back then (I couldn't get past that back then XD) and I simply forgot about it. Then I decided to look around for old PS2 games on amazon that I could buy and found THIS. It is still equally as good and graphically stunning considering when it was made. I know that this is less of a review and more of a story telling but I just had to write about what I have said somewhere. Buy this. If you can get past its somewhat difficult learning curve you will love it. -Alpha.			",56,0,0,6,18,0,10

												Ah the memories. It's a very good tactical squad based game. You command 2-3 squads depending on the missions. The goal is to point fire, suppress, flank, and eliminate the enemies. It's hard but worth it. Strategic and fun. This is not for casuals or kids. This game offers improvement over the first but some of the classic features are should have returned. It is still a pretty fun tactical game. It's a third-person squad based game. The story is pretty good, telling the lives and stories of each soldiers. It's pretty sad but it makes you feel the characters. The game is intense, fun and full of strategies. Though there are times when enemies are unforgiven and spawn behind you, especially on the hardest difficulty. Can be annoying and frustrating but it's a fun overall game. I just wish they can make a third in the series, despite all the characters had ""moved on"". Still would love to see this kind of gameplay! Fantastic game, 9.5/10! Play it!!!!!!!!!

												Dated it might be, but this game is definately worth a look. A fun, challenging, and quite honestly, punishing tactical game. You control a few different 4 man squads (squads can also be broken up into 2 man buddy teams essentially creating mini squads) and sometimes a vehicle or other special unit. The story and story dialogue is a little cheesy, but I honestly don't care. The gameplay is great and the combat dialogue is surprisingly responsive to what is actually going on. You task your soldiers with breaching rooms, moving to corners, taking cover, laying down suppressing fire, throwing grenades, covering a sector, etc. Even on easy difficulty the game is very unforgiving and can be challenging, especially when you're just starting out. Send your troops charging into the room recklessly? They're gonna get dropped by a bunch of AK-toting sand-dwellers. Have good ol' sarge run out from the corner into the street? He's gonna catch a tank shell in the face. Decide to jump out from behind cover and say boo? All your guys are gonna die. Or if there's an enemy with an rpg in a window and you decide it's not worth moving your squad from behind your lovely flowerbox, you're going to have to casevac an entire squad. Basically if you don't play it smart in this game, you will lose. It is challenging game and requires the use of real tactics. Have your LMG trooper lay down suppressing fire so you can move your second team into a flanking position. Lay down smoke so you can enter a building to get an angle on the enemies in cover. You get the idea. Great game, well worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I just wanna say that this game is a bit of nostlagia to me, so I may be biased. :/With that said, I can say I really like this game, even thou it sometimes makes me wanna throw myself outta tall buildings, yet still, you won´t find better on this concept. It gives you somewhat good look at guerila wars today with huge changes from the first Full Spectrum Warrior. What the first game lacked, the second brings. Soldiers are sometimes acting stupid, but you just have to slowly learn, trust me. I would still wait a while to buy it on sale, in case the game is not for you.			",25,1,6,5,3,0,12

												Unreallistic gunfight machanic.This game ends up ordering your squad to throw smoke, change cover, split, flank, repeat. If you don't flank in this game there is no way to eliminate enemies. Limited ammunitions make the even more impossible and unenjoyable. One good thing is, you have the feeling of middle east war and tactical scenarios.			",130,5,0,5,8,0,6
