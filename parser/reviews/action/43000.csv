												I used to love Front Mission, when it was a tactical RPG. Now, it's just a simple shooter.Even if it's still a good game, it's not a real Front Mission for me.If you've never experienced the ""real"" Front Mission, it's OK.But if you know what the Front Mission games are, you'll scream !

												I'm an avid Front Mission fan and I knew before playing that this game was bad, but I had hope that it wasn't as bad as it was made out to be, but wow, just wow. TL;DRBelieve every negative review about this game, it's bad. Regardless if you liked old FMs or not, don't waste your money.ProsThe wanzers for all they're worth are really nicely rendered.ConsBugsThe game crashes a lot. It's 2015 (at the time of the review) the game was created in 2010 and it still crashes because they didn't bother to fix its bugs forcing you to replay missions especially the on foot sections.StoryThe story is bottom barrel garbage. It's like an extremely incoherent version of the worst Gundam story mixed with a poor interpretation of Front Mission: Gunhazard's story mixed with a heavily Americanised story akin to modern FPS at the time. Instead of crafting a compelling side story in the universe of Front Mission we've come to know, we get the ""it's a reboot"" trope with everything starting in New York like in the movies with a dumb plot with an even dumber love interest inclusion. I'll let that sink in. It has no saving grace.Sound and AudioThe sound and audio are mediocre at best, as nothing stands out. The game's score has that Hollywood like feel which you'll recognise from the start screen and is extremely generic and lacklustre. It doesn't have the inventive score capacity displayed in the prior entries.WeaponsThe weapons you equip feel so underpowered, either that or the enemies are enormous bullet sponges.CustomisationCustomisation is garbage whether you're an old Front Mission fan or a newcomer. It’s nothing too complex, but just poorly done. You earn money in levels to buy parts to customise your wanzer, nothing out of the ordinary right. In prior games, before buying parts you'd normally select the parts, see how it looks on your wanzer then look at its stats against what's currently equipped. However in this game you can see the stats but you don't get a preview of the part, all you get is a picture with poor resolution under the stats. So if you want to view it on you wanzer you'll have to waste money purchasing it and once bought, there's no way to re-equip your previously equipped part unless you repurchase it...I'll let that sink in as well.You can now paint each part (limb) separately, it sounds nice until you realise how much of a hassle it is. Each part can be coloured differently via a colour wheel however it's rather fiddly and doesn't remember colours when you want to recolour other parts. So if you want to use the same shade of a colour throughout your wanzer good luck remembering and finding the colour.AIWhy do you even have AI companions if they're going to be utterly useless? Your partners basically do nothing throughout the game. Sure they can shoot the enemies but what's the point if they do no damage and I mean no damage at all. Here's an example, missiles do a decent amount of damage where 4 missiles can reduce basic enemy health by a 1/4. However, when one of your partners fire their missiles in full barrage of 4, the enemies take no damage...I kid you not. I stood behind a building (so that the enemy wouldn't agro on me) in amazement as my partner fired barrage after barrage and watched the enemy’s health and it stayed at full health regardless. When the prior games used AI partners in certain missions, they came to work often outputting just as much or more damage than your squad. The enemy AI is even worse than your partner's and I'm not taking in a dumb kind of way, I mean in an unfair kind of way. If there's a fire fight between your partners and enemies, the enemy AI's aim is potato but once you get into the picture their aim goes to pin-point laser assisted accuracy. Also, they become affixed on you no matter what, disregarding your partners altogether.On Foot SectionsThe on foot sections are so generic, under developed and buggy. I wonder as to why they were even included. When you dismount, you're equipped with an assault rifle and a rocket launcher which can take down an enemy wanzer with 4 shots. Now you might exclaim ""4 shots?! That seems overpowered"" and it is considering it takes 16 missiles while in wanzer to destroy basic enemy wanzers. Before anyone says ""But, you could've dismount in FM3 and Gun Hazard"" and while true once you'd dismounted, you either had to run for your life or find an unpiloted wanzer as you're squishy and only equipped with a pistol which did 1 point of damage. If it takes 4 rockets to take down a wanzer then what's the point of being in wanzers to begin with.Out of place Wanzer DesignsThe wanzers designed specifically for this game do not match the current long standing design the series has or is known for and comes off as being out of place when compared. What you get is something more akin to concept sketches or anime with unnecessary sharp edges, curves and skulls as opposed to the rectangular or circular geometry.VerdictYou know you're in for a rough ride as a fan when the mispronounce wanzer as wanzer instead of vanzer in the opening cutscene. I tried to like it but it's a terrible game with or without the FM series applied biases. It brings nothing new to the table while poorly accomplishing everything which existed prior. Everything about this game is a let-down, from the incoherent story, poorly implemented customisation, forced and buggy on foot sections, generic audio offerings and unlikeable characters. Square-Enix should've had more confidence in itself and released a turn-based tactics game with the improvements that FM5 made as that was the most perfect version to date. Can I recommend this game to long-time FM fans who may think ""that it's not that bad, right?"" No. Can I recommend this game to mech fans hoping for a new game to play? No. This game has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If you're looking for a FM game to play do yourself a favour and play FM:Gun Harzard, FM3, FM4 or FM5 instead.			",76,8,3,5,2,1,7

												Alright, let's talk about a game I bought because it was cheap and I based only on the screenshots. NOTE: I never played a front mission game before, I know its more of a strategy game but I am basing it off what I was presented with ingame.Gameplay: The combat in my opinion is VERY satisfying, explosions are loud, your enemys explode violently and their husks ragdoll to the ground. You can dismember enemies to weaken them or just shoot the center mass to kill them outright. I am pretty sure when you dismember them you weaken their overall armor but I only noticed this with the boss fights. Combat is pretty tough, I died 22 times throughout the campaign on normal You can also skate around like every japanese mech game ever which is basically when you slide around using jets and somehow not scraping up your mech's feet. Combat is somewhat on the faster pace with the skating with you and enemies and the general low health of both parties. Also the game does a good job making it feel like you are controlling a mech, with your mech stomping around when you are not skating and the screen shaking (not the bad shaking where aim is crap, the good shaking where your crosshair does not move) Most of the guns feel powerful aswell. Customization is fun and not that restrictive. You make a 'Wanzer' (from the German word ""wanderpanzer""; wander for ""walking, and panzer for ""armor"") using differant arms, legs, torsos, weapons and backpacks. I must admit I am disappointed at the lack of digitigrade legs and tank treads, but their is plenty of parts to choose from.Graphics: The graphics are nice, characters look like humans and the mechs look like mechs. Cities are detailed and blah blah its a game from the modern age all games look amazing nowadays. Enemies can lose limbs (well you blow off the armor to reveal the inner workings, which looks cool as hell) Sound: The sound is good, the guns sound cool and explosions are loud. The voice acting sounds a bit weird at some points of the game, but its not that bad.Story: Alright time for the story, you play as Dylan Ramsey as an engineer working to make wanzer prototypes and while going on a test run, some  major sh!t goes down in New York. Time to head into battle with little thought! You mainly are looking for your father but its kinda dangerous because enemy wanzers, troops and tanks want you very dead. That's about as far as I will go with story because I don't wanna ruin it. The story was not the best in my opion but it kept me intrested all the way through, course it has everything from violance to romance (lots of♥♥♥♥♥♥blocking, may I add. (why is that word blocked? What if I use it in a non vulgar way such as setting up a gun for firing?)) I also will add that the bosses are puss!es and run away alot, BUT when you do kill them its sastifying. Conclusion: I went in with low expectations, but I was pleased. The game is fun and I played all the way through in one go. The game is 6 (My profile says 5.9 so I am rounding) hours long, this includes retries from death. I do have a complaint for the story, difficulty spikes and some cliche crap here and there, but I had fun, that's all that matters, right? I never played Front Mission before and I know this game is very differant from all the others as the others are turn based strategy and this is a thirst person shooter. I can see how fans of the series can be disappointed but I say, atleast give this game a chance. I give it an 8/10.			",373,16,5,17,27,4,57

												FME is a great game. The single player is great, BUT the multiplayer? If you are getting this game for multiplayer prepare to face... nobody. if you want to play with your friends tell them and then you can play a LAN game, but other than that, it's empty. Even though the game has no multiplayer it is a great single player experience. Thank you, and i hope this review was helpful!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the previous Front Mission games and they were brilliant! none of them failed to entertain me. However I can see they've tried something new, a real time action game. Being a fan of the previous series, I bought this game. It's an okay game, but its very repetitive and gets boring. The graphics aren't the best either and the weapons variety is very low. Weapons look the same... and I was looking forward to the FV-24B vulcan from the previous games. I did not see it unfortunately :(. Ah wells... I can see they're trying a new thing, but it hasn't gone well and the Front Mission series has officially been announced. Over.			",93,2,6,4,3,0,8

												If you ever played any of the Front Mission series before or if you are a fan of the Armored Core Series then you will enjoy Front Misssion Evolved.The movement, mech customizing and game experience is very much like the Armored Core series putting you in the action, allowing you to boost, skate, hover, use melee, fire weapons from your left and right hands and your left and right shoulders.You can buy and equip upgrades to your mech, allowing you to change the arms, legs, torso, left and right hand weapons, left and right shoulder weapons and your backpack.You can even customize the appearance of your mech. You will also find a nice assortment of weapon upgrades to equip; light machine guns, medium machine guns, shotguns, shields, melee weapons, gatling guns, bazookas, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, missile launchers and more.So really, if you are a fan of any mech style game then you will enjoy Front Mission Evolved.This is definitely a game worth adding to your Steam library. :)			",3037,1198,140,413,490,48,555

												Well, this game turned out to be a disappointment. I bought it remembering the amazing experience I had with Front Mission III on the original PlayStation. Sadly, this can hardly be compared, let alone even be called a FM game. While FM III was a turn strategy RPG, FM Evolved is a third-person shooter - a rather huge step away from the franchhise's original concept. However, this alone would not bother me that much, provided that the game was enjoyable. Sadly, this was not the case. Here's a list of 10 things that in my opinion make this game a failure:1. Generic plot - insert ""save the world"" template here and supplement it with a handful of overused cliches. 2. Boring characters - a yet another bunch of two-dimensional cliches you couldn't care less about.3. Unconvincing voice acting - there is more emotion in the sound of a flushing toilet than in the voices you hear in this game.4. Failed customization - even though there is a variety of wanzer models and parts to choose from, the default model is so OP in comparison that you will always go for it.5. Annoying enemy AI - this game should be called ""Dylan must die"" because every single enemy is hellbound on targeting you. It doesn't matter how many allies you have in the mission or how much closer they are to the enemy than you - every single hostile unit will aim and shoot at you regardless of the distance or circumstances. 6. Failed role system - because of the enemy AI, you basically cannot play as anything other than mid-to-short range brawler. Wanted to play as a sniper? Forget it - the enemy will never leave you alone, regardless of the difficulty level.7. Annoying bosses - fighting bosses is almost entirely luck-dependent as most of them have one or two ridiculous attacks that you can either hardly avoid and/or survive.8. Failed ally AI - your allies are useless. Completely and always.9. Human mode glitches - when running around as a human, prepare for some uncooperative controls and random kicks to Windows.10. Lack of a save option - the biggest failure this game has to offer. You simply cannot save by yourself and are subject to the mercy of the autosave and elusive check points. You will have to replay a lot when the game kicks you out to Win, and trust you me that it freakin' will.Not worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Summary:Front Mission Evolved is a third-person mech action game published by Square Enix. Overall it's something I'd expect from perfectly average game. Graphics and sounds are ok, whole action part is just about shooting and punching tanks and big mechs while controlling a big mech (except the on-foot parts). It's not a bad game but it doesn't deserve a recommendation at all as there are so many better games in TPS action genre.Pros:- Average gameplay. Don't expect something to get really excited at, just shoot or punch everything and try to enjoy it as much as you can.- Modify your mech. More assault rifles, more rocket launchers,... or just a better design, spray mechs like your cars in Need for Speed style! Or if you just don't want to customize your mech, you can select a premade one.- Steam achievements.Cons:- Partners' AI. Don't expect much help from them, enemies will even focus on you anytime. They don't die, they don't help. They want to watch and make you feel like you are not alone.- Story. Just expect cringeworthy and really uninteresting story, this game is based on action.- Dead multiplayer.- Linear campaign progress. That wouldn't be bad if it wasn't so obvious. You just see that's always ""beat those enemies to move to another sector"".- Average gameplay. You can spend your money better, buy this only if you are really bored and there's nothing better on sale.			",2522,961,92,292,276,21,356

												This game is abyssmal. The only reason why I finished was because I put money in it and I didn't want it to be wasted. With that said let's get to the trial. Where to begin; it's boring, I just wanted to quit halfway through the game, but you know, money spent, and with that said lets get down to the boring aspects. My biggest gripe is the weapon system, a single gun alone is underpowered, I went into battle weilding two, in addition Front Mission Evolved puts an emphasis on shooting body parts, such destroyed body parts leave the enemy at a disadvantage, which really doesn't matter because you blow them apart seconds later for the effect to be relevant.The gameplay is very linear, the game won't let you play certain missions unless you have a sniper rifle, kind of legs or something or other. The controls are also pretty clunky, mouse movement is fine but the controls on your keyboard are a different story.Speaking of which, you get a relatively small variety of weapons, rifles, SMG's, swords, sniper rifles, shotguns, and shields (why the ♥♥♥♥ are these here?), but you also get should mounted weaponry, which are pretty nice, mainly missile launchers, rockets, miniguns. These help out a lot, because as I cannot stress enough, your guns are pretty weak. Not to mention the sniper rifle is useless in boss fights and around the end of the game. The guns also have an overheat system, as do the shoulder weaponry, pretty annoying, like the SKATE's recharge. However you can also utilize just a sword and shield if you want a swordsman style gameplay but I'll touch upon that later.Then comes along the movement system, walking is mind numbingly slow, as such the only way to get around is to use the SKATE System, and the disadvantages mean life or death in some cases, burning out the entire charge for SKATE forces you wait 8 seconds for a recharge (or less depending on customization), a lot of stuff can go down in the time, especially near the end of the game, and that's time nobody has either! You also get the EDGE system, time slows down, you become invulnerable and deal out godly amounts of damage, the EDGE system is recharged through fighting.The enemies are all cookie cutter-type enemies, they pose no challenge, little threat, their just...there pretty much, yet they remain durable enough for me to need two guns, at times a new type will be introduced but really it's just the same thing with a different gun or body type. This all makes the combat and gameplay repetitive, as the only things getting changed up don't make an impact, and there are no enemies that try something dramatic or pull a twist., it's 5 types, they're all fodder. There's also bosses, and around the end you fight 4 you met earlier and you fight them alone, pretty darn difficult, only interesting moment really.The story, CLICHES GALORE and it's dull and typical like a lot of things Hollywood pumps out. Unknown bad guy decides to be a terrorist and destroys space elevators to make a statement about the world, and the young perky engineer guy (protagonist) must rise and stop him. No plot twists, it's just...bland. Which brings me to the characters! Oh boy are you in for a treat! One dimensional! The characters don't change, they don't adopt new viewpoints, get different outlooks on life, you know the symptoms, voice acting is fine, but the catchphrases are a pain. Hope you like cutscenes, you'll get endless amounts to progress the story.With that said lets get down to the maps, LINEAR ON-RAILS SHOOTER HO! Summarized it, you're forced down a path with the same enemies (stated earlier) all to get to something. With occassional breaks into large areas to move around and fight enemies, bosses, only to be shoved down the same forward path again. But it's got collectables laden along the way, a ♥♥♥♥ton, have fun finding 20 sensor nodes in nooks, crannies, you name it. However there are three emblems per level, these unlock decals and emblems for your mech, basically the only collectables that matter.Now from time to time, you won't be fighting in a mech you'll sometimes be on foot in third person, and the weapons selection is small, rifle, rocket launcher, shotgun, grenades, and the enemies this time around are just as cookie cutter! The on-foot segments are a change of pace, but they don't break the monotony, as it all delves back into the same formula as when driving a mech. Same goes for gunship landing segments, however, I did find those a bit fun, mainly because I got guns that were actually powerful, but it all boils down to 'circle area, and land.'Are we done? Nope! Remember when I mentioned that bit about swordsman style, well were getting into customization! Now to the games credit, customization is pretty nice (of course, they posted it all over the videos and pics). You get to compare weapons, body types (this is the armor), backpacks, legs and arms, and really you can customize to some pretty big lengths. There are three types of legs, bi-pedal, multi-leg, and hover, their all just about the same though as what really matters is the skate system, but multi-leg does let you carry more heavier weaponry while hover gives you more manuvering. You can change up your weapons to become like, a dual sword weilding person, a heavy sniper, or just do what I did and fit as much OP stuff on as possible.Backpacks give you all kinds of benefits, more energy for SKATE, anti-missile systems, more power for carrying heavier weaponry, faster recharge, movement and such, and the game won't force you to use a certain kind of backpack for missions. And while were on customization, you can choose decals, colors, you know the jist.But the biggest incriminating factor about this game is the fact it has multiplayer, BUT NO ONE PLAYS IT, it's dead. makes the DLC pretty useless, along with the customization and decals mentioned earlier. Also to addon is that the end of the game, the final part, is very unforgiving.All this combines to make little to no-replayability.The designs and looks of the mechs are pretty nice though, that's the only redeeming factor.TL;DR: Front Mission Evolved is boring, linear, on-rails, and it's a massive time sink for such boredom, multiplayer is non-existant, the story is dry and flat, and it's all stuffed behind pretty graphics. Don't buy it. It's not worth anything.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""SQUARE ENIX AND KONAMI HAD A CHILD APPARENTLY!""FRONT MISSION EVOLVED; is a third person mech shooter attached with occasional third person shooter, mowing down other mechs called Wanzers, tanks  and human soldiers. (SPOILER BELOW)Story 5/10: Nothing significant or different from any other giant mech stories(anime to be precise). Basically you, son of the E.D.G.E system's creator (it's a special wanzer engagement system) have to save the world from a terrorist threat and an A.I that is...... it's basically Eagle Eye, MGS4, Terminator all over again......but it's with rideable wanzers... I guess that's a sell....oh yeah and you'll have a relationship with a girl who has PTSD so that's a plus.Mechanics 6/10: The controls are easy enough to comprehend......and perhaps its too simpleThere are two parts of this game which are; The mech battles and the third person shooter combats.You can upgrade your wanzers by customize four parts which are: head, right and left arms, and the legs.You also can costumize the colors of your wanzer extensively. This includes; The color, camo pattern, decal and the glossiness of your wanzers.Your wanzers also can be equipped with melee weapons and shields for close-quarter encounter, standard firearms (rifles, shotgun etc...), extra guns/missile batteries mounted on both of the wanzer's shoulders and a backpack as a passive aids in battle. Each of those weapons and parts can equipped with skills cards (of some sort) to enhance your arsenal's ability like explosive ammunition and so on (though they are pretty limited. The E.D.G.E system is basically the Devil Trigger so okay.The third person part is pretty simple; you got your rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher and grenade at your disposal but no personal collection of your own weapons so no customization here.Gameplay 6/10:  Most of the time you'll be killing wanzers or blow stuff up either as a wanzer yourself or occasionally, a turret section from a carrier. The boss battles aren't as varied as most of them just behave like any other wanzer, just more aggressive and equipped with better weapons. Though there are two boss battles that is actually fun to fight which are the mobile fortress and the AI Core in the final boss battle. The game is relatively okay, no part of the game is broken or glitchedThe gameplay is bearable but a bit too simpleThe graphics is pretty nice If you're a mech lover, this might interest you If you're not, skipping it wont hurt anyone 6/10			",91,6,0,3,1,1,4

												Front Mission Evolved. Not the best title I've seen in most mech shooters but I will tell you this before I start dropping bombs of disappointment; for a long time I watched a lot of Gundam and I technically count as still a fan. I will however admit the characters in that show were so lifeless, or just uncreative, no offense to any fans of the franchise but let's be honest. Romance in an all out mech war? I'm not a big anime fan, but come on let's get some armor crunching and guns blazing going on here! Now before I go on a rant off this topic let's get down to the story, you're probably thinking ""Wow! this game has giant mechs tearing into each other and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up like crazy! EPIC!!!"" well unfortunately no.Like in Gundam the characters are either hot headed dumb asses that rush into battle without any plan as to what in the hell they're doing. Or they're negative, boring, cold, and just unreconizable. I hate it when characters are just badly scripted or written out to be this ""mysterious badass"" it's not like I don't like those characters it just depends on how well you can write a good character to be that way. The plot: not much to it really, in fact none of it is really that important or interesting in the least. But for players who don't want it spoiled: basically what happens is humanity builds continent sized space stations that have the occasional boarder lands battle or two, nothing too serious just humans being humans. So they replaced the military with giant mechs named ""wanzers"" yeah I know it's a stupid name to call a mech if anything it sounds like a lot like Robin  ""jee wowzers Batman!""  However a random terrorist group attacks New York and later completely destroys it. You then play as some stupid kid that constantly rushes into fights without a second thought named Dylan. So Dylan later finds out his father has been assumed killed in the assault on New York he then vows he will strike a blow for vengeance on the terrorists that murdered his father. And what better way is there to claim revenge? he of course joins up with the army! actually they walked up to him and just said ""hey kid, wanna join the military?""  because that's how recruitment works... he then blows everyone in his path to kingdom come! You will later fight different mentally disabled bosses along the way and eventually when progressing in the game Dylan will get involved in the most awkward randomist romance I've ever seen in a game. Yeah I don't know who was writing this thing but obviously he/she did not watch Gundam wing or Gundam X. Seriously! a cookie cutter romance in a 3rd person mech shooter? if it was a 3rd person mech shooting RPG then I might give it a pass. But shooters and romance don't normally mix very well together, like Halo 4 for example, however that had more ""awwww"" moments like Mass Effect but also had ""why the hell is this in my first person shooter Halo game?!"" moments. In the end Dylan just randomly decides his Pheromones were stronger than his logic and hooks up with that ♥♥♥♥♥ that constantly yells at you to do stuff in the start of the game, whether you like her or not, you're stuck with her! and to those who have played Mass Effect imagine it like Miranda was the ONLY romance option in the entire game....Yeah, no thanks...Multiplayer: it's not ""perfect"" but it's a hell of a lot of fun to play,  when you get decent gear and weapons of course  it's more fun than the crappy campaign they gave us I'll tell you that much. However due to the lack of people playing the game finding a match is like digging in your back yard for hours looking for dinosaur bones  and no, you are not in China so your chances of finding at least a Tooth is slim to damn nill.  But if you can convince your friends or your girl friend to play this game you won't regret blowing off some steam in a giant mech twice the size of my Kia. Now for character customization. Yes there are tons of parts to use but they can only be unlocked through multiplayer or story mode. And since barely anyone has a match up you will not be getting the parts you want unless you open up a group on steam or you get people you know to play it. Either one is challenging so pick your poison. Also one of the problems with gear in this game is; you can't cross campaign mode character progress such as armor and weapons to multiplayer. This of course results in newer players being nothing more but cannon fodder until you farm for better parts within ranked multiplayer matches.Final verdict: this game get's a solid 6/10, it could have been a 7 or 8 if the story was at least half decent but that's my opinion on the game. Now does it belong in your library? that's your choice to decide. But I suggest getting this game while on sale before thinking too heavily on it.I however only suggest it to any loyal mech fans like me but only as a last ditch choice if you don't like Hawken or any other Mech shooter out there. Because trust me, this game is not a ""MUST HAVE!"" it's a cheap game you can look at if you are completely out of games to play or a game you might seriously consider getting. but it is not an epic mech shooter like a Gundam game would be like so don't expect some awesome showdown like Gundam had becuase most of the time the bosses are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and feel like a chore fighting. So until a decent Gundam related mech shooter is released or better yet a Gundam game entirely I suggest this game to mech fans out there, but again only as a last resort!			",112,1,0,6,2,0,16

												It is incredibly hard to explain how bad this game is unless a) you've played it or b) you know the level of ""quality"" Double Helix Studios are known for.The game is a plodding disaster that takes the worst ideas of the Front Mission franchise (which is usually a turn-based strategy RPG...), and adds in ones that it avoided for ages (weapon overheat mechanics, limited ammunition, on-foot cover shooter segments). There are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of collectables, which is how you both gain new skills (hint: these are very handy) and cash (which is also handy, even though the cash system in this game is kind of a trainwreck?).Do you want to track down, and this is not a joke, an average of 23+ items PER LEVEL? Some in on-rails shooter sections, some that you have to find in boss fights or arenas before your targets die and you're forced onward? Or enemies who will stunlock you while AI companions break randomly? Don't forget how slow you move in overly-large levels, or the wait-for-a-recharge special attack mode you'll basically require in most fights to speed them up.The biggest sin of all, though, is that the game is BORING. HIDEOUSLY DULL. I could totally get into this as a mindless action game but it has cutscenes that go on FOREVERRRRRRR and takes itself deathly serious and none of it's worth a♥♥♥♥♥♥while the same 5 enemy types fight you all game and nothing ever breaks the monotony up. There was a single interesting boss fight. It was a 4-on-1 fight against an entire merc company and in the end everyone had TOO MUCH HP to make it anything but a slog. That's the highlight! That's the peak of the game!Do not buy for any price, do not play, avoid at all costs.			",2445,961,89,309,287,27,386

												Great game for those who have tried Armored Core, Macross vfx/SDF-1, Hawken, Titanfall.I'd love to see more people playing this game... It's great. I have played the entire series from the start. Front Mission 3 being my favorite.Imagine the Stryder titan from titanfall on Steroids. That's what you get here.			",36,0,0,0,3,0,1

												I recommend this game to fans of Front Mission and giant mechs, but only if you can get the game plus all of the DLC on a decent sale - it's not worth the full price IMO.  Also, if you are on the fence about this game then you are probably better off not buying it.To be blunt, this game is not remarkable, but it does provide a taste of 3rd-person wanzer piloting that I've often dreamed of.CustomizationWanzer customization has always been central to Front Mission games and fortunately this one doesn't fail to deliver.  You have a reasonable selection from which to customize your wanzer parts, weapons, abilities, etc.  You can set yourself up to be a slow tank, a thin-skinned but swift machine or anything in between.  Then you can choose between a variety of weapons including assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, missile launchers and more.  There are also backpacks that add certain perks.The color scheme editor allows a great level of customization as well.CampaignThe story isn't amazing but it gets the job done.  You'll work your way through the missions, experiencing a variety of challenges as you go.  Certain missions demand specific loadouts and there is no single loadout that works under ALL circumstances.Although there are some challenging moments the game is relatively easily, except when it comes to some boss fights in which the bosses can seem massively overpowered.  At this point you'll probably need to read a guide to learn what the best loadout is and what tactics to use for the battle.There are segments occasionally in which you are in your wanzer while loaded into the drop-heli with dual chainguns and missiles that you get to use to unleash hellfire on enemies.  That's always fun.CombatThe combat is entertaining.  Skating around enemies while blasting them with a variety of weapons and locking on with your homing missiles while using your own jetpack to dodge enemy fire can be rather fun.  However, the controls will take a little time to master before you can get to this point.EnvironmentThe environments leave a little to be desired.  They kind of remind me of Armored Core levels on Playstation 2 which always felt somewhat empty and lifeless.  At the same time, they aren't entirely uninspired.MultiplayerMultiplayer is dead, sadly.  I bought the Last Stand DLC because I love that type of game mode, but unfortunately I've never been able to play it with another player.  You can play it alone, but you get no XP for upgrades and it is rather monotonous making it completely pointless.			",66,0,1,1,3,0,8

												I just finished the single player campaign and came away pretty dissappointed.1. The story is the most cliche'd nonsense conceived.  Things happen, no real believable development and it sounds like an 80s cartoon with so much focus on the gameplay gimmick, all wrapped up in your standard pretentious references.  The acting is bad, but ....given what's there.. can't be expected to be better. 2.  Given it's essentially Armored Core lite, you would think they would stick with the gameplay in the former series, but nope.. not a chance.  The part selection is rather shallow, the AI is somehow dumber than in the former series, your partners aren't good for anything and the most serious fault is the on foot sections.  Why include the onfoot sections?  They are an interesting idea, but the execution is like an afterthought.  The control/feel for the on foot section is really bad.  You could call the overall mech game weak, but the onfoot sections are terrible.  At least the aiming in the mech sections is forgiveable.3.  The sound effects in this game is straight out of Transformers the movie.  It is terrible, nonsensicle and has such a presence that I was annoyed from start to finish.  The music is generic ""epic"" and forgettable.4.  I played through the campaign and resolved to uninstall it right away, so I have not tried the multiplayer.  The mech sections were not that compelling, so I don't think whatever community happens to be there would be worth my time.			",199,21,0,11,6,0,7

												Crash-happy during on-foot sections. You have to pixel-hunt for destroyable objects to get enough money to buy neat mech parts. The combat and gameplay aren't very compelling. Multiplayer's dead as a doornail. Google Gearhead or MAV or something else if you're looking for a mech game.			",171,16,3,32,16,0,47

												How much you like Front Mission Evolved depends directly on your expectation. Taken for itself it's a mediocre, schlocky and quite enjoyable Mech action game. If you have played the previous Front Mission games on the other hand you will be pretty disappointed.Looking back on this a few years later, you can see how much better Vanquish (action mech combat) or Armored Core (mech customization) are. If you just want to have a few ours of fun (playing on easy - I suck at these games - it took me 5-6 hours to finish) and enjoy B-movie stories (best part is probably the Bond style ending) then go ahead. Don't pay more than 10$ though, as you will regret it.			",741,344,31,85,56,6,76

												I am problably the BIGGEST front mission fan of all time.... but this game is not front mission. It no longer has the story and epic feel to it anymore. I loved it back in the day when it was a tactical rpg, you controlled your own squad of mechs and made them work together to create an unstoppable team, but times have changed. Apparently newer games dont like that anymore and it really infuriates me. Games used to be so good and now they are just being destroyed. Now front mission isnt even trying to appeal to it's fans. Its trying to appeal to those kids who play call of duty all day long. However it is not just that it is a shooter now. It is just not front mission. They did great on a shooter for front mission once, it was only released in japan sadly. It was called front mission online, and it was made for the ps2 and that is better than this.

												Right, will get to the bare bones stuff of this game with the pros, cons and miscPros:-Nice artwork-Decent looking mecha-An okay Customisation for the mechas-Not to bad controls for a multi platform gameCons:-Crappy dubs (All the people sound like they don't believe in what they're doing)-Overused, uninspired scenario-Graphics aren't that good-Bosses are boring and uninspired-Combat is just sloppy-Too short, I finished the campaign in just 5 hours-Silly unbelievable love story-The characterised bad guys are lame, so lame that they look, sound and feel like Saturday Morning cartoon bad guys-On foot phases are sloppy-Quite bland ambienceMisc:-Sometimes the terrible dubs made me laugh quite hard-Screw phisics-Doesn't feel like a real war situation-Crickey!Notes: I do not recommend this game at all to anyone, it is a waste of money, a waste of time and a waist of patience... For those Front Mission vets like me, it is definitively a waste of time, this is why I dislike Square Enix, this isn't the first franchise they butchered, it won't be the last.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I even begin. Take the most boring third person shooter you know, add the worst story written by people who couldn't even write for the SyFy Channel or porn, and try to hide it all behind pretty decent looking graphics and you got Front Mission Evolved. This game is garbage. What's more frustrating is the knowledge that the game has so much potential and an amazing series of work to build off of, yet sucks so bad. I honestly could not think the storyline could get any worse and every 15 minutes I was proven wrong when one of the one-dimensional characters opened their mouths to spew a catchphrase or something obvious. Do not buy this game. Not even if it's on sale. The only redeeming quality of the game is that the graphics are pretty decent.2.0/10.0			",140,29,1,18,16,1,25

												The only other front mission game i played was front mission 4 and it was in japanese. Even though I don't understand japanese I loved that game. Most other Mech game have mech either too weird or too sisy. Front mission's Wanzer(mech) is actually good looking and manly.(like a zaku)Many years later I discovered this game on steam. It's not the same type of game as front mission 4 but I had really high hope for it. Since I really like FPS and I believe it would be a good serie reboot for front mission.The final impression now is quite mixed. On one hand the game have really pretty good CG movies and decent graphics for something that's 6 years old. Music and sound effect are front mission like and it's very well done. On the other hand, the terrible story script, unnessary love triangle, short levels and terrible on foot mission quite ruined it for me.My no.1 dislike for this game are the foot mission. If i want to play a good FPS as human, I would go play borderland, half life or even mass effect. The developer of this game clearly don't know how to program interesting FPS level when it's foot mission. On hard difficulty I die quite a lot from one spray of enemy machine gun shoot acroos the map from unexpcted angle just because I couldn't turn fast enough or hide behind a pillar. As you can see. 6 years later after the serie reboot there are no new front mission game because this one was such a bad sale from it's many flaws.Overall I gained enough entertainment for a bottom line 5.5/10 as a bare minimum recommendation to play if you already own the game. IF you don't have the game wait for a good discount if you have some spare steam wallet fund.PS: the multiplayer server is quite dead so there are a lot achivement for multiplayer that I would have to skip.

												Unfortunately, I can't say much about this game, played it from start to finish an even attempted a second play through to see if I missed something important. Personally I just can't recommend you ever purchase this game unless you are insanely bored, the mech combat is ok, the mini levels where you run around on foot and shoot bad guys are exactly that, and not fun in the least. Square Enix could have really hit gold way back in 2010 with fun mecha combat not seeing since Mech Warrior, but unfortuately this game is terrible...don't even get me started on the personal character developement, general story, and voice acting, yuck.

												While this game was a bit of an experiment that didn't really work out as far as the series went, it's still a fun, stompy 'mech game.  The gun types are varied enough that you have a selection of how you want to fight, the customization is pretty solid, and the graphics aren't bad, considering it's a 5+ year old game.  Plus, there's still some people playing multiplayer.The story for the single player game is more or less ignorable...but you will never find a more Gundam storyline than this game.  Not even Gundam is as Gundam as this game.  It blows right past the point where the mecha anime genre cliches are annoying to the point where they're so damned hilarious you can't help but chuckle to yourself.

												The classic Front Mission games were of the turn-based strategy genre, and were most excellent.  You really had to work for your victories and fine-tuning your pilot's skills meshed well with the mix-and-match style of Wanzer design.  I always looked forward to playing Front Mission games, even picking up the original ""remix"" version for the Nintendo DS.  Having said this, I must testify that Front Mission Evolved betrays the classic formula that made the original Front Mission games so great.  Instead of giving us Front Mission 4, which looked absolutely fantastic, they gave us this ridiculously lame version of From Software's Armored Core.  None of the DLC makes a damned bit of difference, the controls are just terrible, the action is awkward, making you find little things around the map in order to get bonus achievements is idiotic and not fun, and the interface is a complete mess and very awkward.  I'm under the impression that this is a terrible port of a console game because trying to navigate your way through the menus is just sheer torture.Give us the turn-based variety of Front Mission, please.  Spare of this derivative crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be completely honest, I believe this may be the Strongest Ground Base Mecha Game on Steam today.Despite the fact that this game has came out on 2010, it's core mechanics are  Solid	.In combat, you will have four places to target in enemy Wanzers (otherwise to us, Mechas). The torso, each respective arms, and the legs. While the torso represents the main health, each other part will contribute to your Combat Abilities. You break them, your ability to fight will become that much more crippled.Now this will mean you need to play smart. Seriously smart.  I won't joke around when I say   Mobility   is  a  Key   factor in this game.	Your Wanzer's ability to  Skate  around is your most powerful tool the Controller can utilise. That being said, if your Legs (aka, your Skating Mobility) gets destroyed, you'll be crippled like a horse missing a leg.   You're gonna have a bad time.  So better get looking for a health pack!The main reason why I emphasize the importance of Mobility is because you can  Quite Literally,  dodge  Everything.	'Oh, are those a trail of Machine Gun Bullets aimed at me? Let me keep dashing to the side!''Huh, is there a shower of Mortal coming down from the sky? Better Skate out of the way!''Grrr, is that a suicide brawler after my♥♥♥♥♥ Better Kite backwards while shooting!''Ah, is that a series of Homing Missiles Locked onto me? I think I should Stutter-Step left and right!' On top of that, anytime during the game, when you realize that a certain Arsenal of Weapon Choice isn't working out and frustrating you,  You Can Change It Midgame. Yes, I said that right; you can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ change your Loadout during the middle of the mission without restarting it. As a gamer that enjoys trying each type of weapon available, I can't emphasize how grateful this  Privilege	 the developers have implemented into the game. It shows a great understanding for perspective on our behalf.Gone are the days where you need to restart the game to change your playstyle!  … Oops, I forgot that Triple A Developers now Suck Again Q.Q ☆ ★ ☆ ★ ☆But there are some few problems…Generic Characters. Linear Story. Cut Paste Voice Acting. Companion Battle Ai Non-existent. Lack of NG+.Bosses can get sometimes infuriating at some OP things (but the game does its part in stepping stones to teach you how to overcome it.)The Core Item Drops of Energy refills are missing for 95% of the game. I believe the flexibility of the Game could’ve improved so much more if that was available.Multiplayer is dead. Q.Q I want my achievements pl0x!!! No other Single Player Options besides the Campaign too (least give me Survival Mode or something).☆ ★ ☆ ★ ☆Now back to the good points!Did I mention you can Customize the look of your Wanzer?! :D  Not by a lot doh..  A nice touch if I do say so myself.Did I mention that you feel like you’re in an actually 60-Feet Suit of Metal and Armor? You can actively Crush things beneath your feet! (Sure there’s isn’t much to even step on…) But still! The fact that you have  only a few  destructible debris is so trilling!  (Although I’m srlly peeved at how I’m able to Crush Cars when I walk over them but my 16”Caliber Guns can’t leave a dent… oh well #2010problems) The Intro and Final Cutscenes were just really Cool in the perspective of a Mecha Anime Watcher. The Orbital Tower Defense Laser was really awesome to watch. The Big weapon that took it down was also really cool to see (despite we never being able to see it again later). While the ending thing really reminded me of the one scene from Gundam Seed (Destiny?). Quite Touching, really. Cue  Kimi Wa Boku Ni Niteiru. [ https]So although you don’t quite feel like Jesus Yamato from the Gundam Seed Series.I did quite feel like Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass (Season One) with the excellent Mobility of the Knightmare Frames.☆ ★ ☆ ★ ☆Conclusion:Mecha Fans will really like this. But to fully understand the Gameplay, you need to play Smart and keep your Cool. “Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.” (Sun Tzu)9.0/10 (Gameplay)5.5/10 (Overall)			",356,115,2,50,37,4,63

												TLDR; A excruciatingly mediocre game.The gameplay starts off bad, piloting/designing a mech is extremely basic, the combat is dull and the AI presents no challenge what so ever. After playing the first two levels you will have seen all of what the game has to offer. It only gets worse from there though with a poor attempt at ""variety"". Turret sections and then still worse is on foot sections that feel like what i'd expect out of a mobile game from 5 years ago.


plz no. 
A Screenshot of Front Mission Evolved
By: Yourgrandma




If you stick with it what you're in for is a cliched story, poor music, graphics, voice acting and absolute crap level design.Only square enix could think it would be a good idea to put all its marbles on expanding the franchise by turning the series known for its turn based strategy elements/depth into a shallow outsourced one off failure of a action game that desperately tries to appeal to a western audience.This is one of the worst handled franchises by square enix, even though most of the games never came to the west they ended up being fan translated. FM: Gun Hazard (snes) spinoff from 20 years ago offers far more compelling story/gameplay/mech building then this game does.Only reason i even powered through this is because i had a morbid curiosity of seeing how bad this abomination was and what killed off front mission for good. It wasn't worth it.			",237,33,3,6,15,2,33

												Maybe it's just the Front Mission fan speaking, but I can't shake this impression that Evolved finds it at best extremely uncomfortable operating within the existing IP and at worst, it seems to have nothing but contempt for it. Obvious genre bender might seem as a surprise, but it's not the first time the franchise had a spin-off title, it's the fact that the execution of TPS gameplay seems clunky is what really brings the game down from a mechanical standpoint. Especially the completely tacked on infantry levels which were obviously an afterthought and come close second to the annoyance that are rocket-sponge bosses who will test your patience towards the end. Overall pacing of the game is also very lacking and at times it seems as if there are entire chapters missing which would've facilitated smoother flow instead of the current rushed narrative.Speaking of which, the story is probably the greatest offender in the entire game and takes a very liberal, but ultimately misunderstood take on the existing setting. No tropes or cliches are left unchecked as the story forgoes franchise's signature politics-heavy approach in favor of merely dropping acronyms whenever it can and expecting you to give a damn as you follow a very bland main character doing his revenge thing which never evolves into anything beyond that very simple concept. Characters at large aren't treated any better and just fill the utterly predictable archetype role, especially the villains who are so by-the-numbers I first thought it was perhaps some kind of irony at work. You will forget what you went through the moment you finish the game and be glad you'll never again have to deal with all the manufactured EDGE drama.			",906,388,16,192,89,8,171

												Let me first say that I am a huge Front Mission series fan, and played the 3rd, 4th, 5th and now this one, hence the negative recommendation. This installment, unlike its series predecessors, is a third person shooter instead of the series’ trademark turn based RPG gameplay. But that is not the main reason why this Front Mission is mediocre.The gameplay is easy to catch-up and to play, I really enjoyed how the game played; nothing wrong here.The wanzers we see are all from the series (except one or two), so you can somehow relate that you are playing a Front Mission game, even though their designs are ugly (I speak of the Grille Sechs for example).The story could be good if it was longer and with well written dialogue. Character progression is weak and seems a lot happens of the screen. One second you meet Adela and she hates you, then on the next mission she is jealous of Dylan’s old friend and apparently now loves Dylan? Also Dylan gets involved into the UCS military no questions asked I mean … it makes no damn sense. Characters die for no reason, are enemies in one mission and on the next are you best friends …. In the end, the story is really bad written, full of clichés, and does not make up to the series.Also the characters have no personality that makes us love them or hate them. They look like random guys with names and no propose.Also since the multiplayer is down, there is nothing to do after you complete the short and bad single player story.In the end, Front Mission Online is a better Front Mission 3rd person shooter than Front Mission Evolved. Has more wanzers, if anything.IF you are a Front Mission fan, you won’t miss a thing if you skip this one. Square-Enix DID disappoint.			",46,4,7,1,8,0,5

												Another game with a big name behind it.Time for yet another dual-viewpoint review.TL;DR: Only go for it for the multiplayer. Only go multiplayer if you already know someone that wants to play it. (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FrontMissionRevival) FME as part of Front Mission series I've played Front Mission on SNES, including Front Mission: Gun Hazard (that it's NOT a strategy game either, it's a platformer), and Front Mission 3 on PS1.They decided to make a TPS out of a game series that are mostly Turn Based Strategy.The results?- a rather short game- the story is quite blunt. It's about 5 minutes long total. Or less.- Wanzer Customization is quite limited. And weird.- Forget anything ""Front Mission"" you played before while you play this game.It's just a generic TPS game, using a franchise name to get attention.Not bad, but not good, and nothing to do with Front Mission IMO (aside from weapons/part names). FME as a standalone game it's a robot game!!! ROBOTS!!! Who doesn't love them?Oh wait, they are called wanzers here.what is a wanzer? a Walking Panzer (walking tank), afaik xDSo basically you are a wanzer pilot (must enforce you are a pilot, there are a few missions outside the wanzer), and your main goal is walk a few miles destroying everything that moves, and a few things that doesn't move too.No matter the choice of difficulty, the game is quite easy, except for the TERRIBLE vertical sensibility that cannot be configured apart from the horizontal one.Pros: WANZERS!!!! multiplayer mode!!! (mostly dead, there's a group for organizing matches tho) Graphic quality is ok. I mean, for characters and wanzers at least.Cons: Short game. very short. 5 chapters divided into 3 missions. All you gotta do is blow up all the enemies around, and there is a boss battle at the end of each chapter. enemy AI. They consider you as the single target in the game, even with friendly NPC's around. friendly NPC's. They got an ok AI (except if you wander around, they can get stuck pretty often). I mean... they shoot at the target pretty well, and appears to have unlimited core HP and ammo (arms and legs can get destroyed, but i never noticed any of them getting out of comission). multiplayer is mostly dead. Join the group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FrontMissionRevival or send me a message if you wanna find someone to play with. Achievements are either story based or multiplayer based. the first you kind you get no problems. the second kind is tricky, due to multiplayer issues already stated. The collectibles only exist to extend the game, really. They are so annoying to find, you will spend way more time trying to find them than playing the game itself. The radar is ridiculous. it show only arrows (red for enemy, green for allies) and objective direction (yellow star). nothing else, no terrain, or structures or map borders. For a robot system, it's such a lame guidance.Others: every stage in the game have ""collectibles"" and specific destroyable targets (aka sensors) and things like that. They ARE annoying to find, and you can even finish the game without noticing them at all, as they add nothing and are never mentioned, and have no real purpose for existing (except they unlock a few customization items, i think) I've read the review where people complain about the terrible voice acting. I've seen no problem with it really. The content may be empty, but the voice acting is ok.ConclusionDon't play this game for the story. If anything, play it for the multiplayer, with a few friends, or join a group to find players for it.If you are searching for a Front Mission game, search elsewhere.If you are searching for a robot/mecha/wanzer game, i rather play Mechwarrior series, or Armored Core series, if you rather focus more on customization.If you want a TPS, don't play this game. Seriously.Singleplayer is terribly boring. Customization is very limited, unless you unlock it thru the collectibles, that are a pain to get. Multiplayer is fun, but again, customization is limited, this time by your rank AND multiplayer exclusive missions (intel tab).Also, single player and multiplayer customization items are NOT THE SAME. So it's mostly pointless to do any SP scavenge hunt for customization items you won't ever be using.I both upvote and downvote this game. Up for multiplayer, down for everything else. quite divided, i really want more player on multiplayer, so i SHOULD upvote... but the negative sides are screaming way louder. I cannot upvote with such a negative review.			",221,51,4,42,12,1,17

												*A mech-lover's Spoiler-free ReviewIf you have been wondering how does it feel to ride a Wanzer that you have been commanding in previous games, this game puts you in the helm of Wanzer combat at its finest!!!!To those new to the series, this is a very good mech game (if you can get over with some of its issues).Pros:*Fast Paced-Mecha combat*Stays faithful to the essence of Wanzer customization in the previous games*Graphics are stunning*Punching a Wanzer never felt so satisfying*So many customization combinations!!!!Cons:*Voice acting is kinda lifeless, sometimes their inflections are out of place*No one plays multiplayer....Tiny rants:*Story mode characters are interesting, but they are not expanded upon, they dont even introduce themselves right.*Your loadout in the cutscenes do not reflect your actual loadout...*The choosing a prebuilt model overwrites your Wanzer's style (Color, Decals, etc.)*Sniper Rifle Controls are weird, takes time getting used to...*Some weapons cannot be placed in the left hand (WHY? In old Front Mission games you can freely use any hand weapon in any hand.)*Regenerating Health (It doesnt make sense... I hoped the game would explain it but no.... Game developers, please stop using this weird mechanic... it removes realism from the game...)*You dont get rewards for destroying individual parts (Lets say, if you destroy a left arm in past Front Mission Games, that arm is gone, here, the broken arm is still a major threat even when you consider the Accuracy loss)*Some equipment are useless... *Melee damage can no longer be amplified by spare power... Unlike in previous games...bummer...*E.D.G.E. System only lasts for a few seconds and strangely enough, it hampers the pace of action... Why put it? O.oOverall, its an 8/10!!!!Its a great game!!!! Though there times it feels unpolished, still it stands as a great game!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the name of the game is Front Mission Evolved, this game feels more like a downgrade, when compared to the polish and amount of time you could spend in the earlier PS1-PS2 era titles, while some of this has to do with gameplay changes, from strategy/tactics style gameplay to 3rd person shooter, its more than that, the action is very basic, with tacked on ground missions that have you shooting enemies that are no more than cannon fodder.While the game has its moments, the story is mediocre at best, with some subpar voice work, and bland characters.If you want some mech action I would recomend other titles, like Hawken or Mechwarrior, this game only if you can get it for as cheap as possible.

												I LOVED the Front Mission series. This thing, is NOT the Front Mission series. I bought this day one, hoping it would be a higher quality Front Mission 2 or even 3. This is not. Now, moving away from that. If you like robot shooter type games, don't buy this. You could get a PS2 emulator and play all the Armored Core games (the ones that mattered at least), and you could get yourself Front Mission 1,2,3. If you want newer, Hawken (while also♥♥♥♥♥♥ is VASTLY better than this. Or Mechwarrior Online, or the new Mechwarrior game when it comes out. Literally open Google, and you will find EVERY OTHER MECH games is better than this. In closing, I played a grand total of 39 minutes (or something close). That is 39 minutes I will never get back. Save yourself 39 minutes and $5, and don't support this poor excuse for a developer.			",80,9,4,15,23,1,13

												FME is a fairly short third person Mech Shooter.  This is a game that doesn't do anything particularly bad, combat's okay, story is fairly cookie cutter (only YOU can save the whole word!) and flying around in a mech is fun enough.  However the game doesn't really do any good or great either.  There is a decent bit of Mech customization, from paint jobs and decals to various weapons and parts.  However you probably won't use or try a lot of those customizations out as the main campaign is very short (I beat the whole thing in about 8 hours) and there really isn't a whole lot of replayability.Pick it up on sale and enjoy a decent enough Mech Shooter.

If you put aside the outdated graphics, the cliché-filled story and the terrible consoleport controls, it still could've been a good game, but the fact all the boss-battle is pure bs, gives you nothing, but fustration, because no matter if you win, you can't kill your enemies until the very end of the game (wtf is this sh*t?).

												I wanted to love this game, I really did, but it's just average and can't recommend for any particular interest. For a game about piloting giant robots, you'll find yourself surprisingly unempowered. Note that this is my first Front Mission, unlike most reviewers I've read.The worldbuilding and overall setting is pretty interesting, voice acting is pretty good (although most dialogues lack creativity and script could've used a couple rewrites). Gameplay is average. Controls are pretty responsive however there's no strategy or thinking at all for the fights. There's no cover system, enemies can pack a punch really early into it and your weapons deal little damage (except for your rockets that are incredibly OP) so it's just ""get behind a building. poke out, shoot a little, enter again. Rinse. Repeat."" Your mobility is limited by a boost bar so it's just short bursts (dodge) or slow walking instead of a fluid movement system. (There's a burst for movement but it's pretty useless for fights).You'll find yourself lacking either agility or power constantly through tedious levels. Level design is good enough.Bosses are surprisingly even more uncreative in terms of gameplay. You're just in a cage (you don't feel yourself in danger, just limited) where you dodge predictable attack sequences and shoot. If they were a little more open or interesting (in terms of enemy attacks/level design) I'd love them.Story was pretty OK up to the point I got to. Nothing groundbreaking, but nothing really bad either. I've heard many complaints in this particular area so maybe it gets worse later, but I haven't found anything terrible yet, just cliches and ""could have been done better"" moments. Anyways don't play for the story alone.Customization is decent, but not great.Soundtrack is Okayish... Does it job, but nothing groundbreaking either.Multiplayer is as dead as it can be. Don't even bother looking for a game.If you want an action robot customization game, just go play Custom Robo. If you want a strategy robot customization game, just go play Super Robot Taisen. If you want a shooter... Well, I don't know, but this is not the game for you sadly.			",122,26,0,25,10,1,35

												TL:DR Do not buy this game, it will disappoint you, greatly.First of all, I am a big fan of mechs game.I had played other front mission game, armored core, super robot war, some of the gundam, and I won't miss any chance to play a game that let me take control of a giant robot, so when I finally able to find steam card in my area, the first thing I do is to press the purchase button, in this game.This turn out to be a pretty bad decision. I am not even going to talk about the crash I am having, that should not be a part of any game review.Let talk about the game play. CustomizationThe game allow you to customize you mechs beofre mssion, which is great, as I enjoy the ability to make your own mechs and this is one of the reason that drawn me to this game. Sadly ,the customization system are done pretty wrong:1. There are a serious lack of part to choose from2. There are not really a good reason to customize except to put on stronger armor and weapon3. There are no reason to use weaker ""low ranked"" parts anymore after you gotten better stuff.4. In some stage they even force you to use certain part5. No real choiceGameplayLinear level, I don't even need my brain to play this game, all I do is follow the path, kill everyone, go to the next area, kill everyone and repeat, I don't even need to bother with aiming, it is better to just keep shooting, as the battlefield are small, and the enemy appear only when you are closing by, rendering long range weaponary obsolete.There are also some problem with the game's camera, stuff like plant and tree and stuff can go between your mechs and the camera so you can't see what is going on in the battlefield.The difficulty seem artifical to me, All boss have ton of health, and kill you in a few shot, to stay alive to do some damage you have to keep picking power upAlly AIThe AI of ally in this game are pretty weak, to a point I didn't notice their existence until the battle of a giant mobile fortress (sorry for the possible spoiler), where for the first time i figured that I need help and fall back to them, only to find them launching missile at the wall, forcing me to deal with the boss alone.AllyFrom what I know about Front mission, It is always about coordinating with your ally and slowly yet effectively take out you enemy one by one, and this game done exactly the opposite, telling you, a civilian engineer to take on an army of mechs alone.Human stageCome on, this should be a game that I fight the enemy inside a giant robot, if I want to play man vs man battle, I will go get battlefield or something else. Unlike mechs stage, There are never enough ammo.StoryToo short, Too shallow, too lightThe bad guy don't really have a good reason to fight, and the ""good"" side seem strangely lack the power to fight back, come on, it is suppose to be the milltary force of a whole country! and all you can spare is a few mechs? you got to be kidding me.

I rarely used a  majority of the game mechanics i felt like. and it turned into a collectathon with no diversity between the human and wanzer levels. I'd actaully recommend buying the DS front mission game as that is a much more rewarding and challenging experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a game similar to earlier Front Mission titles, you've come to the wrong place. This is no longer a strategy game, but a wonky third person action mech game. Gameplay gets repetitive very fast, wanzer customization is weak, and the story line is convoluted and makes little sense. The game is also very easy, albeit one boss encounter towards the end of the game. The ONLY reasons to purchase this, is that it is very cheap on steam, and if you have nothing better to do, then maybe this can help you kill time.			",125,26,0,12,8,0,9

This is not bad, as you roam the maps dispatching foes who explode under the softest caress of your weapons at long range.  Then you have to fight hyperactive bosses in close quarters who race right up to you and pound your face in with melee weapons.  It also doesn't help that the bosses have hit points that can only be written by using scientific notation.  Another part of the game is a rail shooter, as you ride into battle on a transport, strafing enemy ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  The final part of the game is a 3rd person cover based shooter.  A particularly bad one.  There are all of 2 types of enemies in this thankfully underdeveloped section of the game.  With great regret, I played more hours than I should have before rage quitting.  I'm glad I quit just so the horrible character could die.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Somehow the idea that my wanzer should be militarily superior to my opponents was lost in the mix of bland storytelling, uninteresting music and lackluster visuals. This game was more ambitiious than its creative talent could manifest, with world threatening themes and interesting new mechanics that somehow failed to incite my interest in the least.Evolved does not live up to its successors, lacking the scope of story and variation in presentation that made them interesting. Poor voice acting deadens what little emotional impact is written into the well animated cutscenes. There was so much potential here, and the port itself runs quite well.This doesn't 'feel' like a Front Mission game. Is it the UI? the mechs? customization? story? Probably all of the above. Yes the wanzers you know from games past are lovingly modeled from other games in the franchise, and interesting mechanics like dashing are integrated well into real time dynamic first person combat.It's just so ... dull, and that's not enough to warrant a sale when there are so many surperior titles available. A shameful, boring PC port that does not lend any credence to the franchise. Square-Enix, once again, letting down its fans.I got this in a bundle of compentent games with shall go nameless out of respect.			",352,77,14,45,37,2,51

												Uninspired.  Flat.  Forgettable.  Those are the first three words that pop into my mind when thinking about Front Mission Evolved.  Don’t be fooled by the cool looking giant robots.  You want to think they’re cool, I want to think they’re cool.  They are not cool.  Why?  Clunky controls, limited customization options, few RPG options, no choices, lack of variety in gameplay all combine to make this game an insipid waste of your time.  This is not the crazy customizable Armored Core series, this is not the silky smooth stylized controls and visuals of Zone of the Enders, and this is not the super complex, wholly varied experience of a Starseige or a Mechwarrior.  This game is however,♥♥♥♥♥♥on stick.			",258,31,4,56,30,1,77

												8/10 and i'll tell you why. the game trys to be like armored core with mech cobat and lost planet on fot but doesn't get as close as it should to the gameplay. The controls feel more like armored core 2 so they can be a bit clunky but still its fun to play. as a hardcore fan of front mission this won't top my list as one of the greats but it is nice to have a new take on the game. the wanzer parts list seems to be smaller then other FM games but i can forgive that as this isn't the same type of game. all in all its the only think the pc has to armored core and its a fun mech shooter with some of the greatest looking mechs around.

												This game is a true travesty. This was once one of the best turn-based strategy franchises of all time, and these people have smeared its fine name to make this horrible mess. There is nothing at all intelligent about playing this game; the characters are morons, the story is moronic, the gameplay is moronic, even configuring your wanzer is moronic. This is Front Mission in name only. This is a third-person poop-fest. I cannot give it a low enough rating.    Square Enix, how could you publish this? Have you no shame? Probably the greatest videogame disappointment of my life. Don't buy this!			",118,11,4,19,18,1,27

												If you're a hardcore, diehard fan of mech-based combat(especially first/third person simulator-style), then I believe you'll want to check out FME. The story and somewhat-linear feel to the mission progression are so-so(yawn). But I really enjoy the customization mode. Between missions, you can change weaponry and equipment items, swap-out or upgrade your mech piece by piece(arm,leg,torso), and finish it off with a customizable color scheme and decals. I've built model mecha, and this is some fun to do it onscreen. Then you can jump right in to a mission(or go back to previous ones) and blast away in a suit of your own making. Yeah, engineering is my favorite thing, and this game centers on that aspect in a complex(yet simple to learn), modular fashion. Go for it, it's a cheapy. ",13,0,0,4,1,0,9

												What you get out of Front Mission Evolved is going to depend on what your expections are for this game. If you are coming to it and expecting a great story with a great gamplay and graphics or something close to the original then you will be disapointed. So temper those expectations now.The story is serviceable but nothing really to right home about and really just serves as a way to get you from point A to point B. Graphics are decent and certinaly better than the PS3 version but not by much and are not blow your socks off great. Gameplay is a pretty much standard third person shooter afair but with mechs and some on foot sections. If you want a mech game to play then go ahead just make sure you know what you are getting into before hand. It's nothing like an Armored Core type game with frantic action and  endless customization. If anything its a pretty average to medicore third person mech based shooter.			",46,1,4,4,1,0,1

												As a huge Front Mission fan who played from Front Mission 3 to Front Mission 5, I love this game. I know most people do not agree with me but I saw a lot of potential in this game when it first came out and it's quite sad how people turned out disliking the game so much just because it didn't feel like the old ones...Well, most of the action takes place with you controlling your Wanzer (mech) in order to blast enemy Wanzers, tanks, etc... Sometimes you will play as the character though. It's a bit difficult to get used to the controllers at first, but with some practise you will get there. The bosses are overpowered when it comes to armour, so it might take a while for you to take them down, which means you will take lots of damage. Nothing to worry about though, because you have health and ammo power-ups to pick up during the boss battles. You just have to think fast and dodge a lot.Last but not least, you can customise your Wanzer... Change the colours, add patterns, choose the weapons for both arms and shoulders and choose the body parts you want.I would review the multiplayer as well but unfortunately no one plays it anymore. I had the chance to play it twice and I really enjoyed it.I highly recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: July 28, 2016
												Quick Summary: Front Mission Evolved is very different from the previous Front Mission games, abandoning turn based strategy and turning into a third person mech shooter (not a simulator like Mechwarrior). As you can tell from the game’s “mixed” reviews, there is nothing especially awesome about Front Mission Evolved, but it’s not that bad either.  If you have nothing else to play, or just want a simple shooter game to pass the time, you probably won’t regret playing this game. I only ever played the first Front Mission game (Super Nintendo) so I don’t know how much the story differs with the rest of the series, but I am told that Front Mission Evolved is a reboot, so don’t worry if you haven’t played the earlier games. During the 22nd century, the nations of the Earth are at an uneasy peace. The militaries of the world have built their armies around “wanzers” (walking panzers) which are 30 foot tall human shaped mechs with heavy weapons. Wanzers are fast moving and they actually carry large versions of normal guns. For example a wanzer could be carrying a giant shotgun, or have a big club in one hand for bashing enemies. This means weapon loadout is easily customized (just switch to another gun). If you’ve played earlier front mission games, a lot of the weapons and parts will have familiar names (Egret, Winnee, Husky MK2, etc.).You play Dylan Ramsey, an engineer working in the United States of the New Continent (a combination of North and South America), specializing in advanced wanzer technology such as the EDGE system, which gives wanzer pilots a huge advantage in combat. A sudden and devastating attack on New York sets the world’s superpowers on the edge of war, and Dylan joins a wanzer strike team, looking for some payback.As you’d expect, most of the game will be played from the cockpit of a wanzer, though there are a few missions where you get out and fight as a human. Movement and combat is very simple, walking and jumping just like a basic third person shooter, and for the most part the game is actually pretty easy. Enemies die really fast and there are health/ammo pickups all over the place. Only the bosses are a real challenge. Like previous Front Mission games, you can knock off enemy arms and legs for an advantage, but it’s probably better to just go for the torso and kill them. For some reason, knocking off an arm does not disable weapons on that arm, and destroying legs only slows the wanzer down. The sections of the game where you’re fighting on foot as a human are even more dumbed down than the wanzer sections. You only have 2 weapons that can be switched out (shotgun and machine gun) and you’re more restricted in terms of fighting and movement. If you’ve played Red Faction Guerilla, the gunplay in these sections are actually very similar (except in Front Mission Evolved you can’t jump, only have a couple weapons, and can’t destroy the environment). Pros:+Customizing your wanzer between missions is fun, just like in Front Mission 1. You can actually replay missions for more money so you’ll always be able to afford the “best” parts and guns. If you don’t like customization, the game allows you to buy “prebuilt” wanzers. I found long range weapons to be the best, except during boss fights.+Simple combat, zooming around the battlefield in a giant mech, gunning down/sniping enemies. If you’re having trouble, you can activate EDGE, which slows down time and lets you easily dodge enemy fire.Cons:-The multiplayer is dead. About 1/3 of the game’s Steam achievements are for multiplayer, and you’re not going to find anyone online to play with. You need about 4 people to even start a ranked match (otherwise you get no points/exp/achievements for the match).-The game has quite a large number of collectible items that don’t actually do anything (emblems, sensors, data keys). They offer no backstory and only a tiny money reward as far as I could tell. Some of them are also super well hidden, to the point that even searching for hints online is incredibly frustrating.Overall, my main reason for playing this game was nostalgia. It’s been over a decade since I played Front Mission on SNES, and I still remember a bunch of the weapon/wanzer part names. The graphics for this game are rather dated, but not horrible enough to disgust you. I don’t regret playing it, but I also don’t see myself replaying in the future if I have a game backlog. Just don’t go into this game thinking it plays like Mechwarrior or classic Front Mission games. This is a shooter, where you just happen to be controlling a wanzer instead of a human.

												As silly as you would expect it to be, but it has giant robots! Aahhh freak-out time! Giant robots that you can customize to your every whim, given you can actually afford the parts and.. most the time, I couldn't. Still, it has its own charm to waltz through what appears to be a miniature city and squash all the smaller stuff below while trashing opponents of your own size. If you count on multiplayer modes though, forget that, it does not seem like anyone in the whole world is playing it, ever.. so most of the DLC you can get is nothing but a rip off. C'est la vie.

The Controls are very easy to handle once you read up on them, and if you dont like its set up, you can remap it. The Mechs options are plentiful, but remember to keep everything in prespective! But all and all I find the game very fulfilling when it comes to massive destruction and overall mech combat! even couple of moments when your...

												This game really is a bad waste of the franchise. Whilst it carries over mecha designs, weapons, locations and organisations from the front mission universe, it really does not capture the feel of it, with some embarrassingly cliche writing that doesn't touch the gritty, involved feeling the games are known for.Mechanically, the shooting is just dull, with the mecha based combat feeling slow and uninvolving, and the overlong on-foot sections just fkat out dragging (though I won't lie that was at least in part due to buying a game about giant robots and finding myself on foot for what felt like far too often). Not an awful game, but Front Mission deserved a lot better.			",195,42,0,22,2,1,23

												I'm not going to call this game good, but I won't call it bad either. I like being ""overpowered"" when I play, and even on hard while searching for collectables I felt overpowered. The game is really easy to complete, since the A.I. isn't that good. The only time you might have a few problems is against some of the bosses.Front Mission Evolved does have a story, but it's pretty bad and the acting is really bad too. However, it's there and it's better than nothing.I haven't tried the multiplayer (and I assume it's pretty much dead), so I can't comment on that aspect.If you can get in on sale for 10€-20€ the singleplayer will be worth it.

												I have played Front mission 1 on the DS, 3 on my Vita (it was on the PS1), and 4 on a PS2 emulator. I don't consider myself a huge front mission fan, but from the prologue of this game alone, I knew I would hate it.The story was written by Motomu Toriyama, the man behind the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy and The 3rd Birthday, meaning he is responsible for almost killing Final Fantasy and for ruining one of my favorite franchises, Parasite Eve. His lack of skills at writing a cohesive story or likable charcters really stands out in this game, especially with the stories glaring plot holes, such as how in the prolouge, New York city gets invaded and the army DOES NOT NOTICE UNTIL AFTER THE INVADERS BLOW UP AN ORBITAL ELEVATOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY. And thats just the start, the story just gets worse as it goes on.This isn't even getting into the terrible, melodramatic dialouge, featuring such amazing lines like: ""Every lucky charm comes with a curse,"" ""There are no borders in space,"" and my favorite ""They call him Moses Mosely, because he wrote the 10 commandments of Wanzer combat,"" which is funny becuase Moses DID NOT write the 10 commandments. The gameplays your average generic Third person shooter, barring the fact your in a robot, which adds nothing to the game. Also, the game has a tendency to freeze randomly, which it did to me twice, once during the final boss fight.In conclusion, stay away from this game and if you want to play a game like, buy Armored Core 4 or 5, just don't play this.

												It's a mech game. Clunky controls, but large environments and ""arena shooter"" type gameplay.But this game has problems.There are basically 3 main gameplay types. Mech section, turret section, and on foot section.Turret section is like evrey turret section since the ps1/N64 era. On foot section is also severly lacking in a good design and feel. It plays a lot like Mass Effect 1 with worse graphics and no special abilities. The mech section is the main section and it plays basically like an armored core game. Just with a miniscule of the customization options. However the deathknell for this game is that the turret and on foot sections aren't included in the gameplay loop. You can't customize anything about these parts and so they are basically seperate games within your game. The story does not convey the complexity of this world's cosmology. Instead it focuses on a very typical power-fantasy narrative. Very little is done in service of the game's extremely rich and detailed setting. Also, the voice acting is among the worst I've ever heard in the xbox360/ps3 era. The main character literally uses a stereotypical homosexual accent when picking up powerups while on foot. (what's up with that ??). And one of the ""old man"" characters sounds like he is a 22 year old putting on an old man voice. And the boss fights are extremely tedious. They just last too long. and They feel like they are made for a particular loadout in mind (To an extreme degree). There is a high liklihood of dissapointment if you come to this game with any expectations.			",190,53,2,46,19,0,25

They just last too long. and They feel like they are made for a particular loadout in mind (To an extreme degree). There is a high liklihood of dissapointment if you come to this game with any expectations.			",190,53,2,46,19,0,25

												At first I was a bit sceptic.. Wanzers?? (Walking Panzers) But, then again, I thought of those anime I love so much. Like: Pat labor, Gundam, Apple Seed, Ghost in the Shell.. And yes, this game does that and a bit more. You control one of those cool looking human controlled robot warriors that make every Mech Warrior look like a sissy. Skating, hovering it's all in there and you're also able to customize your wanzer in any way you see fit. (Straight out of Mech Warrior; only this looks cooler) Front Mission Evolved is an action game that could just be a well done anime. The story is action packed and not too deep, but it gets the job done. Within the set universe it's all nicely told and presented. The controls, just like the action, are fast and swift (Which is why you DO need the 3rd person view) This game has Singleplayer, several multiplayer modes and a 2 player Co-Op wave survival mode. If you like robot oriented anime/manga and Mech Warrior then you're going to enjoy this game. I am anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, the story in this game is very predictable.  For those of you who are familiar with the hero's journey concept, it plays out by the book here.  The voice acting also could be a lot better.  The people don't feel like they mean what they say.Alright, now that I've got that off my chest, the gameplay itself is decent.  Giant mechs fight each other and blow each other up.  If you die, the game gives you the option of reconfiguring your mech, and if you are dying a lot, I highly reccomend that you do so.  Some of the boss fights can be impossible without the right build.  However, I am highly annoyed that even though they encourage playing to your strengths, at the same time, certain missions require certain types of mech, which is really annoying when everything else is customizable.  I got this in a humble bundle, and in my opinion, that is the best way to get it.  It really isn't worth buying unless it's on sale.  Decent game, not great.			",21,4,0,3,0,0,4

												I'm always ready for a new Fronty Mission title, and while this one takes the SRPG elements out for 3rd person mech combat, it's still a good time. Mech customization is still fun to refine to the nth degree, though I wish there was more, as always. The on foot human shooting segments seem really light and I feel they could have dropped this feature.The DLC should really be part of the game. I imagine the current negative and mixed reviews are due to this content being seperate for no reason other than to get some extra cash. Other than that the game has some collectables around, some good slugfests, and adds to the front mission franchise.			",395,49,7,28,9,2,47

												Firstly, I hate this game. But only because it took the name of an amazing turn based tactics game and turned it into a shooter..... As far as developer sins go, thats up there with making another flappy bird clone game to cash in on the hype.But, this game on its own is.... average, decent, ok, nothing special. It controls fairly well, the story isn't absolutely horrible, and there are some pretty intense moments. I beat it in 7 hours, so take the game length to be around that long.I grudgingly give this game a pass, it did nothing amazing, and rubbed me the wrong way. But if you pick it up on sale, or have money to burn. There are worse ways to spend your evening.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tl;dr: There's no reason to recommend this game to anyone anywhere ever.I'm not even mad about the genre switch from strategy to third-person shooter. If it had been done well, I would have been all for it. Unfortunately, the transition has been anything but smooth: the game tries to implement TPS gameplay with features carried over from the strategy days, such as weapon classifications and the maths system. The result is an unnecessarily clunky mess that attempts to appeal to both the veterans of Front Mission as well as new gamers, and succeeding at neither.Combine the waywards mechanics with uninspiring and repetitive gameplay, writing straight out of the worst of animes, terrible voice acting, outdated graphics even for the time, and even spunkgargleweewee elements (the game begins with New York being under attack, no kidding), and you've got yourself a boring shambles that cannot be recommended to Front Mission fans, action gamers, shooter fans, mech fans or anyone else imaginable. You can, and should, do better than this.			",77,14,0,11,6,0,9

												The most uninspiring game of all time, with graphics straight from 2003, designed by someone who would REALLY like to do a mecha anime but REALLY lacks talent, voice acted by random dudes who can't act, written by someone with the literary skills of a twelve year old, and the simple, vestigial gameplay only adding insult to injury. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So. Very. Japanese.It's bad enough it's a game about giant mechs (not that I have anything against games with giant mechs) but Front Mission Evolved seems to be making a point to hit every single anime cliche that it can. Young man inexplicably talented at war suddenly drafted into the front lines of the conflict. Revenge for the death of a family member. The brunette love interest and the geeky girl with glasses. ""Meaningful"" sacrifices of a friend and unexpected reversals of fortune. Giant bosses unsurprisingly hampered by giant orange weak-points. It's unsophisticated, sophomoric pabulum that makes the Modern Warfare franchise look deep in comparison. Aging graphics, uninspired sound design and dull level design don't help. The combat is colorful but the levels are too constricted and linear. The third-person camera too often wedges into a corner leaving me with a useless view of my mech's (sorry, my /wanzer/'s) back. And the boss fights go on forever.  FME's only saving grace is that, ultimately, it does involve giant robots, and it's hard to hate any games involving 100-ton walking death machines. But that's barely enough to keep one playing; it certainly doesn't warrant a recommendation. It's trite, unimaginative and poorly designed. But, sadly, that seems par for the course for Japanese video games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If it were a person, it would be a person who was once beautiful but was then subjected to horrible plastic surgery and terrible therapy to make them look and act better.Bottom line, don't buy it.

												Front Mission Evolved feels like a PS1 era shooter. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive and the enviroments are lacking with poor gameplay and writing over all. It's sad, I love the Front Mission series and own all the games they released in North America, but this game is just not where it should be. It would have been great to see the front mission series be the equal to Armored Core or take up the mantle of Battle Tech or Heavy Gear instead it becomes a mediocre 3rd person shooter.

												Front Mission: Evolved rides on a coattails of a beloved franchise which sold pretty well in Japan and had a decent following in the West; but where previous titles were tactical RPG's this one has been hit with a ""borad appeal"" mallet and is now a third-person shooter. Putting you into a cockpit of a bipedal mech toting machine guns and shoulder-mounted rocket launchers sounds amazing and has a great cathartic potential, but some annoying bugs and strange design decisions make this whole experience a chore. First of all, I have a problem with the amining-recticule. Now that may seem like a strange nitpick, but aiming recticule is surrounded by an unecessary transparent rectangle taking about 10% of the screen which gets in the way of you shooting things and spotting various collectibles (all of which do nothing except provide you with a small monetary bonus after you collect a set number of them). While on the subject of ""getting in the way of fun"" - AI partners. For most of the missions game partners you with a AI controlled Wanzer (basically another name for a mech) which I think were supposed to help you in larger battles by drawing aggro and damaging opponents, but they actually end up blocking your movement and line or sight while contributing nothing except stating the obvious (Yes, I realize my armor is low because my Wanzer is on fire thank you very much).Combat is mediocre at best, lacking any depth and ticking off every third-person shooter trope in the book. Your objective in every mission is to shoot stuff until it explodes or stops shooting back, which is unfortunate because with a bit of tweaking it could've been really interesting. You see, consecutive shots in your arms and especially legs can easily cripple you; and in the case of legs, severely hamper your mobility. This will cause you to move at a snails pace until your next health pickup esentially making you a sitting duck for all enemies in the area. While really frustrating it wouldn't be a problem if you could do that same thing to your enemies, but (and it could just be due to the higher difficulty level), I've never managed to do that making that whole mechanic feel kinda cheap. It also serves to highlight how muchlimiting ""skating""; a fast sliding maneuvre, can really interrupt the flow of combat by making you wait for a couple of seconds in cover while the appropriate meter or even your armor recharges. You can argue that this forces you to take a more tactical approach by using it sparingly; only to dash from cover to cover, but I'd argue that if you're gonna base all your missions on blowing stuff up, you might as well make the player feel like a complete badass by allowing him to blaze through it at high speed. Besides, by using slide, you're always sacrificing accuracy for higher mobility and compensating for that requires a certain dose of skill.To devs credit, they tried mixing things up by throwing different kinds of enemies at you along with the occasional turret section, and, god help them, on-foot segment. These only serve to highlight the rest of the game because nothing makes you lament for that mediocre mech combat like playing utterly awful third-person shooter for a few minutes. Boss fights are dull, unimaginative and sometimes downright frustrating with bullet-spongey bosses making the whole affair an endurance run, as you circle strafe around them holding every shoot button available and offering prayers to any god that'll hear you that they go down before you do. Oh, and if you thought that facing a single bullet-spongey boss was an exercise in attrition, good luck facing four of them which game will generously throw at you at one point.Ability to customize your Wanzer to your linking is the only decent part of the experience and even that is offset by game forcing you to use specific parts for some missions, and the aforementioned on-foot sections. It would be interesting to see how this gameplay holds up against other players, but unfortunately as of time of writing, multiplayer has been pretty much dead.Overall it's a generic third-person shooting gallery with forgettable story, idiotic AI, cheap bullet-spongey boss fights and too many on-rails turret sections.

												This is not as bad a game as all the trendies claim that it is. It's an older game now, but it's still a lot of fun, especially if you like mechs. The graphics are a bit dated, but still looks fine to me. Consider the price too, it's a nice deal for you to have some mech fun with. The controls are a bit unorthodox, but they're just fine after you become used to them. If you were to buy this, get it for the singleplayer, as the multiplayer is dead (as others have mentioned). It seems that when the trendies pick a game to bash, their lemming nature kicks in and the pack of wolves pounce.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Boss battles can be summarized as ""Run Between Health and Ammo boxes until Boss dies""Performance: Repeated crashes during ""on-foot-outside-of-mech"" missions, no fix has been found.If you must, grab it when its 50%-75% off, otherwise expect a bland experience.

												Story: The game tries to create a new storyline within the FM universe. This isn't bad cause it helps bring new players in, the problem falls on they tried cramming in a 60+ hour series storyline into a measly 4-5 hour game. The overdramatic touches the nonsensical characters. It all felt very harsh when you're chopping it all together. In a bigger more flesh out game this might have been a ok storyline, here ur better off skipping the cs's.Gameplay: As far as mech games go, this one tries to hard to be a cross between ""Armored Core"" and ""Third person shooter"". It's nice that they added in the look and customization of the previous FM games, but the gameplay has become a almost bland expierence. You enter a level, missle down a row of bad guys, and move on. There's hardly really any strategy or even need for most of the customization options added into the game. I was shocked when they switched to a out of mech stage and you play on foot. It tried to emulate other third person games like ""Gears of War"" or just any simply generic shooter. The game needed more balance and tuning on it's mech side without the need of these on foot segments. Overall: I really can't recommend this game, especially to any fan of the FM series. I'm really disappointed by this as could have been a great way to bring new players in. The FM series has tried alternative gameplay before and has come out pretty well, yet for the first time in this generation it might have been better off staying with its tride and true formula. Especially considering how few SRPG series there were. I say stay away or get it on the cheap, very cheap steam sale.			",286,35,6,42,10,0,13

												A different take on the Front Mission series. It almost completely eliminates what makes Front Mission good (Turn based strategies, unique interesting characters/Wanzers, good story) and adds in poorly done third person shooter aspects. It feels almost like it's trying to be Armored Core, but minus the customization and background.There is some potential hidden, too bad it's hidden under a terrible control scheme, mediocre gameplay, and a lack of anything interesting at all. If not for the 3$ price point, I would have ignored it completely.If you're an achievement hound, and don't mind poorly done gameplay (although it IS playable), AND you see it on the cheap it's a maybe...

												I have waited a long time to review this fantastic game, I am not the largest mecha fan, and I am not a hipster who enjoys his Gundam Seed or 00 but I do know a thing or two about gaint robots and their struggle in the post apocalyptic future. First off you will quickly notice that Front Mission Evolved is not like the other Front Mission games and isntead of using strategy and having a map with plot points, you are given a thrid person angle and a mech with as much handeling as a flat bed with trashcan lids as wheels. Combat in Front Mission Evolved is the most luxurious and exquisite display of mentaly handicap robots, I for one support the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ population and their role in our future robot wars. Now ground combat is spectacular, Gears of War's fluid and functioning controls are blown out of the water by the unreal ammount of realism in the ground combat, the mech controls are the only thing that is compareable in every way. This game puts Armored Core to shame!			",317,46,3,22,17,2,20

												Great Mech game. Story was a little to predictable and was to deep but was still good. The gameplay was pretty smooth compared to mech titles like mech assualt, and armored core that ive played in the past. The only issue i had with the game was the first on foot mission is badly bugged made me play through it 7 times because it would randomly crash. On another not the on foot missions while okay were annoyingly hard because the guns auto target when you aim near an enemy and the auto target cant lead worth a crap making moving targets pretty hard to hit. Also for those looking for MP its dead sadly :P looked like it could have been sweet but aparently that boat sailed months ago. Altogether this is a really solid game and i would reccommend it to a friend however wait for it to go on sale i got mine at $5 months ago and ive seen it hit that price at least 3-4 times in the last year.

												This game sadly is not worth the current 50 dollar price tag. The game's tutorial requires one to actively check the Control Options screen in order to see what the controls are instead of using a simple ""Press <ACTUAL KEY> to do action!"".  Instead it appears as ""PRESS THE RIGHT SHOULDER WEAPON KEY TO LOCK ON WITH MISSILES."" The game, while it has its moments in fun difficulty (Big firefights with lots of Wanzers (Bigass mecha) are onscreen duking it out), the boss fights are little more than tedium of tinking at the boss while staying around the health pack pickups.  Not once does a boss fight feel anything more than slow.  The storyline isn't bad, but neither is it really good.  I can't say much about the multiplayer, as every time I've tried joining a match, there was nobody active in it.  Overall, if the price drops below 20 bucks, it's a solid purchase at that price, but otherwise, ignore it.			",231,20,2,51,11,5,38

												Love this game. The combinations/customization that you can do with the mech is fun and really diverse, though I personally tend to go for the speedier mechs rather than weapons-bulky. Good buy though, more or less.Story probably ain't perfect but hell, good gameplay to me, so I don't really care.			",218,35,20,38,30,2,42

												I am a big fan of the Front Mission series, however this game takes the Front Mission setting and makes a game that is... basically worse than the Front Mission strategy gameplay in all aspects. It should really be called ""Front Mission Devolved"".Youd think that they would put in some effort to justify switching Front Mission to a third person shooter, but it just feels like a cheaply made game.The plot is laughable - the voice acting is very uneven (a lot of the characters are emotionless when they should show emotion, and ALL the emotional scenes fall completely flat) and it is just poorly written and generic. A major theme of the game is the incredible power of the ""EDGE System"" which supposedly makes you into a superhuman mech piloting machine, but gameplay wise EDGE is pretty terrible. It only slows down enemies slightly for a few seconds and I hardly used it at all. The one badass female character turns into an emotional wreck halfway through the game just from seeing someone who scares her. The main character is as boring as you can get, with no real motivation besides ""revenge!"" And the villains have massive plot armor, even after you fight them in a half hour boss battle their wanzers don't get a scratch.The game's very hard to control with a controller so I would suggest using mouse and keyboard - ESPECIALLY in the (boring) on foot segments which will always crash if you use a controller. Even then however, the animations feel pretty stiff during combat. The on foot sections feel tacked on and even more like an attempt to make the game appeal to ""westerners"".The graphics are also pretty poor. Even for the time they came out they were dated. The graphics look like a launch Xbox 360 game from 2006.The music is of course generic without any of the incredible tracks such as the ones Yoko Shimomura made for the original Front Mission. While it's not horrible, it's also pretty forgettable.All in all it would have been better if they just ported Front Mission 4 or 5 to Steam (and probably made more money too). The Front Mission series was merely the victim of executive meddling thinking a shooter would appeal more to Westerners. That may be the case but it certainly didn't result in a better game, even as far as third person shooters go.			",289,80,5,45,17,2,33

												I liked it. It's a shame the multiplayer is absolutely dead as that seems like it would be pretty awesome. I had played front mission 3 before this and although I miss the strategy style game, I was okay with it being a shooter type. I had also loved armored core as a kid though so perhaps that made my transition better. I didn't run into any bugs on windows 10, but can't vouch for anything others could run into. Overall glad I played it and beat it, though the story is generic and single player game isn't terribly difficult. Who doesn't like wanzers? =P			",239,66,3,51,31,3,68

												Ugh, where to start...Well, I suppose I should start on just who would be intrested in this game - If you love mech games in general, then go ahead and get this. That specific genre is rather thin, and despite this games flaws it's still a bit ahead of a lot of the current offerings.If you love the older FM games, and like mech games, don't get this. For people who haven't played any of the TBS FM games, they won't know how much this game craps on them. If you're a member of this group, I'd really recommend you'd buy Project Nimbus instead. If you're intrested in the multiplayer, then I'd recommend you look into Heavy Gear Assault (Not on Steam) or Hawken. If you never played, or don't like the older FM games, and are fine with single player, then you could give this game a try. As it is, it's a well-done SP mech game. As for the crashing issues, I never did come across any of them though I'll admit this was on a much older computer that was closer in spec to the games requirements. Haven't tried it on my current machine yet. (Edit - Haven't had crashing issues on this computer, i5-4590/GTX 960. I suppose the issue is random though, but I haven't experienced any)			",538,81,7,72,77,4,98

												So Front Mission on Steam. Yaayyyy, right?So does this game totally suck? No, it's just meh. For starters, the graphics look like a PS2 launch title, and gameplay mechanics remind of something for the PSX in 1997. It reminds me of Robotech Battlecry, you get to play out your mech fantasy, but somehow the devs didn't really pull it off. Even if this game had been released back 2001, it still would have been a 6.5 out of 10. Like I said this game isn't total crap, but it isn't great either. I got this game on sale ($6.99 I think), so I don't feel ripped off. If the game is on sale again, and you're a fan of the series, pick it up. Otherwise pass. This series was a complete jem back in the day, and like most of Square Enix properties, it has gone to seed. It's to bad that this will be the last game in the series, and it had to go out like this.			",71,4,1,6,2,0,6

												So yeah, i just finished the game. (Single player campaign mode) [2015-12-27]TL;DR:If you are a longtime fan of the game, well, let's just say your expectations will be too high it won't be met.BUT If you've never played a front mission game before, DON'T BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. With the requirement that you like the ff categories:MechsTPSAdventureSensible story (more on this later)Robot fights!!!!Blowing things upCaveat(s)** Don't read text behind spoiler alerts.PROSFun Gameplay.Modest difficulty. Played only in 'Hard' difficulty which is the hardest difficulty in the game. It's not too easy, but it's not too frustrating at the same time. I liked the balance here. Only real hard time you'll get are from the bosses. As in, multiple bosses in one boss fight. Sh!t, that was hell.BG Sound is OKAY. It's not annoying, It's there all the time, but you don't really notice it even though it complements the whole atmosphere at the same time.Dub: Voice Acting is OKAY. It's not overly superb, but it's not bad either. Average even for todays' standard. And this was released in 2010Story: Not bad. TBH, it's not overly superb. But it does the job. It's not cheesy, there aren't too many ""ive'-seen-that-before"" either. It's pretty decent. In fact, imma even say, it's a Good story compared to most games that come out nowadays. It even comes with a... plot twist! So yeah, most near-end plot points copulate well with the premise that's why it has a sensible story.Controls: Actually really, really good. I don't get why other people say the controls are bad. I really really don't. It's not even 'not bad' or 'just okay'; It's not hard to remember, it's perfectly compatible, it doesn't feel stiff, it doesn't bother your gameplay, It's just plain perfect.CONSGame crashes. Game crashed on the first foot level (level name: War Hero). Really sucks. Game crash fixing didn't really help when i checked the interwebz. Fix found belowThere is no OP mech setup. At least even just for the single player story mode. Nope. Not at all.Dub-lipsync: It's bad at some parts.Facial expressions: Well, it's a 2010 release. Waddaya expect?Multiplayer is dead. Let me repeat that: ""MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD"" It's understandable considering its' age and an ocean of multiplayer only games available in the industry today. That's why this review is about single player campaign only in the first place. Maybe there are some hobbyist out there with a private server setup or something, but I'm not going through that extra mile effort to find it anymore. So for the official, un-modded game, it's long gone and six feet under.Err.. More emotions??? Story probably could have evoked more emotions out of the gamer playing the game. Square Enix is known for that. In this sense, it feels like a non-Square Enix game. But then it's front mission. Ah, well.Couple of story telling annoyances. If you aren't too critical of a person, you won't see it. But if you are, well, that is why you would say the story is just ""Okay"".Game crash fixGame crashed about thrice. On the same level of the same part of the level. Because i was going Rambo and trying to be Machete at the same time. Changed my settings twice then played with the same tactics only to experience the crash again. After that, i said, ""Ah, f*** it."" and changed the game back to my preferred settings then played in a more cautious manner. So i guess the core fix that needs to be done here is the players' mindset.This is my setting for the game after a few restarts of the game (not the computer) that made my playthrough smooth and non-crashy. It might be different with yours, but try if you're going insane.I'll only include settings which are usually factors of a game crash.Game settings  Misc   Controller Gamepad   Audio   Dolby Pro Logic II On   Video   Resolution 1280x720 @ 60 Hz   Shader High   Texture High   Shadow High   Vsync On   Anisotropic filtering x16 Environment  OS Windows 7 Ultimate, 64bit   CPU i7 - Devils Canyon   RAM 8Gb   Videocard Onboard, N/A   Gamepad Razer sabertooth 4/5 - Entertaining, was not too disappointed.

												It's a real shame what they did with this game. Had it been a PC-only release, it would've probably possessed a FAR better network system to keep it alive. It's kickass mech action but the storyline is kindergarden-level. The multiplayer part is pretty intense but I recommend to play through the Front Mission Central group, pretty much the only active group left that plays frequently. It's pretty niche, yes, so pick it up whenever it goes for offer as, sadly, it's not worth the full price... AT ALL. Still, if you love manly mechs and missile barrages as much as I do, get it.

												Absolutely underrated game IMO, just a total blast to play. Easy to get into and as in depth as you want it to be. It lacks some of the overall depth of Armored Core V: Verdict Day, but I enjoy the gameplay and the overall look of the game much better. Graphically, this game is light years ahead of the AC series, though that is probably mostly due to this being PC version, vice 720p on the PS3 or 360. I do wish there were more single player modes to experiement with, vice just the campaign. This is one of the games I have no doubt I will play it through to the end. Would really like to see this game series to continue to ""evolve,"" hope to see a new FM at some point down the road. Day one buy for me. Mechs for ever!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw videos of this game and thought it looked great, but the reviews here on steam made me weary.After playing it for a couple of hours, I love it so far and it was better than what I expected, and the reviews make no sense to me.Plays amazing, very pleasant fluid movement and shooting, great graphics, amazing meaty sound effects, perfectly gives you the feeling of piloting a huge mech.Lots of depth in combat with lots of combat and movement options, and many customization options for your mech, from how you want it to play to the mech's looks.It's a great port, runs fluidly and loads fast, haven't had any crash or technical problem so far.Story is fine, characters are not annoying, facial and character animation is great and voice acting great as well.If you're looking for a cool third person shooter or a good mecha game, I think you'll like it.

												The gameplay itself is great, fun and reminiscent of the Armored Core games. You can upgrade your mechs various parts, weapons, etc. Zoom around launching homing missles, artillery-like grenade strikes, while blasting away with your chainguns, rifles, or a melee weapon / sheild if you like.I did have a few complaints however -- The story is incredibly cheesy, overly dramatic. wtih ""comic relief"" in the strangest of spots.  Many characters are just over-the-top stereotypes and annoying to boot. I guess if you like anime-style story telling you'd be into this, but I found it very silly.Also annoying was that setting up your mech for certain missions, it would not tell you the prerequisit for the mission... meaning you would spend 15 minutes setting your mech up just right only to get an error message when you try to start the mission ""oh sorry, you need X legs instead of Y, completely ♥♥♥♥ing your entire build			",221,10,4,17,10,0,27

												This is a shameful game.  It is a disservice to any fans of Front Mission and Mecha fans.  The controls are awkward and the campaign forces you to use certain parts which takes away from the customization.  Even with the Last Stand DLC, with multiplayer dead you will never be able to get xp for the parts that you want.  Best to pass on this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot recommend this despite being an ardent fan of the franchise.Now, look. I'm not saying its that bad, but you'll only want to get it if you're willing to overlook a lot of weaknesses. The game is ""Front Mission"" franchise inspired, but I don't really think this game can be considered as a canon. If its canon, the storyline can be interesting, but its just a small piece of something in the vast universe of ""Front Mission"".Granted that as of the time of writing this review, Square Enix is only content in milking out the customers for ""re-releases"", I seriously cannot recommend this to even another ""Front Mission"" franchise addicts. If you wanted a mecha shooter, well, yeah, this game is probably one of the games you'll want to buy, but even as a stand alone (let's just for a moment, assume to remove the ""Front Mission"" franchising from this title), the gameplay itself isn't polished enough. It feels like a very cheap clone of ""Armored Core"" series, imitating a lot in terms of gameplay, but fails to even hold a light against the other franchise.Just, won't recommend this.(i'm already kind enough on language)			",143,27,3,30,15,0,16

												I found the general gameplay & mechanics to be fun and easy enough to learn and I think most people could find them enjoyable.  I will note however that you should not expect a great story, but at the same time I've seen far worse.  There are a number of what one could say are overly sexual & or quite psychotic female pilots. (Adela walks around with an extreme butt sway, while one of the enemy pilots seems to get sexually excited at the prospect of killing you etc etc.)  Despite the drawbacks I really think it's best that if you're interested, watch some of the gameplay in some videos and give it consideration.  Sure it has some draw backs but at its core it's a fun mech game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recommended for mecha fans ONLY!If you've played Armored Core, then you'll feel right at home playing Front Mission Evolved. This is a 3rd person game in which you pilot mechs called ""Wanzers"". Like Armored Core, you can upgrade your Wanzer with different chassis components and weapons. You unlock better upgrades as you progress. There's also a 3rd person shooter component of the game that has you run around on foot, using a very small selection of infantry firearms (shotgun, rifle, or rocket launcher). It's reminiscent of another, older Mech game, Shogo Mobile Armor. The mech combat portion of the game is alright. It's fun to charge around, throwing ridiculous amounts of missiles and gunfire at the enemy Wanzers. The hit detection is usually pretty clean and the enemy AI can get smart, dodging long range fire and running away from melee attacks. It is annoying that none of the enemies ever run out of ammo and can dash/sprint indefinitely. I also didn't always enjoy having every boss be incredibly overpowered. But overall, they seem to have gotten it right.The 3rd person infantry part of the game is awful however. The character movement is terribly clunky and clumsy, with very little precision. The vast majority of enemies in this mode will consist of 2 types; those with shotguns who run at you, and those with rifles who stay at a distance. Occasionally they'll throw in a ""ballistic"" soldier with a rocket launcher, or give you a helicopter or wanzer enemy to shoot 4 times with a rocket. I didn't enjoy it at any point, and it could have been done much better. You will be struggling through these portions to get to more Wanzer action.A problem with both combat modes is two-fold; poor friendly AI and enemy AI that focuses solely on you. Your allies are pretty useless and will very seldom kill an enemy (unless it's a cutscene of course). That, combined with the fact that the enemies usually prioritize YOUR destruction over anything else creates a less fun and more difficult environment to play in. There are also little in-game collectables, though they seem to have no purpose other than to be collected.Graphically, the game looks pretty good, though it might be a bit dated by now. There were a few voice sync problems with the cutscenes, but no other problems. The soundtrack is generic and forgettable. The voice acting is a bit cheesy but it's okay, although one character couldn't decide if he was British or Australian. Front Mission's story is a bit predictable and has few surprises. There are a couple unanswered questions, some things that don't make sense, and a romance subplot you'll see coming a mile away. But then this isn't really a plot-driven game anyway.Play this game for the mecha combat. Everything else is either pretty forgettable or barely tolerable.			",80,35,0,17,10,0,12

												Really fun game and I really enjoyed it until it crashed to the desktop and it corrupted my save game when I was about half way through the game.  Is it good enough to go back the next day and replay the entire first half of the game? Not right now it isn't.  Perhaps in a few months I will go back and play it again but this corrupted save crash ruined this game for me.  The save game issue aside this game is fantastic and alot of fun to play.

Still, I found this game one of the best Front Mission game.			",164,17,5,32,5,2,12

												The game's not terrible, but there are certain things that keep it from being awesome (like it should have been). I'm a long-time fan of the Front Mission games, but this installment just really doesn't do it justice. First of all, the vertical and horizontal mouse sensitivity are the same, making it impossible to find a good sensitivity setting that satisfies both. I found myself constantly having to look at the controls in the options because when they want you to, for example, activate EDGE mode, they simply say to press the ""edge button"". Thanks, Square Enix.			",308,58,4,38,25,2,49

												Considering a PC game platform, I would rate this game as 5/10The only reason I enjoyed it a bit, was that I reduced dificulty to easy and focushed on waching the plot.Goods:+ Mech configuration and variety of wepons and fighting styles+ Nice cinematics (at least for my taste). Not something exceptional, but interesting and movie-style ones.+ Short title, if played on Easy difficulty. Will be like waching a space-mech movie a tenth of hours long, with lots of action scheans... For this game, the 'short' is a posetive thing.+ Nice sound of weapons and mech movement. Interesting feeling that you drive a 'big' robot wit 'deadly strong' weapons.Bads:- Console port logic => Terrible HUD configuration (for my likes): No customization of HUD, huge visuals on it hiding the screen, enormouse crossair with a stupit usless big rentacle arround it, just to make me unable to focus on the environment graphics- Console port logic => Strange and 'sluggy' movement of mech and mouse and controls in general... No hope for accurasy with mouse (I never play FPS with gamepad)... Gamepad orientation is obvius for example from the fact that you are forced to use one kay-command that combines 'change weapon' command and 'interact with environment'.., I once managed to accidently shoot a rocket at the in-my-fase console I was trying to activate...- Heavy-loaded visuals during combat (for my taste),,, Many of the times, I could see nothing more than red explosion gasses and bright ganlights during combat. Instead of understanding if i was shooting at a tank or a wanzer (mech), I was just trying to zero close to the bright red rectangles of HUD aim-lock elements. Only when I focused on sniper weaponry and got used of the game, I started to enjoing the game graphics... I dont know why, but I felt like getting a kind of light headache while playing, mabie becouse of the sholder-camera mooving in-and-our of my mech in an unconfortable way.- Unfair boss fights if you are in a sniper-focush build... More details here could be a spoiler... :-)- The story is not any memorable masterpiece that would overcome the above handicaps of the game. Scenarion is interesting but not well-displayed in the dialoges and the cutsheens (for my liking at least). Some characters are included in a cutshene, but there is no good presentation of them, making me feel like parts of the game and plot before the particular encounter have been taken out of the final product  There is no humour on the dialogues and not any particular art-of-literature... There are many of better space-opera stories at other games, books or films... On the other hand, the cinematics graphics and aesthetics does indead create a good immersion of a future-mechanic-space world.- Will propably have to search for human players at forums if you intent to go on multiplayer games. Having the game 'searching for other players' at the multiplayer screen for two minutes, reaulted in no-one baing online...In general, I dont feel robbed-out -of-my-money with Front Mission Evolved, since it costed me less than an evening movie ticket, and it offered me about 15 hours of a not-so-bad mechanised sience-fiction story (including combat gametime). But, I will not advertise or recommend the game to my friends, since there are many far-better FPS space-story games out there with controls-sensitivites appropriate for a decent mouse-and-keyboard PC bulletstorm... My personal estimation is that If you find the game on big sales and you like heavy-shooting mechs, you will have some entertainment by playing it. If not, waching only the cinematics if they are avaialabe at a webpage nowdays, will be more rewording.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The good. They do very well keeping the feel of the wanzers, the way they battle, the way they fight, even in 3rd and real time. It feels like you are piloting one of the old front mission cut scenes/intros. Mech customization is right up there with the origionals.The bad. From a franchinese that has deep and interesting story i expected more. The story in front mission is BAD, the acting is WORSE. There are hints here and there that suggest there was going to be more indepth plot and character development, but apparently it just was decided against or something. The games fairly short, but nothing shorter then what we have come to expect from ""recent"" games.The Multiplayer. Playing vs other people is a blast. It uses a leveling system where as you get higher ranks you can unlock more gear. HOWEVER. The game isn't cross platform and is P2P. Meaning no one is EVER on. So the multiplayer, the best part of this game, is gone.Overall A Failure.			",272,68,5,96,42,1,102

												Great Mech game. Story was a little to predictable and was to deep but was still good. The gameplay was pretty smooth compared to mech titles like mech assualt, and armored core that ive played in the past. The only issue i had with the game was the first on foot mission is badly bugged made me play through it 7 times because it would randomly crash. On another not the on foot missions while okay were annoyingly hard because the guns auto target when you aim near an enemy and the auto target cant lead worth a crap making moving targets pretty hard to hit. Also for those looking for MP its dead sadly :P looked like it could have been sweet but aparently that boat sailed months ago. Altogether this is a really solid game and i would reccommend it to a friend however wait for it to go on sale i got mine at $5 months ago and ive seen it hit that price at least 3-4 times in the last year.

												It's a real shame what they did with this game. Had it been a PC-only release, it would've probably possessed a FAR better network system to keep it alive. It's kickass mech action but the storyline is kindergarden-level. The multiplayer part is pretty intense but I recommend to play through the Front Mission Central group, pretty much the only active group left that plays frequently. It's pretty niche, yes, so pick it up whenever it goes for offer as, sadly, it's not worth the full price... AT ALL. Still, if you love manly mechs and missile barrages as much as I do, get it.

												I can't say Front Mission Evolved wasn't fun, because it was, but only very briefly. This game is short. Very short. If you enjoy 3rd-person mecha destruction run-and-gun action in boring, repetitive environments and lacking in emotional depth or plot depth, then FME is for you. If you enjoy Front Mission games for their tactical options and deep story, then you might want to try something else. Evolved was a brave attempt at something new. While they achieved...something, they missed where it counts.			",949,289,27,103,75,9,153

												So Front Mission on Steam. Yaayyyy, right?So does this game totally suck? No, it's just meh. For starters, the graphics look like a PS2 launch title, and gameplay mechanics remind of something for the PSX in 1997. It reminds me of Robotech Battlecry, you get to play out your mech fantasy, but somehow the devs didn't really pull it off. Even if this game had been released back 2001, it still would have been a 6.5 out of 10. Like I said this game isn't total crap, but it isn't great either. I got this game on sale ($6.99 I think), so I don't feel ripped off. If the game is on sale again, and you're a fan of the series, pick it up. Otherwise pass. This series was a complete jem back in the day, and like most of Square Enix properties, it has gone to seed. It's to bad that this will be the last game in the series, and it had to go out like this.			",71,4,1,6,2,0,6

Will be like waching a space-mech movie a tenth of hours long, with lots of action scheans... For this game, the 'short' is a posetive thing.+ Nice sound of weapons and mech movement. Interesting feeling that you drive a 'big' robot wit 'deadly strong' weapons.Bads:- Console port logic => Terrible HUD configuration (for my likes): No customization of HUD, huge visuals on it hiding the screen, enormouse crossair with a stupit usless big rentacle arround it, just to make me unable to focus on the environment graphics- Console port logic => Strange and 'sluggy' movement of mech and mouse and controls in general... No hope for accurasy with mouse (I never play FPS with gamepad)... Gamepad orientation is obvius for example from the fact that you are forced to use one kay-command that combines 'change weapon' command and 'interact with environment'.., I once managed to accidently shoot a rocket at the in-my-fase console I was trying to activate...- Heavy-loaded visuals during combat (for my taste),,, Many of the times, I could see nothing more than red explosion gasses and bright ganlights during combat. Instead of understanding if i was shooting at a tank or a wanzer (mech), I was just trying to zero close to the bright red rectangles of HUD aim-lock elements. Only when I focused on sniper weaponry and got used of the game, I started to enjoing the game graphics... I dont know why, but I felt like getting a kind of light headache while playing, mabie becouse of the sholder-camera mooving in-and-our of my mech in an unconfortable way.- Unfair boss fights if you are in a sniper-focush build... More details here could be a spoiler... :-)- The story is not any memorable masterpiece that would overcome the above handicaps of the game. Scenarion is interesting but not well-displayed in the dialoges and the cutsheens (for my liking at least). Some characters are included in a cutshene, but there is no good presentation of them, making me feel like parts of the game and plot before the particular encounter have been taken out of the final product  There is no humour on the dialogues and not any particular art-of-literature... There are many of better space-opera stories at other games, books or films... On the other hand, the cinematics graphics and aesthetics does indead create a good immersion of a future-mechanic-space world.- Will propably have to search for human players at forums if you intent to go on multiplayer games. Having the game 'searching for other players' at the multiplayer screen for two minutes, reaulted in no-one baing online...In general, I dont feel robbed-out -of-my-money with Front Mission Evolved, since it costed me less than an evening movie ticket, and it offered me about 15 hours of a not-so-bad mechanised sience-fiction story (including combat gametime). But, I will not advertise or recommend the game to my friends, since there are many far-better FPS space-story games out there with controls-sensitivites appropriate for a decent mouse-and-keyboard PC bulletstorm... My personal estimation is that If you find the game on big sales and you like heavy-shooting mechs, you will have some entertainment by playing it. If not, waching only the cinematics if they are avaialabe at a webpage nowdays, will be more rewording.			",255,93,5,80,29,0,91

												Honestly if you like cheesy B grade games with mind numbing action then pick this up on sale. However if you like your mech games a bit more complex and without the frustrating gameplay, then steer clear.I can only recommend this game if you have nothing else similar to play.Finished the game on normal difficulty in 7.5 hours.

												I was very sceptic of this title and I only tried it because of the nostalgia for old ""Front Mission"" games. Instead of 2D turn-based combat this time it's 3D third-person perspective action game where you pilot 1 wanzer (mech). Guess what... that game is not so bad and has very solid gameplay. The story is not that original, but it suits classic ""Front Mission"" feeling ;) If you liked old ""Front Mission"" games there is a good chance you will like this one also ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't say Front Mission Evolved wasn't fun, because it was, but only very briefly. This game is short. Very short. If you enjoy 3rd-person mecha destruction run-and-gun action in boring, repetitive environments and lacking in emotional depth or plot depth, then FME is for you. If you enjoy Front Mission games for their tactical options and deep story, then you might want to try something else. Evolved was a brave attempt at something new. While they achieved...something, they missed where it counts.			",949,289,27,103,75,9,153

												Great Mech game. Story was a little to predictable and was to deep but was still good. The gameplay was pretty smooth compared to mech titles like mech assualt, and armored core that ive played in the past. The only issue i had with the game was the first on foot mission is badly bugged made me play through it 7 times because it would randomly crash. On another not the on foot missions while okay were annoyingly hard because the guns auto target when you aim near an enemy and the auto target cant lead worth a crap making moving targets pretty hard to hit. Also for those looking for MP its dead sadly :P looked like it could have been sweet but aparently that boat sailed months ago. Altogether this is a really solid game and i would reccommend it to a friend however wait for it to go on sale i got mine at $5 months ago and ive seen it hit that price at least 3-4 times in the last year.

												Story: The game tries to create a new storyline within the FM universe. This isn't bad cause it helps bring new players in, the problem falls on they tried cramming in a 60+ hour series storyline into a measly 4-5 hour game. The overdramatic touches the nonsensical characters. It all felt very harsh when you're chopping it all together. In a bigger more flesh out game this might have been a ok storyline, here ur better off skipping the cs's.Gameplay: As far as mech games go, this one tries to hard to be a cross between ""Armored Core"" and ""Third person shooter"". It's nice that they added in the look and customization of the previous FM games, but the gameplay has become a almost bland expierence. You enter a level, missle down a row of bad guys, and move on. There's hardly really any strategy or even need for most of the customization options added into the game. I was shocked when they switched to a out of mech stage and you play on foot. It tried to emulate other third person games like ""Gears of War"" or just any simply generic shooter. The game needed more balance and tuning on it's mech side without the need of these on foot segments. Overall: I really can't recommend this game, especially to any fan of the FM series. I'm really disappointed by this as could have been a great way to bring new players in. The FM series has tried alternative gameplay before and has come out pretty well, yet for the first time in this generation it might have been better off staying with its tride and true formula. Especially considering how few SRPG series there were. I say stay away or get it on the cheap, very cheap steam sale.			",286,35,6,42,10,0,13

												A different take on the Front Mission series. It almost completely eliminates what makes Front Mission good (Turn based strategies, unique interesting characters/Wanzers, good story) and adds in poorly done third person shooter aspects. It feels almost like it's trying to be Armored Core, but minus the customization and background.There is some potential hidden, too bad it's hidden under a terrible control scheme, mediocre gameplay, and a lack of anything interesting at all. If not for the 3$ price point, I would have ignored it completely.If you're an achievement hound, and don't mind poorly done gameplay (although it IS playable), AND you see it on the cheap it's a maybe...

												Well, i loved the Front Mission on playstation, and i loved Armored Core, so i thought FME would be pretty good, and it could have been. But graphics are getting old, and controls are horrible. If you try to play with keyboard and mouse, you will suffer an inverse mouse acceleration that make the game horrible, the faster you mouve your mouse the slower it goes, and vertical axis is just totally messed up.If you play with a controller, the deadzones are very large, and the sensitivity curves are also horrible. The multiplayer is dead, and i think it's mainly because of the controls .So, bad controls is the point.			",257,44,22,14,26,1,27

												I have waited a long time to review this fantastic game, I am not the largest mecha fan, and I am not a hipster who enjoys his Gundam Seed or 00 but I do know a thing or two about gaint robots and their struggle in the post apocalyptic future. First off you will quickly notice that Front Mission Evolved is not like the other Front Mission games and isntead of using strategy and having a map with plot points, you are given a thrid person angle and a mech with as much handeling as a flat bed with trashcan lids as wheels. Combat in Front Mission Evolved is the most luxurious and exquisite display of mentaly handicap robots, I for one support the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ population and their role in our future robot wars. Now ground combat is spectacular, Gears of War's fluid and functioning controls are blown out of the water by the unreal ammount of realism in the ground combat, the mech controls are the only thing that is compareable in every way. This game puts Armored Core to shame!			",317,46,3,22,17,2,20

												It's nice to come back to Front Mission. I have vivid memories of me playing Front Mission 3 on PSX and this game made me feel a bit nostalgic, as I was controlling a huge badass mech with huge boomsticks. Well, that's the part for which I love this game.The plot, however, is rediculous. So pattern. So unoriginal. Well, it's only possible to catch some LULZ from it, and it was fun.			",61,10,0,6,5,0,6

												The only way I would recommend Front Mission Evolved is if you're a huge fan of mech combat games and you're just really itching for another one, and you happen to see it on sale.  Easily the best part of the game is the amount of customization, although certain missions will force you into using certain parts on your mech (such as hover legs for crossing water or giving you a sniper rifle) that wouldn't have bothered me all that much if the parts they forced you into using were actually enjoyable.  The sniper rifle was one of the least satisfying guns I've used in any game, and whenever I had to use it that mission just dragged on and on.  In general most of the weapons outside of melee weapons and shotguns leave a bit to be desired.  All of the others are just pretty dull feeling and boring to use.In general most of the combat and gameplay is extremely repetitive. They also force you out of the mech from time to time to do a standard third person shooter segment, which is easily the worst part of the game to me.  All of those segments were a drag and completely uninspired.  It broke up the gameplay a bit, which in itself might have been nice, but the actual gameplay during that segment was extremely subpar. The story, voice acting, and characters are all pretty bad.  The story is about as generic as you can get, and all of the characters feel like a walking cliche that had almost no time put into their voice acting or writing.  Some of the dialogue is just cringe inducing, this is especially true during the game's boss battles where the enemy will spout the same phrase over and over again throughout the fight.  If you're going to pick up the game, pick it up when it's on sale.  Otherwise just go find a copy of one of the Armored Core games.  ",468,93,7,64,64,5,47

												I got this game to play the single player campaign, expecting the multiplayer servers to be dead, which they were. The mechanics and customization were solid, but the level design is awful in single player, and the enemy design almost as bad. Let me sum it up, the second to last boss has an attack where he fires two missiles that will destroy most of your health. They can be shot down, but not dodged. I chose to use a high powered rifle with a slow fire rate during the game. This rifle was awful without 100% perfect quickscoping at taking out those missiles. If both hit, you die. He also can attack for around a third of your health in melee with a super fast charge that cannot be avoided. Level design fails mostly in that it has a bad habbit of spawning the player RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BLOODY ENEMY and gives very little to no delay. The final boss actually gets a few free shots in its first form! This game isn't hard, this game is punishing and poorly balanced that wants you to play just one way.			",86,24,0,11,15,0,18
