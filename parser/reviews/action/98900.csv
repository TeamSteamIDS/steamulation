												Alien Hallway is very aptly named. It takes place entirely in hallways and it has aliens in it.The game is a simplistic tug-of-war. And when I say simplistic, I don't mean it's been dumbed down, I mean whack-a-mole has more complexities than this. You spawn soldiers and they automatically walk down the hallway towards the endless alien spawner. The only decision you have is when your soldiers should use their grenades but even those are on a cooldown so it's no big thing if you waste a few.In between missions you get to spend the money you earn on upgrades in a small metagame and as the game progresses more soldiers and aliens unlock. The gameplay however, never changes.Because everything is on a tiered cooldown so you will never have any choices to make beyond which soldier to build first. Everything after that is simply bought when the cooldown ends, not when you need or want it.Alien Hallway is a perversion of the genre and so easy even a child could play it and win.

												Although this game is one of the better games from Sigma Team it still is a lemon!The game is a simplified TD style game in which you have to defend a corridor from alien hordes. IF you like Tower Defense games, there are far better games to play. And buying it only because it has achievements is a not well thought justification for buying it.It's a mindless little game for maybe one or two breaks to waste away, but don't put too much time into it. It's very fast routine, and after it got routine, it grows painfully boring. If you still want to try out, wait for some bundle that has this game, or try to get a gifted version from somebody who has a rather sadistic mindset ... and actually enjoys gifting away this kind of games...Oh, by the way... I do still have a gift coupon for Bad-Rats... which has at least some more unintended humor in it...			",1553,811,51,244,215,11,265

												""Get ready to send marines to kill aliens that no man's seen before!""That, my friend, is the plot of Alien Hallway in one sentence. Sorry for spoiling it. Alien Hallway is a light strategy game where you only manage the finances and hiring troops, who handle the destruction by themselves.Drones get you money by scavenging electronics. With money you can send marines to destroy the alien teleporter, the objective of every level. The marines are AI controlled and you can only choose, when to throw their grenades. At the same time you must not allow the aliens to destroy your base.Apparently, these aliens are fairly technologically advanced. There's no telling which side threw the first stone but because of the mentality of the storyline, my bet would be on the humans. Most of the aliens are fairly mindless and naked green little men who just come and smash your hyper-trained marines but their elite troops have powerful swords and advanced armour, ranged weapons like blasters, forcefields that make the aliens nearly indestructible and even huge exoskeletons with tank cannons attached to be reckoned with. One alien type clearly tries to fry the brains of your troops with some kind of telepathy and another one is an exploding kamikaze troop.On your side, you've got a fairly diverse bunch of soldiers and a manually used air strike that can be used every once in a while. Curiously, the flame-thrower guy is the cheapest and weakest of the bunch. The pricier ones are generally better, so later I ended up usually simply stacking up on snipers, missile troopers and heavy laser troops to beat the levels quickly and efficiently. This is important because it gives you gold.In between missions you can upgrade your troops and other assets with the gold, which in itself is pretty cool. Higher upgrades are more expensive with diminishing returns on investment. The most significant upgrade is the soldiers getting better grenades at level 5, otherwise they just do more damage and can take more beating before dying. All levels are really similar to each other, with just stronger varieties or larger amounts of mobs. There are a mere couple of special ones like the one where you start with a large amount of funds but no income. There's some replay value to the levels because you can do them in four different difficulty levels - indeed, one of the achievements for the game requires you to beat every level on the highest difficulty (Expert) level. You can also try to 5-star each level, which amounts to doing them fast enough or with just a small number of casualties. Unfortunately, it's not very obvious what's enough for 5 stars, but the above goals seemed to nail it for me.Too bad the game is very grindy. To survive the last levels even on easy requires a good bit of grinding to get powerful enough troops to survive the missions. You can redo missions for gold, but it's rather boring because you already beat them before and they're no different when repeated. To get just one troop to level 10 requires on hour or more of grinding and to survive the expert mode you need several more troop types to high enough level to survive. One could call it a challenge, but mostly, it's a grind.This might not be a problem if you could control your soldiers a bit more. Generally they shoot the closest enemy and walk towards it, and the same goes for the aliens. However, often times it would be very useful for the snipers to concentrate fire on the forcefield units or the big enemies, but they will also just target the front-line. This is especially frustrating, when the alien teleporter is very close to being destroyed. The troops keep shooting some big tank enemy that could be finished off after the teleporter was down, but before the creature is down more enemies pop out of the teleporter. Just general orders to ""target large enemies"" and/or ""target the alien teleporter at all costs"" for different troop types could have made it so much more interesting.My stance to not recommend Alien Hallway stems from the lack of control over troops, because it's not enticing to just buy all the snipers, missiles and laser dudes your money can get, if you can't give them useful commands (throwing a grenade is not really a good one). This lack of control also makes the game rather casual. I got some 11 hours out of it, but probably first 2 or 3 of them went to finishing the game, the rest being just grinding for gold. It's not a bad game, but it's not very interesting one either. While its base price 5 € is not too bad, I'd still advice to get it on sale.			",3011,1260,77,374,381,26,452

												Alien Hallway is a decent 2.5D tower defense title where you have to defeat aliens. The graphics are poorly done, as well as the interface. The sounds are nothing to write home about and the gameplay is exactly the same as 90% of all the other TD games. Trust me if I say you'll have a better time with any other of those titles. Is it that bad ? No, it isn't, but it just isn't fun or challenging.[Rating: 58/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This is a very short game that is certainly not worth full price, but I actually found it pretty fun in the sense that it is a casual click-click strategy game. I mean it's basically mindless mouse clicking when your units or artillery are ready, but there's a lot of action going on at all times that makes it feel engaging. As you complete levels you earn gold to power up your units which keeps it interesting, but your units end up being overpowered against the enemy letting you pretty much just run over them untouched. Kinda fun, but I wouldn't want to tell you this is a must buy.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

													Alien Hallway is a real time strategy game played out like a tug of war between you and the aliens. If you've played Swords and Soldiers, you get the idea.	You gather resources with engineers to produce more and more, we'll call them Space Marines of various types to push back the alien onslaught  and eventually destroy their teleporter and prevent the aliens doing the same to you.  Units come in various types from the cheapest Flame-throwers who stand toe to toe with the aliens to the more expensive longe range, fragile but high damage units like Snipers and Missile Launchers.  The basic jist of the games is to produce lines of various units to not only do damage but to protect the high value, high production time units at the back.  Flame-throwers and riflemen are cheap don't do a lot of damage, but die well to protect the better units.	Completing a hallway earns you gold that can be used to upgrade you units and improve various other aspects like earning more gold when you complete a level, decrease the time it takes to produce units and have the engineers collect more energy.  The mechanic is similar to Defender's Quest where at higher difficulty levels you will need to grind levels multiple times to be strong enough to move on.  At normal you can just do one level after another without too much trouble. 	The graphics are serviceable at best and the game could use some usability improvements.  You can't use key-binds to produce units and the default mouse pointer is mostly black against a black background and can be hard to see.  Also don't try to take a screenshot, it crashes the game to desktop.	All in all, if you can get the game for cheap, it's decent fun for a few hours.  Don't think about paying full price.

Nothing to it but to click the icon to build a soldier and another to build a gatherer, etc. Imagine starcraft or command and conquer only this is to teach morons basic motor skills. There is nothing to it that warrants a continuation. I've only played about 15 minutes on normal and 8 levels in and each level is the exact same with literally nothing different. Garbage.

												This is an interesting linear RTS. Every time you finish a stage, you earn money and unlock the potential to go onto the next one. You use the money to upgrade your units and your income, the cost of each upgrade the value of the previous two upgrades added together. Unfortunately this makes upgrades almost not worth it at all if you didn't need them to try and beat the game on extreme difficulty.The music is kinda bland and the whole game just feels kinda soulless. There's little simplistic story text describing each stage to give it a little something.Ultimately, I'm neutral towards this game. I could give or take it. However, I side on the not recommended due to the upgrading system.			",887,402,13,172,130,8,221

												Fun little time waster.This enjoyable little game is light on strategy and high on action. It's very quick to complete but I feel you could have a second playthrough on a higher difficulty without being bored.The goal of the game is to kill the object at the end of the hallway. You do this by spawning guys from your side of the hallway. The enemy spawns guys at his side. The idea is you spawn guys with traits to counter the enemy traits. Once you push back the  enemy enough you attack his object.The game is very simple to play and can be completed in a few hours. It's not too difficult and rarely will you fail a mission. When you either fail or restart a mission you get a new pattern of enemy waves. Winning the rounds earns you currency that you spend on new skills, talents and weapons.			",244,49,13,41,28,2,76

												What can I say about this game I wonder... Well, I can say that it's boring and not worth your time. First you more or less finish the game on easier difficulty in just a bit of time. After that you'd either throw the game out of the window or you'll start grinding! Grinding!!! It's not even an online game where you can show off all your grinding skills. Neither is it a kewl game that is worth the grind to get the gold to upgrade your units high enough to complete the levels on hardest difficulty. But still, this game is a bit too boring. You just buy units and throw grenades anyways. No control over 'em.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												100% Completion ReviewA fairly simple, yet fun game. Reminds me of those flash games where you send waves of troops to each others base where troops battle in the middle. The game has a very decent upgrade system, although sometimes you may need to grind a few levels for upgrades to progress in the further levels/difficulties. There can be some strategy to the game; chosing the correct units, when to send to support one another and you have to defend your droids as they go out to harvest resources. The game is fairly short, but if you want to 100% it it's a great little time waster and challanging to beat on hardest difficulty.			",735,295,17,88,84,8,120

												(CATEGORY) ""Poor/Sub-Par/Average/Great/Superb""   1-5/5   (Score out of five) (OVERALL)- Personal rating VS Average Score – My personal rating for this, based mainly/heavily on price, is 80% (Five dollars does not go very far in America right now, so this is a pretty fair deal). My Average Score is 3/5 (60%)(GAMEPLAY)  ""Great"" 4/5 – If you have played Plants VS Zombies (PvZ), you will be very familiar with many of the mechanics of Alien Hallway. You have a single unit who produces Energy (much like the Sunflowers in PvZ) and you use other units as offense/defense. However in Alien Hallway, instead of staying still like PvZ, your units are constantly moving to the right, while the “Aliens” constantly are moving to the left. The goal is to repel the aliens and get to their “Transporter” device, which is the Alien home-base for that level. There are eight (8) battle units (+1 Energy maker) that each have a different weapon and play-style, ranging from: Flamethrower, Sniper, Shotgun, Rifle, Missiles, Grenadier, Heavy Lasers, and Machine Gun. Units are unlocked as levels are completed, and can be used in levels that they were not previously available in. In addition you can use a “Airstrike” ability, that will destroy enemies after a short delay. This ability and all of the units (and more) can be upgraded in a shop. You earn gold for completing missions, the amount of gold depending on how well you did in a level. You can re-do a level over and over again, and acquire more gold. Upgrading units will upgrade their health, damage, etc or enhance their abilities (Like the ability to throw a grenade). You can also upgrade how much gold you get for beating a level, the cool down on abilities, the defensive-capability of your base (which if you have aliens swarm your base, you would lose) and an extra slot upgrade. The slot is used much like Plants VS Zombies (easy comparison!) as in- you have so many slots to use different units, so you have to pick and choose wisely. The game plays out like a serious match of tug-of-war between “Little Green Men” (the style of the Aliens) VS Warhammer 40K Unit (see GRAPHICS). The game flows along easily, though I've heard of other people having minor issues. The matches last only a few minutes. (STORY)  ""Poor"" 1/5 – There are some small blurbs that accompany the missions/levels (“Will they ever stop?! Cover me! Never-ending green stream! To the battle!” Example of “mission info”) , but if anything they are hints, and not a true Story. Otherwise, this game has no story to it. In fact, I still am wondering why the “Good” guys have socks on their heads (with a  piece of black duck tape on their eyes) and wished that they explained if these are even humans. The fact that this game does not have a Story does not actually detract from the game at all. So this rating will only reflect the Average Score, not my Personal Rating. On the Flip Side, the hint section also shows what types of Aliens you will be facing in a level. (GRAPHICS)  ""Sub-Par"" 2/5 – There is nothing truly wrong with the graphics of Alien Hallway, but they aren't up to the standards of a modern PC game. That being said, just like the story, it doesn't detract from the gameplay too much. The character designs aren't horrible, but they aren't all that creative. The “Good” side usually has a set of heavy looking armor, similar to something from Warhammer 40k. The Aliens are “Little Green Men”, the first ones being baby-looking things that crawl on the ground, and only get... weirder... from there. If the Titular “Aliens” in this title were more original I would have given this a 3/5. After all, it's a game about killing Aliens (and Reverse-Tug-of-War). Each planet in the game (three in total) has a different look to it. This is an upside, but they aren't ultra-creative (lack of creativity is the main reason Graphics is a 2/5). (SOUND)  ""Sub-Par"" 2/5 – The music can be a bit repetitive. It does sound like Aliens created it, too. However it didn't make me want to cover my ears. The sound effects when choosing a level are a F- because there is no music when choosing (I believe) and the sound effects do not sound very good / high quality. The in-game battle sound effects aren't terrible, but they don't sound impressive either.  (ONLINE)  ""Sub-Par"" 3/5 – This is a Single-Player game only. It does not have (AFAIK) any DRM. This is what I would give an Average rating. The single-player campaign consists of three “Worlds” to defend. Each planet has a different look (as far as graphics) and increases with difficulty as you go.(RE-PLAYABILITY) ""Great"" 4/5 – I personally like re-starting games that allow me to pick-and-choose what upgrades I get, for a customized play experience. This game allows you to (through the easy difficulty) beat the game with the units you want to focus on, instead of needing to focus on every single unit. The reason why this is a 4/5, despite being not very deep, is because the nature of the game is that you want to re-play missions over and over, so you can supe up your units for the next battle, destroying alien after alien. This game has a lot of mindless fun. If you take it too seriously, or think you'll be spending 100+ hours on it, then you might want to look else where (see (COST)). Replaying missions is actually fun; comparing how well I did when I first got the mission to how fast I can do it with upgraded units (or units not available at that time, unlocked later)(COST) ""Superb"" 5/5 – The best part of this game; it's cost is only 4.99 (USD). I personally feel that for any game you should get about or around one and a half (1.5) hours per one dollar (1$) you spend. This is not to say that Console games and “Triple AAA” titles that cost 60$ are worth it, because generally you wont be getting 60 hour games. In this game, you should easily get your 5 hours if you re-play it once on a harder difficulty. This is also a cheap reverse version of Plants VS Zombies, set in space, fighting against aliens... for 5$. Not too bad, in my book. (DIFFICULTY) Easy  – You are able to choose a difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) like most games, but even on Normal the game is quite easy to beat. You can earn up gold quickly and make your units/etc strong (or stronger than you necessarily need for a level, making the game Easy). On the Flip Side, you could purposely try to not “Grind” out gold to increase the difficulty. I say “Grind” because the game doesn't take much time to get gold. Upgrades are of a maximum of around 10, which doesn't take long at all to acquire (Maybe 10-15 minutes at maximum if you upgrade 'Gold Increase' first).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The basic premise for this game was strong and rather enjoyable. The gameplay concept most certainly would have been a hit if not only for the game's rather poor production quality. While I didn't encounter any bugs, the sparse attention to detail detracts from the overall experience. The game starts with a very enjoyable mechanic, but ends up not expanding on it in terms of complexity and longevity. I completed the game in just over two hours on the hardest difficulty and found myself wishing there was more to be seen and done.The game unfortunately provides only short lived thrills - thus I can only recommend you purchase it during a sale.

												Alien Hallway is a strategy game that follows the tug of war formula presented in popular games such as Swords and Soldiers HD. Unfortunately for Alien Hallway, the game contains bare minimum of features presented in a tug of war game.The maps are hilariously small, with no branching paths. This means that for the majority of the game, you are left sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥spamming buttons until either you or the alien opponent is defeated. There is no strategy involved in this setup, the miners cost a whopping 10 energy which can be spammed right on cool-down in conjunction with whatever space marine(s) you wish to summon.The polish is absolutely abysmal in this game. Some aliens, specifically melee ones, do not have attack animations. They do damage by simply running or walking into your soldiers. Along with low production value, the game appears to have performance and frame-rate issues when there are too many soldiers and/or aliens on screen at once. This makes Alien Hallway virtually unplayable in the endgame.I pity the fool that spent money on this game. Yes I pity myself.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Would I recommend Alien Hallway? YES!It's a fun little game, you can complete it in a few hours but for the price you can hardly complain.It's a casual game to kill some time if you're bored while waiting for something or if you want to play something random for a while.Your objective is to defend yourself against waves of aliens that are invading and attacking earth through a means of teleportation. You have to fight them back and destroy their teleportation beacons to stop them from spawning. You're then graded and rewarded coins in order to purchase upgrades for your next battle.It can get your heart racing in some moments, especially when there's a lot of high level enemies and you don't quite have the means to destroy them yet, so you're concerned that they may defeat you before you're ready to deploy your units or airstrikes.All in all, it's a fun title. If you find this game cheap, grab it, it's a few hours of fun each time you play it. You can't really go wrong.What are you waiting for? Go kill some aliens, soldier!			",1095,265,59,122,171,5,161

												Its clearly one of the worst game I have ever played. Gameplay is stupid and repetitive. All you can do is clicking at buttons when are of CD. New units looks almost same like those you get before. No dmg stats for units, no point, terrible lame writen ""whateveritis"" before ""missions"", not a single idea, strategy means nothing. Dont buy please. This is garbage. I own 600+ games, and goes to my Worst 10 list on Steam. Achievements are easy to obtain so if you like to have as much 100% as possible, this may be product (not game, game has to be funny at at least some points) for you. 2/10			",672,214,21,98,50,9,119

												This is a tower defense game with a side view to all the action. You get energy during gameplay and with that energy you can use it to create and summon your soldiers. The objective of this game is to defeat the opposing tower with your soldiers. It can be challenging at times and you will have to build up gold to build a strong army to do what you want them to do which is destroy the enemies tower. You can upgrade your soldiers and skills with gold it will make you really strong to defeat the aliens that will be encountered. The graphics are alright but the greatest. Its fun to see the battle unfold before your eyes. Some games can take upwards of thirty minutes and some can take ten minutes to complete. This is a fun game for anyone who likes tower defense games but not really a competitive choice with the games in the same genre that are out today.			",3038,1134,139,314,429,33,476

												Alien Hallway is not really the typical Sigma Team ""shooter"" game. It's alot more like Swords and Soldiers or Aeon Command. I think I can say I pretty much enjoyed alot of my time I spent with the Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter series from Sigma and the same I can say for games like this such as Swords and Soldiers and Aeon Command as I mentioned above but Alien Hallway was abit disapointing. The first 2 planets were pretty easy and I was really enjoying the game but when I got to the 3rd planet things got ugly fast, I got stuck on a level and ended up replaying 4 times the previous one in order to get enough upgrades to beat the next level and then I got stuck again and I can't manage to progress any further. That said I think the game is actually pretty neat but I also feel that it is pretty ""grindy"" and that really put me off. If you feel like it or you're bored sometime I'd say to give it a shot and see how it goes for you, maybe I spend my gold on really bad upgrades.			",1393,387,26,190,117,15,203

												This review originally written on June 11, 2012 on GameFAQs""An interesting game concept, but overall a disappointment.""This is the most recent game by Sigma-Team, released in December 2010. Sigma-Team up to this point has almost exclusively been doing their Alien Shooter games. This game is nothing like those. How the game works is you build units and send them to the other side of a simple, long hallway. Your bots gather resources allowing you to build more units, but you don't actually control any of them as they all walk to the right fighting everything along the way. Your goal is to destroy the alien device spawning swarms of aliens thus beating the level.GRAPHICS: 5/10The graphics aren't all that great, but it's not like they really need to be. Part of the reason this gets such a low score is because the game gets extremely laggy when there are a bunch of units on the level. It could be my computer, but it lags even with everything turned off. Another problem is that the lowest resolution is 1024x768 and the higher the resolution the more graphics intensive a game is.A big issue is the unoriginality in nearly all of the units, both human and alien. The human soldiers mostly look alike despite there being several different types. The aliens, going from baby to giant adult, are your standard alien types. There isn't much variety with the environments either. There are only 3 planets with just 1 “hallway” type per planet.SOUND: 6/10There's not much here either. The guns make gun sounds, and that's about all you'll hear. There is music of course but it's nothing special, but not terrible either.GAMEPLAY: 7/10I have to give props to them for doing something that, as far as I'm aware, is fairly original and unique. It doesn't work out that well and it's very repetitive, but it was fun while it lasted. Although there are different enemy types, they're all still killed the same way. You only have to spam your units, especially the stronger ones, and eventually you'll win. There's very little, if any, strategy. Your units, when upgraded, can fire a grenade which is accomplished by clicking the icon above their head. You also get an airstrike you can use to weaken hordes of enemies. Useful until you decide to play extreme where it becomes not so useful.There are 3 planets and 7 levels per planet. In each level you fight different enemies and in varying amounts, but nothing more. Once you beat the game, that's it, nothing else. You can replay the missions to try to beat them as fast as possible and achieve 5 stars, but it doesn't accomplish anything except earn you more money. There is the extreme difficulty which does grant you more money upon beating levels.LEVELING PROCESS: 7/10What stops this game from being completely not worth your time is that it has a skill and upgrade shop. When you complete levels you get money to spend. You can also earn bonus money which I haven't figured out the mechanics of yet. You can upgrade the unit classes giving them more health and damage output, and upgrade your skills like how much extra money you earn at the end of a mission. This is useful in the beginning but once you get into the higher levels of upgrades the cost in money is so insanely high and the reward so small that it's not worth it. Cheating for money (after I beat the game of course) is about the only way to prepare yourself for the 3rd planet on insane, and even then good luck. The legit way is to grind for forever to earn money which got boring fast. The higher skills for units and such should have had some special bonuses to make earning them worthwhile and provide variance to the gameplay.LENGTH AND REPLAYABILITYBeating the game on normal took me about 3-4 hours and those were fun hours. And then it got boring. I wanted my units to be higher level but the price is high and the payoff so small. However after you beat the game there's no reason to continue playing. There's no survival mode or anything like that.FINAL SCORE: 6/10The game is fun for a few hours or so, and then you get bored. The game currently sells for $10 and I recommend you wait until a sale for it to go below 5. There's not enough substance here and the gameplay alone isn't good enough to keep replaying like it is for the Alien Shooter games. The main problem is the lack of direct player action. There are a lot of places they can improve the game in a sequel if they make one, and I kind of hope they do. They have a great concept, but the execution is poor. Luckily there's a demo (on Sigma-Team's website) so if you aren't sure about the basic gameplay, check it out.			",1460,506,45,194,106,13,226

												At this price (5€)? On it's own? No way. It's a tug-o-war-game, and a fairly simple one at that. It took me less than three hours to complete my first run-through at the medium difficulty, and even then it got tedious after a while. The devs expects you to play the levels again in order to level everything up, but frankly I can not see a reason to do so. I got it in a bundle along with a few really good games for next to nothing, and with that in mind it was worth it for the few hours it managed to kill. Get it in a bundle or at a deep discount, 1€ or less.			",562,140,17,78,55,6,124

												Good fun clicking!  A tower defense type game where you send your space marines down the hallway to kill the aliens and their space ship.  Persistent upgrades that you buy with gold you earn from each mission give it the extra it needs to be a lot of fun!  A good purchase when on sale.  Has 30 levels, each takes about 2-5 minutes, with decent replay value.			",733,177,23,71,37,7,90

												Only for fans! Additionally there is a bad performance problem with the graphics when there are too many units in battle. This is a known issue and not solved by the developers since the game has been released. The game bored me because you have to play many times the same levels to upgrade the expensive units only to be able to win the last level on extreme difficulty and to get the last achievement at once.Got it !! Yeehaaa ^^			",915,344,38,177,134,7,240

												It's not Sigma Team's best foray into gaming, but it's decent for a push defense game. The game isn't particularly challenging; most of the difficulty is dependent on how patient you are. Prepare for quite a bit of grinding if you want to make the basic units powerful enough to survive the last few levels. If you're all about push defense this game is for you, otherwise it'd be wise to pass.			",137,15,3,9,5,3,11

												Fun small game, easy but fun. Aim of the game:You go from left where you start to attack the aliens on the right side. Kinda point and click, units walk auto to the enemy and begin fighting. I know it sounds boring but I had a lot of fun playing it with all the upgrades to win and beat the aliens. Graphics are fine, controls easy.Recommend it?Yes. But buy cheap, I know I did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not the best graphics or sound, but if you want a decent pick-up-and-play, it will satisfy. Recommended that you get it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cool plants vs zombies type of game (But your units advance instead of being stationary), you'll have to destroy the enemy's base, while defending your own.			",655,243,18,142,43,3,108

												Good midless fun. Blow up aliens as quick as you can. Nothing memorable here, but nothing bad either. Not a bad way to kill time on a rainy day when you cant be arsed to get into a AAA game.			",600,140,17,112,60,8,131

												Not a bad game. Its a simplistic seesaw towerdefense/rts, kind of like swords and soldiers. Very easy, it is repetitive though with the grinding.			",1131,344,37,145,99,10,218

												Just buy units as soon as you have money. No skill required for this game. The only thing you can do is throw grenades from your units (which you should do as soon as they are up) and cast your ONE AND ONLY spell which is a simple aoe damage spell. Boring, boring, excruciatingly boring game, There are plenty of games like this one that you can play for free on sites like Kongregate or Armor games. Do your wallet a favor and give this game a wide berth			",156,50,3,27,13,1,30

												I was about to write a WALL OF TEXT for this SIGMA studios piece of repetitiveness but(t) fudge it.This game is brought to you by the same guys who made Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter. If you like mediocre uninspired top down boredom you can now enjoy the same boredom without having to mash mouse buttons. Just wait till cool down and press the button for a unit to spawn and move from left to right killing stupid green men and blowing up their teleporter.You could play this game without looking at the action going on just tap respawn after cool down and wait until game displays your performance rating. Like other people said: It is a dumb kids game with no replayability whatsoever. Luckily I got this with a cheap as fook bundle - nowhere near above 1$ territory. Wasted 3 hours of my live on this garbage.			",1099,192,47,78,81,8,157

												An amusing game, crippled by poor optimisation (at least on my computer) which makes the game appear more like a slideshow with gun sound-effects than a game when more than a handful of enemies are present. Still an amusing concept, pick it up cheap in an indie bundle or for less than $2.			",429,157,31,80,67,5,114
