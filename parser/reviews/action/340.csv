Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is some kind of show-case made by Valve to introduce their new High Dynamic Range method of applying light inside the Source Engine. Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).After playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years -  I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....Since this one comes for free in the Orange Box and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played Half-Life 2 at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-).Overall rating: 8/10			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

 My Review :Rate : 10/10Lost Coast is a small technology demo showing off the Source engine's HDR rendering capabilities and it is an additional map originally planned as a section of the chapter Highway 17 of Half-Life 2, but was dropped. Only download this if you like Half Life or Source Engine or waiting for Half Life 3.  This game (or demo) is included with the purchase of Half-Life 2. Game doesn't cost $39.99 USD, ""Half-Life Complete"" does!			",151,19,4,9,6,0,13

												One of the most inspiring, most enlightening games of it's time. After finishing this game for the first time, I had to go back and play it several more times. In fact, I replayed this over 70 times and I still wasn't able to fully soak the story of the lone fisherman and his quest to help the protagonist Grodan Friedman and his trusty companion, the crowbar. I spent many hours up at night just trying to fathom what exactly went through the mind of Friedman as he traversed through the barren landscape of Highway 17. Don't even get me started on how much the High Dynamic Range adds to the whole game. Seriously. I mean, you couldn't get anymore detail and lighting even if you went outside, took a rocket to the surface of the sun, and stood there even though you'd be burning up. Overall, I give this game 8.76 times the square root of pi out of ten. Plus, you get more Garry's Mod Props. Awesome, right?			",145,11,8,12,12,1,16

												Although it's a damn short game, only clocking in at around 30 minutes to 1 hour at the most, I was really interested to know how the process of developing a game was like. To do that, you need to turn commentary on. This commentary came straight from the developers from Valve, like Gary McTaggart, Robin Walker, and Chris Green. After playing and listen to what they had to say, I understood the process of making a game a little bit more. As far as graphics and level design go, I would give it an A.			",95,17,9,11,5,2,4

												This is not a game. This was orginially a demo for Half-Life 2 and the Source Engine. Now for some FAQ:""Is it good?"" Sorta""WTF! IT IS 39.99 FOR A DEMOZ!!!! VALVE SCAM!?"" Click the name and look at the page*.""Why don't they sell this speratly so I can see if I like Half-life 2?"" I really don't know.This game, because it is a demo, shows you all of the cool things that the engine can do in-game. I like this more because it seems to be filled with action (also not repetitive). It is a good time killer for only 15-30 mins. I give it a 7.5/10.* If you type in ""Lost Coast"" the price will be shown as 39.99. If you press on the tile-thing and look the the page for it, it will only be able to be sold with the bundle, that is why it is that much.			",139,16,0,7,7,1,11

												This really isn't much of a game, but more of a tech demo for the technical geeks. This little gem includes most elements found in its complete game, Half-Life 2. Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, this unused concept was scrapped, possibly due to time constraints or maybe based upon the fact that this game is a prototype all on its own.This demo details various visual and graphic capabilities that are found in that said complete game. All the while, this ''game'' just shows how immensely strong the Source engine is, considering it was pretty new for its time back in 2004, and how it would become the most essential game engine to date, what with various Valve and 3rd party games being built on top of this incredible engine. The most clear concept that is shown off is the high dynamic range lightning that is now most commonly used in nearly all of Valve's games. There isn't much of a story or a narrative in this demo, you're none other than Gordon Freeman, who is stranded on a lost coastal cliff, (The clue is in the title.) that you must climb up to destroy a Combine artillery launcher in a monastery, which is rebelling and attacking a nearby town. Though this is just one massive chunk of a technological demonstration, it has several story elements that didn't make the cut in the final game. As a result, this level received a good response from the community, as if the fans haven't been missing anything at all.While I would say, this game is very interesting if you love to dig down and unearth various unused game content and maybe discover a little of the history that had been closed.

Good, old memories...So one day, after school, I met with a friend at my home. We were both very young back then. I just got my first PC, but only played a few browser games on it. My friend however knew this one program which I thought would be illegal at first called ""Steam"". The dark design of it and the fear of the unknown made me feel like a hacker. The reason why he forced me to download it and create a new account was a special sale, where AMD graphic-card-users would get some games for free. These games were Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. Lost Coast was my first First-Person-Shooter. After we killed every enemy and annihilated the chopper, tried every path, spammed ""E"" at every door in hope that we could open it, we gave up. We played a whole 2 hours (!) without knowing that it is just a showcase of the beautiful Half-Life-engine. But it was great. And it felt great. The scenery was beautiful and we both knew that we would get killed if our parents would find out. Actually, I believe that the fact that we played it secretely made it even more exciting. To hide Steam and both of these brutal amok-games from my father, who checked my Computer from time to time to install security-updates, I created several sub-folders in folders, all with unique categories about ""Pokemon"" yes, I played Pokemon a lot back then :D. I will never forget the day I started PC-gaming, nor my first FPS-experience. This day will be in my memory for all time. And no, I did not run amok a single time. At least not in real-life :PEdit: I played the game on another account though.			",112,18,7,5,7,2,4

												Lost Coast is a short showcase of the new power of the Source Engine after its upgrade in FY 2006.

It only lasts a few minutes of gameplay, but it's worth playing right after you finished Half-Life 2.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

 The Story Some people might be asking “Atratzu, why are you reviewing this? It's not even a full game, it's a demo”. My answer is... I dunno It's a game in my library and I want to review every game I've played.There's not much to the story, you meet an old man (the fisherman) who takes you up a flight of stairs to unlock a gate to let you up to the chapel. Then you get ambushed by the Combine and need to demonstrate the amazing Half-Life 2 source engine to those jerks and kick their butts.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was used as a “Technology demonstration” showing the graphics, style, lightning, combat, and generally demonstrating the Source Engine in Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was developed by Valve the same time that Half-Life 2 was being developed, Lost Coast was released on steam in 2005. Gameplay 	Keep in mind that this game came out in 2005. Today and in the future a Technical demo like this might seem silly, but at the time it was dazzling 3D graphics to onlookers.The controls are the same as Half-Life 2... First person view, different types of weapons can be found and switched between using the scroll wheel or 1-2-3-4-5-etc, pew pew.Actually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the “Buy Half-Life Complete”.Conclusion	To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17). The Gameplay was identical to Half-Life 2 because it was basically a town in Half-Life. The Achievements were non-existent. The price is non-existent because it comes in a bundle with other games.“Should you get this game?” That question is irrelevant, “Should you buy and play the Half-Life Games?” Heck yes.All in All Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a really nice Game!10/10 From Me Sweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was supposed to be a level added into the original game, but for some reason never made it. Instead they pushed the Source engine to its graphical limits instead and using this level as a platform show casing the power of the Source engine. The level takes about 15 minutes to complete, but you will be treated with eye candy and if you're looking for more Half-Life 2 to play, then this level will be enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was used as a “Technology demonstration” showing the graphics, style, lightning, combat, and generally demonstrating the Source Engine in Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was developed by Valve the same time that Half-Life 2 was being developed, Lost Coast was released on steam in 2005.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Some people might be asking “Atratzu, why are you reviewing this? It's not even a full game, it's a demo”. My answer is... I dunno... It's a game in my library and I want to review every game I've played.There's not much to the story, you meet an old man (the fisherman) who takes you up a flight of stairs to unlock a gate to let you up to the chapel.

First person view, different types of weapons can be found and switched between using the scroll wheel or 1-2-3-4-5-etc, pew pew.Achievements: This game has the hardest achievements out of any video game I've ever played. They're broken down into one category: unforgivingly difficult. Beat the whole game in extreme-FUBAR-murder-death-mode. Play for 1,000 hours. Reach notorious hidden objectives, slay the hidden spider queen, and many more.Actually, there aren't any achievements in the game.Price: Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is priced at $39.99, for the stand alone game, it's crazy, isn't it? Imagine how much fun you could have with a game from 2005 for $39.99? I think that's a solid price, I think Valve could get away with charging an extra hundred dollars for the game and it would still be worth it.Actually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the “Buy Half-Life Complete”.Conclusion: To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17).

												Great little demo game, one map, to show off the power the Source Engine had in 2005, and on today's computers, it still looks amazing. One of the main things this game shows off is HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which mimics your eye's pupil in response to differing levels of light. Give it a try!			",75,17,4,1,10,3,5

												A very quick and short lost part of half-life 2 that filled with 14 commentary from the developers include gabe newell about how they design and develope game like half-life 2. You as Gorden that will do a little bit of combat some exploring and then one small easy puzzle to destory a big gun that's been shelling the nearby village. Shouldn't take more then 10 minutes to complete but it's quite fun to hear developer talking about everything. 10/10... Try it out hear what Valve staff have to say. I just wish they will make more games.			",2437,942,81,289,309,25,343

												This game had been sitting in my library for years, and I finally gave it a try today. Well, this isn't really a game. It's a tech demo. You see, you play through a small section that was cut from Half Life 2, and you can enable the commentary of people who work at Valve. It's pretty much a short museum tour with a guide. I mean, I really love museums myself, and I really enjoy learning stuff about game development, so I liked this. Sadly, it's quite short, it will probably take less than 20 minutes to complete. But damn, even for a 2005 game, the graphics are still quite decent, and they don't look horribly dated like some stuff from that era. Plus, Gaben talks to you.			",431,92,18,35,32,4,27

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a short map placed in the Half-Life universe. Even though it got cut from the final game, it still offers a good short story, like a small chapter of Gordon's journey.The graphics are stunning, making full use of the Source engine's HDR, and the map design is really good as well. The final moments give a true sense of the ""calm before the storm"".Highly recommendable, and, in fact, I'd suggest you, imaginary gamer reading this review, to play it every time you feel like replaying the HL franchise. In my personal canon, the events of this game actually take place between the events of Half-Life 2 and Episode One, while Gordon is supposedly beneath all that rubble.			",418,84,9,48,30,5,75

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a very short tech demo where the developpers of the source engine talk about their work. Originally, it was part of the Half-Life 2 campaign, but was cut in the end.+ Lord Gaben greets you+ There is some shooting+ Interesting cliff map+ Makes you think about what if this map wasn't cut- Cringy old man...I'm glad he was cut.- It's very short and can be played through in about 10-30min. Depends if you are interested into the audio messages of the developpers.- Tech demo onlyI'd recommend playing Lost Coast if you are interested into the source engine or if you want to see about this mysterious Lost Coast map that was cut from Half-Life 2. If your interests don't meet these conditions, don't touch Lost Coast.Replay value: NoneRating: NoneRecommendation: It depends			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a short and brief tech demonstration showcasing the new mechanics and posibilities of the Source Engine used in Half-Life 2 itself, as well as giving you a brief introduction of what the core game itself is like. The segment used here was originally planned to be a part of the original game but was ultimately cut and used as the demo for the game instead, it's short and sweet, a nice and effective demo.

This is a tech demo showing what Half-life 2 Episode 1 can do. Also Half-life 2 Lost Coast only has one map it is still quite good. My final rating is an 8/10. I think if you could go into the village and check it out and stuff it would be a lot better.			",80,7,0,3,4,0,2

												If you expect this to be a sidekick to Half-Life 2 like opposing force or blue shift were to Half-Life, you'll be disappointed. It is just one Level that was not featured in Half-Life 2 and instead was used as a demonstration of the new High Dynamic Range lightning feature of the Source-engine. This is done quite well with a nice commentary that explanes the different methods that were used. It's a good tec-demo and should be played with commentary.			",44,3,0,2,4,1,2

												This is obviously quite excellent, because it's a...well, I guess by modern Steam standards it would be called a Half-Life 2 ""DLC"", though ""playable technology showcase"" also seems to cover it quite well.     It's not a game in itself, it's a brief but enjoyable scenario/side-quest set in the Half-Life universe.  Made by Valve.  So obviously excellent, but I wouldn't exactly go buying a $40 pack for this and this alone if you already own all or most of the other stuff in it.  But if you got Lost Coast for free, as I believe I did, then there's truly nothing to complain about, is there?     On the other hand, if you're the ""independently wealthy"" type, $40 might be the equivalent of a piece of chewing gum in the back pocket of us lesser plebs, so you may as well just spend that much on a 30-minute ""game"" irrespective.  Or you could be more generous and give it to the derelict currently rifling through the trash can on your footpath, if you're that filthy stinkin' rich.     OH LORD HELP ME, WHY AM I EVEN BOTHERING TO WRITE THESE WORDS?  I think I may have an addiction to game reviewing, this is my second one tonight...Verdict: 9/10 (as long as you didn't pay anything for it).			",744,418,6,57,40,5,78

 Half-Life 2: Lost Coast As the Steam Store page mentions, LC is a tech demo that was originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter in HL2. It is a free download and is automatically added to your Steam Library when you purchase a copy of HL2.The demo is very short and you can probably rush through it in under 30 minutes. You have access to all of the weapons from the original game to fight your way up a cliff side and retake an ancient church which the Combine have garrisoned into an artillery platform.The main purpose of the demo was to showcase Valve’s new HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting and demonstrate how it integrates with the Source engine. Despite being released in 2005, the results still look relatively impressive today. Highlights include how light reflects on water and wet terrain, and how it refracts through glass. There is also an interesting section where HDR tries to imitate the iris of a human eye by using light blooms when the player is suddenly exposed to daylight after being in shadow.Additionally, LC introduces a commentary mode to the HL series. In this mode, audio nodes can be found which play a track recorded by various members of the development staff. These nodes provide some insightful commentary if you are at all interested in the development process, or if you simply want to get a little more replay value.There are some rough edges in the demo; I encountered some graphical flickering and occasions where the enemy AI would not respond as cleanly as in the original game. Despite this, LC is a beautifully presented and swift diversion that can easily be included in your play through of the HL2 series.			",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More than a game, this is a technical demo for the use of HDR in the Source engine. It was to be part of the campaign's original Half-Life 2 but the cut for this reason. It is still quite entertaining this map, with about 30 minutes, maintaining good quality (even no dialogue) and variety. Turn opens the way comments, where developers can discuss changes and game details. A fun, free cut-content map from Half-Life 2. Great voice acting work, fun gameplay. There's not a lot I can say about it.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.But... wow Half-Life 2: Lost Coast blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Half-Life 2: Lost Coast on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple ""Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"" moment... the weight of a dark choice is huge. It forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Half-Life 2: Lost Coast sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.It is a sin to call Half-Life 2: Lost Coast a game. Doing that would categorize Half-Life 2: Lost Coast into the bland and consequence-free ""kill-em-all"" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast a story-driven, emotional experience.

												the graphics in this game are the best I have ever seen. It is beautiful in every way and if its graphics were combined with a good story it would be extremely immersive. It made me feel like I was the character. The weapon draw time is perfect and it looks as if youre actually taking a gun out from its sling. The gun mechanics are perfected without a flaw, when you are either shooting or reloading, its movement and sound are as convincing as a real gun. And the lighting and reflection make it seem as if it were real life. I would not recommend spending the $40 as its more of a demomstration and explanation of HDR rather than a story. But if its on sale i would highly recommend purchasing it because it will be very enjoyable and will definetely spark a conversation.			",41,0,0,2,1,0,0

												While Lost Coast has become a sort of joke among fans, i personally enjoyed it for what it is, a Tech Demo.Lost Coast is simply a demo of VALVe's new technology, while also showcasing some interesting mechanics. The commentary is great throughout, providing interesting insight into the game developing process, as well as HDR.It'll only take you about 15-20 minutes to complete if you take the time to listen to commentary and admire the surroundings, and nothing is particularly difficult, but it does show some fun gameplay with combine soldiers on a cliffside.All in all, if you bought Half-Life complete and are wondering if you want to play this, go ahead and do it! This is a fun little tech demo with pretty graphics.			",325,99,3,30,33,3,19

												The game is a short add-on to Half Life 2, but I can tell you it is great. The game might have a slight graphical improvement (very slight, it is hard to notice but there is one) and maybe some fix ups with a little bit of other things, but the only thing that has gotten worse is the AI and the story. The story is very bland and kind of boring. You just have to stop a genarator. The AI is not like Half Life 2's AI, at least for me. There are errors with the AI at times in the game.Overall I give the game a: 7/10			",99,7,1,13,9,0,1

												Lost Coast is a deleted scene from Half-Life 2.  It doesn't add to the story, however.  It is a small area, a short map meant as a demo for some of the lighting effects of the Source engine.  Despite being very, very short, it's also very satisfying to play.  If you have played Half-Life 2 and are looking for 30-60 minutes to kill, it's certainly worth pulling out.			",173,41,6,32,22,4,50

Everyone love it so please install the game beacuse i know you have the game in you library its only 400 mb thats nothing :) I hope you enjoy my review , i  enjoyed the game even only for 0.2 hours  Pros:-Story-Fisherman-Boss Battle -All weapons- its half life duuhCons: -You need Half Life Complete to play it grab it now its only 9,24 euro - Too much ennemy and i would like to admire the little village			",81,4,3,10,6,0,12

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

PROS:+ Gabe's voice+ interesting view on game development+ view into the Half Life 2 engine mechanicsCONS:- not really a game- just a graphic demo with a bit of shootingComment:I am really not sure if I should recommend this or not. It's not particularly bad but in reality this is just a demo, one small map with some commentary from the developers. Some enemies can be found but not that many. So while the idea to show us how Valve does their games this is just a showcase for hardcore fans of Valve/Half Life. But since this comes in a bundle and is extra stuff packaged with other games I will give it the thumb pointing upwards...			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												This is a great little piece of Half-life that was used in the original Source engine demos. They cut it from the game but I think it was never a part of it, just a tech engine level. Reason being, it used HDR lighting and that is a feature of the Source engine that HL2 didn't use at all. People were upset by that but hey, here it is now. It's fun, beat it in 19 minutes but it came with my HL2 purchase here on Steam. It wasn't advertised with it but it was included. It's nice to see, the HDR, but it's not a must own.

PROS:+ Gabe's voice+ interesting view on game development+ view into the Half Life 2 engine mechanicsCONS:- not really a game- just a graphic demo with a bit of shootingComment:I am really not sure if I should recommend this or not. It's not particularly bad but in reality this is just a demo, one small map with some commentary from the developers. Some enemies can be found but not that many. So while the idea to show us how Valve does their games this is just a showcase for hardcore fans of Valve/Half Life. But since this comes in a bundle and is extra stuff packaged with other games I will give it the thumb pointing upwards...			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												What an awesome game! It has commentary from the developers as you play. The developers commentate about how they used HDR to really draw the player into the game. Its amazing to know how much detail and time got put into the game. The shooting was basic for a casual shooter. The developers at Valve wants you to give feedback to how this game looks and feel to the player. The game takes about 10 mins to beat the first time through. I beat it a couple times to really enjoy the games graphics and art style. This is a great game to have in your collection, it opens up your mid to new possibilities and if you want to know more of what it takes to get a game looking and playing the way it does then this is the game for you. It is a very interesting game and I highly recommend it.			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												Though this only took ~half an hour to complete, it was still pretty entertaining. At first I though it may have been a whole expansion that I missed from the series, but it's just a short preview/demo/commentary type thing. This is included with half-life complete so chances are there's no need to explain/convince you to get this or play it. It all boils down to if you have any interest in what the developers of the game have to say. Very little on the story side, but fun nontheless.			",250,44,7,16,21,1,22

												Hello Fellow Physicists,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a great level. I won't even call it a game because it's just supposed to be a small portion in Half-Life 2, but it was a cut level. It exhibits some of the greatest graphics of the time that it was released which were absolutely stunning. I strongly recommend trying the game because this is a game that matters. It's a game that exhibits some of the newest graphics of its time! I love seeing things that truly mattered back then, like the water or the atmosphere. I love the game, it's a great level, I would have rather actually seen it in the real game, though! Definitely worth the money to play an extra level of the incredible series!-Kyle James			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great little piece of Half-life that was used in the original Source engine demos. They cut it from the game but I think it was never a part of it, just a tech engine level. Reason being, it used HDR lighting and that is a feature of the Source engine that HL2 didn't use at all. People were upset by that but hey, here it is now. It's fun, beat it in 19 minutes but it came with my HL2 purchase here on Steam. It wasn't advertised with it but it was included. It's nice to see, the HDR, but it's not a must own.

It's just ONE map with ONE goal, but in that short period of time, it is one hell of a fight against the combine, and an introduction to new Source things (have you seen the details they put into this game?).

												The design of the game is just amazing. And if you think it could not get any better the story begins. Your able to steer your story with control. Feel the world the way your character would feel it. And find out how not only you but the world that surrounds you evolves, and use your influence to change the way the world works. The music of LOST COAST is astonishing and intense. The music was my refuge.  I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.			",121,4,6,5,9,0,5

Nevertheless This game totally was min-boggling it served to me as a demo merely because its super short and because it's only for testing purposes only since this game was mainly intended as a graphics test.

												For a free little extra that came with the full version of Half Life 2, this was actually pretty enjoyable. It had the same basic gameplay and strategy as the rest of the game, and it had a decent setup. I give it 8.5 false HL3 confirmations out of 10.Oh, and I am now part of the Steam minority who has actually PLAYED this demo. So I have that going for me, which is nice.			",41,4,0,6,3,0,3

												I guess Lost Coast is a cut episode (or something like that) that was suppose to be in Half-Life 2 but was removed. Not sure why but it was interesting. Sadly it was WAY too short, but i guess theres a reason to this. I can recommend it, but its not really necessary to get it unless you want to and at this point its only available through packages so if you got most of the valve games (especially the trilogy of Half Life 2) you would probably throw possibly around $30 down the drain just for this (depends which package you are buying from). The challenge is fairly good, so if you are that kind of person then go for it.			",284,30,0,7,2,0,3

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a quick thirty minute tops extra gamplay from everything you loved about Half-Life 2. It starts you out with a nice arsenal and throws you straight into combat. It is intense and awsome as you fight many armed soldiers on cliffsides while moving on into the city in street combat. Ammo is plentiful as your facing many skilled combatants and even a helicopter towards the end. Altogether a quick action packed experience full of excitment.			",17,0,0,0,3,0,0

												Lost coast is a nice little game that gets you peak to the little earlier versions of half-life 2 (HL2 is actualy my favourite game of all time, i wish you could connect an Xbox LIVE account with a steam account) But it has a few problems. Its a short one, but that i can undestand. But you can deffinetly see it was still WIP and just a tech demo.7.6/10			",144,19,1,23,6,3,15

												Half-Life: 2 Lost Coast is in all reality a short developer commentary mixed with a small side task. You help a fisherman by taking a monastery back from Combine control. Along the way are audio nodes that let you hear about how the environment around you is created. Overall it is a great way to get insight on how amazing the source engine is for its time.

												A free addition to owners of Half-Life 2: The Lost Coast is more of a hardware test and interactive commentary rather than a game (or a mod, for that matter).Not much I can say about it really. It's common knowledge that the Lost Coast is actually a level cut from the original iteration of HL2 set to take place between the ""Highway 17"" and ""Sandtraps"" levels. But if you have Half-Life 2, take a look at it. Play through both the actual level and the commentary and you'll be pleasantly surprised.Plus, hey! Free Gmod content, whats not to like?

The good part is when you buy Half-life 2 it comes with this game, So if you want to play a Half-life expanion and have beaten Half-life 2, Check out Episode 1 & 2, This expansion comes free when you buy Half-life 2.

												Its worth it beacuse it only comes in the Valve complete pack, but if this game was still availible to purchase by itself, I would not buy it beacuse its really short and doesnt really entertain unless your one of those people (like me) who like to see how the games are made. If you get Half life: complete, play this game, and make sure you turn on the developer commentary! Thats pretty much the entire point of the game, beacuse it focuses on how Valve diescovered new ways of developing the source engine after Half Life 2: Episode 2 was released. If this was available to buy by itself, I would assume that Valve only released this short, basic game to earn an extra few thousands of dollars or so, but also beacuse they wanted to show the players the new way they came up with making the graphics for the source engine, the character animations, and the lighting affects. If you are a developer, this is a good game to play if youre testing out your Source scripts or something. I think this is a pretty good game. I recomend the it. Don't wonder why I typed so much for a game that you can't even purchase without buying the entire pack, but I just feel like typing right now. Well, thats all. Goodbye. P.S, don't think im an idiot if you look at this game its its perfectly available to buy, when I wrote this, it wasnt available, and I don't know if it ever will be available to buy by itself again.

												The sheer level design and attention to atmospheric detail is what makes ANY Half-Life addition an absolute must.

You can only get it in the Half-Life or Valve complete pack and it's not even available as a standalone !!! This one is for free guys! What you pay for are all the other games in the pack!

												10/10 Really ! Do yourself a favor, if you own this game, PLAY IT !!! This is the best chapter of the original Half Life 2. It wasn't finished at game release, because it was so advanced that it took longer to perfect. Everything about this game is amazing. The sound effects, the voice acting, the characters, the visuals, water effects, gravity gun, the exploration, the many varied weapons and ammunition, the shootouts, the game play with keyboard and mouse. Don't rush through this game, do some exploring, throw objects around with the gravity gun, smash wooden objects; boxes,boats, find health, find armor repair, Towards the end you get unlimited bazooka ammo, to fire at enemies, helicopters, down towards the beach, at the rocks.  I found alot of replay value, because you can use different tactics, and learn how to make best use of your weapons. The Artificial Intelligence of the enemy is the best. PLAY IT, if you enjoyed Half Life 2, you will love Lost Coast it is a GEM !!! Play it with the commentary turned OFF.			",171,48,0,6,5,0,1

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is an incredible, high quality game, that will make you want to shed some tears. I highly recommend you playing this game, however if you do play this game, you will need a box of tissues, because once you hear the voice of our lord and saviour, lord GabeN you will cry.

												10/10 Really ! Do yourself a favor, if you own this game, PLAY IT !!! This is the best chapter of the original Half Life 2. It wasn't finished at game release, because it was so advanced that it took longer to perfect. Everything about this game is amazing. The sound effects, the voice acting, the characters, the visuals, water effects, gravity gun, the exploration, the many varied weapons and ammunition, the shootouts, the game play with keyboard and mouse. Don't rush through this game, do some exploring, throw objects around with the gravity gun, smash wooden objects; boxes,boats, find health, find armor repair, Towards the end you get unlimited bazooka ammo, to fire at enemies, helicopters, down towards the beach, at the rocks.  I found alot of replay value, because you can use different tactics, and learn how to make best use of your weapons. The Artificial Intelligence of the enemy is the best. PLAY IT, if you enjoyed Half Life 2, you will love Lost Coast it is a GEM !!! Play it with the commentary turned OFF.			",171,48,0,6,5,0,1

												Its worth it beacuse it only comes in the Valve complete pack, but if this game was still availible to purchase by itself, I would not buy it beacuse its really short and doesnt really entertain unless your one of those people (like me) who like to see how the games are made. If you get Half life: complete, play this game, and make sure you turn on the developer commentary! Thats pretty much the entire point of the game, beacuse it focuses on how Valve diescovered new ways of developing the source engine after Half Life 2: Episode 2 was released. If this was available to buy by itself, I would assume that Valve only released this short, basic game to earn an extra few thousands of dollars or so, but also beacuse they wanted to show the players the new way they came up with making the graphics for the source engine, the character animations, and the lighting affects. If you are a developer, this is a good game to play if youre testing out your Source scripts or something. I think this is a pretty good game. I recomend the it. Don't wonder why I typed so much for a game that you can't even purchase without buying the entire pack, but I just feel like typing right now. Well, thats all. Goodbye. P.S, don't think im an idiot if you look at this game its its perfectly available to buy, when I wrote this, it wasnt available, and I don't know if it ever will be available to buy by itself again.

												This review will be incredibly short as this is only one mission and it's incredibly short, so let's get straight into it.Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a cut section of the highway 17 chapter in the original Half Life 2 where you are taken to a city St.Olga where you are tasked to take down a combine artillery launcher who is shooting down headcrabs into the town.As stated before it's incredibly short. It took me 10 minutes to finish the entire chapter and it's still incredibly fun. The reason this was released was to showcase the incredible range rendering and the new feature which was implemented into future valve games, the commentary mode. Since you get this for free if you own Half Life 2 I see no reason not to check it out. It's still Half Life and it's still great. Final Rating:7/10 - Play It If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked the review post in the comments on what you disliked.

												This is a tech demo of sorts to show off new gaming technology (at the time). It's short. There's boats and a fisherman and then some stuff happens but it's all easily forgettable. Apparently there are no fish in whatever dystopian future the Half-Life universe is set in. They've been wiped out and replaced with eels. Sounds about right. Yeah.			",823,300,26,81,65,10,105

												First thing i wanna say: Remember in the original Half life 2, (you know the original not episodes 1 or 2) in the 1 part where the residence was bringing youre buggy, (along with you in it) while hanging from a magnetic crane, this ""lost coast chapter"", was originally supposed to happen in a blackout or something in the middle of that chapter. Thats why its only about 20 minutes long, because its a lost chapter. Pretty good gameplay, with some guns along the progress of the chapter. I also just wanna thank Valve for putting this lost chapter on steam. :)8.5/10			",143,8,1,6,9,0,14

												^ That is really how long the game is. It is just a demographic of Valve's new Source Engine HDR Technology they use. It is really just to show you that, and how the light affects your vision like it would in real life. Pretty cool considering it still looks good today! Might aswell play this it's pretty interesting to me, or if you just like hearing Gaben's voice for 25 minutes :D. No Rating: it's just a demo people :)			",20,1,0,0,1,0,0

												This one is difficult. It is a technology demo for High Dynamic Range Rendering in the Source engine, set in the level supposed to take place after Highway 17 in Half Life 2. Even though the Source engine is falling behind compared to other engines nowadays, this game still looks great, and the added graphical effects make all areas express more detail. Aside from the technical stuff, everything else is the same as Half Life 2 in terms of how it works. I wont spoil anything.Now, because it is only a technology demo, it is only about half an hour long, and there isn't much to do afterwards. Oh well. Not sure why it has such a high price individually, though is harmless on collections like the Orange Box. If you want to get it, get the Orange Box, as it comes with the other Half Life 2 games. Overall, it is effectively a small part of Half Life 2 with better visuals. I'm not going to give a rating, ill let my words speak for themselves.			",18,1,0,0,1,0,0

												This demo makes me wonder how much better Half Life 2 would have been had everything in the beta made it into the released game.  The trip up the coast is easily the best part of the game with all it's atmosphere of beautiful vistas, abandoned buildings and sniping opportunities with the newly acquired crossbow.  This is a great demo to come back to just to run the stress test video for some eye candy and to check out your latest video card/drivers.  Fisherman's face is great to zoom in on to see the highest detailed character in the game.			",31,1,0,5,0,0,1

Then again, who doesn't already own a copy of Half-Life 2? And no that's not a zinger a copy of this 30 dollar game comes with a copy of Half-Life 2 for free meaning the price tag has accidentally been kept the same for years. The more you know. Did you know Lost Coast is the least played game on Steam with 99% of those that own this game never playing this game let alone istalling it? ...I can't believe anybody has even seen my review for this.

												A very short game - I think I did it in several minutes(the remaining recorded time was probably me idling or and running the stress test it had).... Apparently was a tech demo to show case HDR or whatever graphics, but decied to later add it in to be part of the HL2 storyline....

												As of this moment, I have not yet beaten Half-Life 2. However, it came with this little gem that I like to call Lost Coast.The main game itself is great, but for an absolutly free DLC, this game is pretty sweet. The level is pretty well designed, and even though it's really short, only took me 19 minutes, it was still really fun. Plus the little boss battle at the end is real satisfying, knowing how many times I died to that helicopter in the canal in the main game.9/10			",87,9,0,0,3,0,0

												Hmm. Given you can't get this on it's own, I'm not even sure what the point of a review is. But here goes:Created to show off the Source Engine's recently added HDR lighting features, Lost Coast is a chapter that originally would have taken place during the coastal section of Half Life 2.

												While it's a pretty short game (lasting usually between 10 and 30 minutes) it's pretty good. Of course, I'm not saying you should buy it alone, but definitely buy the Orange Box pack and play this after beating Half-Life 2 and both episodes (you'll need something to cheer you up) I highly recommend keeping the harpoon by the way. You'll see what I mean.			",16,5,0,4,3,0,2

												lost coast only came out bundled with half life 2 ... or at least i hoped it did. the point is it was ""GONNA""  be wait for it HALF LIFE 3!!!! but became a 15 min long dlc. it is fun for a sort time and then it becomes a on trail fps. it gets pretty anoying when you had to kill some dudes in the pump building thing while you wait for a guy next to you to break open a door. the thing ends with going back from where you came from making it POINT LESS.                                                                                                   PLAY BACKthis is worth nothing it comes with half life 2 and it has one charter from the game that can only be downloaded thought this dlc. why do i say downloaded well if you have GARRYS MOD then it might be worth a dam... well you will need half life 2 so ya. you can play it agin with some comments around you .... how ever, most of the time a guy or pack of dudes will come and destory the comment they'er gun fire noise will overlay the comments and make that point less its worth like 10 bucks and it is with half life 2 so i say ........ GET THE @#@!#@@ THING ALREADY.			",129,8,1,15,9,2,0

												Lost Coast is a small technology demo showing off the Source engine's HDR rendering capabilities and it is an additional map originally planned as a section of the chapter Highway 17 of Half-Life 2, but was dropped.

												Sooo, Lost Coast is a not really a game, its more of a tech review demo for Half-Life 2.There is really no plot, you just climb a hill, killing some Combine soldiers and solving an easy puzzle. Over the level you find developer commentary speech bubbles and that's basically the most important part of the game, the devs talk about the development of HL2.The main goal of Lost Coast is to show High-Dynamic range rendering or something of the sort, I guess they were really proud of that so yeah.Well, since this game can only be purchased in a pack, I cannot recommend paying 28 euros for a tech demo. If you are buying any of the packs, the full games will be your interest, not this, unless you is mental.			",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												Lost coast is a cut level from half-life 2 and it will take you about 15-20 mins depending on your skill in half-life games. It takes place during the highway 17 chapter and only has one Friendly NPC called the fisherman voiced by the same guy who voiced bill from Left 4 dead and Father Gigori from the ravenholm chapter of half-life 2. Overall I would rate this a 7/10			",126,20,2,13,12,3,8

												This is a good game, I guess. It has some Half Life 2 aspects but this game is mainly to teach you about the Source engine and how Valve makes games in the Source Engine like Half Life 2. I got this for free when I received when I bought Half Life 2 along with Episodes One and Two. For a game that used to be $40.00 it wasn't worth it for only 22 minutes, at the most, of gameplay. I guess it was a good game for teaching about the Source Engine.			",22,2,0,3,3,2,0

												Lost Coast.What a fun, short experience.Or was it?!!?!??!Did you ever notice the Illuminati watching you the whole time?No?That is because you weren't looking for it.See, to find it follow these instructions perfectly.1)As soon as you have control of the Freeman, Turn around and take 47 steps forward.2)Walk left until you run into something.3)Next, find the box that when broke open, drops only ammo.4)If you get ammo, then turn around and listen to the nodes in this order,...3,7,1,2,6,4,6,5,6...5)After that is complete, simply carry on with the level.6)That is, until the helicopter fight.7)During the fight, after hitting 2 of the 3 shots you need to hit, jump off the cliff and hit the final rocket. Aim for the water.8)If you die even though you hit the water, you succeeded.9)Now beat the boss, go to the area under the fight and use the elevator to get down.10)Now, before the man finishes talking, kill yourself above him, any way works.11)By doing this, you skrew up the dialogue, as you are not supposed to be able to die.12){FINAL STEP} This will accidentally trigger 4 seconds of dialogue that features 2 men talking about their masters and moreI don't want to spoil the rest, so...Go have fun, it took me 27 tries			",38,2,1,1,1,0,1

												I'm not even sure if you can really buy this or not but, while it provides you with a shortlived (but enjoyable) experience, it's a *very* short mission you're given to play. If the case is that you are able to buy this, don't. It was intended on being a showcase for Source engine's capabilities, not its playability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good, but not worth 39 dollars. I only got this because I bought HL2 when all of the games in the series were on sale, and since Half-life: Complete costs 9.99 at that time, it gave me Lost Coast. Let me tell you why the game isn't worth it:Only 1 chapter, with one map. That's less then Half-life 2. The only objective is to take out a gunship, and it's easy as ♥♥♥♥, and barely any Combine soldiers try to stop you. The map is short and only takes a few minutes to beat, while actual chapters in Half-life 2 take about a half hour, or sometimes a full hour. (Unless your playing the beginning chapters.)Valve, you could've done so much better. Though i'm not saying it's bad. Just not worth the money. Valve, lower the price, and I'll recommend this game.

												Well... lets see... Hmm... let's think really hard. What are the good things about Half Life 2: Lost Coast? Well... I don't have any idea. It's as simple as that. Nothing.                                          --------Ask yourself this. Would you buy a game where you get stuck on a stupid little part about 11 minutes into the game where a bridge always breaks after a combine breaks it? No. Exactly. That is why it comes free with Half Life 2. There's no point in those people on forums that say ""Bwagghhh I bought HL2 So i could get lost coast troloolo lawlz"", it doesn't make any sense. Wait, woah woah, you've never heard of those people? Exactly, there is no people like that. Please, do not waste your time on lost coast. Play HL2 and have fun.			",166,27,0,18,19,3,19

Why is he helping this random stranger that could be a combine spy, he's an old guy, in plane site, where the combine could shoot him down... And last, if Freeman really got knocked out and tossed to the end of the coast, how dose he still have his suit!?I mean I know he had his suit the rest of the games but COME ON! He's lost at sea, he woke up on a pile of rocks with a bunch of broken boats, and he still has his suit... His suit would have pealed off and shorted out but the time he got there...

												First of all, I love every single half-life game that was ever made, except this one. The only reason why I'm giving this a bad review is because it costs $40 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for a simple tech demo! You can beat this in about 15 minutes but all this is that valve is just simply showing off some new tech they got their hands on, that is it. There is no story, and from what I have heard this is one of the most un-touched games in steam. You can get it if you like, but you also get it for free if you buy half-life 2 episode one (Or one of the half-life games). So do not get this unless you want to just sit there listening to the programers jabber on and on about how minor things wil improve the game by a lot.			",16,0,0,2,1,1,2

												Eh, it's alright. I expected at least a little bit more. Perhaps a quest through the town, or exploring around a bit, but there's really not much here. It's like looking at the deleted scenes of a movie: you get some good things at the sacrifice of a plot. There's litterally not much to do in this game. In fact, it's much like a demo version of Half-Life 2. Easy to beat, gives you a taste of action and not too much to think about. Most of all, it leaves you wondering where the rest of the plot went, which then would influence people to buy the game. Hence why I think it should be a free demo. Overall, 8 out of 10 as a demo, 2 out of 10 as a game.			",27,14,0,6,7,0,2

												It's a very short tech demo showing off some of the features of Source Engine. Worth getting along with something else, if you can, but not worth purchasing for itself. As it can only be had via Packs (at least at the time of writing), weigh the pack purchase based off of the other games you're currently lacking - if there's some that warrant picking up the whole pack?

												The horror of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 begins and ends with a hallway. Down its dark length lurks walking robot animals out to kill me, and I’m only armed with a goofy bear mask and a flashlight. If I light up the hallway, I’m treated to snapshots of terror: toothy jaws hanging open at weird angles, outstretched arms of patchy fur and gut-like cables, and eyes with a pinhole-sized glow staring right back at me. The hallway is a funnel of fear.I peered down that hallway a lot during my roughly six hours playing Freddy’s 2, sole developer Scott Cawthon’s followup to his first spooky suit stalker simulator released in early August. Cawthon didn't wait long to leverage word-of-mouth popularity and YouTube celebrities’ horrified faces with a sequel that further establishes his skills at crafting a truly frightening experience.What I wanted from a Five Nights sequel was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits to find me and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs. What I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety, a wonderfully cruel cocktail of supernatural mystery and jolts of panicked adrenaline. Enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty.Once again, I’ve made the questionable career move of taking the overnight security shift at a children’s pizzeria for a measly pay rate. Strange Things occur among the tiled corridors and empty dining rooms at night, and staying alive entails warding off walking murderous animatronic animals by tracking their movements through grainy camera feeds.I’m still rooted in place with no degree of movement beyond swiveling my head left or right; a slight disappointment to my hopes of freely wandering around. The first game used that restriction as an added layer of stress, and that’s effective enough the second time around, but the novelty feels a little worn now.

												Hi, this is Gabe Newell, and welcome to the Lost Coast. In this tour, we're going talking about a new graphics technology we've been developing, called High Dynamic, Ranged Lighting, to HDR. We'll also be giving you some insight into the design and production challenges during the construction of the Lost Coast. First, a quick explanation of the commentary system. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press the +USE key. To stop the commentary, put your crosshair over the commentary node and press your +USE key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game for the purpose of showing something to you. In these cases, simply pressing your +USE key will stop the commentary. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Downvoted only due to the following:The practice of paying for mods is antithetical to the nature of the modding community; an optional ""DONATION"" button is not (Just like on the Nexus http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/? ). Was a fun game, The fact that Valve is doing this and that Bethesda is endorsing it and they both taking the largest share of the modders' work is American Corporate greed at it's finest.Take something artistic and done for the love of the subject matter, monetize it, then allow the accountants to define art as widgets, and then creativity is now run by the mercantile class, the middle men, who are ""America Corporates"".If they had any integrity and decency, any moneys brought in, at the very least, should be 100% donated to charities on behalf off the modding community in conjunction with Valve or Bethesda or whomever. See Gaben, you don't need the cash grab, you can win by getting good press which in the long run would do better for you to show you are not like EA et al.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a tech demo to show of Source's HDR lighting and it uses a level that was removed from the Half-Life 2 campaign.As you travel through this level you encounter various objects and sceneries that come with a little narrated explanation from Gabe Newell and his goons.It's a tech demo, and not a very good one at that. If you want to test your system, go get 3DMark. If you want to learn about the making of Half-Life 2, go google it. And if you want to hear Gabe Newell's voice I am sure there are places that can help you with that too, also you might need to see a medical professional about that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is rediciously priced, costing $40 for just a game about Gordon Freeman washed up on the coast, while a fisherman says the Combine took over the island, and Gordon goes on a mission to go and defeat them. The storyline is cliche, the enemies are way too overused (a little too much blue Combine soldiers). But the graphics pay off a little of these problems, but overall the game is really crappy, and I don't recommend to buy it. Unless if you're willing to mod it or in for the graphics.Also, it takes 10 minutes to complete. 10 MINUTES!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm so sad that I had to put this in the negative comments. I bought Half-Life 2 and it came with Half-Life 2 Lost Coast so I thought that this game would be good... it was so short and I had no idea what was happening. I believe that it takes place after Half-Life 2 but it just made no sense to make this game. Again I'm really sad that I had to post a negative comment on this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Secondly this was first $20.00 it is now 39.99 WHY? this is not even a game and it also sucks at showing you how they made half life 2. Hint this game is the same price has the half life complete pack and it also comes with half life 2 stay foar away from half life lost coast  I blame GABEN!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great little game. The graphics are comparable to games being made today and it is enough of a challenge (on hard mode) to keep you occupied for a while. Unfortunately, due to the length of the game, it is really not worth paying the £2.99 to get it. Buy it in a package, for example Half life complete, if you really want it. Overall i'd give it 7/10 for playability butonly 2/10 value for money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know it is 30 minutes or less long and has no plot on the actual half life story line so in one point you dont lose anything buy not playing this game. Now there are some issues with the game itself, sometimes you get huge frame rate falls but if you hit the good settigs you would actually enjoy it ; Know its more like a fast expensive 30 minute programming or game development course that is very helpful in the terms of sequence and user psychology+ gabehn gives you his email to contact him :D    PS: It actually does give the feel that will be given to the half life 3 (OMG) yes its true (SPOILER ALERT)= in the cliff area one of the developers add ""The rough terrain of a cliff could give some excitement but we didnt use that in the half life 2 series"" This means it will be put up to HL3 in a long long time ahead I think.

 Detail Back in 2005, HDR was unheard of. Valve was one of the early adopters to use this technique of rendering. While most engines required the graphics card to be able to render scenes using Shader Model 3.0, Valve implemented HDR via Shader Model 2.0. To make these kinds of improvements to a 2004 engine and make it look this good was simply outstanding.This is just a tech demo to showcase just that: Valve's implementation of HDR in the Source Engine. It is not a full game and should not be seen or played as a game. It includes commentary by some of the senior software engineers at Valve, including one of the co-founders and owner, Gabe Newell.A side note: I was able get to get to the other side of the island with some effort, but this was obviously not meant to be possible as you can walk and see through some of the objects.Take your time to explore and admire the tech.

The gameplay shows off some impresseve new graphics' but the gameplay is kinda short, Which i was disappionted the most about. But the upside of this game is the graphics, which i was impressed the most about. it shows what computers can do to video games now a,days. Our technololgy has increased during the years. and we can create video games in the comfort of our own home. So think of this game of a trailer of what valve is capable doing now a days. it brings excitment to what half life 2 episode 3 is going to look like. And would call this game more of a demo then a exciting adventure. Its still a game. and its not horrible, in fact its kinda epic and i would give it a (4 out of 5). I like it. Its not bad.

												This is a very interesting showcase of HDR in Half Life 2, and I hope that Valve includes little addons like this for their games in the future. This outtake level of Half Life 2 has commentary from Valve develpers that explain how certain things work to make the game very realistic. From explaining when they change up the gameplay to showing how some texture mapping works, I enjoyed this half-hour(no pun intended)of playing Half LIfe 2: Lost Coast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a more full-filling half-life 2 story, get it with the HL2 sale or bundle. The add-on was pretty good for the most part, but the mission was is only like 15-30 min. I finnished the game in 9 to 12 min. because i thought there was more to it or that you can walk around and explore the island. But all you really do is blow up the combine missile ""lancher"" , it sounds fun, but more like a tech demo then anything, even though it gives you more textures and better looking game, get it on a sale.

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a short game that felt amazing. The addition of new lighting and reflection effects made the game feel new and modern. Due to the shortness of the game and the lack of that fear I felt when seeing a Combine Chopper, I cannot fully reccomend this game. Fortunatley, this did come with Half-Life 2, so it was a fun 10 minutes of my time. 7/10 - Would Reccomend			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a one mission episode of about 30 minutes where game developers give you comments in-game about the scenarios of Half-Life 2. The game itself cannot be purchased alone and is included in Half-Life 2 bundles. If you like behind the scenes clips, you will found interesting to hear how the game was developed and how they included HDR and some other aspects in the final game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												when i dont recommend this ""game"", i mean not to play it. it comes with half life 2. anyway, this incredibly short free DLC for Half Life 2 takes place on a mysterious island, a ""Lost Coast"". from what i can tell Gordon was unconciouss in the actual, much better full game. then, some fisherman comes up and says ""Hi youre a doctor i bet youre here to kill the combine."", then you go up a mountain, shooting Combine on the way, until you get to a small village, then you go into a church, where you destroy a big gun (which was the point of the whole thing) with the gravity gun, then you kill some headcrabs, then some more combine, then you go out another way to kill more combine, then you fight a helicopter, then you go down a swingy lift (arguably the funnest bit in this DLC), then he says ""Well done we'll have a feast to celebrate, i hope you like Leeches"", then he says♥♥♥♥♥♥about you being fuzzy around the edges, it fades into black and he says ""Bye"", and so do i to this DLC, because that was literally the whole thing described. one paragraph. now you know what happens and you dont need to play this. you're welcome.

												*DISCLAIMER!* This game is not 39 bucks like many think, its free when you get HL2 lets just get that out of the way.Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a deleted level from Half Life 2, if you wanted to be more specific its somewhere during the ""car level."" For you completionists never fear! for this game is somewhat non-cannon as its main Purpose is to be a TECH DEMO! so don't worry about where it exactly fits in.Thats right, this is a Free demo when you purchase Half Life 2 ( I got mine in the Half Life Bundle.) Lost Coast shows off the slightly upgraded Source Engine that almost all Valve Titles run on, mainly the lighting (Not going to bore you with the details as that would ""spoil the commentary."")This is also the first appearance of Valve's developer commentary that is now a regular staple in their games. Unless you are really into the development part of Half Life you might not be interested in that side that Lost Coast has to offer.*GAMEPLAY* Like I said this is a deleted level from HL2 so don't expect a full game on this one. You meet a fisherman, take on a few baddies, blow up a gunship and look at the nice graphics. No achievements, no gnome, no real challenge. But hey its worth it to give it a go one time and then forget about it in your steam library. *OVERALL*This is a tech demo not a game, its more or less a show and tell for Valve's hard work on the Source Engine's improved lighting. I would have loved to see this in the full game but alas no such luck, perhaps in HL3? it takes no time at all to play and has our favorite Crowbar loving scientist. Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine to play HL2: Lost Coast!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm seeing this for forty dollars. Is it actually worth that? I recieved it as a gift, and thought it nice, but it's not really a game worth forty dollars at all. it's a 40 minute to one-hour game that's mostly about director commentary. It's not commentary on the half life game though, it's one short level aside from the HL2 storyline, without any kind of story. It's neat, definitely, but i wouldn't spend more than $5 on it.

 Detail Back in 2005, HDR was unheard of. Valve was one of the early adopters to use this technique of rendering. While most engines required the graphics card to be able to render scenes using Shader Model 3.0, Valve implemented HDR via Shader Model 2.0. To make these kinds of improvements to a 2004 engine and make it look this good was simply outstanding.This is just a tech demo to showcase just that: Valve's implementation of HDR in the Source Engine. It is not a full game and should not be seen or played as a game. It includes commentary by some of the senior software engineers at Valve, including one of the co-founders and owner, Gabe Newell.A side note: I was able get to get to the other side of the island with some effort, but this was obviously not meant to be possible as you can walk and see through some of the objects.Take your time to explore and admire the tech.

												   Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a very short but enjoyable game. It was originally intended to be released with Half-Life 2 but was then later cut. It takes roughly twenty minutes to complete but is worth playing for sure.   Of coarse, we once again step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman as he hikes up the steep cliffs of the Lost Coast. On his way, he'll encounter several different combine soldiers. As he pushes on, you'll find Gordon inside of a monastery in which he needs to destroy a combine weapon. Short afterwards, he'll step out into the world only to get rained down upon by an combine helicopter. Upon completing his mission, Gordon makes his way back down the mountain to once again talk to the old man.   You'll have to play the game yourself to find out who this mysterious man and to see what he has in store for you...    All in all, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it to other players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Originally a level that was designed for the original Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is merely a tech demo showcasing Valve Corporation's source engine and what it can do.  It literally only lasts for a third of an hour, but it was fun seeing where the droppods that spout the head crabs orignially came from.  If you're on the fence of wanting Half-Life 2, this short demo will help you decide, but it's not going to show everything from the getgo (it is a demo after all).  Getting The Orange Box will automaticaly make Lost Coast avaiable free of charge, and it is definitely worth its free price.  (And really, why pay extra for a tech demo anyway?)  Ultimately, I felt that this short demo was not really worth my time, but at least for Half-Life fans, you'll have something else to add to your collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a very short but enjoyable game. It was originally intended to be released with Half-Life 2 but was then later cut. It takes roughly twenty minutes to complete but is worth playing for sure.   Of coarse, we once again step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman as he hikes up the steep cliffs of the Lost Coast. On his way, he'll encounter several different combine soldiers. As he pushes on, you'll find Gordon inside of a monastery in which he needs to destroy a combine weapon. Short afterwards, he'll step out into the world only to get rained down upon by an combine helicopter. Upon completing his mission, Gordon makes his way back down the mountain to once again talk to the old man.   You'll have to play the game yourself to find out who this mysterious man and to see what he has in store for you...    All in all, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it to other players.			",36,0,1,9,2,0,1

												I found it, you guys. It's on my hard drive. You want it back? You can have a copy, but I'm keeping the original here. You know how in movies when the bad guys download a file they always delete the original? That makes no sense. Some dude is going to show up to work the next morning and people are going to have been sending him problem tickets related to a missing, vital file all night. The guy is going to realize very quickly that someone has deleted his file. Then he'll just restore a backup and tell his manager that someone stole the file. A few hours of bureaucracy later the police, FBI, CIA, RCMP, Interpol and Anonymous will be on the case, destroy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that dumbass hacker. He should have just left the ♥♥♥♥ing original file where it was. This is why the movie industry needs IT professionals like me to tell them that they are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Because they are. Some shows are better about science, though, like Star Trek The Next Generation and Star Gate. Tau'ri represent!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first thing you'll have to say about Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, is not about the game itself, but rather about your computer. You will be dumbfounded to find your PC has been able to completely install the game in less than 2 minutes. The answer to your question will be shortly inturrupted when you find out the game was a tech demo and it lasts anywhere from 20-40 minutes, depending on how bad you are at aiming.Since its release almost a decade ago, rave reviews have been pouring in. The general consesus has been""I paid for what?""Thanks to its groundbreaking technlogy showing off just what a 20-year-old engine is capable of, users have been delighted and surprised as they formed together outside of valve's offices. To demand their money back. However, Gabe Newell saw good in these peasants and created Steam Sales for everyone. Upon hearing about this miracle of modern gaming, a statue of Gabe was erected out of macaroni and cheese to be a shining temple to the god-like superiority of valve software. Unforuntely, those waiting outside valve's offices for HL3 grew hungry and tired and eventually devoured the macaroni statue. Darkness fell over the land, with nothing but TF2 updates slowly creeping over the desolate horizon.------Overall I would say this game was far too short and had a severe lack of memes. 6/10--- ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont recomend this at all (only if you play on the computer for like 10 - 15 minutes per a day) well if you do play for it for 10 - 15 well play this game it will be fun but after a long time of playing it will get boring and also this is'nt like $40 only if you had pre ordered the orginal half life 2 and costed like 40 to 30 $$$ (if you that person i will give it a 6/10).And now the bit what im at i play on the computer for liek 5 houres and one day i get hl2 and i played this game and it was fun i used to speedrun the game but know its just boring nothing new you can get %100 in 1 houre and your finshed (but this one more thing speedruning like i said) but know to day i will give it 1/10 its rubish dont buy it unless you play pc for 10 to 15 minuted			",50,2,0,0,4,0,0

												I recommend this small episode completely!! You'll finish it in half an hour but it is amazing. There is this particular part of the game where you get embushed by the combine, you'll recall those amazing fights in ""Follow Freeman"" episode one more brilliant time. Definetely recommended! Enjoy :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A well done demonstration of older source HDR capabilities and some insider advice on the overall creative process behind the half life series.  Although pretty short, its still worth playing if your somewhat curious.Hopefully valve will continue to produce these smaller snippets with other games they release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this as a part of the orange box, which I bought for ten american dollars. Thats a good deal, but forty dollars on steam is ridiculous, even for me being a half life fan since 1999. This isnt even long enough to be considered a level. Dont get me wrong, its cool, and the difficulty is high, giving any hl player a challenge. But to buy this alone would be crazy.

												For those that love Half-Life, or Half-Life 2, or if you're just interested about the magic they do at Valve, this is a must have. For 20-30 minutes of gameplay, you can experience incredible graphic rendering as explained by many different developers, including Valve co-founder and Managing Director, Gabe Newell. Not only does this game, or rather, ""tech demo"" present you with exclusive commentary, but you can also choose to fully immerse yourself in a lost part of the world of Half-Life 2. It is very fun to play, and I have done so many times. On a side note.......GabeN pls make HL3 pls be a bro. Thank you all at Valve Software.			",23,1,0,0,1,0,0

												I rate the expansion/add-on to Half Life 2: Lost Coast 2/5.This is a very short (though free through Steam) little area that would have probably been nice to have somewhere in the original game (especially when considering how short Half Life 2 was). No major bugs, very linear, feels pretty true to the ambience of the main game but I wish Lost Coast was seamlessly integrated into the main game.			",172,24,2,6,7,0,17

												Lost Coast is a quick, fun side mission. Gordon Freeman wakes up on a shore to find that the place has been overrun by the Combine. Outfitted with little ammo and resources you scale a cliffside to the top.The game itself was short but it proved to be fun. Limited resources meant a much more challening run. A must play for those who cannot wait for HL3.			",181,13,10,18,8,1,12

If you dont include the dev commentary. But i recommend including the dev commentary so you will learn about the source engine more =)			",52,5,0,5,5,2,1

It is good at getting pumped up. But buying a 15min tutorial voiced by Gaben for ""39.99"" as the the first package is also ""39.99."" I wonder if this is actuialy a good deel.			",77,2,0,10,5,0,3

												You must try to get this, you don't just buy it. This game is included with the Half-Life and Valve Complete packs. It is also obtained if you buy all of the official Half-Life 2 games. It's just kind of... there. It's interesting to see how the development of Source made current Source current Source. This is a tech demo. It varies from the lighting engine to how combat areas are handled. If you happen to stumble upon this ""game,"" I highly reccomend trying it out. Even if you're not interested in graphics and game development.			",90,5,0,3,3,0,4

Also if you're like me and you know very little about how graphics are created and their various effects, it's a nice little learning process.Nice addition to come free with HL2 and a great effort on Valve's part.

												It's a HL2 technology demo of new HDR thing that was introduced into Source Engine back then. You get to play some small level, that was originally scrapped from Half-Life 2. It comes free with all HL2 purchases.Nothing much to say about this that can't be said about HL2. Enviroment is superb and makes good use of contrast and thus gives a nice HDR impression. Some small fights. Blowing ragdolls of soldiers off cliff with rocket launcher. Boss fight. Stuff. Nice things.HDR is effect simulating your eye pupils getting used to current brightness of enviroment, for example, making bright spot appear very shiny if you was wandering in dark for a while.Oh. And it comes with developer commentary. For first time ever. Which is the best because it's the only commentary that doesn't talk all time about voice acting, since there is very little dialog to begin with.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												This was an essentially a test mod for High Dynamic Range lighting (HDR) which was new technology at the time of release. As a game it doesn’t offer much more than a set of scenarios to show off various situations in which HDR is used. very short and quite pointless. if you are a half-life completionist, you may be interested to learn about this level that is essentially a stripped down cut version of the Highway 17 level in HL2, however don’t pay a huge amount of money for it as it adds next to no replay value			",236,39,13,32,14,1,24

												Nice short level to showcase their new use of high-dynamic-range rendering. Sad it was only 12 mins worth of gameplay. Not grading this as there was not much to go by. Did have some trouble with some rendering at the start of the level on the dock talking to the old man. Would get flashes of black on some of the farther particles, all went away after the level started.Could of been longer.			",196,58,2,23,14,2,19

												This game was a test of the power of the Source engine- a test it passes with its beautiful high dynamic range. The game itself was a segment cut from the ""Highway Seventeen"" chapter of Half-Life 2. It plays like a Half-Life game and doesn't disappoint in that aspect. In fact, I wish this weren't removed from the full game, as it would have made a great addition. However, as a standalone game, aside from Half-Life's tried and true gameplay, it's a graphics testing mat with a thirty dollar pricetag. I cannot recommend this game for that reason.
