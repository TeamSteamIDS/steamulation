YouTube™ Video: Guardians Of The Middle Earth Review 

			Views: 2,619		

			Doing a Review of this old MOBA game called Guardians of the middle earth aka GOME. One of the probably biggest cashgrabs in the history, well what can you say when Warner is the publisher in the...		

Warner is Back, this time they don´t want your money (Yeah right..)In short the game is bit of a cashgrab, there is nobody playing the game and the overall gameplay is subpar compared to other competition. Only good thing i can say is that u can play with mouse + keyboard or controller, but no point buying the game since developers abandoned it. Balance and everything is absolutely horrible about this game, i feel sorry for everyone whose going to waste any penny on this game.			",425,179,5,53,33,3,42

I encountered heavy Lag issues when playing against other people, cant get heros without paying money (except a small starting pool) and even as a Lord of the Ring fan, i was dissapointed about the loveless implemetation of the chararcters.

												Do not buy this game.  It was terrible on the consoles, and it did not improve on the PC.  Since it started, I still cannot join a match with a full complement of other human players.  Most of my games are against bots only.  More to the point, DOTA 2 is superior in every way to this game, and that game is for free.  I see no reason to spend money on this travesty of a MOBA.

												In all honesty this game should have been great, and a long time ago when it was first released this game was actually great.  Released on the Consoles in 2012, this game was a well polished and much needed intorduction to the MOBA gameplay concept to console players.The developers were fast and transparent.  The community was alive and everyone was happy.  Somehow the development team slowly changed from being fast and transparent to being non existent and deceitful..  It started with the release of one character, Snaga, he spelled the downfall of this glorious game.  Somehow his release saw a magnitute of glitches and bugs which made the game unplayable, and until that point hadn't existed.  Speed bugs, and gold mode bugs and everything imbetween. The developers spent the next few months trying and failing to find a fix for the issues caused by Snaga's release.  They released the remaining DLC characters and then went into hibernation mode.This brings us to the PC release, a new Developer at the helm Zombie studios..  promises were made of fixing all the issues which plagued the Console release and and saw the once great community decimated.  Fast forward almost 2 years later and the PC game is a virtual graveyard.  The game priced at 19.99 is unappealing to new gamers, and the gamers who already own it just flat out have no reason to play it.  If you could write a book on missed potential GOME would be it.The gameplay itself is really nice, the characters counter each other fairly well, no one character is super OP, the controls and movements are smooth.  The learning curve isn't bad at all, and last but not least you can play as the well known Middle Earth characters..   With that said, I would avoid this game like the plague, if you already own it, idle those cards and remove it from your harddrive, if you don't own it, consider yourself lucky.

Unfortunately for this game with immense amounts of potential, the developers seem to have neglected any sort of updates or fixes for the PC client. Can't speak for the console version of the game, but it can't be much better.I would hold off several months and see if any changes are made later on, but until then, not worth playing.

												The MOBA/ARTS genre has exploded over the last few years. With Heroes of the Newerth, the original DotA, League of Legends and Dota 2. Now Monolith and Warner Brothers have decided to get in the fray, with Guardians of Middle-earth, a Lord of the Rings themed MOBA/ARTS game for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3(and now PC...) If you were ever afraid that a DotA style game would be dumbed down when brought to a console, I can say that your fears are unfounded. Guardians of Middle Earth is anything but dumb, in fact it's quite deep.In Guardians, you get the typical 3-lane 6-tower map setup from a top down perspective. Exactly what you’d expect in any MOBA. A mix of upgrades for towers and buff shrines in the jungle area, between the lanes, that your team can capture. Each shrine increases a teams health regen, allowing you to stay in lanes longer, which you need to do to gain XP. While there is a single lane map I’d advise against playing it. It devolves into rage quits quite often, which ruins the experience.There are no item or gold mechanics in the individual matches, nor is there any last hitting required. These meta game elements are Call of Duty style loadouts and unlocks from experience and gold gained for completing matches. The amount of individual loadouts are gated by your account level. The items used within are gated by gold. You buy gems, potions, and relics from the in-game shop using gold. This is a way of specializing your loadouts to meet certain needs across any character. This whole area of the game is way too large to go over extensively in a review. Suffice to say, the depth and variety in loadouts is immense.The in-match skill mechanics are more to do with team work and map awareness than twitch reflexes. Movement controls with the left thumbstick. Attacks control with the right thumbstick for directional aim. Your characters face around a 360 degree axis. Your facing will also change with your movement. Holding the right stick will override the left stick’s facing controls. Allowing you to strafe and backpedal. A ring is drawn around your character showing your attack range, area of attack(usually a cone), and directional facing. It works well most of the time, but there are situations where you can’t tell if you’re hitting your target or not.Using abilities can be frustrating. You get the same ring shaped hud element for each targeted skill. These skills assign to the face buttons. I don’t know about you but I don’t have the dexterity to hit the A-button and use the right stick at the same time. You will usually end up having to aim with your movement and be careful enough not to run too far while attacking. It’s not ideal but there is a certain level of acquired skill in doing it.One nifty feature borrowed from Monday Night Combat is upgrading towers. Towers are upgraded by all players so long as they are a certain in-match level. Each of the 4 upgrade types need different minimum levels in order to apply. The creep waves are altered in the same fashion by upgrading a barracks found behind each lane’s second tower. These barracks are immune to attack until the towers in front of them are destroyed. Upgrading the barracks allows the creep wave to concentrate on different styles of pushing. Heavy siege units break enemy towers or front line fighters hold the enemy from being able to push to your base. It’s a great strategic mechanic that more games in the genre could enjoy.The Guardians are ripped straight from the pages of Tolkien's classic. They range from the bastion of good himself, Gandalf the Grey. To the epitome of evil, Sauron. And a few other notable characters like Gollum and Legolas. Each Guardian fits a different archetype and role, that create what could be a diverse meta-game. Only time and community will decide how competitive the game becomes.As for the community and player interaction: there doesn’t seem to be a lot going on in that department, at least within the game. Most players don’t seem to wear their headsets, which is a blessing and a curse at the same time. My time spent with the game has been rage and troll free, but just about every match has had someone disconnect or leave. It’s unfortunate, and I’ve yet to win a game short handed or lose a game with a numbers advantage. Luckily, queue times were short and lasted only about 2-3 minutes.There isn’t much else to say. The character design is great and borrows from the films and the sound is pretty top notch too. The graphics are as good as you’ll find on current-gen systems, if not a bit muddied. The gameplay though is the core of the experience. If you’re looking for an easy way to get yourself into the genre, Guardians of Middle-earth is one of the best chances you have.Too bad it's completely dead on arrival for PC.

												Guardians of Middle-earth is a multiplayer online battle arena game from Warner Bros. Guardian of Middle-earth are based on The Lord of the Rings lore.Guardians of Middle-earth gameplay is almost similar to Dota 2, hell the map is basically the same. But there are different gameplay elements that separate this game from Dota 2, like upgradeable towers or some sort of barracks. Hero are based on The Lord of the Rings, you can play as Gandalf or maybe Elrond. Each hero has 4 abilities. Guardians of Middle-earth however, has poor control and is considered pay to win as most of the items grant bonuses to hero, and need to be purchased. Even some heroes needs to be purchased before you can pick them in the game.Graphics of Guardians of Middle-earth is quite decent. The textures, models and the effects are acceptable good. But the game performance seems not. It feels no smooth at all when you play the game.Guardians of Middle-earth got some potential, but it seems the developer doesn't see it, hell there's not even an update anymore. I'm a fan of The Lord of the Rings series, but this game is a dissappointment. I don't recommend this.Rating 3/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Slow gameplay, abandoned by community, akward controls, dull and monotonous skills. Not a great buy, which is the problem with this pile of burning rubber and steel that may have one day been a train wreck, you have to buy it. For £15 you are getting a freemium model similar to League of Legends, which is my isn't how games should work. You pay money upfront and then have to pay extra to be able to play more than 6 characters, out of which the only differences between them are voices and appearances, something else designed to drain your wallet.Avoid at all costs; recommended alternatives?Dota 2SmiteLeague of LegendsSMNKStrifeAnything except Dead Island Epidemic (A game which stole this game's business plan)			",111,12,3,22,12,1,30

												Don't buy this game even if you're a big fan of Middle-earth. Gameplay is very dumbed down so that It's possible to play on gamepad but it doesn't work well for a game of this kind. Meta-game is focused not only on levelling your account but also buying a one-time usage potions for gold (of course you can buy gold for real money) that are later used in matches to gain an OP advantage - it feels like a cheap cash-grab from an old F2P game...but you have to actually buy this game O_o Graphics are horrible and there is no option to modify them at all (only resolution and V-sync - again the console-friendly aspect of the game).Seriously, play LoL, Dota, Smite, etc. - anything else will give you a better experience.And if you're a fan of LOTR/Middle-earth, pick up a different game from the universe or just go watch the movies/read the books again, You'll gain a lot more enjoyment out of that.

												Got the game during the Warner Bros Bundle. At that time i wasn't into MOBAs so i gave it a pass.Now that i got fully acquainted with MOBAs, i decided to try it out. After all, this game was created by Monolith, the creators of No One Lives Forever, Blood and FEAR, and was the first MOBA (and the last) to hit consoles. Breakdown You have a selection of 36 heroes, in a 5v5 mode with either a solo or trilane map. One thing i would like to clear out that all the heroes are actually purchasable with ingame cash (5000 gold). The DLCs give you instant access to those heroes, along with unique skins and extra gold. To be honest, i could bear with it, since you can earn gold by just playing.When you first start the game, one thing you realize - there is no shop. Yes, last hitting doesn't matter. There are no items for you to buy. Instead they have this ""belt"" system. You create a belt out of 7 gems. The max level cap is 14, and every 2 levels one of your gems will activate. That's pretty much how you add stats to your heroes. Lifesteal, extra damage, crits, extra health etc ...That's the ugly part of the game. 5k for a hero i can understand. but the gems cost gold too, and their prices range from 200-5000. We are speaking about items that can make a hard carry out of you. That's unacceptable.Additionally, your belt has 4 slots for potions, which cost gold too.Finally, you have 4 slots for commands (which are all free). They are basically extra abilities, and you can choose 4 out of 16, but using 1 will put all of them on cooldown.There is no mana. Yes, abilities can pretty much be spammed, since the cooldown isn't very lengthy either.All heroes have a ""free teleport scroll"". Yes, they can teleport to the base. The ability has no cooldown. It cancels if you get attacked though, but still, there isn't even a cooldown.To be honest, going back to base isn't even required because each lane has healing item pick ups somewhere on the side (they look like tangos to be honest), and they heal pretty damn fast. What makes it different You can upgrade towers and barracks. When you reach lvl 6, 9 and 12, you get to choose from 4 different types of barracks that will spawn different units, and 4 different towers. The building can only have 1 upgrade, so if another upgrade is applied the first one is removed.Shrines - there are 4 points on the map, that when controlled give your team extra health regeneration and damage resistance.Defeating neutrals in the forest gives you buffs, some of which last 2 mins (kind of like runes in dota).Also, i noticed that the skin of the map changes. During my first match it looked like Osgiliath and during the second, it was Hobbiton. It practically wields no difference, but it's a nice thing to have.Other than the normal 5v5 mode, there is also a Survival mode aka Horde Mode, which is pretty good. It allows up to 5 players. Playerbase Even if you were to look down on all those problems - there is one major problem.To earn gold, you must play matches, but how would you do it if Steam db says that only 3 people are currently playing the game (one of them might have been me).You do get gold for bot matches, but it's so small (i got about 500 per match). Conclusion The game costs money, and it has heavy elements of pay 2 win.Overall, it's a poor use of the license. It's very softcore and lacks a lot of elements that make a MOBA.But hey, at least you can play it with a controller!!! No kidding, the game is pretty good with a controller. No as good as a mouse, but overall they managed it.			",498,99,13,68,57,7,114

												There wasn't many players almost one year ago, even with Guardians of Middle-earth as part of some Humble Bundle, by today this game is truly empty. I don't think that playing a game made for multiplayer purpose with bots are fun, so it's just waste of time and money. There are great MOBA games that are Free to Play, without any problems with playerbase. Sadly, for a ""Gandalf and company"" MOBA game, this price is too much. I'm not sure what devs were thinking, but I know that they wasted a great idea.			",1736,715,60,244,224,20,321

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",104,9,2,16,14,0,18

												Guardians of Middle-Earth is a more casual take on the MOBA genre and is thus a good starter game. I would recommend it to someone who just wants to take it easy or who wants to get introduced to the genre in a more relaxed fashion than League of Legends or Dota 2. The Tolkien license is the games biggest selling point, the vast library of characters from the movies, games and books are sure to appeal to fans of the Professor's works. The game overall suffers from being a port and does play better on a controller, since you can't change the key bindings at all.I would recommend the game if you can get it on a sale, though 10€ is a bit much considering you still have to buy skins with real money and Guardians have to be unlocked through gameplay or store purchases.I would not recommend the game if it is not on sale, it's better to go for one of the several F2P alternatives.

												In a world where dota and league of legends have firmly planted their flag in the moba genre, you would either have to be a revolutionary game designer or a complete idiot to try to compete with them.In this case, Guardians of Middle-earth and their respective no-name developer team falls flat on its face in the latter category. The only way I could rationalize the developer's strategy for releasing this game is that this game was designed for five year olds. Gold mechanic too hard? Ok we removed it. Dota's 25 level cap too hard? LoL's 18? Ok we made it 14. Mana management too difficult? We got rid of that too. In this dumbed down world, you max out your level in about ten minutes, but with no gold, you will never get an edge on your opponent. In an hour, you will be sitting there, everyone maxed at 14, praying something happens. In this joke of a world where some random hobbit can 1v1 the lord of Mordor himself, the biggest enemy to both teams is boredom. I highly suspect that there's a payment scheme of somewhat that I would balk at, but honestly, if you can't retain a player for ten minutes, then whatever crafty method you devised for generating is the least of your problems.The single redeeming factor of the game was the portraits of the characters in character selection. They were very artful, and I could only pray the graphic designers weren't tortured with seeing what mangled sprites their art was attached to.Do not buy this game, do not recommend this game, do not talk about this game. It was free, and I still feel cheated for the time I spent playing it. I hope that whoever thought of this game still has an in with the production team of lord of the rings, because he is not going to make it as a video game developer.			",89,10,1,12,8,0,14

												Do you have a lot of money lying in your pocket and you wanna waste them?! Then don't waste them on this game. The game is bad! The gameplay sucks, the matchmaking sucks. The game sucks so bad that you won't find a single player in the matchmaking. Takes forever to find a game and when it can't find any players it will automatically set bots to fight against. That's how rich the player base is for the game. The fact that they made the game buy to play then didn't make the game playable is really what makes me furious. I do agree that it was an unique take on making the game playable with a gamepad but the game isn't optimised at all to say that it was a good idea. If you're trying to compete agains the other MOBA then make your game better by actually look for what the other games have in them that makes players wanna play the game more.LOTR fans beware!

												Despite i had a good amount of fun playing this game, i have to not recommend this game; the playerbase is dead (means if you want to play it, you will exclusively play with bots), and if you happen to find at least another player, you will likely have a problem of connection.This game had lots of potential, it gave a new point of view to see the evolution of the MOBA's game phases, where the power of your character comes only from the little runes that you can use to customize your character, that was a pretty neat addition;As mentioned, the game version for PC was strangely abandoned by the developers, leaving terrible servers for the game's matches if at least 3 human players are present, providing costant and huge lag, until being disconnected for excessive ping, along with other gameplay's problems caused by these low quality servers, expecially, the sticky-attack of the melee heroes, that prevents the melee guardians doing some fast actions, like attack and fall back, and such harrassing stuff.Actually, this game is enjoynable only to play in a match with only a Human player in the whole match, it means you will play ""You + 4 Bots VS 5 Bots"", or at most with a friend of your same region, and only if you think that your computer is strong enough to handle great details, because in this game there aren't graphic settings at all, and the ones setted are high.

												The game had a rocky start and was not presented well to the public at launch. While it isn't as complex on builds as League or Dota it is a lot of fun. You can play against AI which most people won't want to do but I had a ton of fun just grabbing some friends and torching the bots. The gameplay is surprisingly good but navigating the menu system at first is a bit convoluted. There are two things that set this game apart from others in the genre for me.  Controller play - KB & M will be better in a lot of situations but the ability to play with a controller gives the game a level of fun casual enjoyment that not many of these game have. LOTR License - Learning an entirely new character or setting like in League or Dota can be fun but there is something really special about playing a games like this with characters you've known and loved all of your life. My biggest gripe with Guardians of Middle-earth is it's genre. I'm tired of playing competitive online games. Games like this, League, Dota and HOTS would be so much better if they had co-op story modes in the style of an action RPG like Diablo or Torchlight. Not to mention how important it is for games like this to maintain a strong player base or how easy it can be to lose that player base. In short if you are considering getting Guardians of Middle-earth be sure you get it to play solo against bots or get some friends and play together. Get it on sale and if you do that you might really love it.Don't go in expecting it to be the next big thing. The game is dead and will always be dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The biggest problem with this MOBA is that it doesn't have a clean feel to it, smooth movement, easily explained abilities, fluid auto attacks, and super OP/Nerfed to hell characters.  I'll go through each of these, but first, I'd like to state one of the cool things about this MOBA:The system for upgrading your minions/upgrading towers is A: Easy to understand, B: actually worth using, and C: works.Now, onto the problems:The game feels like it wasn't polished or cleaned, just thrown out to the public because of deadlines.  It would be like if you took LoL from Season 1, and compared it as an equal MOBA to Season 4 LoL.  Season 1 feels gritty and awkward compared to season 4, and it's becaused it's been cleaned and polished since then.  This game needs that cleaning and polishing badly.Movement in this game is unresponsive and delayed.  You'll be trying to dodge a skill shot, or just move in random ways to fool your opponent.  Well, unfortunately, even in offline mode, it takes about half a second for your character to respond.The abilities are convoluted and stated in weird ways that don't just say ""roots your enemy for 1.5 seconds"" or so on.  It takes up 3-4 sentences describing it, and not really telling you exactly what it does.They had an interesting idea for the auto attacks, having melee auto attacks cleave an area in front of them, while ranged attacks will hit the first enemy in front of them.  The problem is that auto attacks are delayed, like the movement.  So by the time you auto attack, your enemy has probably killed you.Some characters in this game are just extremely powerful and others just pointless to use.  Gandalf the Grey, his E ability deals massive amounts of True damage, and it scales.  It also roots the enemy till after the damage hits.  It's insane.  Whereas Gollum/Smeagol is supposed to be an assassin who leaps in, stuns and silences, getting resets on his ultimate, but he deals 0 damage with any of his abilities.  Those are just 2 examples.If the devs were to really focus on making this game work, I think it could be something great.  However, it seems they've given up, and nothing is getting fixed.

												This gam- actually, lets not call this a 'game', so games are not offended here, lets call it, hum, a thing. So, this 'thing' is a joke! Not the funny kinda of joke, but it does makes you laugh once you start playing (if you can defeat the crashes and actually find a match. See? this ga- thing, this thing is challenging afterall, isnt it?)Anyway, if you are looking for a beautiful, expensive, non-lethal way to punish yourself, i highly recommend this little gem!

												I decided to play this game so I could load off the 2 extra copies I had from my humble bundles during my stream. At first I was very lost, no in game store to buy items no last hitting... what the hell is going on? Despite the many problems that are mostly due to an incompetent development team that refuses to aknowledge their player base or their concearns, its a fairly fun game. I played 8 hours my first day and thats saying a lot. Unfortunatly I never got a full match to go through so every single match had bots in in. Eventually I found a few friends who also had the game from the humble bundle who decided to give it a try with me. It was enjoyable with friends to say the least. I eventually plugged in my controller and that was a better experience for me. I would not reccomend buying this game at $20 thats just crazy but I would suggest giving it a go if you got it in the humble bundle just dont expect league of legends. Its a nice streamlined MOBA that needs to be free to play if they want it to last. Anyways Thanks for reading!			",567,118,15,57,65,5,87

I mean it’s ok and it’s fun to use a bunch of Lord of the Rings characters but u have to pay to unlock some forms and use in game money to unlock them all. There are plenty of free games better MOBA’s out there no point in really buying this game. I got in the WB humble bundle so I don’ really mind it.

												Regretful purchase. Feels like a way for a game company to cash in on the 'MOBA' game hype. It's nice to see the developers trying to add some little changes to the general gameplay, such as being able to change the attacking type of your towers and your creep waves, however this is quickly let down by the fact that there are no items for purchase for your characters, only the potions you select at the start of the game and 'jewels' that add some minor stat bonuses to your chosen character, which often seem to make minimal difference.Abilities often fail to trigger and become highly unresponsive at the worst of times, and on a few occassions the game abruptly ends without any clear indication as to what 'win condition' your opponent apparently 'achieved'. The matchmaking also presents a similar issue, with failing to find players at times, it will throw you into a bot game or solo game without question.The game presents some mild redeeming value, with quite a lot of familiar faces from the Lord Of The Rings series which are quite well modeled, but you will quickly find that 90% of the characters in the game are for purchase only, therefor turning the game into a bit of a cash grab.

If you are lucky enough to find other players in this title it performs as a very basic Dota/LoL clone, with very little in the way of creative gameplay.   Ablities are a rehash of the same recycled cookie cutter recipe.The only reason that I have this title is from it being bundled with other products in a Humble Bundle Sale.

												Holy crap this game is broken right now. Definitely recommend holding off on this until (or if) it becomes playable. There is a half second delay on all commands, and even apart from that even with the game saying 80 ping it feels like you have 1000+. There is no customization in terms of graphics or control options aside from resolution. It took me an hour to finish my first game and that was a co-op vs bot match. It's not that the bots were hard, it was just almost impossible to do anything. Lethality against the heroes was really low but minions dropped like flies. The only way we could end the game was to keep backdooring and chipping away at the towers.			",383,86,9,48,27,4,54

												Horrible. Even for a die-hard Tolkien fan, this game is so broken avoid it. Also good luck finding any matches, I had to resort to bot play because it took to long to find anything. Even then it's uninteresting and dull. DOTA 2 or League of Legends is much better.			",26,7,0,23,23,0,18

												Avoid - Excessively long queue times just to play solo.  You will spend at least 3 to 5 minutes just to try the game by yourself.  If you are lucky enough to find other players in this title it performs as a very basic Dota/LoL clone, with very little in the way of creative gameplay.   Ablities are a rehash of the same recycled cookie cutter recipe.The only reason that I have this title is from it being bundled with other products in a Humble Bundle Sale.   This game is DLC heavy for playable units, but not as bad as Company of Heros 2, yet.			",464,73,11,66,60,4,67

												Could not dislike this game any more.  Only good thing is that it came out of the Humble Bundle, and I think I gave all of it to charity/tips.  OH I GOT SOME CARDS FROM IT! YAY!  however I dont think it makes up for the hard drive space taken up by this pile.my experience:Oh wow the menu is nice, I like the way they've done the runes and masteries.... oh potions are one use each?  The character models look nice, lots of LotR characters.Lets Queue up!  go vs bots first time, Estimated queue time, 1 minute 27 secons, good wont have to wait too long.. 5 minutes later 1 other person has ""been found"", it gives up looking, lets go to the game!  no purchasable items in game, no mana bars, horrific lag, silly objectives, all skills given at the very beginning of the game (except ult) and a stupidly low level cap (15).  with only 2 of us  there, the lag was still somehow unbearable.  despite my ally going 0-20, we still somehow managed to force a 40 minute stalemate, after that much time I simply dropped out of the game.Don't waste your time with this, even if you do have the 80thousand gold incentive.  It will get you a lot, but once you've gone into the game you'll realize the only thing you have is time wasted.sorry for the rambling, this game is just so awful.			",369,79,7,106,48,4,103

												Please, do not buy or play this game. :< Definite two huge thumbs-down.Slow combat, unbalanced champions, slow and unresponsive actions, the list goes on. Not to mention the extremely small player base so that you get stuck with ""hard"" bots both on your team and the others. Which, by the way, are also terrible (running around ignoring enemies | not playing the objective| or helping you at all). That 56 metascore doesn't lie. I mean sure, it looks pretty, but what does that do you if the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥ier than a sewage plant?Even if you got this in the recent HumbleBundle it's not worth your time to download and play, seriously.

												0/10, this game is broken, you cannot play online.  The bots consist of the same bots everytime that go in the same lane everytime, and have identical mechanics of playing super defensively and have healing passives on so that most hits you do they heal right back up, which makes it impossible to have fun before having high end passives.Also your team bots show no teamwork and force you to always go top, so you basically 1v2 and your side's bot on top will just play defensive as I said.

Dry.The level design is pretty interesting, but modes, matchmaking, and overall presentation just make this game look like what you would expect out of a cheap attempt to cash in on MOBA games.If you want good mobas, stick with League, DOTA2, etc., and don't bother with this one.

												Guardians of Middle Earth est un MOBA plutôt innovantLa possibilité d'incarner les héros de LOTR grâce à cette licence prestigieuse satisfera bon nombre de fans.Un gameplay qui innove un peu avec la possibilité d'upgrade les tours et casernes.Toutes les spells disponibles des le debut sauf l'ulti, ce qui enlève la phase de farming ennuyeuse et la remplace par des teamsfights en permanences. Ce n'est pas une pâle copie de gameplay de tous les autres MOBA à succès, les développeurs cherchent réellement à innover.L'optimisation se fait entre les parties et non plus pendant, et devient par conséquent beaucoup plus faible, laissant la place uniquement au talent des joueurs.14/20points faibles :- Quelque lags quand on est pas contre des bots ( en 5vs5 full joueurs)- Pas de gain de gold en partie , on grimpe de lvl mais on achète pas de stuff ... le nombre de kill impact donc peu si ce n'est sur l'xp- Le manque de joueur- Payant			",378,68,11,30,5,2,24

												I had this game on my wishlist for a long time. I'm a League of Legends player, tried Dota, Dota2, and some other MOBAs and this game was a big disapointment to me.Its quite beatiful in the graphics departments, the heroes are nice and if you like LoTR universe its quite compeling. But thats it, The game, unlike other MOBAs is not F2P, you have to pay 20$ (if not on sale) for it and then you find that it has lots of bugs. The unresponsiveness of the champs while you play makes the game unplayable for me.It takes a while to learn how the controls works because even when you click on a skill and point click the enemy, the ""hitbox"" on units its terrible and its difficult to cast anything.The heroes will lvl up, but you can't buy items to strenght up your champion, even in late game creeps are dificult to kill due to this ""no-progression"". To top it off its impossible to get a 5v5 people game. You always end up playing alone vs AI because there is no people (at least when I've played the game). I won't recomend the game, even if you love Lord of the Ring. Its unplayable and you have plenty of F2P MOBAs around where you will have more fun FOR FREE!			",202,53,15,45,21,3,34

												This is a very good, streamlined moba. Every ""item"" that you would buy in the middle of the game are all setup before the match begins, so that destroys the flexibility. But on the plus side, this might be the least ""snowbally"" moba out there. A character getting kills only means that they get more experience which will level them faster and make them tougher, but not an unstoppable force like in most mobas. The two main downsides to this game that cant possibly come down to personal preferance are that YOU HAVE TO PAY AND NO ONE PLAYS THIS. you can sit in queue for 5 minutes and still only end up with a game full of bots. I personally think that mechanically, its the most fun moba out there, but having to pay for a game that no one plays is bogus. So yes, i recommend it from a game stand point, but i know that not enough people will buy this, so i'd say dont waste ur money.			",145,27,1,6,4,0,6

												This is a test for the steam reviews. Might as well rage for a bit.Ok, as far as obvious cash-ins go, this is a pretty well polished one. At least in the basic presentation. The characters are about as balanced as a stool that's missing a leg, you need to unlock each of them with in-game currency (for a paid game), the mechanics have no depth at all, not having actual money inside matches, meaning you don't buy items in game. The visuals vary between gray and boring and the matches end before you get invested.There are a ton of free, better MOBAs around. The only thing Guardians of Middle-earth has in which it is better than all of them is the comunity, that is overall less toxic, because no one plays it.			",136,23,1,14,4,0,12

												Targeting mechanics make this game completely unplayable. There's no one to play with, not even for a co-op vs bots. Played only one game with Gollum, I have to say graphics are actually good, and voice acting is above average, but the sound effects were completely bugged: a lot of sounds didn't play, or they were too low I could barely hear them (and in MOBA, you need any sound or graphic cue to know what's happening).Don't waste your time please.

												I'm a huge fan of lotr but this game is just vile. The control system is just horrid, sometimes you can't even select an ability or your guardian. There is no concept of an items system which makes the game very dull and boring. The multiplayer is really bad, most of the time you can wait up to 10 minutes and then you get a game with only 2 actual players while the other 8 spots are filled with bots. There is no graphics option, no way to buy heroes with in game currency like in League Of Legends, essentially this game is a 'pay to win' MOBA, i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this nasty port.

I raised it as an issue in the community and was contacted by a game rep called Melanee who was helpful and genuinely concerned that the game didn't work. Unfortunately 3 months later the game still doesn't work and I'm no longer in contact with anyone from the development team. I'm hugely frustrated and I'm now going to be looking at getting a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far one of the worst Moba's I have played in my life , mainly because it was thought for consoles and the port is horrible. The graphics are decent and i love the setting (Middle Earth fan-boy here) , but as much as I wanted to play and ejoy this game I couldn't. The controls are awfull and the servers (at least for europe) suck , they lag a lot and I have died so many times to lag it's annoying. Another thing that I found annoying (this is mostly in the design part) is the fact that you can lose eye of your hero rather easely. The minions are pretty much the same size as you if not bigger (hobbits and dwarves i am looking at you)  and god forbit the enemy has the same hero as you do . In conclusion i would say stay clear of this game as it is not worth your money . If it was free I would give it a try but I wouldn't touch this otherwise.(I got it from a bundle)			",230,52,6,35,14,4,46

You can't do nothing to stop this FPS drop.3) Messy gameplay, aiming for an enemy is a real pain, especially in the fray.4) The game is unstable with random crashes ( i lost a game when i were destroying enemy nexus because ♥♥♥♥ me).5) Weird game mechanics : no gold when killing minions ?_?... 6) You have to pay the game and the champions (you have to farm ingame gold like others f2p moba like lol) :OIn few words this game is an awful console port.

												Do not spend any money on this. I spend countless hours playing Guardians of Middle Earth on playstation 3 and xbox 360. It was a great game plagued by some technical difficulties. PC was supposed to be the fix but it wasnt. This is a moba with no multiplayer, since no one can play it. The most crippling issue is the networking errors and disconnects. You can not rejoin a match either so if there is lag beyong a second the match it over. If they ever fixed this entirely it would have been a decent game, controls were smooth (better with a controller) gameplay balanced, graphics looked good. Now I believe the PS3 and xbox 360 communities are on their last legs but if you really wanted to give it a shot, buy it for one of those consoles and you get the pc version for free. After playing by yourself for a few hours on pc if you wanted to give multiplayer a shot, go to your console. When you get the gold mode bug youtube how to get past it. This isnt a serious review for me, but more of a warning. I take this review about as seriously as they took the port over to pc.			",200,55,1,83,23,2,39

												Guardians of Middle earth is a MOBA genre game and uses characters from JRR Tolkien LOTR and The Hobbit. Guardians of Middle earth should be played with a controller rather than a mouse and keyboard which cannot be said about any other MOBA games out there. There is no in-game item shop and the map is much smaller than in most MOBA games. Players who are  looking for a competitive MOBA will not find it here but if you are new to the genre then it is a great start. Without being able to change your items in the game because the buffs, loadout style, items are  done before the match starts it makes the game a lot easier for beginners. Guardians of Middle earth is more of a quick and fun experience that can be played in  35 minutes as there is a time limit on all games. With over 30 characters from the forces of evil and good there is a huge range of champions for you to chose from. This game is truly aimed at new players to the MOBA genre.

The options for graphics does not EXIST... it's crap. If you are on the fence or even thinking about buying this... DO NOT! League of Legends, Dota, HoN all do it 1000000% better.

												I'm wasting my time to write this review to save your time from playing this game.This game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥version of League of Legends. I got this game because it is included in the Humble Bundle. I ignored the rating and gave it a shot to see why it is not a famous game and I immediately regret my decision. I only played it for an amount of time to get the trading cards and get access to the booster pack.If you compare this to Prime World (a bad version of League of Legends). Prime world will look like a masterpiece. At least Prime World is free-to-play and has a decent game play (It has a lot of balance issues and that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Facebook-like base building game). But if you want to try/play a Dota-clone/ARTS/""MOBA""(what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ genre name) don't even play this game if you don't want to waste your time and money.This game takes away all the good things that make a Dota-clone/ARTS/""MOBA""(riot pls fix) and makes it a bland, license name-milking, and a boring game. It is a disgrace to the LotR name.P.S. Even if this goes F2P don't even play it. You're better off playing Dota 2 or League of Legends or the nearly dead Heroes of Newerth.			",377,142,17,92,66,9,77

												This game is neither for fans of MOBAS or LOTR. It doesn't allow any form of narrative to surface and the over complicated game mechanics make this game feel more like a chore than it does an actual fun experience. It really tries to stay a middle ground the entire time, really drowning out the charm thatother MOBA's have no problem providing. There is no real depth to this game unless you know what you are doing, and even then it feels like it an unfinished product.			",309,88,5,48,37,2,40

												Honestly, this game just isn't worth it.  I got it through a humble bundle, and this game *almost* devalued the humble bundle.  The controls are clunky, and the game is obviously a poorly done port.  There are better MOBA games (Dota2/LoL) out there, skip this.			",161,14,2,18,18,3,45

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME.Where do I ♥♥♥♥ing start....  This game is literally horrible. Why it was ever sold or even made for console? (That would explain its lack of particle effects, good textures, and boring♥♥♥♥♥terrain) Is beyond ♥♥♥♥ing me. If you are looking for something that is similar to LoL or DOTA don't buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I received this in a humble bundle and glad I didn’t spend my well earned money on this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Think you’re going to play with real people? NOPE you'll be waiting 10+ minutes for a sign of life in this game (maybe 3/10 people) and if you que for 5 coop vs bot and you end up waiting around 5 mins it will automatically put you in with all bots (or any players you have found which is likely 0). That makes no sense? If I wanted to play with bots on my team I would have played a ♥♥♥♥ing FULL bot game. Speaking of bots, it’s like having mental ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your team. You can try and go in a help but they will just pull out of attacking or any help what so ever and leave you there to die. They often wonder off out of lane to randomly single hit jungle minions or try to solo (I don't know equivalent of baron nasher in LoL) by themselves???? The bots seem worse than usual bots. Somehow my team has really dumb bots and the other bots know exactly what to do. Also there is no ping system. no way to communicate to the bots what to do (like DOTA signals). My bots are the downys and the other team gets MLG apparently???? Then you have the mechanics and i guess physics? I don't know if i would call them because even a 5 year old in preschool would realize how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t these controls are. You can spam your skills about 50 times to finally ""snare"" someone and end up just standing close to them not doing anything.... The skills require you to be so extremely close for some reason even though its a ranged skill. I played the nazgoul character with the ball mace and found it extremely frustrating casting anything at all. Walking through creep is borderline hair-tarring stupid. You basically eat♥♥♥♥♥♥off of everything in front of you. If you think about last hitting you’re not going to get that either because you can’t focus on a minion without spamming the left click pretending it matters. The creep give xp and that’s it so it is basically not even worth doing..... When you’re clicking the creep I would always see my character doing nothing, literally standing still in one place. The when I was looking around at the people in front of my lane I would see my character magically farming creep without em touching anything. The game feels like its always a second behind, almost like the UI and mouse movement is restricted. You are slow to strafe the camera any which way and it can be pretty ridiculous to see what’s going on in other lanes.Having no items and just skills makes the game drag on and on and on. If I am down 20 kills or more I think I just want the game to be over. It also doesn’t allow you to carry the team or basically get multiple kills. Last time I checked when you are fed with kills that’s kind of how you get multi kills is because you’re good. If you have characters that don’t suffer for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ then it makes no sense why you would even play the game if you’re good. Get kills = no rewards, get no kills = no punishment or lose. This to me is a huge stepping stone in a MOBA game. These 'belts' they have implemented kind of speaks to me that they did not want to put in a real mastery system. No extra skills, nothing. You apply stupid gems and then play. Seeing that you start out with like 20k of points even the bad people can be beefy. Champions will do the same amount of damage on every skill, each level no matter what. Unless you use one extra skill I would call it a 'buff' off some sort, but still that’s every 2 minutes or so.There is nothing special about this game, nor is it fun to play at all. If you have never played a MOBA game defiantly do not start here either.I think that if you want a MOBA please look somewhere else ei. LoL, DOTA, HON, Heroes of the Storm (when it comes out).  I don' think this was a harsh review at all. They want to play the MOBA game get it right. I'm being nice to the rest of you by warning you this game is a waste of steam game space. If I spent money on this I would be looking for a refund within the next 24 hours. I don't know whether to laugh at this joke of a game (I hope that’s what they went for because its ♥♥♥♥ing garbage) or to cry because they want real money for this. I think I will get the steam achievements and the badge and then uninstall as quickly as ♥♥♥♥ing possible because I don’t need this disease on my HDD.GG ",301,40,9,45,20,2,53

												DO NOT GET THIS! AS of Nov. 2013 this is a giant unpolished unoptimized piece of crap. I got it for free basically in a humble bundle with free DLC and couldn't even bring myself to finish the first match.... laggy as all get out (not just net code but that's a giant part) it's like they took a console game and said let's toss it into PC without even changing a thing. The options for graphics does not EXIST... it's crap. If you are on the fence or even thinking about buying this... DO NOT! League of Legends, Dota, HoN all do it 1000000% better. Which is sad considering they money they had behind this IP.			",254,41,3,34,36,5,78

												Poor controls, terrible networking, and an overall flawed design prevent what would have been an amaing entry in the MOBA genre from truly succeeding.The game is designed to be used with controllers and has very poor PC optimization for mouse and keyboard. Skill activation latency when using a mouse and keyboard gives a distinct disadvantage when instant skill/item use is necessary in sudden skirmishes. Bot games are hosted server side and are plagued with the same issues. Between champion design and the LOTR namesake this game could have been a success. However, there is no late game scaling and no items to buy. The game requires a very high degree of teamwork and any player(s) who can work with one another will dominate those used to a more free style of ""Champion"" building that comes from games like DOTA, League, or Infinite Crisis.I obtained my copy through a Humble Bundle so I will not remark on initial cost. However, the game certainly would have been a wash for me if I HAD paid the $15 MSRP. There is also a VERY high degree of pay-to-win with in-game activated consumables that boost damage, resistance, and other useful stats. These can be purchased with currency obtained from playing games, but if you have used all your currency then you better get to the shop to acquire more, lest you lose your matches because of a disadvantage in stats.Avoid this like the plague until they fix some of the issues. Players have been complaining for months about problems and Monolith just doesn't seem to be listening. Either that or they don't know how to fix it and can't outsource a solution to save their product.If they ever fix the issues plaguing the game then I can say that in my own opinion this game could be a great success; very far down the line, mind you.

												I'm wasting my time to write this review to save your time from playing this game.This game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥version of League of Legends. I got this game because it is included in the Humble Bundle. I ignored the rating and gave it a shot to see why it is not a famous game and I immediately regret my decision. I only played it for an amount of time to get the trading cards and get access to the booster pack.If you compare this to Prime World (a bad version of League of Legends). Prime world will look like a masterpiece. At least Prime World is free-to-play and has a decent game play (It has a lot of balance issues and that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Facebook-like base building game). But if you want to try/play a Dota-clone/ARTS/""MOBA""(what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ genre name) don't even play this game if you don't want to waste your time and money.This game takes away all the good things that make a Dota-clone/ARTS/""MOBA""(riot pls fix) and makes it a bland, license name-milking, and a boring game. It is a disgrace to the LotR name.P.S. Even if this goes F2P don't even play it. You're better off playing Dota 2 or League of Legends or the nearly dead Heroes of Newerth.			",377,142,17,92,66,9,77

It really tries to stay a middle ground the entire time, really drowning out the charm thatother MOBA's have no problem providing.

												Nope nope nope. As a MOBA fan I have to say EW. This game was obviously made for console and ported with very little effort to pc. I ended up playing with a controller because it felt more natural. The game doesn't have enough effort put into roles and balancing, and its a bit less strategic and more random. As far as a MOBA for console its about as good as it gets, but like RTS's they aren't imagined for consoles.			",95,12,1,16,8,0,20

												Another attempt to jump on the MOBA bandwagon that falls short.The developers seem to have spent more time trying to cram in as much liscenced content as they can, that they have lost sight of the actual gameplay. This could have been a contender to knock DOTA2 off it's MOBA throne, combining a much loved franchise with a popular genre, but the gameplay is stagnant and uninteresting. It's basically a cut down DOTA, with very little variation in gameplay or skill involved, and it seems to be, run in, spam actions as soon as cooldown is up, and hope for the best.I doubt I will be re-installing this.

It takes all of 3-5 seconds to switch lane. What is worse is the actual game itself terrible UI with little-to-no feedback, unresponsive or confusing interactivity, broken mechanics, horrible hit boxes for selection+targeting and unbalanced gameplay all of which lead to an experience that is just pure frustration.

The when I was looking around at the people in front of my lane I would see my character magically farming creep without em touching anything. The game feels like its always a second behind, almost like the UI and mouse movement is restricted. You are slow to strafe the camera any which way and it can be pretty ridiculous to see what’s going on in other lanes.Having no items and just skills makes the game drag on and on and on. If I am down 20 kills or more I think I just want the game to be over. It also doesn’t allow you to carry the team or basically get multiple kills. Last time I checked when you are fed with kills that’s kind of how you get multi kills is because you’re good. If you have characters that don’t suffer for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ then it makes no sense why you would even play the game if you’re good. Get kills = no rewards, get no kills = no punishment or lose. This to me is a huge stepping stone in a MOBA game. These 'belts' they have implemented kind of speaks to me that they did not want to put in a real mastery system. No extra skills, nothing. You apply stupid gems and then play. Seeing that you start out with like 20k of points even the bad people can be beefy. Champions will do the same amount of damage on every skill, each level no matter what. Unless you use one extra skill I would call it a 'buff' off some sort, but still that’s every 2 minutes or so.There is nothing special about this game, nor is it fun to play at all. If you have never played a MOBA game defiantly do not start here either.I think that if you want a MOBA please look somewhere else ei. LoL, DOTA, HON, Heroes of the Storm (when it comes out).  I don' think this was a harsh review at all. They want to play the MOBA game get it right. I'm being nice to the rest of you by warning you this game is a waste of steam game space. If I spent money on this I would be looking for a refund within the next 24 hours. I don't know whether to laugh at this joke of a game (I hope that’s what they went for because its ♥♥♥♥ing garbage) or to cry because they want real money for this. I think I will get the steam achievements and the badge and then uninstall as quickly as ♥♥♥♥ing possible because I don’t need this disease on my HDD.GG ",301,40,9,45,20,2,53

												First of all, let me get one thing straight: This is actually not a very good MOBA. I'd classify it as mediocre in that respect. If you are looking for a MOBA, go play LoL or DOTA2, they are both better alternatives.Why am I even recommending this, then?Because, while there are better MOBAs out there, this one is quite simply a game I find fun to play, especially with friends. No, the game's quality may not be up there with the giants of the genre, so don't expect that. This game is simpler and has a couple of unique twists. For me, the main selling point however, is the setting. I am a sucker for anything Tolkien and that may cloud my judgement. This may be a failure as a MOBA, but it is decent as a LotR game, and we get far too few of those these days.In short, if you are looking for a MOBA, this is not the game for you. If you are looking for a LotR-game fix, this one is okay.			",496,217,15,116,79,4,119

												First off, thank God this wasn't published or developed by EA.   One of my favorite companies back in the 90's, Monolith, developed the original console version.  Zombie Studios did this port which was very well done.  I first played the demo on the PS3 and now played full version on PC just recently.   It is a very solid and well-designed  but simplified MOBA - even if it was designed for the consoles first.  Unfortunately the community is not that big yet.   I think the fact that they are charging people to play it is inhibiting are larger community base.  But if you think about it,  League of Legends, HON and Demigod all started out at $30 - $40 at first but then became Free to Play (with monetization).  So they may end up making this a F2P eventually.   I think they are riding on the fact the licensed LOTR name will sell itself - and they got me. heheh.   My first impressions of it is like a mixure of Demigod and LOL. And that's why I actually enjoyed it. (You can upgrade your minions, towers, etc at the base like Demigod and you have preloadout items, relics, gems like LOL.  The only gripe I have about it is the pre-loadout screen for relics and gems is not intuitive.  You can store different layouts on several belts but after I do that I have no idea what they are because I can't name the belt and there is no ""popup"" to describe the items in that belt.  That is the only terrible part about the game so far...that part of the UI design. It's not up there with the hardcore MOBAs like DotA, LOL and HON but was still fun and challenging nonetheless. Since it was streamlined for the consoles, I've read that it is much easier to play with a joypad controller because it is ""cone-based"" aiming.  I played it with the mouse/keyboard and I didn't have to much trouble aiming.			",194,11,2,26,6,3,40

												Easily the best game of the genre. What's the worst part of the MOBA genre, the community of course. How can you enjoy the game with a bunch of twelve-year olds or Russians screaming at you? This game fixes that glaring flaw by not having a playerbase whatsoever. Furthermore you can play as all your favorite Lord of the Rings characters like, Frodo, Gollum, Ugluk, Snaga, Agandaur, and yes even Ori. All in all I give this game 19/20 rings of power.

												Regardless of being dead MOBA, that takes more than 10 minutes to load, this game has potential.In regards to a gameplay, this is something that changes conventional MOBA strategy, farm->win. In this game you can forget about items, gold, go out there onto the field and fight with what u have from the beginning: spells, spells, more spells. Idea is very nice, and it makes the game relaxing.In regards to community, there's one to create. As not very popular game, few play this game, and it is up to you to join the game and bring something special into it.			",67,7,1,18,13,2,12

												It seems as yet another cheesy MOBA game, however, it is very unique compared to other games which mostly copy the original DOTA allstars. The main difference in this game is of course the LOTR theme, and then some! There are no items in the game, you only rely on yourself. The lack of depth, due to the game having no in-game items, is recovered by using runes (which can be bought with game currency, which you get from playing the game itself). These runes can boast your stats and are set up before starting a match. This 'rune' system is very similar to that of League of Legends. Also, this game has FULL controller compatibility, which works amazingly well. If you have a controller, use it !I have pointed out the things that make this game different from other popular MOBA's out there, it is a fun game, but it lacks depth and is very easy to play. Worth a try.			",171,24,3,23,16,0,31

												Pre-purchased this game, unfortunately this game was dead even before it was released. It is a poor console port full of bugs, the dev support has been inexistant. The AI is poor and it is nigh impossible to find anyone for a multiplayer game; then good luck playing with the huge lag peaks if by chance you happen to find another player and get into the game (the rest of the teams will be filled with comp).The only good mode is players vs waves of ennemy in a cave, but here again no one is playing and you can't play with AI allies.Do not waste your time and money with this game.

												I got this game through Humble Bundle and was being sceptical, seing that it's one of these MOBA games as I don't like the whole genre. All these games are absolutely monotone and boring (I allready played LoL and Dota 2) but I tried to be optimistic. This optimism was allready shattered as I was looking at the main menu, being like a poor version of LoL with a ""Lord of the Rings""-Skin and as we just tried to play it, we figured out that it has got big problems with the gameplay (at least it looked like it). So I would say, just never buy it. It's not worth anything. 0/10			",664,200,22,97,62,6,103

												""Ohh...  You touch my tra-la-la...""Not a very good game to be perfectly honest, the controls are horrible and actually play better with a gamepad (which is terrifying considering this is supposed to be a MOBA) and considering the pricing system setup everything is pretty much pay to win.  Plus it already costs money in the first place, with the exceptions of Demigod and Herzog Zwei I cannot think of a single MOBA that should charge money up front.  There's a reason MOBAs are a sub-genre to RTS, because they're for people who don't have the skill to play RTS.  And if you don't have the skill, you won't want to put in the money.  And if no one wants to put in the money, how is this game going to sell?(By including it in cheap $5 bundles of course!)Something I will say on the positive sides, I am glad to see it takes advantage of upgrading ones base.  But with no real income I don't see why you wouldn't upgrade your base...  And hey you can play as the often forgotten Mouth of Sauran, one of my favorite characters of the series...  So that's...  good?(Numbers for people who don't like to read)Graphics: 8/10Sound: 6/10Gameplay: 3/10Value: 2/10Reccomendation: Do not buy, do not try, just pretend it never existed to begin with.

												I am glad i didnt buy this game but was given it.  This game is a battle game and Arena battle game.  You choose a character and select special commands and potions and things for the character.  And then go into battle trying to gain control of the map.  Controls are sub par.  As the UI shows what buttons to push....yet pushing those buttons results in nothing happening.  That was the problem i had.....I had no idea how to cotrol my character.  Interface was totaly counter intuitive.  In addition your character supposedly could be selected to have a high attack value and you can get items to make them stronger....i did this...and the result was the same thing when i chose a weak character.  In other words the actual balance in this game and information is wrong...my supposedly very strong archer was weak as a character with barely any strength.  It seams also your character will automaticaly use things whether you want them to or not at time.  In game I had to scroll the map weirdly i couldnot zoom out much....and combat was...well.....very slowish...and reminded me of a real time strategy game....but with horrible controls and a bad UI.  If you like good games....i would avoid this one.....if you like jrr tolkiens books the movies they came out and are a fan boy you might like this...since it uses the same characters....but if you want a fun game to play....ugh i would avoid it.

												With so many MOBA's out there setting standards and defining the genre, you'd think it would actually be harder to fail than to succeed.  Somehow, this game managed to fail.Gameplay: - The lack of an auto-attack and the less-than-fluid feel of control is disappointing. - The ability to upgrade and customize defensive towers was an interesting gameplay twist which I'd love to see implemented into other (better) MOBA's.DLC Flood: - I thought this may be similar to Hero Academy or other games where all of the fun of team or hero selection is limited by how much you spend to unlock.  Given the prevalence of free-to-play MOBA games, I was *shocked* to see that this game, at $19.99 or higher, had the gall to offer fairly expensive DLC packs for hero unlocks.  I ended up getting this game through one of the Humble Bundles, so I don't regret it.  However, I would not pay full price for this game or for any DLC packs. - To clarify, however, the heroes can be unlocked in-game through play, and the DLC packs seem focused on unlocking them earlier or on alternate character skins.Overall: - I was very disappointed with this use of the LoTR license.  I'm certain I've played better Starcraft or Warcraft custom, community-made maps.  I was hoping they'd do something fun and unique, even if not totally compelling, on par with the Battle for Middle Earth games.  Unfortunately this game feels like it was rushed out the door, monetized, but incomplete (perhaps to coincide with movie releases.)  Get your Legolas fix elsewhere.			",375,94,10,44,36,3,74

												The gameplay feels clunky and slow, with weird damage outputs and a lot of random mechanics. This seems to be because of a pay to win mechanic, in a paid game! However, this is if you can actually get in to a game. The queue times are always 5+ minutes and the servers are just awful. Players disconnect, (including me) throughout the game and - from the UK - I get insanely high ping and frequent lag spikes.Overall, this game isn't worth being paid to play it. Either wait 5 minutes for a laggy game, or play against useless bots in an awful game. Just as bad as the console version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To their credit, when Monolith was tasked with making a Lord of the Rings MOBA they didn’t just re-skin League of Legends and call it a day. Though in hindsight, perhaps that would have been the better choice. For the uninitiated, a MOBA (generally) involves two teams of five players trying to take an opposing base. Minions flow along “lanes”, used as meatshields against enemy defensive towers. You control a powerful hero with potent abilities that level up during the course of the match. There are a lot of elements that separates GOME from its genre-brothers. Instead of having an in-match store, you purchase all your items, abilities and potions between matches using currency earned during a match. Potions are consumable buffs that need to be restocked. Abilities are utility spells, you can take four into a match. Guardian Belts hold purchasable Relics and Gems (which act like the weapon/armour items from other MOBA games). As your Guardian gains levels during a match, the belt slots unlock from left to right, unlocking the stats of the gems/relics as you go. You can upgrade the Towers that defend your lanes, and the Barracks that spew out minions. Both have four levels of upgrades that drastically improve their defensive/offensive power, giving that lane a huge advantage of a non-upgraded lane. Guardian abilities all work off cooldown counters, there are no mana or resource systems of any kind.The 36 Guardians are grouped into distinct roles: Tacticians (tanky pushers), Enchanters (high-damage nukers), Defenders (tanky supports), Strikers (glass-cannon nukers) and Warriors (middle-of-the-road). There’s cooperative play against bots, the standard five vs five online play (which puts you in a hard botmatch if it can’t find opponents), survival (five players vs waves of creatures), and a practice mode where you’re forced to play a certain character. There’s only one map, with either three or one lanes, but the map has multiple skins that change the aesthetic trimmings, chosen at random when starting. You have to pay for the game upfront, but unless you shell out for the expensive edition you only have a handful of Guardians at your disposal. The rest you buy using in-game currency, but the amount you have to play to unlock even one is ridiculous. Online, the game uses a peer-to-peer system for multiplayer instead of a server-based system, so expect a lot of lag all the time. That’s if you can even find a match: steamcharts.com which tracks players on Steam games reports GOME has at most, 20-30 people online at any time. Range indicators on abilities are unreliable, controls can be unresponsive, and you can’t even adjust the graphics settings in-game.Proving that the power of a franchise name alone isn’t enough to save a bad game, Guardians of Middle-earth is a derelict wreck. Its online community is dead, and even if you’re okay with just playing offline against bots, the core game experience is a let down.			",227,35,9,25,26,1,33

												Unfortunately I feel this game falls a bit short when trying to keep up with other big MOBA's like DOTA and LOL. The games only real pull is that it's 'Lord of The Rings', not to say the game is the worst thing I have ever played but its not worth its price tag.			",151,22,2,16,10,2,29

												This game just kinda... sucks.A lot. It's like an RTS game but you only control one guy so why not have a better way of directly controlling the guy? Also there isn't any sort of single player campaign to play through, it's just online multiplayer or bot matches so this game is just a complete waste of the LotR licence. The combat is just so mind numbingly boring, all you do is point your guy in the direction of an enemy and spam the abilities until one of you dies. I've had more fun filling out forms at my doctor's office. I give it 2 hobbitses out of 5, at least the game looks nicer than most crappy games out there.			",155,11,3,16,6,2,5

I will never support this developer or publisher again, and I have ceased making pre-purchases of games, or buying into alphas.This game is unfinished, unsupported, and empty of players.

												I was able to get this for free for owning an Xbox copy, but it's still a good game. I'm not really sure what all the hate is towards this game. I enjoy it everytime I play, and now that I have a Steam copy that will be much more because the Xbox copy keeps bugging out on me. I wish it was more supported by the devs with new content and all that, but other than that, I feel this game is greatly over looked.			",248,92,20,63,40,7,57

												As someone who hates MOBA games, I shouldn't really say anything about this game that I got for free, but I will try to not let my hatred for MOBA cloud the review. In itself, the game play is pretty good, the story is non existent as in most MOBAs, but it does carry the LotR magic and essence within. So if you like MOBA games and are a fan of Tolkien's world, then by all means give it a try, if you are neither, just forget this game and move on with your merry life. I feel that since I got it for free, it was worth the price I did not pay for, but if I had bought it, I would totally not recommend it.			",65,5,1,10,1,0,9

												imo, it's legit to make a new moba if you bring something new to the genre.And Guardians of Middle-earth totally did this! Each character begin with all their abilities (except for the ultimate) and can upgrade them as they level up. And that's it. There is no other progression in the game. No gold to gain and no items to buy. (And I like this concept.) But, there is items that you can get from outside of the game. You are selecting your build before starting the game. You can't come back to the base and buy more potions, everybody have only 4 of them. There is obviously the question of peoples who pay becoming beeing more powerfull. Well, they can obviously unlock items faster but I can't tell how much faster while I couldn't find peoples to play and see how much I win for a game. I like this because you don't have to bother yourself about items to buy in-game. You just equip a set of upgrades to your character and jump in and level-up.There is also very interesting gameplay elements. Basics attacks are a cone in front of you, alloying you to hit multiple ennemies at the same time. There is a lot of secondary objectives on the map such as shrines to enhance your team and obviously a jungle. At level 6, 9 and 12, you can upgrade your tower and barracks.And it is very nice to see the character design of the LOTR characters, particullary the bad guys because we don't know much about them and they look very cool!BUT, the game is actually terrible to play. Aiming the basic attacks is awkward while they affect many ennemies but you can only focus one. Abilities are also kinda delayed and awkward to aim. It seems like you never know what ennemy you're hovering on. Also, this game is very slow on my computer. (It's a bit odd because LoL, Payday2 and Dark Souls work fine.) I can't say it's much of a bad thing because it's an old computer but, I can't change any graphic option except Resolution, Fullscreen, V-sync and one last I forgot. Anyway, there is no way to reduce the graphics quality to be able to play better.This is a shame. This game could have been Heroes of the Storm (well, the Blizard sticker is still missing) but they failled the game implementation very hard. Such a good game design gone to waste.

												I can see why this game died, the Gems and Relics are unfair and scream pay to win. Buying the DLC gets you gold which you can buy relics and gems to inprove cooldown, do more damage, lower the damage you recive, etc, etc. That is not all, in game it is easy to loose track of the mouse arrow and you do not know what your abilites are till you level up and read them etc. No in depth system like Dota 2 has for the in match shop and etc. Only have health, mana is missing, ults have a 10 sec or so cooldown. The list goes on and on. Btw I spent $5 on the $80 Miltril Edition so yeah they are just greedy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...			",368,64,11,70,89,2,92

												I got this game as part of a package deal, and it wasn't one I cared about getting, so reallly it was a bonus. I didn't expect it to be great, but it was far, far worse than I was expecting. I tried playing it PC style at first, but it really seemed like a game more for a controller, so I thought that would improve things. Nope. In fact, I got the prompts for the keyboard keys instead of the controller buttons (using an xbox360 controller) so... that was entirely not helpful. Then you have to use both sticks simultaniously to move and aim, so if you want to press a button while you're doing that, you're screwed - in other words you kind of need another set of fingers so you can do three things at once. Yeah, I was NOT pleased with it. If you get it for free, try it I guess, but it's complete fail, and don't pay for it.			",215,93,5,29,27,2,24

They should make it F2P and it would rise be really nice MOBA that brings something else to the genre is not oriented on gold farming but on exp. My opinion :As long as you see it cost anything dont buy. When it goes F2P and collects some new players insta play cause its worth it.Game 7,5/10Dev policy: 0.0000000000000000000000000000/10			",121,8,9,21,10,0,26

												Guardians of Middle-earth is a MOBA (Massive online battle arena)... You probably  heard of LOL,, HON or Dota have you? Well this game is pretty much the same... Of course the lanning phase isn't quite the same (set-up,last hit utility and items) nonetheless the mechanic is look-a-like. What is really awesome in that game is that you can take control of MothaFu****in Ganfalf or his friends and decimate everyone on ur way Cause You Shall Not Pass!!!Unfortunatly, GoMe community is dead (last time i checked) so you might not be able to find a game .. ever,,, or maybe with 1 pers so you will be doing 2v5 vs AI... That's pretty much worthless...So I wont recommend this for you guys cause its boring playing vs Computers and you will get tired of boosting your heroes for no purpose... (If you know people that all want to play this game together, go for it, but like i said earlier, last time i checked we were maybe 20 online)(Soz for my english)			",242,21,8,49,32,5,45

												Got this game in a humble bundle and decided to check it out; The LOTR feel is somewhat present, the music is nice and floating, the interface looks LOTRish but the gameplay is just weird. It feels plastic. I played DOTA 2 & LoL a little bit and I'm familiar with MOBA games, this one tried to achieve something, as it isn't quite a ""clone"" as some people here suggest, but the problem with this game is that it had failed in providing continuous and fluid gameplay throughout the match.It just feels like the matches are boring, especially towards the end when you just can't wait for battle to end but you have to make that one final slash on the enemies main building.I wouldn't recommend buying this game on Steam, but if you got it in a bundle or as a present from someone, I say give it a try. It's not a disaster, and it doesnt' deserve all the hate in the world (goat simulator got 90%+ score, I think this is at least worth SOME money while goat simulator should be banned but that's another story).

												This is a very similar game to Dota 2 and League of Legends in that they are moba's. The gameplay is very different though, alot of people claim the game is not smooth but I havent encountered any problems with how the game runs, but this might be because I use my xbox 360 controller instead of keyboard and mouse as this game has full controller support. Instead of the in game store that you buy items from in this game you have a belt wich automatically unlocks dfferent pieces of the belt as you rank up, the belts are made up of gems which give different bonuses such as attack speed, attack damage, and extra health, and thats barely scratching the surface and this encourages different playstyles in the game. No character in this game is exactly the same and although there are characters that are easier than others some characters require more skillful players to utilize their abilities and the characters are balanced. People complain that this game is pay to win, this is a lie as you earn in game coins at a fast rate by just playing the game and the one item you can only purchase with money does not even give you an advantage over other players. This game completely encourages teamwork and is very rewarding, but not many people are playing this game anymore so it will be hard to find teammates. The reviews from people have only spent 1 or so hours playing this game are very misleading, as any moba requires some time to get into. This is all in all a very good game and if you have a few friends that play it it is easy to form a team and do matchmaking and it is also easy to make friends in the game and this will make the game a much better experience. The only bad thing about this game is that it is not free to play and it doesnt have a large community.			",65,3,0,8,3,1,3

												This is clearly the worst MOBA game I have played and maybe one of the worst multiplayer games.This game is already junk on the PS3 but the PC version is not even optimized.If the menues('structure) did not already make you uninstall this game, the gameplay will.Being a fan of the LOTR Books and Films does not help when u want to play this game.The controls are not optimized for PC, the hero system is (in-game) money based and the overall gameplay has nothing to do with teamwork. The game time is capped at 20 minutes and thoseAlthough as everytime, I'd advise to watch streams or gameplay videos before deciding to buy or not to buy this game.			",305,53,3,28,21,2,52

												 The History Of Guardians Of Middle Earth Player : You were hanging out on store, you saw a moba with lotr characters, then  you quickly bought it. You were ready to roll out. Then you entered the tutorial/practice. You saw effects are slow and the mechanics are terrible, you said lets try that on real players.

												This is the most movie-based game I've ever played. The characters are slightly different versions of the ones in the movie, the gameplay is boring samey and uninspired, and the story is boring as well. No matter how cheap it is, it isn't worth your TIME.			",308,49,8,21,23,4,20

												I had fun with GoME on the 360, unfortunetly the PC version got the shaft. Not having dedicated servers ruined this moba because by far the worst thing about it was the frequent disconnects and lag everyone experienced. The devs abandoned the game long ago. Its a shame, because the actual gameplay was good. GoME is one of those ""It coulda been ah contendah!"" if it were only treated right. I hate Monolith for ditching out on Gotham City Imposters and GoME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But you couldn't do that cuz after waiting 20 mins on queue you lost all hope you have. Then you checked the community to group up with someone who plays that game.

												I have been playing this game for the Xbox360 since it came out! its a really fun MOBA using a unique Gem/Relic system. Having a MOBA catering towards the LOTR/Hobbit franchise is a great idea. Different characters ranging from simple Human-like heroes to creatures all from the stories! Its a blast to play, despite me mainly liking this on consoles the PC version is just as great!			",145,15,1,24,5,0,18

												Guardians of Middle-Earth, is not a solo-playable game, instead it consists of Player versus player in match sets, as well as co-op mode versus the CPU. You can manage your character inventory, equipment and commands, giving you control over your character and the ability to personalize it based on your play style. The wait times for co-op matches can be annoying, but the real-time action makes gameplay fun, and the graphics are pleasant to look at. I personally do not care for games where I am forced to play with or against other players, unless it is something I choose to do, so I would not play a game like this normally; However, for it's genre and given the quality of the game, I would recommend it for players who enjoy the pvp, or co-op gameplay.

												Guardians of Middle Earth is an absolutely abysmal game, ripping off other MOBAs while abusing the LOTR license. It's definitely another movie licensed cash grab, but is also an awful MOBA as well. It charges money up front but can't even compare to FREE MOBAs that it is failing to copy with any decency. It takes a big dump on its license, much like War In The North. Do not believe any positive review of this. I have to say this because this is a dreadful game. That is the truth and reality. They are lying to you, probably working for WB trying to get you to buy their crappy game. Any player that's played League or Dota2 will see right through this crap and uninstall on the first day. As a former League of Legends player myself, I can tell you that this game fails in EVERY way to compete with it, on top of charging a box just to play it. They then run a cash shop with locked content after you paid them for a box in the first place.If you want deeper details as to why this game is in every way a complete and total failure; I'll try to make a nice list for you...-Dated, muddy graphics that you can't crank up. All you get is a Resolution, Window mode, and Vsync. Nothing else. Did you like the nice amount of graphic customization in League? Well, you won't find that here. This is among the most restricted of customizations you can find. Console ports from 2009 come with more settings. Hell, Warcraft 3 from 2001 was more appealing. Not technically ""better"", but so much more charming and pleasant to look at even today. This game is muddy and ugly.-Crappy controls that you can't edit. That's right, like the graphics, you can't fix the controls either. They are locked in a rather awful default scheme. Unlike League, you can't hold down space to keep your hero moving. You can't use A to attack move if you like to do that. Thankfully Shift does it, but I find I use both, and many players may prefer A. The default scheme is not convenient in the least, and you can't change it. Like, why do I have to press to bring up my level up menu? Why can't that just pop up on its own like League? Why does the press for the building upgrades not even work? No, you have to press U EVERY time you want to upgrade a building. You can't change it, and the button to press for it doesn't work.-Extremely simple game mechanics. There's no AD vs AP like League, no Mana, no Energy, it's just spam spam spam when your stuff is off CD. Some League heroes are like that, but most aren't, and the game isn't built around it. Here, the game seems built for dummies, devoid of almost any strategy. Pick any hero, spam every ability, there, you're playing this game.-What customization the game does have makes no sense. You can choose between Gems and Relics(aka Runes) but you can get all of them right off the bat. So why would you even bother with the weaker ones? In League, again a game that knew WTF it was doing, lower runes were for lower levels, better runes, which cost a lot more, were for higher levels. Here you can basically get max tier runes right out of the gate, so why bother with anything less? Why does the game even have account levels??? They don't do anything!-4 Summoner abilities, renamed to ""Commands"", but they all share 1 CD. So what's the point of giving us 4? You're probably only ever going to use 1 or 2 out the set and just forget the rest. Btw you can't edit their default keys, which are A to F. HF with that. I should mention now that the game has no ""stop"" command for when you want to STOP your hero. I keep wasting my Command CD hitting S expecting my hero to STOP, but it doesn't. The game instead wastes my Command CD. So A and S are Summoner CDs, no way to change, instead of Attack Move or Stop. Wtf is wrong with this Dev team? Why is there no ""STOP"" hotkey???-Confusing interfaces that make it hard for me to keep up with what I own and don't own or what hero I can play or can't play.-No warring factions. This is a big FU. You've got LOTR here, a universe built around good vs evil, with many races to support it, yet you copy League(This time it's not a good thing) by having anything on either side. Wtf? So why should anyone play this over League? It should be good vs evil, yet you can see both sets of heroes on both sides at same time.-The multiplayer is dead. It takes a LONG time to find a match. I sit in queue for several minutes only to get a 2 player+3 bot vs A.I. team because the game gives up on finding a full set of 5 players. NO ONE is playing this game. In real games, like League, you push the button, 5 seconds later, you got a full match, Co Op or not.So there ya go. In summery, DO NOT get this garbage.			",96,25,0,16,5,2,21

												Rating: 1.5 out of 10Genre: MOBAThoughts: Honestly the game is so poorly made I can't really say much, but it's funny because Heroes of the Storm is almost a direct clone to this game but with Blizzard characters instead of LOTR characters and everyone loves it, which is rather funny (I personally think HOTS is garbage), this game just really needed to never release on console in the first place as well as have a price to play it, which draws people completely away from a MOBA in the first place, fixing animations heavily is needed so badly.  In reality if you are going to make a MOBA you cannot make one without items, although they did try to add in a rune feature like ""Dawngate"" had which is kinda good almost.

												Worst game ive ever played, i paid for this when it first came out. There was a time where it was literally unplayable, because of THEIR faulty port they created of this game. Ive never been denied a refund on something that was broken because of their bad manufacturing. they gave me the runaround and repeatedly told me to contact steam, who told me its their responsibility, and i should be entitled to a refund. After the replies stopped, i just vowed to never buy a game by this bottomfeeding s**tbag company, and spread the word about how scumsucking they are. I hope they all live miserable lives and are unfulfilled until the day they no longer exist. This company is worse than AIDS. Its as if all those people from teen mom, jersey shore, and flavor of love  all had acollective  baby, it got dropped on its head and fell down the steps, and was put in college on its second birthday.....out of place, shouldnt exist, and straightup ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												This game...Let me begin by saying that I have a strong affinity for both MOBA games and the Lord of the Rings.  I've been around a while.  Started playing DOTA in 2003 and continued playing it until DOTA 2 was released.  I have over 2000 hours on DOTA 2.  Tried Heroes of Newerth, LOL, Strife, etc...  My point is I know a little something about the MOBA genre.So now that I've provided my background, I beg you, do not buy this game.  It is dead, there are no players.  If by some miraculous occurrence a player base came into existence, STILL I beg you, do not buy this game.  It is quite literally the worst game I have ever played.  Nothing works correctly, bugs are everywhere, mechanics don't make sense, and frankly the devs don't care.  I have played this game with both bots and people, and in both situations, it is a truly awful experience.This game was so clunky, and just all around bad, that I swore off developers Zombie Studios and Monolith.  If a studio can release this game, in the shape it is in, they have no integrity, and I refuse to contribute to their continued existence.  I urge you to do the same.  If you don't believe me, read pretty much any other review written about this game.  It has been six months since I bought this game and last played it.  I randomly found myself back on this page and immediately a white hot rage was rekindled  inside me.  I suddenly wished nothing more than to throw down my enemy and smote it's ruin on the mountaintop .  This game needs to be taken to the fires of Mount Doom and destroyed!  IT SHALL NOT PASS!

												The controls are bad, the tutorials don't explain some really important things (or just plain contradict themselves), the camera is a pain, the skills seem to have very little to do with the characters who use them, and there is no way to find people to play with. There's some good stuff, like the character design and voice acting, but nowhere near enough to stop me from immediately uninstalling the game after banging my head on a wall for a few hours.

												As much as I love Lord Of the Rings i can't play this game. I just don't like it. Probably because I play DotA 2. It wouldn't be a bad game, if you could use every hero whenever you want and if you didn't have to wait a year to find a game...If coming from DotA, you might not like this, but if you just started playing a game from this genre, you might like it.

												This game is basically DOTA, DOTA 1, DOTA 1 was pure s.hit, the worst game since Bastion (which as we all know was pure s.hit), I could go on and on about the amazing graphics and mechanics - if there was any, which there is not. You can play as the gayest heroes, its basically HoN there is no difference, except for the fact that HoN is better, by a marginal d.ick, however if you spend a magical £50 on the f.ucking in game purchases the game gets increasingly worse as the layers from the already shattered onion get peeled off.HOWEVER I would recommend the game to anyone who has hands and/or a left nostril, it really enhances your gaming experience, either by allowing you to punch your screen or sneeze on it, both outcomes are that you cant see the s.hit game anymore, but thats what makes it so enjoyable ---- Its like the thrill of the chase when the beautiful Shrek is chasing you and he finally catches you and the feeling when he penet....- Anyway totally recommended game, buy it noooooooow!!

												There are better MOBAs out there and they're free-to-play. None the less This game deserves to pay a visit specially when it goes on sale (preferred 75% off) and get all the DLCs with it. I mean, its LOTR so that's the least selling point and just don't get too serious about the camera angles and you'll get used to it. :)			",696,160,26,93,73,10,117
