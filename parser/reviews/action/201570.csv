												I'd like to like this game.No, really. I would. But the fact is, that it's just too roughed up to be good. It's too unresponsive, there are errors in the menus, even. The text can often be too small, and being half blind like me, all you see are smudges that vaguely resemble words.I should also mention that the resolution is utterly screwed. You can't play in 1080P fullscreen, and whenver you change resolution, it changes between fullscreen, and windowed mode.The game needs a LOT of polishing up.I'll let you decide if it's good or not, but just be warned how rough it is, and how great it would be if it was polished.

												I imagine if I did LSD while playing Darius and had my childhood best friend sat next to me commenting on the gameplay, the result would be fairly similar to playing this game. D:Really Big Sky is the most confusing scrolling shooter I've ever played, just shoot the things, avoid the things, and drill through the other things, oh! Don't forget to collect those things and upgrade these things! Sometimes you'll take damage and not have a clue why, other times you'll blow up for the same reason, and sometimes your ship will spew a huge laser and the screen will go multicoloured because, why the ♥♥♥♥ not? Very trial and error but I'm okay with this because it's damn good fun! :P			",376,87,22,67,31,3,53

												Really Big Sky is a twin stick sidescrolling shmup that looks good. Mainly because of the colourful neon graphics, but this also makes it hard to identify what is what and that doesn't work well in this genre. The game isn't well polished. The menu's are a mess. You can't quit a game, but only pause it or terminate the game. It doesn't support 16:10 resolutions and you can't also play it full screen with higher resolutions then 720p. It's just sad for a pc game.The game play is a generic bullethell without level design except that it tries to make up having no level design by sometimes having screen filling things you need to drill or shoot through. That and the enemies are random generated. But that doesn't really add that much. Most of the time it's unclear what you must evade. It's main plus is 4 player local coop. And in the end that's the only thing Really Big Sky has going for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jump to the end for a quick conclusion.This is a hard one to review. Really Big Sky is a twin stick shooter, a bit bullet-hell-ish at times with.I really enjoyed the first couple of hours I played it, but it soon revealed itself. There are several thing I really like about this game, but their implementation leaves a lot to be desired, specially from a balance standpoint.I'll start with the pros of Really Big Sky:-It looks great! Even from the screenshots you can see that, but it looks much prettier in motion. There are a few resolution issues, but I was running it at 720p and it looked pretty good. I used this game has a pause between work, so playing in a smaller window didn't realy bother me.-Several modes. There is a classic mode, which includes bosses, events, scores, and shop in which you buy upgrades. There are modes that focus on difficulty, not attacking, giving a retro feel to the game, for just relaxing without worrying about scores and dying etc. So, there is choice, that's a plus.-Shop in the Classic mode let's you upgrade the parts you prefer and give you a sense of progression (which is also one of its faults)-Very detailed information. Everytime you end a run you get a score screen with more entries than anyone needs, really. And also a comparation to your average run, having the player strive to get better. Besides, there's a library with information about modes, events, bosses, upgrades, and so on. That's good, although it's way too detailed, and I doubt that anyone would go out of their way to read it all. I think that showing the entries as tips throughout loading screens would be more useful.-Bosses respect certain patterns, which change according to difficulty.-Decent variety in enemies, events and locations.-The music was pretty good. Not really my cup-of-tea, but I see some people really enjoying. Plus, it fit the context of the game.Now, the problems I have with it, some of them inherent with the pros' bad implementation, in my opinion:-The visuals are full of particle effects and filter changes, which can get a mess too often. Between those changes, you'll often lose track of what is on the screen, and what damages you or not. Most of the times, you'll die from something you didn't see. Also, it has performance issues later in the game, where particle effects are too many. I have a GTX660Ti and a 3.4GHz Quad Core... and it dropped to 5 fps at one time. That's pretty bad. But it ran mostly well on it. Still a reason to beware.-Bugs. Well, everytime I quit the game it crashed. That's not a big deal. Everytime I tried to see the Scores (as this is mostly as arcade game), it crashed. That's a problem now. And highly diminished the game's value. If there is no one to beat, why would I play more of it, after a while? Score attack games are fueled by.. well, score. This game has it broken. There are also a lot of people who can't get the game to run.-Dificulty Curve and balance. This is the worse part of the game. In the beginning, you're essentially running on trial and error, dying over and over until you learn how to get through certain things. But that's ok, learning the patterns and so on. But, as you progress through the game, it just gets a blurred mess in which there is no skill, and your score is mainly dependent on what you buy from the shop. And luck with the events you get. It's more of a grind-fest than struggling to get better at the game, since all you do after a while is to upgrade the ship and hope that the screen doesn't get too crumped with enemies and filters.-All the modes are too similar to increase the game's longevity too much. There's no drive to really play them, since most don't change too much about the game. The big one being Pacifist, in which you can't shoot, only dodge.=====================================================================So, conclusion.This is a game that is pretty, although relying entirely on particle effects and filter to achieve so, which often gets very messy.Progression is through grind and trial and error rather than skill, which isn't very good either.BUT, what I've played of it, was pretty enjoyable. The game feels good, for 3-3.5 hours. After that, with scores broken, it loses momentum and gets grindy and repetitive.If you're looking for a shoot-em-up to play for a few hours, this will be fun. If you're looking for a game to last you, or just a very good game... pass this one up. It's full of flaws and bad implementation, despite being a fun and well thought game in its core.I have to say, it feels satisfying whenever you score in the millions, but you also realize that it was more luck than skill. It is a fun game, sometimes, but I can't think of it as a good game.It seems to follow Boss Baddie's games' trend. Really neat concept, nice art direction (although too many annyoing effects), but then those games try to be bigger than they are with too many badly implemented mechanics.Please, keep it simpler. And polish them a bit more after release.I understand that other projects and games are more important than old ones, but several things are simply broken, and there are people paying for it.Cheers!

												Edit: At least this game delivers more on its space premise than No Man's Sky did, eh?**A DUAL STICK CONTROLLER IS RECOMMENDED**Summary  Genre SHMUP   Gameplay 85   Artstyle 90   Sound 80   Options 15   Replay 100   Value 100   Overall 95 Gameplay:Control: This game makes best use with a dual analog controller, and I found that aiming with a mouse can get a little congested due to the limited range of resolutions and windowed mode by default.This game plays very smoothly and shooting in a full 360° while trying to focus on enemy, bullet, and self placement starts becoming second nature after only a couple plays. Transitioning into drill-mode to go through indestructible obstacles is very smooth, and moving while drilling is very precise even though objects will produce a horizontal movement slow.Firing: Your default is a powerful and large laser block that then becomes a rapid-fire volley of smaller lasers. You recharge the more powerful shot just by not shooting for a while, and from what I could tell; the limit of large lasers stored is infinite. You can unlock additional lasers that fire around your ship, as well as a bomb that occasionally fires out that is affected by your velocity as well.You also can charge your drill and go into a very powerful (and limited use) spin that makes being still impossible due to always sliding, but you can spin forever if desired.Upgrades: There are only a couple ways to upgrade, which involve either: Boring through planets that randomly take up the entire screen and fly through upgrade pads for boosts. Killing enemies, collecting their drops, then using them to upgrade your ship permanently after you die.There only appears to be two temporary ammo upgrades, one is just a super powered version of your charged laser, and the other is announced with a quip from the narrator and results in an auto-firing beam that penetrates everything.Permanent upgrades are very potent and are why you can keep going higher with your score after each death. A few upgrades include: stronger lasers, a shield to absorb bullets, and a slow orbiting ball that destroys enemy fire on contact.Enemies: Really Big Sky excels with enemy patterns and design, never really seeming ""unfair"" due to excellent design. The only time the game will steal a cheap death from you is because of a special effect and random enemy placement.ArtstyleThis game is gorgeous to look at with its very vibrant colors and randomized galaxies. If you are simply just a fan of recolored deep-space phenomenon, you will be hooked easily.Whenever you find yourself inside a worm-hole, the game shifts into a 3D plane, letting you travel down the space-pipe of many deep colors. However, I do find that sometimes it gets difficult focusing on staying centered due to how dark it can get.There are also many moments where the colors shift and go negative or very dark, leading to their own obstacles. Due to their frequency after a while, I never really felt obstructed by them except for when the screen is very dark and I can't see an enemy that absorbs shots (however, bullets and asteroids are contrasted so avoiding them is fine).There is even a semi-rare event where floating dinosaur fossil heads breath bullets and fire at you while the background goes black and the screen goes blurrier while everything slows down and an air siren plays.Enemy design is top-notch, even referencing classic arcade games and styles. This is very hard to explain in text, but just looking at screenshots should clarify.Bosses all feel adequately boss-like (even impressively so in one regard), although it may feel a bit stupid fighting a giant orb with a shield around it if it never gets to the point it can drop suns on the screen.The worst part of the visual design is just the shape of your ship, even tho it's perfectly acceptable as is. It just gets overshadowed by how intense the rest of the game is.Sound:Techno, a relaxed (and younger) British narrator, and modern mixed with retro beeps and boops come together for a very calming yet engaging experience. There is an option to disable the narrator, and playing the game without audio doesn't take anything from the game; which I say is a good thing due to not everyone being fond of techno and narrators. However, I am, so the sound gets a pass.Also when you kill the enemy based off of Vector graphics, it dies in a satisfying old-school 'boop'.Options:MASSIVE failure. The highest accepted resolution is 1920x1080. The next highest is immediately 1280x720. For someone with a 1600 range resolution, this is disappointing because 1600x900 is still a 16:9 aspect ratio. Also don't expect playing the game windowed if you don't have the exact resolution the game wants; it'll either get compressed or it will just default to windowed.Also, there are only three graphic options (even tho with a game like this; it's understandable). The game while windowed is ""Always on top"" by default and no way to change it.At least you can: adjust sound via percentage, disable the aiming line, adjust narrator frequency, and also listen to songs you discovered in game.Replay:This game was built around dying and restarting with no end besides high scores. Due to unlocking multiple game modes that change how the game is played drastically, as well as just the upgrade system, you can find yourself replaying this game a lot while having fun.There really isn't much to say because the game was built for this, and it works.Value:This game is 5USD on steam right now, and it is the kind of game you can just come back to at any time as well as leave at any time. It's entertaining and definitely worth the money. If this game goes on sale; it'll be double its worth.That is, if you like SHMUP/Bullet-hell games. If you hate them with a passion; why even bother with reading this?			",267,29,8,17,3,2,8

												There's a quaint simplicity about Really Big Sky: twin-stick shooter, drill through planets/asteroids and you can funnel points you earn during runs into improving certain attributes and powers. Levels are randomly generated (as far as I can tell) and defeating bosses and certain enemies requires some thought but isn't an obnoxious puzzle. Additionally you can unlock more modes that are essentially the base game but with extra parameters, greater difficulty or alternate milestones! On the surface it's all really good and the graphics are decent.It was about an hour into the game that I realised I hadn't the faintest idea of what I was doing: obviously I was shooting ships and (trying) to dodge their attacks but then I would be sucked into a vortex? Or perhaps the colours would invert or suddenly blur? Did I unlock something? Am I more powerful? Does this enemy have a shield? No wait, that shield apparently damages me but another one didn't? I put a bunch of points into some random stats but I don't think they've done anything?Really Big Sky's gameplay is completely incoherent and this is not helped by the scorchingly bright and blurry visuals. The ""library"" doesn't help remove the obfuscation surrounding the gameplay mechanics but is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed smug descriptions, which on reflection should have been expected from the atrocious voiceovers heard during the game. Some of the stats are incredibly obvious and very necessary, but a lot of the laser related upgrades often seem to have little effect, or at least their impact is not conveyed effectively.I got this game for free so technically I got my money's worth, but it's really difficult to recommend this game over pretty much any other scrolling shoot 'em up or bullet hell games on Steam. Admittedly the genre is not ""my jam"" but Ikaruga is good so maybe start there instead?			",253,86,2,60,7,2,34

												This is a good take on the ""bullet hell"" genre. Not as infuriating as most of the Japanese varients of ""bullet hell"". It's still frustrating enough to make you want to punch the screen, yet addicting and enjoyable enough to make you say ""just one more try..."" about 83 times before you realize it's 0330, and you have to work the next day.Great for playing in short spurts, as you can easily pick up for 10 minutes, die a few times, and then go about your business.

												Really Big Sky is a very colorful game and really easy to understand.Highly satisfying - provided your reflexes are sharp! If you like hard twin-sticks shooters and can handle a lot of visual distraction, Really Big Sky delivers the goods. It has a great soundtrack, randomly generated levels that keep the game fresh and funny narration. Really Big Sky is also visually stunning and the controls are easy to get used to.While the game doesn't have a lot of different baddies and bosses, it mixes and matches them randomly so that every game is different and always challenging. This game is worth the purchase. ",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												A thumping dance track, a ship that can turn into a drill, a sense of speed that borders on dizzying, and a cross between bullet hell and an infinite racer. That's the bare bones of what you get, however what sets RBS apart from many other games is the sheer sense of style involved, this is a game that much like the old Defender, Tempest and other trippy games before it, doesn't shy away from wild, brave use of colour, and plenty of flashy lights. Combined with a thumping techno track, you get the distinct sense that you're taking part in an assault not just on your ship, but on your senses too - and I mean that in the most affectionate way possible.The only caveat is that I would suggest for the best possible experience, you obtain a gamepad for this one, it works a hell of a lot better using twin sticks as opposed to keyboard/mouse. Just beware the LSD induced dinosaurs.			",1647,571,92,264,280,18,321

												Pretty colors, great graphics, however, both these things are the game's downfall.Once you start upgrading your ship and surviving longer than a minute or two your screen becomes chalk full of pretty effects that cover up bullets and warp your screen so you have no idea what is going on because you can't see anything. The more upgrades you get, the more visuals erode your vision.Random stuff will happen, such as your bullets moving too slow to actually hit bosses, your screen will go ""negative"" but everything is nearly the same color which prevents you from seeing further, or giant laser beams will shoot across the screen without warning of where it's going to hit. So when you think you have a good streak going, prepare to be dissapointed from randomness stopping you.Also there's these nifty little forcefield pods that prevents your bullets from going through the field to destroy the pod. Sometimes these will clutter up your screen moving extremely slowly, or stand still during boss fights. The only way to destroy them is to use a spinning sphere around your ship to destroy them. So you get really close without touching them, stand there for 2 seconds, to wait for the sphere to come around to destroy them. In the middle of the boss fight this is very impractical. During some of those random screen effects, you're unable to see the forcefields at all. In addition, there are ""hard forcefield"" enemies that kill you on impact as well. These as well you can't see when you're in some of those screen effects.Visuals 9/10, so pretty, but obscuring.Gameplay 5/10, visuals too obscuring.Music 7/10, menus have extremely loud music, ingame has repeating decent music.Sounds 10/10, very well done, plenty of non-grainy sounds.

												Quite ok game but then in the end this game divides me up pretty badly. Pros:+ Interesting idea+ Lots of things going on. Fireworks and drilling into planets and the whole shabang+ Tons of upgrades though very little overview what you are actualy upgrading.+ Special modes unlocking quite quickly. Cons:- A narrator that sounds like he was just ejected out from a pub in Cardiff. 'You♥♥♥♥♥ he says when you go down. Dev probably thought this type of narration was a good idea. like a director talking about his creation while you play. Does not work at all. - Despite the fireworks the level design sucks. Generated worlds just does not cut it against Satazius, Jamestown, Exceed games much more limited design. - Fireworks gets out of hand. You really need to concentrate to understand what hurts you and what not. Learn the enemy types but not where you encounter them. Generated content you see... To wrap it up: If you really need to have a shmup that is _different_ go on and buy. if you are novice in shooters or just recently started adding to your library then skip this for now. There are others that are better at this time than this truly indie shooter.Edit: Muting the narrator adds a lot to the game. now one can enjoy the soundtrack and the action  better. Quite surprised how big of a change this has on the game.  MUTE IT immediately. dont use the always/or the lesser narration option. just kill the narration entirely. you do not need it at all.

												The game has a few interesting ideas for the bullet-hell/twin-stick shooter genre-hybrid, but it lacks focus and struggles to follow it's own rules resulting in a highly unsatisfying experience.Here was my experience.First thing that struck me was the obnoxiously flashy menu screen.  I mean, the bloom rendered the menus unreadable!  But perhaps it is my monitor that isn't perfectly calibrated that is causing the issue.  I can try to look past that.  So let me change the resolution so I can enjoy it in full-screen... wait a minute.  Why is there an unsatisfying selection of screen  resolutions?   The game just reeks laziness now.  If your monitor resolution isn't the top 4 most common resolutions, gg to full-screen experience.I still decided to give the game a shot.  I tried the tutorial, but it left me feeling very confused about many things.  Why add in the drilling ability?  The spinning ability?  When would I use each one?  What are you talking about ""hoops in the nebula""?  Perhaps if I play a few levels I will come to understand... Nope.  After playing a few levels, I didn't even understand how I died most of the time nor understand what I should have done to stay alive.  Maybe the fun is in figuring all this out?  But first I got to use my points to level up.What should I level up?  What does each of these do?  The description doesn't clarify most of the time nor can I see how the leveling affects my ship.  The leveling process is so unsatisfying, I don't even care what I level up as I often feel no sense of progress.  Also, why are there two play/back commands in the level up menu?  Such lazy menu design.After playing and dying so many times, I decide to refer to the library archive in hopes of reading up on the enemies I faced.  ""Know thy enemy"" right?   Well, it would make a lot more sense if they actually placed images of the enemies so I know what they are talking about instead of focusing on trying to be funny.  For the record, their attempt at humor was so invasive, there was nothing funny about it.I keep playing hoping I get over that hump to where I can start to have fun, but the more I play, the more I realize how rotten the game is.  Due to randomly generated  levels, each playthrough is unique, but it's also not satisfying because the difficulty feels very artificial and removes the feeling of progress.  Also, by adding shields that absorb damage in a bullet-hell game, it removes the threat bullets have at all.  I'll bet it was introduced because when things get too intense, all the flashy effects makes it impossible to tell what the hell is going on.  So rather than toning down the effects, they removed the core of what made bullet-hell bullet-hell.  It doesn't stop there though.  What makes difficult games fun?  Because the game lays out rules, and defeats you while following those rules.  And the simpler the rules, the better.  As such, when you die, you know exactly why you died and that reason was you.  The game didn't cheap-shot you.  Due to all the elements added to a supposedly simple genre, many times it's not clear why you died, and it breaks it's rules quite often, removing any fun from the challenge.So in conclusion, the game ebbs feebly with nice ideas and flashy effects, but the game lacks much needed focus for the experience to be satisfying.  Avoid this game if you can.			",249,50,2,11,9,2,20

												Second Impression (last paragraph for summary)Also, there are some weird resolution issues: Two of the Fullscreen modes act the same, and the highest resolution is severely cropped off (admittedly, I have resolution issues with many games due to a giant 2560x1080 monitor, but many players mention issues). I have to play in a window or in a full screen mode that takes up about 70% of the center of my monitorReally Big Sky is a side scrolling, roguelite twin-stick shmup that I can't compare to any shooter from my memory. Unlike most shmups, it falls less on the inherent skill requirement and more on the trial and error style such as a Contra. It has that bright and colorful style like Geometry Wars and unique gameplay mechanic involving shifting the ship between standard shooting mode and drill mode. The standard mode utilizes laser backdraft - in which your shot becomes larger and more powerful after not shooting for a moment, so it pays not to ""always be shooting"" like other shmups have taught you (This is probably easier with the Controller as you're always shooting when using the mouse and keyboard until you click). The drill mode disables your shot, but allows you to bore through planets and meteors and use a limited count drill spin (that makes a sound much like Sonic the Hedgehog's spin dash).Besides what appears to be randomly occuring ""smart bomb moves"", that is the limit of your ability (besides moving of course). RBS cleverly and annoyingly uses these limited mechanics to anger you and challenge you. Even the experienced shmuper will likely die often due to the curveballs of incoming solid planets, inconveinient laser beams, or deviously placed meteor fields. What makes that worse is that the the art style is a bit much at times and RBS will put salt on the wound by having random events that you have never encountered before such as inverting the color palette or navigation challenge events like from Scoregasm or Satazius. I thought I would eventually get over this, but the artstyle is at times, so flashy that you're likely to get hit by something you couldn't quite see in the chaos. Oh, and the game will occassionally mock you via the announcer or saying your skill level is ""N00B"". You will probably die often, more likely from planets and events than the bullet hell streams, but that is part of the intent, as it utilizes the modern roguelike trend of allowing you to upgrade your ship after you lose. Shards from killed enemies are used as currency to buy upgrades such as 45, 90 and 180 degree shots, shields to absorb damage, claymores that cause explosions and seem to cancel a few bullets, and much more. Said shards often spray in a fashion that makes it impossible to get them all and can place you in danger. Admittedly, the upgrades are a bit confusing as it isn't always clear when they are activated or being used (why do some upgrades say ""co-op"" when I can use them in single player?) and I'm not sure why I randomly get a vortex that will duplicate my shot pattern (I think it's another random event like the giant laser attack you can get). Despite it's simplicity, parts of this game are confusing.The game does have a lot to offer - like most roguelikes, you almost never play the same level though I can't tell if they are either completely procedurally generated, or if there is a pool of randomly selected levels. Even in the different levels, there are a variety of enemy types (like shielders that don't hurt you, but block your shots, or cascading enemies from the top of  the screen, or minibosses that have light bullet hell streams). There are a plenty of modes, including Pacifism that removes your ability to shoot, Retro mode which forces your shots to only go forward and adds an annoying posterization color filter, Arcade which spawns more enemies and events, and Boss rush, which honestly, I found pretty fun, even early in the game (best mode?). The soundtrack is solid and energetic use of electronica, synthwave and to my suprise, some metal in boss rush.In the end, RBS is a very hard shooter that's kinda unfair - throwing complete curveballs at you before you're 100% sure that you understand the mechanics (Meteor fields and lasers are just cheap tactics, developer). The art style is often to the detriment of the player and can ruin a really good run. The game largely requires trial and error as well as death to acquire upgrades to increase survivability (it may be technically possible to do so without upgrades, but I think that's a challenge even for the masochistic shmup gamers). I really want to recommend this game, because I see quality here (My original review gave a thumbs up), but the random events and cheap tactics to kill you drove me to a Thumbs Down. RBS is inexpensive, especially on sale,  so it is not a huge loss if you don't like it (or refund it, which didn't exist on Steam in 2013 when I played this). RBS also recieves semi-frequent updates, as it was updated when I played this in December 2013 and has recieved a few update after then - it looks different from when TotalBiscuit featured it.  RBS will only appeal to those that like rogue-lites, shoot em ups, and bullet hell games - which is VERY niche.  ",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												This game has some REALLY cool visual effects, but because of all these effects, you can't really see what's going on at times, and it's not really fun when most of your deaths come from the fact that you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥ Because of this, I'm not sure if I would recommend this game or not, as it really depends on whether or not you think this will affect your enjoyment of the game.But here's a tip: if you get this game, make sure to spend points on Radioshield. It gives your ship armor so you won't die instantly when you get hit. Oh and some bosses seem harder than they really are, you just gotta figure out how to beat them.			",161,15,6,8,3,2,8

												OK four words. I love this game. Very addicting after a while when you get into it. You are used to the controls very quickly because there arent many of them. You need to find out in the right moment what to do when a planet appears or meteorits and what you can do to destroy them. The same goes for the Bosses. You need as many multiplicators as you can get to get a high score. I played the classic mode the whole time. And dont look at the highscore list they are too high to be real i guess its all hackers again like in every other game. But i can tell you try to beat your own score is so much for fun that i am not interested in the lists. The game is very fun you upgrade your ship with points also for better protection and more firepower.I say try it find aout the enemys weaknesses and you will be very addcited if you like such type of games.greetz Akaya			",334,53,8,34,8,1,22

												""pretty"" ""artsy"" visuals aside, Really Big Sky is basically a game that fills in a checklist of how NOT to design a shmup.The visuals are simply ""crazy"" and not in the good, Crimzon Clover sort of way. All of the post-processing effects that do not interact well with each other at all make it hard to see what's going on, and the lack of level design and spongy enemies make playing Really Big Sky a confusing and ultimately pointless experience. (The worst offender is the ""retro"" mode, which only looks retro if 60's acid trip raves are what you consider to be ""retro"" in videogames.)Additionally, the gameplay is not at all noteworthy or creative. The only unique mechanic in this horizontally-scrolling twin-stick shooter is the ""drill"" option, which allows you to drill through certain objects and collect items. Although this could be fun, the game doesn't do much with it, largely due to the lazy procedural generation and simplistic obstacles, which leads me to my next point, the game is laughably easy - you can take many hits before biting it, and all of the enemies and bosses have extremely simple attack patterns that pretty much everyone has seen before. you may ask ""so how does the game introduce challenge over time?"" and the answer to this is that it instantly kills you by some kind of hazard or enemy that enters at speeds that you could not reasonably react to, and since the game is randomised it's not as though you can reliably memorise them. Needless to say, this is incredibly lazy game design that any arcade game worth its weight in quarters could not get away with.This isn't even mentioning the obnoxious narration that goes on throughout the game (which at least when I played it, you could not disable). Hearing a sterotypical british guy say ""oohhhhh you♥♥♥♥♥quot; every second time you die is cute the first couple of times you hear it, but quickly becomes grating. Really Big Sky is a game filled with unnecessary additions weighing down the otherwise simplistic and boring gameplay, that tries to excuse this fact by shoving in post-processing effects and obnoxious narration to try and be ""artistic"". Even worse and even more overrated than Sine Mora. Avoid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was really great. Easy controls, beautiful visuals, simple navigation and straight-forward goals with many different kinds of gamemodes. This was a really great game.Then they ♥♥♥♥ed up the graphics...I can't even play it anymore, literally. The game is locked to 720p, and when you attempt to change it to anything else, your game will pretty much be destroyed. There used to be great upscaling to better fit any screen's resolution, but the developer took it out for some...reason... Whenever I try to play now, on my 1080p monitor, the game glitches and ♥♥♥♥s up beyond my comprehension. Even when I set it to its locked resolution, my cursor is restricted! Sometimes it'll be stuck in a corner and can go nowhere, and sometimes it'll be restricted to a small box in the very middle of the screen, making it impossible to aim or click on anything. Also, let me not forget about the constant DirectX setups that always occur when I start the game... Every time I have to go through a setup just to play it, and it seems to ♥♥♥♥ up the game even more each time... Seriously, it's unplayable at this moment.I would recommend this game. I desperately want to recommend this game, but I keep hearing people have my problem with the graphics, and I would never recommend that experience. I'm really sorry. I loved this game, but I can't tell anyone to try it out anymore in this state. BUYER BEWARE!!			",136,25,4,9,14,2,8

Has a few bosses that aren't too bad once you figure them out. Very fast paced, rounds will last from 30 seconds and up, averaging probably around 2 minutes, obviously more if you are good/lucky.

												""Really Big Sky"" is an enjoyable sidescrolling shooter game (I forget the proper name but whatevs) which mixes mob grinding, with boss encounters, with a unique levelling system very well.I enjoyed the 2 hours of play I got out of the game before it became a little tedious, but still overall an enjoyable couple of hours. I beat most of the game, think I missed out 1 or 2 bosses, but that's due to the fact the spawning of them is random and I just got unlucky.My main criticism of the game is the fact that the commentator/narrator is absolutely terrible, and incredibly annoying. Had I not found that I could disable his innane babbling in the Settings I would have instantly uninstalled the game, as it's truly horrible.Other than that, a decent experience for those inclined to these sorts of games!Nilesy			",312,139,3,47,47,5,46

												Really big sky is a fast paced arcade shooter. It throws you into action from the very beginning, with minimal explanations over anything, so don't get disappointed if at first you find yourself dying before starting to grasp what is happening around you. Dying is an important part of this game: there are no levels to be completed, only to be delved into until your ship is wrecked, at which point you upgrade it a bit and start again. After some trial and error, you start to figure things out and go on an endless challenge against yourself trying to move further and further into the world. The game's graphics are very colorful and can even be ""trippy"" at times, changing colors very fast. There is also a variety of modes to be unlocked including a ""retro 80's"" mode, which adapts the game's graphic style into different arcade eras. Recommended in relatively small doses so as to avoid eye bleeding.			",218,129,2,37,18,2,33

												Really Big Sky is a very colorful game and really easy to understand. It sadly offers just a handful of bosses and enemies. Still, this game is worth the purchase. Highly satisfying - provided your reflexes are sharp! If you like HARD twin-sticks shooters and can handle a lot of visual distraction, Really big sky delivers the goods. While the game doesn't have a lot of different baddies and bosses, it mixes and matches them randomly so that every game is different and always challenging. The different modes offer yet more replay value - If you like to rely on your reflexes (and not on your memory) to score big, this game will fulfill you.Pros- Awesome shooter that will offer quite a challenge.- Great soundtrack.- Randomly generated levels keep the game fresh.- Funny narrator!- Visually stunning!- Simple controls, works very well with Xbox 360 controller.Cons- Only 4 bosses that are easily defeated once you get to know them.- Game should not offer to upload scores when it knows your score isn't in the top 100.- This game BEGS for an expansion pack with more baddies and bosses!My Rating - ""Great"" Traditional Rating - 6.5/10.

												Really Big Sky is a fantastic twin-stick shooter. As most games from the arcade era, it doesn't have much of a plot. You simply have your spaceship, and must fly through space killing aliens who want to take your planets. And there's tons of them. It doesn't really have a story mode, you don't get to ""win"" the game; it's all about surpassing your best score. And I must say this game is great at it. You'll find yourself playing again and again, improving not only your skills, but also your ship as well.So, to talk about gameplay, as I said, it's a twin-stick shooter. That means you can move your ship in any direction across the screen (although it's always heading right), and you can also move your aim wherever you please. The ship has two forms: the ""shooting"" form, in which it automatically shoots wherever you're point, and the drill form, which is used to pass through planets and asteroids that you might find in your path. There's a lot of different enemy ships, ranging from small ones, to huge ships that act as bosses; and there's also random events that add an extra difficulty during their duration. You also collect stars after killing enemies, that can be used later on to upgrade your ship. The game also offers a multiplayer co-op mode, for up to four players, but it only works locally, meaning you'd need to have at least three extra controllers around, for your friends.This game also includes lots of gamemodes. Most of them play out largely the same, being more (or less) difficult, but there's some that put a new spin in the game, like the Retro mode, that plays out like early shooters from the 80s or 90s, with powerups, lives and all that, or the Pacifist mode, in which you can't shoot at all.The art style is pretty nice; full of vibrant colours and some really good effects. Entering a wormhole is a pretty cool visual experience. And the design of the different enemies (and of your own ship) is great, with some looking like what you'd expect from a space shooter, and some with pretty unique designs.One more thing I should talk about is the soundtrack. Oh, what an amazing soundtrack this game has. I think it'd still be a pretty good game without it, but the soundtrack makes it an excellent game. The music, while being somewhat ""loud"", so to speak, still manages to be relaxing in a special sense. It really fits the tone of this game. And then there's the narration; as there's a narrator who talks during your gameplay, giving you advice and things like that. Now, don't worry, he isn't talking the whole time, he just shows up here and there, and whoever voiced him did a great job.Well, I think that's enough for my review of Really Big Sky. I really recommend this game, and if you get it, I hope you get to enjoy it as much as I did.			",418,84,9,48,30,5,75

												I have a LOT to say about this game.It's absolutely brilliant in the gameplay part, I love the music, it's an amazing bullethell game in general and the visuals are great.There are some annoying things about it I do have to point out though:- Using 1080p, you can't go fullscreen- The tutorial can be skipped way too easily and accidentally. Please have a timer of like a second until you can skip the messages. I had to take it 3 times till I didn't skip it entirely- Some mechanics are really not explained at all/not well enough. Like why does everything invert and music goes funky, why does it suddenly zoom in one direction, when do I get killed and when can I touch bullets no problem, ...- The intros aren't skippable or disablable in any way. Please NEVER do this! Show them the first time and then have them skippable afterwards, but don't waste a user's time by having them see the same intro every time with no way to skip it!I can't believe such an amazingly looking game was made in Clickteam Fusion 2.5 as well, I really need to learn from somewhere how to have such nice Effects in there! Did you use a custom extension for this, or was it all with the already existing ones? Anyway, that's besides the point.The game may have it's flaws, but because of all the amazing stuff, it's in my oppinion VERY worth it! If I had the source, I'd love you forever, but of course that's way too much to ask for.			",143,28,2,5,10,2,8

												This game is something out of a disgusting wormhole. I was positive. I have tried it for like 10 minutes, most of which was spent trying to find my mouse in the character creation screen, which happened to be invisible. Next disaster was the fact that the ship responded only to the spacebar, which moved the ship diagonally to the bottom corner. Everything else except the mouse was unresponsive, and it took some time trying to figure out the GUI for the options menu to see if the cursor was disabled. Wtf? Help? I am unlucky? Or is it the game?			",29,2,0,1,6,0,0

												This is one of the most counter intuitive and broken games I have ever played. The tutorial is absolutely awful. It's basically an auto-death on the third instruction that completely locks the game out until you use the task manager.The levels are pretty much just as bad. The gun shoots about two ticks to the left of where you aim. So if I'm directing the right stick right (3 o clock), it's shooting at between 1 and 2. After about 15 seconds, the ship turns into a ball of light and you cannot see what you are doing at all.Don't waste your money. If you want a dual stick asteriod like shooter, get Beat Hazard.

												If you like 2D shooters this is a great game. It takes a little bit of getting into but if you are a SHUMP fan this is one of the best on steam. Its a dual stick horizontal shooter with semi randomly generated levels with a lot of diffent modes to keep you occupied. Its slightly annoying from the classical horizontal shooter viewpoint in that you can't memorize the levels but you can memorize the patterns of events. The scoring is also slightly randomized but really, if you just want to have some fun exploding things and dying very quickly, this is excellent.			",209,36,4,43,30,5,67

												When I first started the game, there were black borders around the game. That's fine, I'll just change the resolution. Oh wait, there's only 4 options to select.So if your monitor isn't the top 4 common resolutions, then you're out of luck. Unfortunately changing the resolution booted me to windowed mode, and alt+enter didn't work for me. So instead of having the manageable black borders, I have to play in windowed mode. Great start!So I went through the tutorial and played the game, then I died to some invisible enemy. I could not tell what was going on in the screen due to all the flashy effects the game throws at you. They're pretty, but annoying as ♥♥♥♥.After you die you can add points to upgrade certain abilities, I think. I'm not sure if I have to add points all the way to get that ability, or it improves the ability in-game—which I don't notice due to all the flashy♥♥♥♥♥♥going on.So I played through the game again and reached a boss. The boss was a ship with thrusters that each shoots beams in a pattern, so naturally I shot the thrusters. Didn't do a thing.Apparently I was supposed to wait for the pattern to do it's thing, then enemies appear.Then the cycle continues until the boss moves backwards and forwards, bringing you towards the ship, and you have to drill through the ship to avoid getting damaged. During this stage you can shoot the thrusters.And inside the ship is a circle thing, where if you touch it you get damaged. Apparently I did that too many times and died, I think? I could still move around, and the boss keeps moving backwards and forwards, but I can't shoot anything. I also can't take damage.So I uninstalled the game feeling confused by the game and confused by how this game got so many positive reviews. Oh well, if they enjoyed the game then good on them, but in my experience I couldn't enjoy the game.			",576,210,31,46,62,6,79

												This game isnt enjoyable, not for me anyway. Its a schmup in the same sort of vein as blast em up. I actually enjoyed blast em up a little more than I did this though. When you first start playing its totally confusing, very hard to pick out what your doing or what to shoot. You can upgrade your ship everytime you die by collecting stars which count as coins, but then even the power ups are hard to understand exactly what they do. The achievements are again confusing, forcing you to look online for instructions and the coop achieves require you to install 2 third party controller emulators. Overall if I was to explain this game in one word it would most definately be CONFUSING. Its a very unusual thumbs down for me, 3/10			",733,71,21,23,25,6,50

												What do you get when you have a developer that has no idea how to optimize a game, goes full out insane with special effects, and has no sense of balance?This game.Avoid it. I gave it an honest try. Two hours. But one of those hours was spent fighting against horribly imbalanced bosses thrown at me right at the start of the game. When your game thinks throwing impossible walls of enemies at you is fun... it's time to look elsewhere.It's not even worth it for the badge or cards.			",947,390,16,92,43,9,89

												Yuck. A shmup where trial-and-error is necessary to figure out what can kill you is a recipe for disaster, and that's exactly what Really Big Sky is. I can't recommend this game one bit.On top of that, it doesn't support 1920x1080 and doesn't seem to scale up its 1280x720 native resolution properly, meaning you'll have to manually change your desktop resolution if you want it to fill your screen. If you actually want to play this piece of trash, for some reason.			",807,239,35,97,62,7,118

												Really Big Sky is a side-scrolling space shooter/bullet hell game where you go through procedurally-generated levels, blasting enemies and upgrading your ship for the next time you play.It seems like this game has a lot of strategic depth to it, but I'm having a hard time telling for sure because the game doesn't tell you anything. The tutorial is fine for getting the basic controls, but the game is terrible at describing anything else. I have little idea what most of the upgrades actually do, so I can't really make informed decisions. It's cool to blast stuff and all, but I feel like 90% of the game is going over my head, and the game itself is just fine with that.The game, at least, is very pretty, and the music is nice to listen to. The narrator's somewhat entertaining. The controls really suck at first, and I had to do a lot of customization in the options before they were even passable.Overall, this game seems like it has decent gameplay, but it's completely ruined by the poor execution of the rest of the game. I wouldn't recommend Really Big Sky to anyone but the most enthusiastic of bullet hell game fans.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												I get to get blown up while some british guy calls me a♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10In all seriouslness, I hate bullet hell games. I hate memorizing enemy attack patterns and hate the fast paced stress of them. That being said, I enjoy RBS because it's different. It's a bit slower, and rarely unfair, i'm just playing on an underpowered tablet until my laptop gets out of the shop.I've got about half the achievements apparently, but nowhere near unlocking all the game modes.Classic is my favorite, i enjoy upgrading the ship with every playthrough, and like the challenge, but the 2 minute timed mode is a blast too. Pretty awesome game, I like the music too.Some of the game modes are brutal - hell and nightmare particularly, but it's still fun!			",139,23,6,25,27,5,29

												(Recently re-installed to check out the trading cards and to see if it has improved at all in the interm. No it has not.)I have nothing but the utmost hatred for this game. I wanted to like it too, pretty-as-hell space shooter with like twenty game modes and online leaderboards for all of them? Sounded great!First of all, you would think a computer that plays Just Cause and Portal 2 without an issue could play a 2D space shooter without slowdown, right? Really Big Sky brings it to a crawl. It took a graphical drop of like %75 to get it to normal pace.And you're going to want to drop the graphics too. All the effects make it impossible to understand what is going on. Things you can shoot and things you can't shoot look the same. Is that an asteroid, a boss or a funny coloured black hole in the background? I could not tell you! And when you die in one hit, this is something you have to know!Worst of all, every so often the colour will warp, the BGM will be replaced by awful noise and the screen will fill with bullets. This happens often, randomly, and there is no way to stop or prepare for it. A support forum-goer called it part of the challenge. I call it having all the game elements taking a collective♥♥♥♥♥♥on your computer screen and calling it challenge. It is the opposite of fun.There are many better space shooters on Steam. Some are even a bit cheaper than this one. Please do not buy this game.			",369,94,7,25,24,7,49

												I got this game for free through PCGamer handing out Steam keys, pretty much because the title was reminiscent of FTL, a game I enjoy as well. What I was not expecting was to absolutely fall in love with this game. You'll first find that you have to hold MOUSE1 to NOT fire. As you progress you can find bosses, which can turn a regular shooter into a bullet-hell game. There are also planets that randomly appear which force you to drill through them. The colors and the soundtrack are amazing and fit the mood perfectly. 9/10 because the bosses can be quite confusing/tough at first, but at $5.99, this game is a steal! ",141,7,5,7,12,0,6

												Two Really Big problems for this game:- The game itself is not hard, you just get killed by things you can't see, or if you can see them, you've literally never encountered it before and there is no indication that it will kill you.  It's more frustrating than skill intensive.- The design seems to contradict itself.  On one hand, the game wants you to play it over and over, to have the satisfaction of upgrading your ship.  On the other hand, the game builds up each session painfully slowly, instead of throwing you right into the action.  Overall, here's what a play session looks like: slay exceedingly easy enemies for two minutes, some crazy visual effects happen for no discernable reason, run into some invisible boulder and die.  Repeat.  Not what I would call gratifying.			",90,20,0,13,4,0,10

												Fun rogue-like, side scrolling, twin stick shooter. It's a good time waster, I find myself playing it in 20-30 minute spurts when i have time to kill. Pros: You get to blow a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Controls are good, ship upgrades.Cons: Crashes on exit from fullscreen...at least for me...other than that not too much else.			",476,107,13,44,23,4,50

That's right, a freaking dinosaurs in space that shoots lasers at you!

This game has beautiful light visuals and addicting gamplay, This game does not require alot ofskill to play just shoot everything you see and dodge some projectiles the enemy is firing at you.Overall rating: 9/10Pros:-Very colorful-PEW PEW PEW PEW-MORE PEWPEWPEWPEWPEW-Simple-Amazing light shows-Good music (more enjoyable if you can set your own music, but damn wouldn't that be Beat Hazard?)-Lots of modes and Challanges to complete-Fun to playCons:-Sometimes you can't really see the screen because theres too much PEW PEW PEW and exploding enemies-The more you upgrade your ship = The longer you go = More killing baddies = More Neon♥♥♥♥♥♥in the screen = Cant see-The Narrator is sometimes annoying-Co-op maybe?

												I'm sorry. I know I didn't play it long enough... 1st of all You should write that this game may cause Epilepsia...So colorful, I was not even sure what I'm hitting, if there are any power ups. Tutorial was okey at beginning and then somebody speed it up so much that You actually don't know what happend. For tutorial ONE ENEMY is enough, not bunch of enemies... I died during tutorial... (ETC) Never happend in any game... Beside of that, AIRCRAFT(AirPlane) Should be much more bigger, I'm not playing with an ANT, bt with spaceship/aircraft/airplane. I love arcade games, but this is... not clear. I felt like shooting doesn't work at times... and those combinations with drilling and etc, should be moved to other buttons... :/Tho i like drilling into planets, no idea what means ""Laser speed""... :/ Anyway. Maybe I'll try it later again.			",520,289,18,68,62,6,67

												It's a good game.Imo, it has high potential, but it lacks a decent tutorial, idk maybe the developers wanted to do it like that, so you have to ""explore"" and ""experiment"" a bit, how to kill that guy and stuff.People that like Arcade games will definitely like this one aswell.It's not a game I would recommend to anyone, since you don't NEED this in your library, but you WANT it.Another good thing about it is that you can easily open it while waiting for friends/sex and close it when you need to.This game has very good feedback (and it indeed is!) but as i said, it lacks a tutorial, but you can find out most of the things in the first few hours or so, based on how well you use that what you got in the game. ;)			",101,11,4,10,6,0,12

												Loads of colors, madness, fun, randomness, deaths, fun, pixels, projectiles, fun, points, tracks, fun.Here is how to describe it. An indie casual shooter, where your goal is to survive the longer possible while travelling at faster and slower speed in the endless space with your ship, while tons of random things may happen (from sudden endless battalions of ships, to floating jurassic bones that can shoot from their mouth).The controls are pretty simple, though the game lacks of a tutorial to explain what your ship can do (become a drill to enter inside asteroids or planets and other kind of stuff, move at extremely fast speed to create a super-lethal ring of fire around your ship, channel a limit break of your ship while you collect shiny thinghies, or charge your projectiles just to make them bigger). The options don't allow most of these controls to be changed, but their key bindings are pretty good and not really needed to be changed.There are also upgrades you can buy after every death you score, but careful that by buying them you make the next tries more difficult than your previous. Also, it may happen that you won't know what are you upgrading at first, but by playing again and again the game you will understand their use.I don't really think there's a local coop in, but the singleplayer is good enough thanks to it's replayability to make this game a good choice for bored people.

Bosses are outstanding as well.Pros:-Very colorful, very fast paced;-Good soundtrack;-Very good bosses;-Humour.Cons:-Some resolution problems, which I bet will be fixed/are only on my pc.Score: 4.5/5TL;DR: Really Big Sky is a Really Good Game and you must buy it NOW.

												This is one crazy game!!!! It reminds you of those classic shooters you played, but it's nothing like them at all!!!!What you basically do is dive into infinite space with your tiny little ship with little wings. And you blast through enemies, collect power ups, drill through planets and asteroids, and save your hindquarters from nasty alien space ships. And it becomes increasingly difficult as you pass through hurdles! The graphics are neon-ish. They look beautiful. 90% of the time you will see lasers on your screen. The rest 10% of the time you'll be drilling through planets, which do not house nasty alienses (that was Gollum, I swear!).The game has a library of enemies which gets updated as you encounter them. The information is humorous. The devs who created this game did a great job!So, the verdict? 10/10!! It will satisfy all your needs, whether they be shooting aliens, watching colorful lights in space, drilling through planets, or being mocked by the game via the ""exit mode"" button (You'll never see that text. Just some text which might make up for a good excuse as to why you lost). Also, it makes you come back for more. And you will come back to destroy that nasty alien mothership!GRAB IT!!!

												I got this game when it was offered for free and have no regrets.If you like bullet hell, shoot-em-up style gameplay, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are wonderful, it reminds me a lot of geometry wars with all the crazy special effects. There is a lot of color and it can be overwhelming at times - the high activity on the screen can make it difficult to track where you are, enemy projectices, etc. The music is very good and adds to the intensity of the gameplay. The controls are very simple, and the learning curve is minimal. There is a tutorial in the beginning of the game that is quick and very helpful. I find the narrator to be a bit annoying, but it is possible to turn the narration off. Grinding in this game is actually quite easy because you can get a lot of credits very quickly with each game session (thanks to the score multipliers). The upgrading is simple, and they are mostly offensive-based. There is a unique mechanic in this game where you will periodically encounter planets/asteroids. To pass them, you have to switch your weapon to your drill, allowing you to travel through to the other side. Inside the planets, there will be random bonuses like increased weapon spread, ship speed, score multiplier, etc - drilling through these will give you the bonuses. While your drill is active, your weapons will also charge, allowing you to shoot massive beams when you switch back to them. As the game progresses, there will be times where your super boost activates, propelling you forward at a blinding speed. This is easily one of the most dangerous parts, because it is very easy to crash straight into an enemy projectile, or worse, any enemy ship.The boss battles are not too difficult, but the game remains challenging, especially when the screen is filled with weapon effects.Very fun game, pick it up if you like shoot-em-ups.Recommend!

												Twin Stick Shooter that feels REALLY good to play, has tons of gamemodes and decend soundtrack! Flashing lights caused me little bit of headache, but still it didn't stop me from playing this for couple of hours! Controls took a while to get used to as I am more used to controls like on touhou-games and more classic TTS's.STILL the price isn't bad and the game will most likely have you play it ""one more time!"" for couple of times more than one.

												Really Big Sky delivers highly satisfying from various challenges and randomness in every mode you play.Unlike other bullet hell game, RBS offers your initial setting like more upgrades, more challenge. Drill minigame and wormhole will break you for a moment before the game throw you in space war with chaotic and colorful battlefield. The soundtracks are great and fit well like '80 sci-fi movie as well as narrator keeps his fun chat.However, remind you that this game is score competiton as there's no end game. Only four bosses with tougher pattern doesn't feel different once you know their pattern. Plus, some poeple may get technical problem and low frame rate during heavy load of effects and enemies.Still, I highly recommend this game for people who love bullet-hell style. Great visuals and random gameplay always keep me to back and enjoy stunning experience. SPAAAAAAAAAACE!!!			",218,56,5,10,3,2,3

I love this game and would recommend it to anyone. This game can be hard at times but that also depends on what game mode you are playing on, and trust me there are plenty of game modes to unlock!

												Lasers, a drill and a narrator that probably needs to be shot - Really Big Sky brings back the intensity of side-scrolling shooters, but now with 50% more added fun. With over 10 gamemodes to play through, from the pointless Peaceful? gamemode to the ridiculous Hell gamemode, this game has infinite replayability value. Also of note is the fantastic upgrade system present in the Classic Mode, allowing a player to really soup up their ride.+9001 respect, Ripstone & Boss Baddie.Currently in the Humble Weekly Sale!

												Definitely not the game for me. I suppose I should have guessed, when a game is described as an adaptive SHMUP(shoot'em up), that I wouldn't like it.It's way too frantic, and, unlike other shmups where you can memorize the level to know how better to position yourself, this one changes continuously.If you like shmups, then you'll probably like it, but this is really really not my flavor of game.I also had some graphics issues mid game that I think might have been caused by the effects. On the main menu, selecting one of the sub-menus seemed like it made the options too big for my screen for a second.It's definitely psychadelic.The music was pretty good, though, great chiptune. :)If a psychadelic adaptive frantic shmup with ship upgrades and great music sounds good for you, then try it. but if you have issues with standard shmups like me, well...better stay clear. You'll like this one even less.			",40,27,0,2,6,2,6

I can't recommend this game. :/New Review:  (From 2016)2 years later, I decided to look into this game again in an attempt to get another 100%.  This isn't the first time I've been wrong.  It's also not the first time I've been right.  I'll admit that at the time of the review 2 years prior, I had a splitting headache while going through some rough crap at home.I turned down the quality of this game from high to low and found the game to be quite playable.  This game turned out to be a pretty decent danmaku.  I don't know much about a story going on, there MIGHT be one, but I'm not really sure.My only gripes involve not being able to see how much shield you actually have and what the real requirements for the BOOKY achievement are, which still remain a mystery even after unlocking it.PROS:+Nice Danmaku+Trippy graphics+Interesting musicCONS:-How much shield do I have before I die?-Shield recovers?  What recovers the shield?-True unlock condition for the BOOKY achievement is an enigma (unlocking entire library is only part of it, apparently)-May cause epilepsyOverall, it's a pretty decent game.  If you already got it from a giveaway, a gift, or an earlier purchase, you should check it out.  As I said 2 years ago, it is an acquired taste.7/10			",262,77,12,21,24,7,23

												Three options for ""full screen"", none of which work (on my 1920x1080 display). One is full screen, but 3/4 of the screen is cut off, the second is a not quite full screen window with the bottom cut off and the third is a tiny box in the middle of the screen!!! Hey @developers, I don't care if you're game only does 720p - just ask DirectX to set that as the resolution when you init the damn display! No need for you to upscale at all!Started a new game, it asked for my screen name - soon as I hit D for DarkStarSword the damn thing decided that I had entered __ as my name! Only way to change the name is to delete all progress - good thing I realised what had happened immediately before I had made any progress! Hey @developers, handle the SHIFT key would you? This is a PC for christ sake!Looking at the forums these are known problems since at least around March, yet they still have not been fixed. Poor first impression and I haven't even started playing yet!Edit: I've now started playing and I must say this game has absolutely terrible performance! My nVidia GTX 680M should have no trouble with a game like this, but the framerate is absolutely terrible - fraps tells me I'm getting 35fps in game (which in itself is bad), but it feels more like 15-20 fps and is quite unpleasant to play. There is also no pause button when using a controller and no way to bring up the menu without killing yourself to end the game.It's a shame, because it looks like there is actually a pretty good game behind all these problems.Edit 2: Achievements are broken!

												The screen is too busy and the colours too jarring to be able to make out what is happning on screen a lot of the time. Add to that the procedural generation of levels to ensure the player can not learn the levels and the game becomes mainly about luck with little real skill involved.And no 1920x1080 fullscreen?The soundtrack is good though, about the only part of the game I can recommend. Best thing would be to see if you can find the soundtrack seperately and not bother with the game at all.			",503,281,0,124,29,1,54

Here though we have a modern take, its fast, its colorful, and its catchy! I dont know if there is a lot  I can actually say about the game besides I enjoy playing it. I described it as best I could, some more details though I imagine you want. You are in a spaceship flying through the galaxy shooting, ""things"" There are a hand full of bosses, and a good deal of game modes. Its really simple.

												This game is a pleasant surprise. With gorgeous-looking space environments, very nice music it also has quite enough of gameplay variety to appeal for some hours of simple shooting fun. There is a progression with ship upgrades, the downisde of which is that you have to grind/die A LOT at the start. However, when you upgrade your ship enough and new game modes are unlocked the game really starts to be very fun. The only other problem I had with it was too much eye strain due to color inversion effects/speed increase combination. I really felt my eyes tire quickly and would suggest playing the game in moderation. The recent addition of cards should serve as a good enough incentive to break through the first 1-1.5 hours to really understand and enjoy the game fully. Also there are so many twists in mechanics and enemies that even now I tend to find something I haven't understood/discovered before. Oh and the random level generation definitely helps to make each playthrough different and interesting enough to not bore the player. Good game!			",1658,664,65,213,191,14,294

												This game is very badly ported, there are only 3 resolution options but they all seem to be bugged, I was unable to play this in fullscreen, period, the fullscreen options kicked me into windowed mode once you start the game, it only stayed fullscreen in the menus, and also the only resolution is 720p. Mind you the windowed mode seemed to be more like 360p weirdly enough.So my recommendation is an absolute avoid for being a horribly bugged dreadful port.I can't speak about the gameplay because I could never get that far unless I felt like playing it in tiny little window, which I didn't.

All you need to do is kill enemies, and do it real fast. And you also need your reflexes. And.., let the LASERS do its job. The levels are random (I think) and each gameplay features different enemies and obstacles which is kind of cool. You can't master the level. And also, LASERS!			",183,33,5,20,8,2,15

												★★★★★★☆☆☆☆It's an okay sh'mup. It's very bright and very heavy on the particles, like Geometry Wars, but after serveral attempts I really just lost interest and am wondering if I'll ever play it again.The worst part of it is the unnecessary announcer in the game. The comments made are mostly cringeworthy and seem to have been recorded from a low quality microphone. The game would have been significantly better without it.The only reason I'm recommending it is that it does seem like it would be a good game for anyone that's into the genre.

												Once I realized that I could use points I got in-game to upgrade my ship so I didn't die from one shot I started having fun. I'm dumb.  This is pretty crazy bullet hell shooter. There's times when there's so much going on on the screen I have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what's happening and then my ship materializes from a purple-blue blaze of laser fire still intact with all the enemies gone. It's those moments that make the game.  I have to say it's a rather confusing game, but not just because there's a lot going on.  Some of the mechanics aren't very intuitive. Same with the boss fights, or what even constitutes a boss.  I enjoy the fact that what the game throws at you each time is different; or, at least, the order in which the game throws fixed battles at you is random.  The drill-through-planets concept is pretty cool, too. It also has a bunch of game modes, which adds a good amount of replay value.I think the weakest points are the voice acting (would've been better to have none...sorry) and the occasionally surreal enemies that seem way out of context, like those dinosaur heads that rotate and shoot lasers. Seriously, wtf is that about?  That just breaks immersion. The game also seems to be missing that final polish.  I can't really put my finger on it, and it's not an unpolished game, but something feels loose.All in all, if you like bullet hell shooters, you'll probably like this. I did, and still do. It's great fun to jump in and see how long I can last against ridiculous odds. Pick it up.			",162,28,2,8,16,1,15

												The moment I realized this was a great game wasn't when I first drilled my way through a planet instead of going around, nor was it the first time I overcharged my lasers and produced a giant death beam. It wasn't even when I encountered a wormhole filled with fire breathing dinosaur skeletons.No, the moment I realized this was a great game was when the announcer began to hum the Jurassic Park theme while I was fighting off the dinosaurs.

												Everything about this game is really annoying. Everything.• The extremely bright menu.• The way everything looks like it has a blur filter laid on top.• The fact that RBS doesn't support a resolution above 1280x720.• The annoying and inconsistent narration.• The inability to pause and exit to the menu from the game.• The ""cute"" menu options when you die.• The over exaggerated British-ness.• Binding the Steam screenshot trigger to the left-button on the 360 controller so I randomly take screenshots when it's resting on my lap.• Being unable to Alt-Tab to my desktop because RBS is set to ""always on top"".• The entire game not making any sense, (are there levels, or is this just one giant random procedurally generated game?), so every time I ""retry"" the level I end up playing something completely different.• When you're asked to enter a name and press Shift, like most people would do to capitalise the first letter, it instantly automatically enters your name as '__' and continues on to the main game with no way to change this without deleting your save file...I've never experienced a game that does everything it can to make me hate it.

												WTF did I play?!PLUSES:+ Good for retro arcade lovers. I also like arcade and retro games, BUT! I didn't like this game!MINUSES:- Reminds me ""N.P.P.D. RUSH - The milk of Ultra violet"" (my 1th hated game), because both have some disgusting graphics. I don't say it must be on super ultra 3D graphics, but at least a little kind and pleasuring graphics.			",262,50,23,26,25,4,40

												I'm really interested in pc local multiplayer games for my living room, and this looked like it fit the bill.  *I was wrong*.  The graphics are extremely buggy, and you cannot play the game in fullscreen at 1080p.  The controls are ill-advised... who puts a dedicated screenshot button on the left bumper?  The entire time you play, an englishman mumbles nonsense at you.  I really don't understand this game, but I don't want to spend the time to figure it out.			",360,120,6,41,49,3,70

												I got this game for free as most of you did. But if you didn't DO NOT BUY this game! It has really stupid gameplay all you do is kill stuff and go through meteors with a drill. Such dull gameplay never seen before. It's just not worth the money. Buy it only if you really really really really really really really really REALLY want it and if it's on sale of course. I don't recommend it to anyone. Rated 3/10!			",74,13,3,3,6,0,5

												I was not impressed. You have 1million things on screen and you just move around because you have 1 gun and it just auto fires. If you get hit once my one of those million things its game over and you just start again. This is no story or real sense of progression. The game is basically continually replaying the same level over again after having upgraded your ship. with things that aren't well explained and don't make a lot of sense. I had no idea what most of the upgrades did and some said ""co-op"" next to them for some unexplained reason. The game is not well optimized for PC. It starts windowed and trying to make it fullscreen doesn't work. Your keyboard and mouse to navigate menus is annoying and unintuitive. Good music though. 4.5/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												This game has serious interface flaws which need to be addressed before I would call it enjoyable, as well as many other issues: -Huge pixelated text that covers the screen and is near impossible to read. -Imposed rendering cap of 720p for no apperent reason, with incredibly awkward and unweildy settings. -Primary button used for multiple things at once means that you can skip important information or navigate away from what youwant to while trying to do other things - like shoot. -Overused effects domination the already low-res display and make it hard to tell what is going on. -Sluggish controls. (Not really too bad, and would not be a problem if the above were not true.) -Good music! But you can listen to it for only a very short amount of time. -Unintiutive design.   *The tutorial is ambiguous.   *You often cannot tell whether you are supposed into fly into a thing of avoid it until you try.   *You have an arbitrary limit of how many 'special drill attacks' you can use, which is at no point brought to your attention,   *and this limit is represented by a completely unrelated text character near the top of the screen.  *Mashing the primary button brings you back to the title screen, not back to the game, after death.  *Respawn text is often ambiguous and changes ever time you see it.  *Generally unclear, hard to read, and confusing interface. Even if it is shiney, shiney does not a good interface make.Another big issue is illusion of speed, which plagues a lot of games. The background makes it look like you a re traveling incredibly fast, while the things you can encounter move by you much more slowely relative to it. Effects and other shiney things also do not accurately depict speed, so is leads to a confusing gameplay environment where you'd be better off assuming you were not moving, and that things where moving past you at different rates.Good things about the game? Like I said good music, and fancy effects, but these are used so poorly I cannot claim that they count positively. Under other circumstances they might be selling points, but under these they are merely things which are not terrible.			",61,9,1,3,5,0,0

Because the music, colors, and design are great, and for the first two hours of this game it was rediculously fun.			",148,62,6,8,10,1,24

												An explosive space shooter that is unique every-time you start a new level. The visuals are explosive and fun to look at and can change anytime. I feel like Im playing a new game everytime I start a new level. There are a wide variety of modes to choose from. There are leader-boards to see how you compare to your friends. The gameplay is alot of fun and keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. It is a challenging game because alot of time you only get one life.The boss battles are creative and keep you on your toes.The upgrading of your ship can really give you the advantage when fighting through the sky. The music can be changed and they have a Jukebox full of great tracks to choose from. The downfalls of the game is that it can be buggy at times. But setting aside the bugs in the game it really is an intensely explosive game that changes really fast as you progress through each mode.I highly recommend this little treasure for any space shooter ready for an intense experience!

												With the wide acceptance of the WASD and mouse combo and XBox 360 controller, twinstick shooters are everywhere. Really Big Sky however takes the twinstick shooter idea and uses it to deliver classic horizontal scrolling shmup gameplay with modern visuals and sound (not to mention a Cockney AI). Like with classic arcade games, score is everything! Multiple game modes, a rocking techno soundtrack, an upgrade system and overall fun game experience make Really Big Sky one of my favorite twinstick shooters of all time.			",511,204,20,89,71,8,100

												I was really surprised by this. It has sat in my Library for a year or two, part of a HumbleBundle bunde.When I played, I liked it. And I normally don't like games from the Bullet Hell genre.Cons:• Doesn't tell you spaces aren't allowed in your name, and automatically puts and underscore without confirmation.• Like the Sega Dreamcast, the better you do, the harder it gets.• Only 'Starbits' from Classic count to your 'Starbit' total.• You have a set number of lives, usually one, and can not obtain more during stage play.• Obscenely bright, and even more so during certain effects. Do not play in the dark.Pros:• You can upgrade your ship… in Classic mode.• The library. How it describes things, in general.• Easy controls, particularly in I think it was Retro mode, and especialy Pacifism mode.• It doesn't take much time to raise any given shop stat to max.• Like the Sega Dreamcast, the better you do, the harder it gets.• The enemies and bosses are easy enough that you don't feel that their OP, but at the same time, hard enough that you feel challenged.• References. Scattered through gameplay. Most you need to have narrator always on for.• Visuals are stunningly awesome, is you can adjust the brightness enough.• The tutorial (skippable) is amusing, and skippable.• Gameplay, visuals, sound, and controls are all very well put together.• Unlockable modes.• Achievements, cards, et cetera.• Controller viable.• Same-computer multiplayer.

												Going through my backlog from Steam sales, I was surprised to find a true gem. Really Big Sky is an awesome-tastic shootemup with randomly generated levels full of absolutely mental special effects, enemies, bosses, and special events. I was instantly sold when I found out that the proper strategy when flying straight at a planet is to equip your drill and blaze right through it, because ""going around is for chumps!"" Lots of game modes, a nice progression mechanic and a ""library"" of info on the game to unlock mean plenty of replay value. In summary, you really should play this game.			",364,125,4,31,35,3,26

												I hate this game with a purity that surprises me. PC controls are awful, with a terribly distracting crosshair. Tutorial is poorly structured, and you'll click through cues by accident. Bombs are never clearly explained in any of the several times I've tried to get into this game.Graphics are blurred into obscurity; color choice is poor and gives terrible readability of the environment. I have played my share of bullet hell games, and this is not for shooter fans. It's for folks who desperately need sensory overstimulation. If you really like a lot of sounds and colors sloshing around to techno, this is going to be a blast for you.Design wise, the scale is claustrophobic, and does a terrible job of conveying any sense of scale or speed. Narrator is annoying and flippant. Intro is epic and self absorbed. Not my scene; tried several times and wish I'd never bought it.			",273,87,1,59,21,2,62

RBS is fun yet all too flawed.Still, ""Who at all the pie-manufacturing planets?"" has to be heard to be believed.			",481,70,11,38,30,1,41

I've played 90-minutes of it so far and still have no idea what the hell is happening most of the time. But in a fun way. It's what I imagine doing too much acid and then getting electrocuted whilst playing Gradius is like. I've never managed to do those 3 things in a combination like that, but you get the idea. The control is tight, the game is pretty, and the music kicks ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, I don't really like techno since I'm not a nerd, but still. Sounds good.			",196,13,2,7,2,3,9

												This is the perfect example of why random people shouldn't be allowed to publish any crap they make in a game making program. Learn a real programming language before putting ""games"" on Steam, not this experiment where you just throw random lighting effects in and call it a feature.But it's clear the publisher doesn't care about quality, ignoring the many people who can't even run the game because it only works in about 2 obscure resolutions.Do everyone a favor and buy a better microphone too. Who is this idiot saying random things like ""Here come the niiiiiiids, cash baaaaaaaaaack"". I wish I could get my cash back for this garbage.

												Of all the shoot-em-up space games I've played in recent memory, I love the concept here most.  Play for a few minutes and die and you get points to upgrade your ship for future battles.  Do awesome and last for a long time and get major upgrade points.  Even if difficulty scales as you upgrade, the endless upgrades are very satisfying and I hope it never ends!  Kudos!

												Look at all those colours in this game... O.O It's...truly AMAZING! If you are looking for a game for all ages, Really Big Sky is for you! Yup, your main goal is to shoot EVERYTHING ( The moving objects & the not moving objects ) and to beat your highscore (reaching the one million points maybe, yay). There are different game modes, for instance, classic and arcade. After a classic game you can upgrade your spaceship  to become stronger and stronger. I have actually nothing left to say about this game hmm maybe..No, just check it out!			",317,108,9,34,32,3,36

												I've not gotten too much into the game yet, and frankly, Shmups aren't usually my best games. However, Really Big Sky is not only incredibly visually impressive. But also the gameplay elements are simple, easy to grasp yet amazingly enjoyable. Not to mention the humor within the game really livens the mood and just adds to that already really rewarding and fun playing experience. I'd definitely reccomend getting a hold of this game.

												Psychadelic pulse-pounding frenetic bullet hell side-scrolling shooter. Super simple, super replayable, super neat.Downsides are that it by default runs in a window and if you fullscreen it seems to not like being any higher resolution than 1280x1024 or something which is a bit of a shame. This means that in type 1 fullscreen, (where the screen is stretched to fill your window), everything looks a little blurry. Other downsides are that a lot of your time will be spent dying very very suddenly because all the shifting nebulae-like colours make it sometimes difficult to see where a stream of hot neon death is coming from.Upsides include everything else, including the soundtrack, the oh-so-british silly voice acting, the infinitely replayable gameplay, the ease at which you can just load this up for a quick blast when you're short on time, the simple controls, the wonderful array of enemies and bosses to fight and learn how to beat, the drill/vortex mechanic, and the range of different playmodes to increase (or decrease in one case) your challenge. This helps keep the game wonderfully fresh. Bored of the normal mode? Try pacifism mode! Or Boss Rush! or HELL, or Nightmare! or Retro for that Atari-esque feel complete with eyebleedy colour clash!There is literally no reason not to give this a try. It's a blast!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I rate the game Really Big Sky 2.5/5. An okay, remarkably straight-forward action game idea that is severely hampered by remarkably unintuitive visual design.This initially cool-looking game includes far more style than substance and the severe lack of clear or easily understandable graphics (watch the video preview to see what I mean) adds a great deal of unnecessary challenge and a viciously sharp learning curve. But when its style is stripped away, this game is essentially an extremely simplistic (and repetitive) side scrolling action space game with no depth. As a result of this game's underlying simplicity and continuous frustration (the game is always hard no matter what) the game becomes boring quite quickly. The unusual techno-oriented style of the game's sound design you might love but you might just as easily hate it. At least this game is cheap.   What you see in the preview is pretty much all you get....if you can decipher what it is you're looking at in the first place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really Big Sky is really a one of a kind game.  I haven't played the first title named Big Sky, so I dunno how much alike they are, but this twin stick shooter is very different than what you are used to.The first few games will leave you wondering what to do.  And even if you will ever get far.  It's not to the point of rage quitting, but you may take a few breaks between a few runs.   The game randomness is awesome.  Every runs are truly different.  A large variety of enemies, settings, modes, pattern to learn, lots of customization for your ship, more stats for you to look at than you care for, leaderboard.  This game have it all.Be prepared tho, like I said, there is a lot of stuff to learn, things to figure, and you should really try to figure them out by yourself as it is the most interesting part of the game, getting to know the game.I won't spoil more of the fun for you by telling you more about it, cause obviously there is a lot to say. I could add that the visuals are very very sweet, if you haven't already noticed.  Highly polished UI as well.Do yourself a favor and get this one.  If you read this whole, then you will likely like the game :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really Big Sky is a challenging space arcade shooter with a fun Neon art style. There is no story; just fly, shoot, and survive.There is a multitude of enemy ships that you have to take on. Each with its own special attacks and abilitys, their sole purpose is to kill you. Along with the small enemys every so often, there is a boss that once you fight and (hopefully) kill you go to the next area. However, a mega attack to kill them all might lead to a some amount of lag on some PCs.Every time you kill a enemy you get ""Starbits""; the money for the game. You use them to upgrade your ship with better lasers, bombs, and shields. That leads you to (possibly) surviving longer and getting more starbits. The power ups aren't well explaned; in some cases some they're as clear as day where as others not so much.There is a lot of game modes that you can play, and each of them have a diffrent style you can play. You unlock them just by playing the game and unlocking diffrent achivements, which leads to my next part.The achivements. Half of the time they are more cryptic than the powerups you buy. Some are striaght forward such as ""500 kills"" or ""boss X50"", those you need to kill 500 enemys and 50 bosses. Then you have ones like ""Booky: give a hoot"" or ""Home potato: be like Harry Stamper"", not a clue in the slightest.PROSI love the Neon art style.Nice Arcade Shooter.Plenty of replay value.CONSPowerups aren't well discribed.Same with the achievements.This game is a nice time waster if you need to burn 5 minutes to 3 hours just shooting evil spaceships.

												I don't know why everyone is complaining about the narrator; the narrator is hilarious. I actually laughed out loud when he sarcastically hummed the theme from ""Jurassic Park"" during the flying dinosaur skulls part.My only real criticism is that I can't tell what killed me half the time. It really does seem like the game occasionally just decides ""OK, that's enough"" and kills you. The other thing is that even when ""continuing"" I keep having to defeat the same two bosses over and over. Isn't the point of a continue that it saves your progress? Oh well. I didn't run into any of the other stuff people are complaining about either; fullscreen works fine, etc. I did have to quit by ALT-TABBING out of the game; a minor beef that a lot of other games seem to suffer from. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game reminds me of a classic Gradius without the powerups you got during gameplay.It's really fun and addictive, if side-scrolling space shooters are your thing.These guys have great humor and lots of easter eggs hidden within the insane gameplay, and sometimes it's really hard to find said easter eggs, because your eyes will be too adjusted on your ship.Did I mention that it's 4-player local co-op? More insanity, way more fun that way.My favorite part was probably the black hole dinosaur heads. That's right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do what comes naturally.Nice gamemodes (I unlocked each every single gamemodes in around 5 hours)Nice bosses, soundtracks aren't that bad, just a bit repetitive,silly but funny achievements.It remembers me some good ol' arcade games with spaceships n' shït.Yeah, that's a pretty good game. I got it free thanks to a bundle from PC gamer, but it's pretty cheap you know?6€ for an arcade shooter that makes silly things, with few gamemodes and bosses. You can also play it with someone else on local multiplayer ! You should try it with a friend, it's a good experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall I have mixed feeling about that game, some things are clearly good in the hardcore SHMUP style, but often frustration prevails. It often feels more like a demo than a game proper.I don't recommend the game in its current state (August 2014). There is certainly potential here, and I still plan to play it from times to times.On a positive note the dev still update the game from time to time For me the biggest issue are the annoying gratuitous visual effects that hamper the gameplay. For example all of a sudden, the screen can switch to negative or pseudo colors or the display is affected by a sort of ripple effect. In the end, too often you loose without even knowing what actually hit you.With a few minor changes I'd recommend it. Check a video first to see if it works for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks promising, sounds amazing, but when you play it. It's less so. Still beautiful, but some parts utterly confusing (the tutorial doesn't teach you enough, IMO). All the same, this game gets in my good books because of its simplicity (as I said, only some parts are confusing, otherwise it's a simple game), nice concept and fun gameplay.For Doges: reely beeg skie, wow, such fun, much gaemplae guud, beeuteeful gaem, such amaze			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know how to put this...Really Big Sky is a bloody damn well masterpiece if you ask me. The only thing I can really think to describe it is if a bullet hell game, Asteroids (y'know, that old arcade game?) and The Impossible Game's soundtrack had a hot sweaty orgy and made this love child of a game put together.I'm not going to tell you what to do... But you should get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the colours...oh the colours. twin stick shooter on acid. sound track is pumping ,the changing of the colours as the game progresses is mind blowing and adds a beautiful twist to the game. you can increase the power of your favourite weapon as play through. plenty of game modes. really big sky is a gem of a game and for the price you cannot go wrong. if you like twin stick shooters while trippin on acid this game is for you. well worth a look.

												Got this game for free from PCGamer, and it's worth your time.It's one of those shooters where you're sometimes you're like ""WHATS HAPPENING I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE ARE SO MANY LASERS IT MUST BE GOOD BECAUSE MY SCORE IS SHOOTING UP LIKE CRAZY OH NO I'M DEAD THAT WAS AWESOME""I recommend it for when you're frustrated playing other games, and need something to let off steam; something that doesn't require much skill, and isn't super competitive. It's a little relaxing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FRELL YEAH!  Really Big Sky is another game I've been waiting to recommend.  I pre-purchased Indie Royale's Really Big Bundle before the games were announced because of the obvious title hint.  I have not regretted it.  This is probably my game of 2011.Are you interested in the shmup genre despite the pattern memorization it often requires?  The procedural generation in RBS removes that problem.  Do you like to earn upgrades?  Do you prefer a level starting point to earn your score?  RBS offers modes for both styles of play.  Buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Really Big Sky is an impressive game if I've ever seen one. I have only played the game for about ten minutes and I'm already hooked on how good it is. It is good for pretty much all ages, and has one simple goal: SHOOT EVERYTHING. Good colours, good music, good gameplay. If only the big game brands put this much effort into a game.PEW PEW PEW!

												After getting a key from a giveaway, I looked up the game to see exactly what I had won, and I saw something I had ever seen before.So, I downloaded it and played it. A few hours later and I'm here typing this review.So far, I love the art direction and the variety of the game, as each time you play, you will encounter new things, which is one of the elements I love the most besides killing everything you see. After a game, you could then upgrade your ships using points you have aquired during the game.I am not sure if there is any backstory, but to be honest, I'm not sure it needs one. This is a fantastic shooter with variety, color, replay value, and plenty of humor. I highly recommend it.The only complaint I have is that this game should support some more resoloutions such as 1366x768, or maybe I'm doing something wrong..Overall: I'd recommend anyone to buy this.

												I got this for free in the giveaway. I can see why people can ""love"" this game, but to me it is just another 2D space shooter with not much innovation or originality put into it. The first thing I noticed was the super bright menu screen. I go on to play and notice that everything is way too ♥♥♥♥ing bright. I can't go 5 minutes of playing without my eyes straining like spaghetti noodles. It kinda loses playability about an hour or so but that's probably just me. Even then, I could've played Galaga with trance music and get the same effect.4/10 because the narrator is alright and the soundtrack is awesome.Time for me to get some aspirin.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But also the gameplay elements are simple, easy to grasp yet amazingly enjoyable. Not to mention the humor within the game really livens the mood and just adds to that already really rewarding and fun playing experience. I'd definitely reccomend getting a hold of this game.

												(Note: For those of you who just want the ""11/10 I killed Bigguns""just scroll to the bottom)For me, RBS is a game I like to play when I don't have a ton of time on my hands or I just want to relax. I has the feel of a classic arcade style shooter but with ALL THAA COLLOURRSS. It is not just limitted to that though, there are some very challenging gamemodes and if you want to be any good you actually have to focus. I sure haven't. In fact I am terrible at this game! Despite that though I really enjoy it. There is nothing like blowing stuff up to sooth the nerves! I have to say that the one thing i disliked about the game was that so much happens after you get a certain distance. I can honestly say that half of my deaths occurred without me knowing what caused them. You are shooting lazers. They are shooting lazers and the BAMMO! A boss is there too. This all happens pretty quick late game and you don't stand much of a chance. But that is from an unskilled player such as myself. In conclusion I should say that this is a really enjoyable game with a nice retro feel (it has a ""Retro"" gamemode for heaven's sake). I really enjoy it and reccommend it!Now for the rating:6/10 Gameplay (you die too quick)7/10 Graphics (ALL DA COLOURS!!! But the do get confusing...)9/10 Difficulty (if you want a challenge this is the game for you)8/10 Soundtrack (It's got some sweet beats... yes I really just said that. Oh gosh)9/10 MULTIPLAYER (You can do it all with your pals!)Total:7/10 (That's not the average of all those ratings I know but that is what I feel in my heart) ",49,6,5,3,4,0,3

												I must say I am extremely disappointed in this game. If I hadn't been given this game for free I'd ask for a refund. My resolution isn't supported in full screen, so I can only play the game windowed, besides that there's a 20 second start up video you have to watch every time you open the game, and this cannot be turned off. Besides this, the controls are ridiculous. Who ever heard of a game needing backspace and enter for yes and no when half the other menus in the game allow you to use the mouse? This games just a cluster♥♥♥♥ of terrible execution. Very disappointed, I was looking for a good SHMUP and all I got was a waste of my time. Would NOT recommend this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's great, don't believe what anyone else says. I know because I've played it for less than 2 hours and I'm already making a helpful review.Nah, It's actually not. You don't get a tutorial and obstacles look like powerups of some sort so you don't even know what to do at first, leaving you with a very bad first impression. Sometimes the AoE circles of obstacles that require you to go into drill-mode show invisible because the game resolution is faked up and enemy obstacles appear on top or bottom side of the screen so you can't see the center of the obstacles. There is this fog obstacle that requires you to have enough firepower stored up in order to get through, but sometimes the cloud respawns almost instantly or you just simply don't have the firepower, getting you killed and having to retry.To be honest, I wouldn't like it even if these issues didn't exist. It feels bland and I'm not a huge fan of the genre so I don't recommend to buy the game unless you get it for cheap and afk for cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some bosses can be easy to kill but you gotta remember to press ""A"" to jump over what's leftover or else you'll die, lol. The sidekick voice is a crackup sometimes, and the music is very befitting to the game.The best part of this game is that it is very rewarding. Keep on playing and keep on getting better and you will be handsomely rewarded with unlocks, perks, and a pandoras box of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The developer needs to make this game work. He had so much time and it is still horribly buggy... but once you get around all the hurdles, the game can be enjoyable.I recommend it only if you can get it for free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no pros for this game as I cant possibly get it to freakin run. Mostly because it only has like 5 resolutions non of which are 1440x900 which is what I have. FFS even KOTOR, a 10 year old game, has 1440x900. The mouse in the menu screen feels like it's moving through molasses and hence feels unresponsive. The number one problem of course is that THE GAME DOESN'T ♥♥♥♥ING WORK. Being as I have a 1440x900 monitor I can't go into fullscreen mode. The fact that I can get the game to run untill I hit the play button is just silly. If you want to buy this game, don't go play ikaruga or another far better, more polished bullet hell shooter.

												This is a really great game, increadbly fun to play.  Fantastic humor in it. My only gripes with this game is the lack of consistancy. Some times an enemy will hit you and 1 shot you but the next playthrough it wont even scratch your shield. The other problem is that some sequences cause the screen to pretty much become so bright and blurred that you cant see whats going on and an enemy will spawn on you and kill you. Can't tell you how many times this has gotten me killed and its not even like its a lack of skill that kills you its just a bad mechanic. When you play it you will see what I mean. Totally worth buying though as the pro's outway the cons with this and I really enjoyed it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Considering this game is going free for a week on the PC Gamer giveaways via BundleStars I figured I'd shove my oar in.Really Big Sky is an alright and pretty cool SHMUP that does rain in on the bullet hell, it has simplistic mechanics that take time to master and looks pretty cool. However, it has plenty of faults, from resolution issues  (Running a 16:10 monitor or a 4:3? You're in for a bad time) to crashes on scoreboard checking and a quite unforgiving difficulty curve.The song and the ""Cockney AI"" is irritating as well, I suppose to some it would have the same sort of charm that Killing Floor's Harry Enfield Nostalgia does. This is a game that will be quite unforgiving but worth a go for sure on a sale or cheap to scratch that arcade action itch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay. Where to begin with this one. Note: I got this game free from PC Gamer's Indie Week thing. But I would pay for this game, especially after playing it.Short and Sweet, here we go.+ There's a metric ***load of lasers.+ There is a lot more explosions than lasers+ The Narrator is hillarious, at points.+ UPGRADES+ The Screenshot button+ There are times in this game where I don't know what's happening anymore+ From what I can tell, a ton of boss fights.+ The colors really captivate my attention.+ Easy to use control scheme, for controllers. I'm pretty sure the game technically has <2 real buttons. + Drilling through planets (And bosses) is fun.That being said.- The narrator is also useless. (I.E: Shoot the core!) - Trial and Error gameplay, but, it's not like you won't die anyway.- Repetitive, but, if you've played any space SHMUP you won't mind really.- The soundtrack gets repetitive but you could always mute it and play your own music. - You will get killed by some random mechanic you didn't know about, and get frustrated on how to get past it.- ""What does this upgrade do I don't know I'm just gonna purchase it.""Edit 2: I've found the pause button, we're okay. +- I've played this game for about 25 minutes and stopped to write this review.

I can't go 5 minutes of playing without my eyes straining like spaghetti noodles. It kinda loses playability about an hour or so but that's probably just me.

												Really great game.  Doesn't deserve the bad reviews it's getting.  I'm guessing that's mostly due to people who didn't give it a chance or do not possess the reflexes necessary to do well in the game.  I'm having a blast with it.  It's beautiful, and well made.

												Its random, hard, funny and  I feel its worth getting if on sale, this is one of those games where you might be confused at first, but once you get into it, the game is hard to pull away from...plus there is a british guy who rambles  hilarious stuff while you play, which makes the game even better if you ask me.also there is dinosaur heads that shoot fire while sirens go off as the british guy sings the opening theme to jurassic park, so there is that too.

												This game has quite a steep learning curve, particularly since the tutorial doesn't go into any depth about the game. However, once you've progressed passed this and worked out how to pass planets, the game opens up and becomes a very enjoyable experience.Lots of modes, ship upgrades and randomised levels keep things fresh and interesting, but you will have to play this game a considerable amount to get anything out of it.One for the high score junkies and those who enjoy being abused by the Narrator (Why not?).

The tutorial is pretty easy and I am looking forward to the rest of the game, unfortunately, this game just have crazy graphic that I need to set it to low.Overall, good game for some old school side scrolling shooter.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After getting a key from a giveaway, I looked up the game to see exactly what I had won, and I saw something I had ever seen before.So, I downloaded it and played it. A few hours later and I'm here typing this review.So far, I love the art direction and the variety of the game, as each time you play, you will encounter new things, which is one of the elements I love the most besides killing everything you see. After a game, you could then upgrade your ships using points you have aquired during the game.I am not sure if there is any backstory, but to be honest, I'm not sure it needs one. This is a fantastic shooter with variety, color, replay value, and plenty of humor. I highly recommend it.The only complaint I have is that this game should support some more resoloutions such as 1366x768, or maybe I'm doing something wrong..Overall: I'd recommend anyone to buy this.

												This game has some issues. I haven't played much of the game, but these issues are clear and apparent within the first few minutes of gameplay.The tutorial goes from peaceful control learning... To suddenly throwing you into the gameplay at a super-fast pace and you dying. That's okay... for some people. I'm one of those kinds of people, but not everyone is.Secondly, the game's SUPA TECHNO LIGHTING screws with the gameplay. The effects hide an enemy somewhere and then you die.By the way... The nice British narrator swears every time you die. He says t**, a**, and a number of other things. This is utter mindless garbage. Swearing is OK, but please make an option to NOT have it. Some menus even have curse words like d*** right on them (Peaceful mode says ""Throw in your god d*** towel."" Are you joking me? Nothing lets you know this game has that. Nothing. The game looks fine for kids, the tutorial is fine, then the game decides to showcase lots of cursing. The issue I have with this is that there is no ""noswear"" option, no warning of this, and it is always constant and blatant. Goodness.Back to the gameplay.Everything in this game will kill you within a small number of hits. Lasers or ships alike, they will kill you. Instantly, on the lower levels. Once you start upgrading stuff, you will start making it to bosses... Maybe... And then you will die. Half of the ""enemies"" on screen cannot be killed, half the objects cannot be destroyed. Most stuff you have to drill through. By the way... THE TUTORIAL MENTIONS NONE OF THIS. It gives you a short flying tutorial, and then just says ""screw you, MAJOR BLAM BLAM TIME.""And yes. Half the enemies cannot be killed in a twin-stick SHOOTER. This game is more like a runner.Other gripes. The game's HYPER TECHNO GRAPHICS strike again with performance. On lower cards, it will lag out for a few frames (usually resulting in massive damage / death). No health bar (sure, I'm one hit dead when I start, but could I get a shield bar?). No indication of certain enemies and what they do. Obsessively overintensive lighting that gets in the way (such lighting can be done without messing up the gameplay. Try Beat Hazard Ultra). Swearing is annoying as anything. Narrator repeats the same few lines (and I like his voice! They botched him up.) This game is not only difficult, but also punishing and annoying in almost every way. Game gives no indication or lesson on what will kill you, and with how obsessively good the AI is, you will never know.So do I recommend this?If you're a child, no. Lots of swearing.If you're someone looking to cause carnage... No. The only carnage is your own.If you're someone who doesn't have the best gfx card. Nope, lag will kill you.If you're looking for a good experience of skill... Nope, this is just punishing.The list goes on.If you are someone willing to put up with a game punishing you for buying it, with constant swearing at you and yelling at your incompetence (half of which is helped by the bad mechanics and lighting) and are willing to die over and over and over and over, with almost no reward... Maybe I could recommend it then.Seriously... Developers, there are good and fun experiences that are fast-paced. Yours is too fast, and not willing to slow down and get a player pumped before the pain. And honestly, put in some indication that you don't give a darn about cussing, so some kid doesn't have ""t**"" and ""a**"" running through their ears constantly, until they say it in front of their parents and then get their games taken away.GFX: 7/10.Gameplay: 4/10Story: *FAAAAAAART*Difficulty: About as difficult as cutting cheese, with a twig. Without the twig breaking, or you explode. And do it fast, or you explode.I do not recommend this game.EDIT: Also, I wanted to point something out. This game calls itself ""a twin-stick shooter for the modern day."" Does modern day mean swearing, lack of storyline, seizure-inducing graphics, lack of tutorials... If it does, then I am sorry, but this marks a bad future for gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, Ill admit that I got this game for free during a BundleStars giveaway.  But, I can definately say that I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  At first, I was thinking 'Eh, just another Rygar-type space shooter', and a way that's exactly what it is.  But due to being such a game, it brought back no small sense of nostalgia from my earlier years in gaming.  The narrator can get kind of annoying, but eventually I grew fond of his taunts, and for those who arent as tolerating as I, you can turn him off in  the options menu.  This game can sometimes be frustrating, but as I have played and gotten better and learned the strategies for the bosses I have encountered so many times now, each playthrough has gotten more and more fulfilling.

												This game has some issues. I haven't played much of the game, but these issues are clear and apparent within the first few minutes of gameplay.The tutorial goes from peaceful control learning... To suddenly throwing you into the gameplay at a super-fast pace and you dying. That's okay... for some people. I'm one of those kinds of people, but not everyone is.Secondly, the game's SUPA TECHNO LIGHTING screws with the gameplay. The effects hide an enemy somewhere and then you die.By the way... The nice British narrator swears every time you die. He says t**, a**, and a number of other things. This is utter mindless garbage. Swearing is OK, but please make an option to NOT have it. Some menus even have curse words like d*** right on them (Peaceful mode says ""Throw in your god d*** towel."" Are you joking me? Nothing lets you know this game has that. Nothing. The game looks fine for kids, the tutorial is fine, then the game decides to showcase lots of cursing. The issue I have with this is that there is no ""noswear"" option, no warning of this, and it is always constant and blatant. Goodness.Back to the gameplay.Everything in this game will kill you within a small number of hits. Lasers or ships alike, they will kill you. Instantly, on the lower levels. Once you start upgrading stuff, you will start making it to bosses... Maybe... And then you will die. Half of the ""enemies"" on screen cannot be killed, half the objects cannot be destroyed. Most stuff you have to drill through. By the way... THE TUTORIAL MENTIONS NONE OF THIS. It gives you a short flying tutorial, and then just says ""screw you, MAJOR BLAM BLAM TIME.""And yes. Half the enemies cannot be killed in a twin-stick SHOOTER. This game is more like a runner.Other gripes. The game's HYPER TECHNO GRAPHICS strike again with performance. On lower cards, it will lag out for a few frames (usually resulting in massive damage / death). No health bar (sure, I'm one hit dead when I start, but could I get a shield bar?). No indication of certain enemies and what they do. Obsessively overintensive lighting that gets in the way (such lighting can be done without messing up the gameplay. Try Beat Hazard Ultra). Swearing is annoying as anything. Narrator repeats the same few lines (and I like his voice! They botched him up.) This game is not only difficult, but also punishing and annoying in almost every way. Game gives no indication or lesson on what will kill you, and with how obsessively good the AI is, you will never know.So do I recommend this?If you're a child, no. Lots of swearing.If you're someone looking to cause carnage... No. The only carnage is your own.If you're someone who doesn't have the best gfx card. Nope, lag will kill you.If you're looking for a good experience of skill... Nope, this is just punishing.The list goes on.If you are someone willing to put up with a game punishing you for buying it, with constant swearing at you and yelling at your incompetence (half of which is helped by the bad mechanics and lighting) and are willing to die over and over and over and over, with almost no reward... Maybe I could recommend it then.Seriously... Developers, there are good and fun experiences that are fast-paced. Yours is too fast, and not willing to slow down and get a player pumped before the pain. And honestly, put in some indication that you don't give a darn about cussing, so some kid doesn't have ""t**"" and ""a**"" running through their ears constantly, until they say it in front of their parents and then get their games taken away.GFX: 7/10.Gameplay: 4/10Story: *FAAAAAAART*Difficulty: About as difficult as cutting cheese, with a twig. Without the twig breaking, or you explode. And do it fast, or you explode.I do not recommend this game.EDIT: Also, I wanted to point something out. This game calls itself ""a twin-stick shooter for the modern day."" Does modern day mean swearing, lack of storyline, seizure-inducing graphics, lack of tutorials... If it does, then I am sorry, but this marks a bad future for gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game seems to start up just fine, but the resolution is totally wrong. My default is 1920x1200 (16:10), but I just see part of the menus.Then, when I finally manage to navigate to the menu for changing the resolution it changes through a few resolutions (there's not even an option wich shows all resolutions, it just changes them as soon as you change the resolution option), then  shows a black screen and finally crashes. I've had this problem since buying the game (maybe about half a year ago) and tried again today: same thing, so I guess the developers  just gave up on this game?So maybe this game is fun as some people say, I don't know because it just doesn't work.

												Play a glowing object venting glowing objects out of yourself in every direction of a variety of sizes and colors while more glowing objects hurtle towards you at various speeds.  Giant planets show up sometimes which you  drill through (WHY IS THIS STUPID CRAP I N THE GAME!!?!?! )  as a method to cheaply kill the player. You can upgrade your ship after each randomly generated stage but it doesn't really matter when you get one hit killed by the boss or   by the planetoids or by the weird wall thing that flies into you. EVERYTHING GLOWS,  good things, bad things, random things.    If you like want to play a game like a Michael Bay Transformers film then by all means, 5$ is a smaller price to pay to have no idea what's going on till you  go into a catatonic fuege state and stumble away in a dilerium, begging for the sweet release of death.

												It's wild, colorful, disorienting, and hard to tell what's happening half the time. It's also dirt cheap when on sale and plenty of fun despite its drawbacks. Also, there is an option to turn that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ narrator off. You know, the one that insults you whenever you die. I don't know why the developers felt the need to include him, but the voicing just makes the game seem pretentious. Here's the breakdown: It's a solid twin stick bullet-hell(ish) shooter with great music and wild colors that is often on sale for next to nothing. Hell, I got it for free in a promotion. Movement and shooting is slick and simple, the drilling mechanic (where you have to sacrifice the ability to shoot in order to drill through oncoming solid objects) is interesting and well-executed, though the game would be just as good without it, and the music is great. The only downsides are the narrator and the fact that it's easy to lose track of what's going on. One minute you're blasting away at a boss, when suddenly all the colors invert without any indication as to what triggered it, nor does it seem to change the gameplay at all. Other times your projectiles (and those of your enemies) will travel agonizingly slowly, or blindingly fast, with no indication of what triggered this change. Sometimes you get a big laserbeam that lasts for a few seconds and obliterates everything, again with no indication of what triggered it. The screen is often packed with so much activity that it's hard to tell who's an enemy or what they do, and the best strategy becomes ""fire wildly and hope for the best"".But whatever. Psychedelic color schemes, boopin' music, and the ability to pick it up and play for 10-20 minutes at a time make it worth whatever pocket change you spend on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can experience all the bosses and events because they pop up randomly. It's pretty chill and fun for a bullet hell game really. Bullet Heaven, one might say.There isn't a whole ton of stuff in it, but there is certainly 7 dollars worth of content. I enjoy it, and you get steam trading cards that you can sell if you want.

												It's a bullet-hell shoot-em-up with awesome effects, satisfying to beat bosses and a funny narrator (favorite quote: Let's shoot some baddies!). In this game you'll be shouting ""Ima fiiiring my laisooooor!"" a couple of times. It also has a couple of interesting random events and an in-game shop for the classic mode where you can make yourself a beast of a tiny ship. Great game (at least for me...) 8/10 \(^_^)/			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has no substance. It's its biggest flaw, and a major one. It has about... I don't know, a combined total of about 15 minutes' worth of content, randomized infinitely to pad out the gameplay. Different game modes add little to the variety.The music is good, - really good sometimes, even; I really appreciated Mike Smith's contributions to the soundtrack, - and the graphics are... well, flashy and sometimes the colorful chaos is enjoyable to watch, I'll give it that. However, it turns out it was a _terrible_ idea on Boss Baddie's part not to try and make enemy bullets and other hazards extra visible and perhaps unaffected by all the graphical distortion effects going on and particle effects flying by, obscuring your vision. As the game's difficulty increases and the screen becomes cluttered with all sorts of randomized junk, it becomes nigh-impossible to tell what's going on, and what hurts you and what doesn't - and it is entirely the game developers' fault.The feeling of being utterly confused is fun for a while, but gets old rather quick, like Mister Pineapple's comments heard throughout the game. (He has about 20-30 lines he says from time to time, those can be turned off once they get repetitive.)There are numerous other shortcomings that I'm not going to discuss in detail, because while a bit annoying, they can be overlooked and the game can still be enjoyed to an extent in spite of them. (resolution locked at 720p, restricted aiming with the mouse, game rules are not explained clearly enough, the library only provides vague descriptions instead of pictures of objects in the game, often making it even harder to figure out what exactly it describes, expo mode in the options, game always crashing upon exiting)I don't think you can get more than about 6-7 hours of entertainment out of the game, and that's really stretching it. Unless maybe you have some friends to play the game with - I asked a friend to play with me, but I showed a gameplay video to him and he refused, turned off by the chaos on the screen. Your Mileage May Vary, I'm pretty sure Boss Baddie stated at some point that their game was designed primarily for co-op with up to 3 others and should be played on a machine with a good sound system, with the bass turned up a couple notches.I mean, all in all Really Big Sky is kinda okay, definitely playable to a degree, a solid 4/10 if I had to grade it on a scale, but I'd say forget the game and just buy the rather awesome soundtrack if you can get it somewhere (and then turn up the bass), or risk getting RBS if your friends are willing to give it a shot as well.

												Really big sky is a 2d space shooter with a high amount of difficulty.In this game you control a tiny worthless ship and your objective is survive the longest you can, every time you finish your round by either dying or.... dying you will have a upgrade menu in order to increase your firepower, have claymores , better shields , better handling, etc making the game somewhat easier each time , but once you max your upgrades you can get elite ones which also make the game more difficulty for extra challenge.There's several game modes to play boss rush , naked mode (no upgrades), timed you can only live 2 minutes but resets on death, easy mode infinite lives, etc.The only lack is the amount of bosses and how at some parts the game drops a ton of fps due to bad optimization.Pretty cheap game and it gets on discounts quite often must have for people addict to challenging games.

												I got this game from the Bundle Stars Giveaway and it turned about to be much more than i had anticipated. Very simple to learn, but always leaves you with a challenge. Super addicting game, and also insanely colorful! i would give it a 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
