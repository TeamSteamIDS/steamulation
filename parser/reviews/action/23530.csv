												""You're it until you're dead or I find someone better!""Spiders and ticks and ants, OH MY! Where do I start? Bugs, guns, some kind of invisible wall? Seriously fun game that doesn't take itself too serious. This game is well worth the full price.A third person shooter that's easy to pick up and as fun to play solo as it is with friends. Select one of four unique armors, choose from over 200 weapons, and get ready to kick some major bug butt.Once on the field, the commentary between allies and the tips provided by the higher ups will have you laughing everytime.As for those that typically avoid ports for their many faults and issues, you'll find none of that here. Outside of one spelling error this game is near flawless. Complete key binding, full controller support, and satasfactory graphics settings.So click 'ADD TO CART' and join team lightning today!

Sure!Like Killing Bugs With a MIRV Missile? It's here!Aaand many more!When Ameican Studios Touch Japanese games, They tend to make it WORSE (Take example of Ace combat Assault horizon, it makes the Ace combat look like ""Call of duty in skies"" They messed up too much, and especially Too many DLCs) But this one, Not many has changed....I'm impressed.The Campaign is fun, but it's more fun if you're with your friend! And no tutorial needed, You proably know how an FPS Work, So yeah, BLAST THEM TO PIECES!Although The gun sounds are quite decent, graphics are decent, almost everything is decent, But they're similliar to Sandlot's (The makers of the Japanese EDF games) EDF Games.PROS-FAST PACED INTENSE ACTION-LOTS OF BUGS! (Litterally!)-MANY WEAPONS!-CHEESY DIALOUGES!-EVERYTHING YOU SEE CAN BE DESTROYED!-UNIQUE WEAPONS!CONS-Gun Sounds are....Okay, but not good.-The soundtrack Needs to Be LOUDER- Weapon World  models are kinda limited- Kinda Feels ""Lonely""- Multiplayer Seems Dead.9/10 WOULD BUY!!AND PORT THE OTHER EDF TO PC!

												People like to complain that this game is inferior to the rest of the series, i dont think soIt might not share the same sense of scale with 2017 and 2025 - where everything is gigantic and comes in stupid numbers -  but its still a fun game. Also it isn't as cheesy and funnyI like the different classes, although they play differently they're fun and fairly easy to get around with, unlike 2025 where you get your @ss kicked if you play with anything other than the base class (at least at first). There's plenty of different weapons, each one with advantages and disadvantages that will keep you hooked, looking for the best combo.I dont like that it takes so long to level up a class to the max, and the campaign could be longer.Overall is a fun game, and if you like 3rd person shooters you might like it			",2258,930,98,295,279,35,400

												Thanks to a certain Swede, I have to make a better review.EDF was originally released as a Simple series game like Puzzle Quest. The Simple series was relatively cheap and varied wildly in quality. This is the first and only game in the series that wasn't developed by Sandlot.It's an FPS where you shoot giant bugs with various weapons while wearing power armor with various abilities.There's also a bad end which my friends and I got after our playthrough.All in all, pretty fun. A nice gem and definitely underappreciated. I'd recommend checking out the other games in the series.			",415,42,6,41,48,4,72

												Looking for a cheap game that is a blast to play? Do you like killing gigantic monsters and aliens that take up your whole screen? Then get this game. It's definitely worth the price it's at and extremely fun but I'd recommend bringing a friend or two along and take note that the co-op is only 3 players. But the wave defense mode can go up to 6. All in all if playing as cool looking soldiers with four different classes who kill gigantic alien bugs and huge bosses. All while having an epic arsenal at your hands sounds fun, then this is definitely the game for you. It does only have three chapters with 5 decently lengthed missions each in them so the game itself is kinda short but definitely does have some replayability like the different difficulties. I'd recommend starting on normal but after you get your characters leveled up boost it up to the next ones and try playing again. The game becomes much more challenging almost dreadfully so. I give it an 8/10.			",657,159,20,63,63,7,66

												Blowing up giant insects, while destroying buildings for the good of humanity with multiple explosions is always fun. However, for fans of the series, this will leave you with a bitter taste in the mouth, as it's nowhere as fun or as long as the other games of the series - some could even say that it's somewhat unfinished. Instead of giving you a lot of missions, they've replaced it with an equipment grind-fest and missions that are nowhere near as epic as the ones from previous games - heck, there's not even an ""EDF! EDF!"" chant anywhere to be found. In any case, it's still a good introduction to the series, if only to make you want to play the other games, so pick it up if it's on sale, or something.

												It's nothing groundbreaking nor praise worthy, but gosh darn it, it sure is fun as hell.  You are pitted against endless amounts of ants, tarantulas, ticks, and more because they are trying to end all life on the earth. I mean, come on. That sounds awesome, and it is. The story is lame, but the game play is pretty solid.  I really liked the different classes that had differing strengths and abilities. It adds a bit more flavor to game. Oh, and don't get me started on the arsenal. It's overwhelming. A plethora of weapons from , If I am correct, around six categories.  Now imagine all that, but with friends. It's a damn good time. The co-op adds so much more fun and I loved the survival mode. Literally endless amounts of bugs versus you and whoever you wish to tag along. And as for bugs, I encountered millions (haha get it? Humor). But the bugs that ruin a game? I encountered none. It ran smoothly and nothing hindered me from enjoying the game. It's cheap, fun action. $10 is a steal of a price, so if it goes on sale pick it up instantly. It might BUG you if you don't (I'm funny). Oh, and if you like weapons be sure to pick the DLC as well because it adds more of them which is always a good time.			",371,58,4,49,2,1,15

												When i was much younger, me and my brother were terrible at picking games. we picked the no rep, ""meh"" review games that werent popular. we didnt care. We picked the game based on the cover. Lo and behold one day we got our grubby hands on EDF 2017. we both together spent at least 300 hours on the game. we never beat it on inferno. that being said, I was excited for this game to come out. after quite a few hours of play, i have come up with two reviews. first one is for long time EDF players, second is for newcomers to the franchise, behold the reviews underneath.Newcomer reviewPros:-giant bugs to shoot and kill-many different unique weapons, including some useless unique ones-four classes each with their own unique weapos. perks, and skills-robots-not your average shooter-funny comentary-good replay value-WTF these weapons are so cool and ""weird""! they are not your usual shooter gunsCons-gameplay may be repetative especially if you use the same weapons over and over-30 fps lock-cant use all weapons with all classes-short storyLong time EDF playersPros-nostalgia-new enemies-new mapsCons Okay, before i get into cons, these are for those who specifically want that old nostalgic feel. there will be a lot-classes. you cant use all weapons with all classes and it loses that feeling of you being just a soldier amongst the ranks-weapons arent that unique compared to 2017. no assult rifles that have 999 rounds, about as accurate as a political campaign and deals massive damage. no more 100m blast radius rockets. etc.-hectors dont flinch. i used to spray them just to keep the bullets away, now all you can do is run-wasps. f*cking wasps. all they do is fly so fast they give you a headache and they have lots of health.-ant hills dont die after shooting them. you have to plant bombs. bloody annoying when you have 150 ants around you squirting acid and your plant gets reset.-vehicles are garbage, but even worse than 2017 garbage-explosions hurt you. no more running into the center of the explosion to pick up the weapons crate-what a terrible campaign. so short, story is terrible, and levels arent unique. no underground, no beach, just city maps.overall, great game for newcomers to the series. if you play the game you will LOVE it, but then will wonder just how much better the others can be. if you have an xbox, i recommend you pick up 2017 immediately.

												I'm a big fan of EDF 2017 on 360 and Global Defence Force on ps2 but I can't really recommend this one.First complaint, no split screen co-op. I ended up buying 2 copies during a sale so my gf and I could play together.Second, lame tone/aesthetic. This game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software, a western developer who, from what I can tell, has never made a decent game.  They took the kaiju tone of the originals and tried to turn it into a meathead military game. Gone is the simplicity of shooting and diving. Gone are the slightly too loud sound effects of picking up power-ups and navigating the menus. Gone are the physics that result in bouncing ant carcasses. Gone is the awful dialogue spouted by your fellow soldiers, well maye not gone but not as enjoyably terrible. The missions are longer and this may appeal to some but I prefer the plentiful bite size missions of the previous games.It's just a let down. They managed to take the awesome concept of ""shoot giant insects"" and get it wrong. I didn't think it was possible.			",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Made by a different team than EDF 2017, 2025 & 4.1.  The American made Earth Defence Force Insect Armageddon is still a fun crazy third person shooter that likens itself to Sandlot's EDF series with its own unique flare.It's not as insane as the other EDF titles, or as difficult. It's a bit easier to slide on into, and most of the other classes perform better off the bat than 2025/4.1.  It does require a considerable amount of grind just like the other EDF titles.The campaign is relatively short, but for 10 bucks, it has a lot of fun to be had. It's not as good as the other EDF titles, but it's not bad either. It's worth owning if you like EDF.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never played a EDF game before and I heard of it being watered down and not as good as its japanese counter parts, This is the first American made Earth Defense Force! Thus, I thought this would be a good introduction to the game franchise!It was! I had so much fun playing this game. Its like a third person Serious Sam! Run and Gun down millions of enemies down. that keep bum rushing you so much that even the strongest of soothing anal cream would not suffice! You got to endure the onsluaght, and hope for the best!You get 4 armor sets. I love playing as Tactical, Spamming sentries and SMG gun fire! One thing I noticed is the difficulty is sporadic! Missions can be downright easy, but when replaying the same mission it would be difficult as hell! Very random outcomes and I dont know what to think of this. It keeps me on my toes but sometimes a relaxing smooth mission to level up would be nice!Speaking of leveling up, this game is almost MMO levels with all the grinding!! Which kind of bores me a bit but overall? I can recommend it! It's a nice little game to pass the time.  ",202,8,1,11,5,1,2

												It's low budget and silly, but it's also a ton of fun. You fight hundreds of giant bugs and aliens with hilariously overpowered weapons (I saw two AI squad members hit an ant withthe shotgun at the same time, the force of impact sent the ant flyng over 300 meters in the air, it's hilarious) and are capable of destroying every single building and object on the map (with no negative consecuences!).Sure, it's repetitive, but it's got some cool touches and it's mindless, chaotic fun. Destroying an alien carrier ship and watching slowly come down to the ground, smashing every building on its way never gets old.			",235,18,31,12,12,0,10

												This game is pure chaos.  Missiles and acid spit flying everywhere, explosions that clear 4 city blocks every time you fire.The online co-op works just fine and is a lot of fun.  Several classes to choose from.  I think they did a good job maintaining most of the cheesy lines and feel of it all that's within the series.If you play levels on harder difficulties you have a chance for even better gear.  Slow at first, but picks up fast when you get a good couple of items.  Personally I really like the heavy class.  Hold up a shield and fire a missile at your feet to explode everything around you?

												Loads of simple, replayable fun. The campaign is short, but the four classes and large variety of weapons and equipment to choose from makes missions a joy to revisit. The graphics are dated but perform well. Animations are smooth and the game hardly slows down with tons of crap on the screen. I recently purchased this game through Steam, and boy, online is dead. I haven't tried to play the campaign co-op, but I could not find a single person to play survival. This is a shame because this is clearly a game designed around co-op play. Your AI squad mates in the campaign are competent, but things would go so much more smoothly if I had a human player or two. The survival mode is a wave defense game type that is also highly replayable. The downside here is, unlike the campaign where you have multiple classes, you can only choose one class for survival - the trooper. You can still equip him with the trooper specific unlocks you acquire for him during the campaign, but why the developers chose to limit class selection for this game type is beyond me. It severely detracts from the game's lifespan. Since this game has been out for a while, I'm beyond hoping they will patch it in. If you have some friends to play with or are simply dying for some chaotic old school shooter mayhem, pick this one up.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												I really wish I could recommend this.But I cant. If you've ever played any of the EDF's that were developed from Japan, you can see why I cannot recommend this. Not enough enemies, no enemies interaction, no physic reaction, no slowdown, no cool weapons. It feels as stale as any american Third Person Shooter unfortunately. Play EDF 2017, EDF 2025, and Global Defence Force. None of them are available on PC unfortunately, but please check those out instead, I think you'll have 2000000x more fun playing them than this.

												This game is okay at the very least.Pros:Class SystemBigger than life enemiesLots of enemiesCons: End mission was crappy and dull. There was no final boss. Just repeats of old enemies you already fought.I hope you love running to a spot then sitting there to defend it for over 10 minutes. It doesn't have the free-roam element like it did in Earth Defense Force 2017. In EDF 2017 you could choose where you wanna go first while clearing the map. While in this EDF you just about go to an area, kill things, then go to the next spot on the map & hold. This is the entire game.There wasn't all that much enemy diversification. Instead of making new enemies, it just threw the same old enemies at you. Sure, EDF 2017 did that as well but it was to a lesser extent.I felt like it was a rather short game. It only took my friend & me 5 hours to beat on normal mode.End Thesis:If you're a fan and lover of old EDF games like Earth Defense Force 2017, get ready to be severely disappointed. If not, this game might be for you, if you don't mind the cons that is.			",86,3,0,9,7,2,24

												5.2/10 A sad off-shoot of a loved title.EDF has a bit of a following, and to gift those folk with this game could be considered an offence. However for those who have not had the chance yet to experence EDF, you will not exactly be blown away with this one. Unfortunately it lacks immersion, gameplay, graphics, optimisation, sound, weapon quality, enemy AI and general quality, and thats just the top of the iceberg. It's whole foundation compared to the rest of the franchise is just dripping wet with nonsense.You may think this then to be a negative review, and typically you would be right, but I still had fun playing it. Still had fun bringing down the bosses, still had fun collecting the weapons and leveling up and still had fun rolling through the game again after completing it. Ultimately I have to recommend this title even with it's flaws as it still anchors onto the EDF franchise and there is a smidge of amusement to squeeze out if you want it.In summary, Earth Defence Force: Insect Armageddon is a title that under-shot it's potential to be a good game, and landed firmly in the OK camp. It's OK, it's fine, just dont expect too much.			",130,30,3,18,14,0,8

												This game is one of the MOST under rater shooters of our time. It doesn't have the best graphics, no... But why in the hell should that matter if your looking for a FANTASTIC game. The game revolves around big♥♥♥♥♥alien bugs and machines, massive explossions that can and WILL level every building in sight. The bugs are BIG, BAD, and they SWARM. If there was ever an enemy that uses it's numbers to overwhelm you, this is it.There are 4 main classes, and ALL of them are unbeleivably well balanced. Want a Jet pack? Check. How about a heavy with an energy sheild that absorbs damage, shocks enemies, and if surrounded detonates a small nuke? Check. Or how about a sniper who can massicare the massive swarm of enemies from afar without ever smelling them? Check... or how about your average Joe soldier who just HAPPENS to be able to hold every kind of weapon imaginable? Check.The weapons... oh the weapons. So many weapons and gun turrets and oh, did I mention they have tanks? No? Well they do... and sometimes, you will need them. BAD. especially when your up against enemies that are a little over 15 stories tall and shoot lazers out their asses while dropping giant jumping spiders who happen to have giant ant friends, that have flying hornet friends... and yest they're also giant... who happen to have flying machines that swarm and suicide bomb you when they're too damaged to fight... who happen to have more friends who are just bigger... and Biggers... and BIGGER... You see where I'm going with this?Oh yes and... there is a rocket launcher that happens to be able to level 6 city blocks... But hey if your not into that sort of fast paced, unforgiving, brutal, and adreniline pumping action with 3 player co-op then hey. I guess this game just isn't for you. You probably couldn't handle Inferno difficulty anyways ;P			",148,19,0,22,33,1,37

												I've played EDF 2017 and 2025 at lenght. I couldn't imagine that they really did something wrong with the PC version (EDF Insect Armagedon) but they messed it up. The other EDF's are large, you have tons of levels and 4 difficulty to repeat. You find constantly armor to improve health and at least a dozen weapons per level. Not in EDF Insect Armagedon. I played it through within 3 hours (first of 3 difficulties)! You find weapons but only from special monsters (just a view per level if at all) and you have to unlock them with experience points. Additionally all weapons of the same kind (rocket launcher, assault rifle ...) look identically. No matter if your rocket launcher shoots one missle or 10 homing missle at once: it looks the same (this is different in the other EDF). The exciting item hunt where you felt like a real badass got a lame and boring game. I guess fans of the series still have some fun in multiplayer but the game cant compete with its brothers on xbox360 and ps3. Very sad.PS: My mother language is not english so ignore the errors.

												This is a pretty good time if you can get it cheap. It's not a 'real' EDF game as it was outsourced to an entirely different studio halfway across the world but thankfully they understood enough to keep things goofy. The biggest departure from the Sandlot EDFs is this game's modern Western mission structure where it's all waypoints and overt setpieces as well as the odd (infuriating) linear vehicle segment. It kind of made me realize the canon EDFs are a lot better designed than they typically get credit for as they manage to get a lot of these moments to happen organically (like, in IA there will be an anthill and a prompt for you to stick a bomb on after which a counter starts running and you have to deflect waves of insects until it blows. In canon EDF there would just be an anthill with bugs streaming out so you end up deciding for yourself to wade in and destroy it so they'll stop coming. The end result is remarkably similar)Anyway until one of the proper EDFs gets a PC port this isn't a bad way to scratch that itch.			",337,101,31,77,50,5,48

												I don't get the negativity for this game.  It seems like people generally think this was a bad entry into the franchise, but I haven't seen the problems.The game is about 20 minutes of new and unique content, interspersed with immense amounts of grind.  You get more powerful weapons with credits and random drops.  You need more powerful weapons and higher levels as missions proceed, because the difficulty curve is wildly inconsistent and enemies become bullet sponges very quickly.  Thus, to proceed you get to the point where you grind early levels for the credits and random drops required to progress.  To my understanding that is the series formula.The AI is terrible, and often suicidally runs into combat.  The enemies aren't challenging, but they tend to attack in the middle of reloading animations and double the time they take.  The achievements are...frustrating time sinks.  I think the worst part of this game is that you have to grind through it an immense amount of times, because the separate classes all require experience building and the purchase of new weapons to make them viable.All of this said, the game is good stupid fun.  Grab a couple of friends, spend an afternoon grinding, and completely forget about the game two days later.  It costs less than some movie tickets, doesn't aspire to being something high concept or avant garde, and revels in stupidity (if you beat the last level on the highest difficulty you'll know exactly what I mean. All in all it's a good game.  Not great, deeply flawed, buggy for a long time (the radar function was enabled my default for the longest time, removing the need for the support unit's special ability), but satisfyingly shallow and fun.  Maybe 4.1 will be better, but I can't really say I'm unhappy about this game.			",147,17,0,13,4,1,19

I don't know what happened, But 16 hours passed.Don't get it if you want a good story.

												Before I get into the game's problems, I would like to say what's good about it. Shooting games where you fight giant insects is a rarity, so points for a concept that hasn't been explored much. The game aslo has a grand sense of scale, with huge buildings getting destroyed as collateral in the fights and huge boss-type foes that are taller than lots of the buildings themselves. It also usually introduces a new enemy or a new vehicle every mission (at least for a while). Although far from a perfectly implemented, the game also gives the player several classes with their own abilities, and the ability to change your gun loadout between missions. However, this game has a number of problems. First, it is extremely repetitive. There is very little variance in mission objectives. It's always go here, kill all the constantly spawning enemies, repeat. There's little in terms of varied environments; Where you are on the map has almost no effect on how any given situation is approached. Combat is also repetitive, with waves and waves of the same four enemy types with an occasional bullet sponge boss. Waves of enemies tend to go on for entirely too long, and I found myself wishing for a change of scenery halfway through most of the firefights. As mentioned, most of the bosses are bullet sponges, not particularly difficult to defeat, but it takes a very very long time. Only occasionally are boss battles fun.The system of armor classes and unlockable weapons is a nice thought, but it is poorly implemented. Weapons can be found on the battlefield, usually after killing some boss monster. However, weapons are also divided into tiers, and even after collected can only be unlocked via leveling up the armor class that uses said weapon. The problem with this is that it can take too long to level up. If you change your armors for the sake of varying the gameplay, level ups are few and far in between, so the weapons you pick up become unused, and the enemies become increasingly durable (the game uses skin swapped versions of some enemies with more health later in the game). Either the game becomes repetitive because it gradually  takes more time to kill enemies or it becomes repetitive by sticking to the same class. Overall, the game has some good ideas, but most are not very well implemented. Some people might find enjoyment from this game, but the giant bug novelty isn't enough to salvage the gameplay			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only get this game if you know for sure you've got friends who want to play it. It's just a terrible single player experience. I bought it primarily because I wanted a single player game where I slaughter waves of enemies, and hence my review is from that perspective. I could see how this game could be very fun with a few friends.pros- the armor classes look cool       - when it's not being unfair it can be very fun       - some humor and funny lines that will make you laugh       - A lot of content for a game of this pricecons- Weapons look way to similar, and have names you can't possibly remember and look nearly identical (even the icons) meaning it's easier to just remember what ammo/damage the weapon did if you want to swap in and out. (a minor issue but still irritating) -Constantly unfair meaning you'll die too often not from hordes of insects, but from a single powerful blow from one of the stronger enemies, that wipes half your half.-Many of the machines that spawn other enemies take too long to die. It's not difficult to survive, they simply take way too long to die which gets old very fast.-Friendly AI is just pathetic and love to run in front of you while you're unleashing a barrage of grenades/missiles which ends up damaging you from the proximity to the blast.-when the 'ticks' latch on to you, you need to mash E (or whatever you have it set to) I really wish games wouldn't do this, I have no interest in wearing out my keyboard (another minor point)Summary: it's not the worst game ever, I didn't enjoy my time for the most part so that's why I don't recommend, but I would say to anyone who knows a friend who wants to play it or already has it, for 11$ it's not bad and I would recommend it.

I mean what I dislike about it most is there isnt even halp the missions as the old one, not even close. Just by the old one its only like 5$ for xbox, or just buy the newer EDF 2025, its JUST LIKE the old one just better waaay better. But I like them the same, there both sooooooo much fun.

												I picked this up upon hearing that EDF 4.1 was coming to Steam, and I wanted to try out the gameplay, I'm glad I did, this game was extremely entertaining. The gameplay is simple but satisfying. You pick one of 4 characters, equip some weapons, and kill tons of enemies. Think Serious Sam only as a 3rd person shooter.  You usually have certain objectives to complete in game although they aren't complicated, mostly a way to get you to move to a different area. There are also plenty of vehicles and turrets to help you. The game looks nice for a 7th gen game, but in my opinion the sound mixing is a little off, so you may want to tinker a bit in the menu. A good 360 port overall though. You might think fighting tons of enemies might get boring, but the action stays engaging. The game is pretty short however, there are 15 levels but different difficulties. Don't just jump into the highest difficulty however. You need to get weapons during the level, which you then buy using in game money you earn from missions. Your character level and weapons carry over which is how you survive on higher difficulties. It's a bit grindy but the gameplay is fun you won't notice. The biggest issue is probably the larger enemies which can get bullet spongey. FIghting huge enemies and carriers can get a bit repetitive, even if you're at a decent level. Overall a really fun, albeit short shooter. It has it's flaws but at it's price I'd recommend it for some mindless fun.			",145,16,1,7,6,0,2

												Earth Defence Force: Insect Armageddon is a tremendously fun game if you can overlook some of its minor flaws. The storyline may not be on the same level of the Bioware epics and graphics aren’t top notch, but the core ethos of the game (shooting at a horde of aliens twice your size) never gets old. In terms of actual gameplay you are given a choice of four classes that you can level up during missions, which will allow you to unlock new weaponry that will help you defeat even larger and more impressive foes. This is a brilliantly crafted little game. Try it out!			",15,1,0,8,3,0,14

												Returned to this after trying 4.1. Personally found this much more fun and playable 'out of the box' - where it falls down IMO is in holding your interest in the long term. Pros and cons below.What I liked:- very fun to pick up and play 'out of the box'- nice variety of classes to suit different playstyles- all classes feel fun to play from the start- controls for each class 'feel' right (and are fully customisable)- more of a gritty 'Starship Troopers' aesthetic for the suits than the anime look of 4.1 (personal preference)- good variety of weapons for each class (and fun to use) - but a bit limited within tiers (see below)- amusing dialogue (though this does get old)What I didn't like:- huge amount of grinding for xp and cash at higher tiers - despite the fun gameplay, I suspect that a lot of people would eventually get bored and stop playing before reaching the final tier given the limited choice of missions (see below).- very limited number of missions compared to say 4.1 - makes the above grinding feel more 'grindy', even with the 'Remix' option- most of the missions are pretty long - and you have to complete them to get any reward - again, not very friendly for the amount of farming/grinding required to progress at higher tiers.- lack of variety in mission environments- while there are a large number weapons to collect overall, the number for each class within each tier seems quite limited - makes weapon farming less interesting, especially at higher tiers.- only 3 difficulty levels (I think 4.1 has 5)- dumb AI team-mates (though still better than nothing)- 'Survival mode' wasted by only allowing one class and limited weapon choice.- while the a design of the suits and ravagers is nice, the environmental graphics look really basic by today's standards, with really limited graphics options.- TicksWhat I'd like to have seen (perhaps by DLC):- many more missions and environments- many more weapons at higher tiers- updated graphics- a survival mode that allows you to use any of your existing suits and weapons- more randomisation in Remix mode, not just enemy types, but spawn points, objective locations etc.- more enemy types			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh boy...this ♥♥♥♥ing game...well, wrote a Review for EDF4.1, may as well do it here too.In said previous review of Earth Defense Force 4.1, Shadow of New Despair...I said this game was like an American Made Mutation of a fantastic Japanese Series. Kind of like how we tried to make our own ""Godzilla"" of some kind but called it ""Zilla"" instead, and it apperently sucked. Hard. (Thankfully the original creators bought his Licenseing out, comepletely remade his bio and such, and proceeded to absolutely murder him in the first movie he came in. Or at least that's what I heard.)This game, thankfully, is not EXACTLY like Zilla. It wasn't terrible but...it's still a sort of Black Sheep of the franchise for a good reason. It tries it's best to stay close to the formula of the classic games...but it feels as if it's tried to downgrade most, if not all, of the aspects they tried to stick to. For instance: This game is friggen SHORT. Only around 15 or so different missions for the campaign plus a few Survival Missions which take place in the exact same maps, which is NOTHING compaired to even the Very First EDF Game on the Playstation. To compare, 4.1 has 89 missions in the Solo Campaign, 9 Bonus Missions in the the Multiplayer to make it 98 there, 23 or so missions in the first DLC Pack for the game, and 20+ in the second pack. That's close to TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL MISSIONS to do!Next, it's difficulty. This game only has three to choose from...yeah. JUST THREE. Normal, Hard, and Inferno. Compaired to the norm of EDF, which is FIVE, this is yet ANOTHER downgrade because it makes the game way...WAY less accessable. Say you're a New Player to the game, and you start on Normal. If ya find yourself being a bit challenged on there, say it's actually the first Shooter that you as a Player have gotten into and don't know how to properly play, you could go to Easy and ease yourself a bit slower into it, and work your way to the harder difficulties. That is nowhere near the case here.Another thing I should mention is how the player grows stronger here. In the other games, only your Equipment grows stronger as you collect bits and pieces to up your Arsenal and Armor. Everything else? Depends on YOUR skill. Depends on YOUR Talent. Your reactions, your planning, your aim, everything. It's mostly on YOU to get you through the fights. It's all on your own Experience.Not here. This game goes for a pretty damn basic method of getting you stronger for the fights ahead. You can collect some weapons out in the field when you defeat certain enemies, sure...but for the most part? You're grinding Mission after Mission not to collect gear...but to get more Currency and Experience POINTS. These, respectively, allow you to buy your character more gear, and Level You Up increase your HP Ammount and the weapons available to purchase. To me, this system isn't as Immersive, as Creative, or as FUN as the other games.Speaking of Fun, my next topic is just that. The fact that this game isn't as Fun as the actual EDF Series. Hell, some people (me included) could find this game...kinda boring really. Besides JUST having 15 missions, they don't really even seem to feel any different at all.The Classic EDF Games hold some kind of Magic that keeps every single mission feeling fresh and fun to fight through. It's all fairly Colorful and Vibrant, you can Explore every inch of the map you're given in each mission within it's MASSIVE boundaries, Explosions feel Inherently Satisfying, Bug and Robot corpses litter the battlefield after exploding into Blood or...well just flat out explode to let you see how much you've accomplished...and it all just douses you in Internal Happiness that you simply can't stop,This game? Is almost the complete opposite. Everything is put into more ""realistic"" boring brown filters, Explosions feel like you're shooting Weak♥♥♥♥♥Firecrackers at the Enemy (Classic EDF had BETTER Firecrackers as an ACTUAL WEAPON), The maps are far more linear due to stupid plot reasons (i'll get back to this in a second), the Enemy Corpses disappear as soon as they die, and it's all just so slow and sluggish...it's like you're going through a Daily Slog each and every time you come across a horde of enemies. That's terrible, really.But it gets worse when I move on to My Last and MOST CERTAINLY Least favored aspect of this game: It's story. Oh god, it's story is just...no. THIS aspect is just flat-out ruined, and is the worst part about the game bar-none. Classic EDF had Rediculous Basic. ""Giant Insects and Massive Machines have come to destroy everything we love and hold dear! Here, take this FORT KNOX LEVEL OF GUNS stuffed in your locker, fellow EDF Soldiers with their own funny Dialogue who will dance and Sing with you on command, and an EXTREME amount of PURE HYPE, and go save our world!""This game? STUPID Basic. ""Our mission is to save the world from the threat of Large Bugs and Accompanying Machines. Here is a truck filled with a large arsenal that you can use. You will have two Squad Mates who will follow and assist you in combat, but you can't interact with them even though they have randomized voice lines that aren't interesting. Follow our waypoints, stick to your objectives, follow this linear path because the Ravagers have created Barriers that we can't cross through-"" Ugh, okay yeah. I can't even continue with that...i've made MYSELF uninterested.The worst part is? They actually tried (and failed miserably) to make it a little bit more serious. The Highest Points of it, which really isn't saying much, goes as follows. They build up this mysterious ""Cube"", only for them to say later that it's basically just a really powerful bomb. They activate said Cube to completely destroy a Giant Insect-...oh sorry, they also call THOSE Ravagers here for some stupid reason. They activate it to destroy a RAVAGER Nest, only for their escape chopper to crash and burn, and command says that your team will be ""acceptable losses"". Oh, and the Mothership just appears from out of nowhere at the Final Mission.{Spoilers Ahead}And the Bonus Ending on Inferno...oh GOD the Bonus Ending, just...just don't. It's terrible. It's stupid, it sucked, it was cheesy in a horrible way...it was just terrible. The Normal ending leaves you to question whether or not your team survived an attack from said Mothership after an old friend came in to rescue them via Helicoptor, or died either from the crash or from the explosion of ""The Cube"". So that was at least KIND of interesting. But the Bonus Ending just throws that all away and-...ya know what? No. ♥♥♥♥ it. ♥♥♥♥ IT. I'm NOT even gonna say it! It is not worth your time! Don't even look it up on Youtube! Just...don't!With all that being said however...i'm sure there are some people out there who may enjoy this format of game. There is a Philosophy across this world that, if you search long and hard enough: There IS a game out there that can possibly suit you. This one could very well be yours if you take a look at it yourself.For me however, it was a no-go. My final rating is a 4/10 with a No Recommendation.			",71,7,0,5,4,2,2

												This is a fun solo game, but much more fun if you are playing it with your friends. I've played this game and 2025 back on my ps3, I wish they port 2025 to PC too. Both are good games. But for those who wants to get 100% will have to do lots and lots of grinding. But if you are doing it with some friends, you wont get bored.Pros:- Dynasty Warriors like with guns vs insects.- Various kinds of weapons, shotgun, rifle, rocket launcher, missile, sniper, and the ultimate weapon, pesticide. - Destructible environments- Huge enemies and bosses (some)- Four classes to choose, adds minor to moderate gameplay experience- Friendly fire is always on- EDF!!!Cons:- Tons and tons of friggin grinding to get 100%- ♥♥♥♥ing tickers- Graphics a little bit outdated- Friendly fire is always on- AI is dumb, but good for meat shieldBuy it if you like PvE games, its worth the price and the fun.

												I really wanted to be able to give this one a positive review. Even with the rose-tinted glasses of having played and immensely enjoyed the original EDF. The first had its good and bad points, but it was the good points that salvaged the game's bad ones. Yes, repetative gameplay is pretty much the staple of this series, but it never got too boring because of the campy, B-horror tone, the hilarious enemy physics (dead ants bouncing gloriously into the heavens) and the scale and variety of the creatures.Unfortunately, IA seems to have decided to do away with all that. Gone is the humor. Replaced with a more serious (but still somehow silly) gritty approach. Gone are the physics and the scale. Gone is the variety (well, you get some variety...if you like Spider Type A, B, C. Mix that up with Bee Type A, B, C, etc.). It's nice to have larger maps to explore, but they're hardly inventive or varied enough.  Overall, it was a pretty dissapointing experience.			",226,121,0,21,20,0,10

												So apparently no one reviewing this game prolly has never played EDF 2017 or the newer one probs cause they are console only, but this game is no where near as good as those. First this was made by a DIFFRENT developer than the other EDF games. This game is a mess it takes everything that makes a EDF game and throws it out the window, the way the bullets stop 10 feet infront of you and dissapear the reload system blows its a Gear of War type of system. The way you get new weponds suck in the other EDF games you get random drops for killing the bugs and stuff and you get new ones that way it was cool cause there was over 150 of them. This game alot lacks scale the levels and super small not to mention the destruction sucks and its really just overall a buggy game, do yourself a favor and buy a 360 and play EDF 2017 or get 2025 for 360 and PS3 you will see what i mean.

May not be that popular now, since 4.1 is out, so you may be falling back on your friends because forget pubs. Getting the achievements will be a major chore aswell.Pros:-Good, clean fun-Lots of arcade valueCons:-Not the best looking game, not even for its time-Tends to get a little annoyingly difficult at times (solo play)			",321,87,0,34,31,2,24

												Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon is the only American game in the series, and so naturally they totally misunderstood the camp and replaced it with HOO-RAH military dickwaving.That aside, it added a bunch of features that were later totally ripped off by Sandlot in 2025; as expected of the creativity-devoid Japanese. Unfortunately they also added a heap of pointless grinding and forgot to include about 40 or so missions that are clearly missing from the very much unfinished game.I give Insect Armageddon 4,000 ants shy of a hill.

												Being an owner of EDF 2017, I grabbed this game during the Summer 2014 sale. The game overall is good, but not worth the price of full admission, and here is why:Pros+Graphics+Engine+Keyboard/Mouse & Controller support+Online Co-Op+4 Different Player ClassesCons-Very Short Game-Singular setting (no Fields, Undeground, Metropolis variants, or Beach settings-Not Giant Mechas/Godzillas-Certain weapons are tied to certain ClassesOk, so overall the game is NOT as good as EDF 2017. Sure, the game looks great, but the designs are highly ""western"". They've removed those chromed Hectors and flying ships (like in 1950s sci-fi movies) for more Americanized grimdark enemies. Very little color in the game at times, ants and spiders practically blend into the Detroit setting (which is the ONLY setting). You play a very short amount of levels in city that looks the same. No green fields with small buildings, no ravines, no beach areas, no different city changes, no underground missionss.It plays like EDF, it sort of looks like EDF, but honestly its not worth the current 9.99 price of admission. If you can get it for 4.99, go for it if you're wanting some gun-and-run action. I would not recommend this to 1st timers, but a fan of the series might enjoy it.			",156,35,2,2,4,3,19

												I was sceptical; Its a console port from an not well known studio.But this game really suprised me, its a bit like Serious Sam, but with Bugs and Aliens.You cant approach this game with high expectations, because then it will not deliver.The graphics are surley not awesome or great, they do their job neverthless.This is a solid port all in all, keys can be reassigned, resolutions can be set. Framerate seems to be capped, not good, but with all the action youre probably too busy to notice it. I encountered no crashes or technical problems... but millions of BUGS ;)Its addicting, you unlock weapons and levels for your class. You can play the campagin and a survival mode, off- and online with online co-op. (havent tried online yet).If you are looking for cheap, mindless action, lots of explosions, the ability to flatten whole cities and kill tons of bugs and aliens - this is it.No thinking, planning or strategy... Just you, lots of guns and the Bugs.			",3866,1553,168,488,656,65,666

												If you like tps and 60's campy horror films then is a must have! Blasting tons of giant insects and spaceships could not be more fun. Best if played with a friend or two, EDF: IA is a very fun way to kill time (and bugs!). Besides the typical campaign mode found in most games, EDF: IA also has a weapons & armor unlocking system and survival mode which pits you against wave after wave of enemies, played solo or with others online. For the current price, EDF: IA is a steal.Some aspects of the game are better than EDF 4.1. I personally enjoy leveling up which isn't present in 4.1. I also like the grity graphics compared to the more anime style of 4.1. Its all about what your taste is but EDF: IA is a worthy spin on the series. Overall I like 4.1 a little better but I play both, depending on what mood I'm in because they play differently.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												sorry guys.  i really wanted to like this game.  i mean i REALLY REALLY wanted to like this game.  i have been an EDF fan since GDF days.  i thought, how hard could it really be to make an EDF game?  even i know the formula, these developers surely couldn't have messed it up.how to make EDF game1. fill stupidly large area with large amounts of generic destructible objects, i.e. rocks, buildings, etc.2. put bugs or robots or aliens or something on the map - lots of them, like wayyyy too many3. make tons of weapons of radically varying levels of actual usefulness and cram them in4. create mission scenarios that are all as vague as humanly possible cuz they are all the exact same: kill everything5. crank all engine physics up into the red, then do it again 2x for good measurejust like that, i've made a good EDF game.  so what went wrong here?EDF is not an action 3rd person shooter series.  it is sooo slow, missions are mind-numbingly long, it's repetitive beyond all reason and you never really feel like you've made any progress in the games because nothing has changed.  you're doing the exact same thing you were 2 missions ago.  literally - nothing has changed.  it has a heavy hypnotic, zen-like quality to it - clearing a massive map is simple but tedious, and there is a special kind of old school arcade pleasure in glancing at your minimap occassionally to see the field of red dots slowly thin.in insect armageddon, they have forgone that slower pace, and put in it's place a weird checkpoint system where enemies come in individual waves.  they made a decision to have the bodies ""vaporize"" instead of just explode into the distance - a damn shame considering the gonzo physics has always been a huge draw for these games.  the cheeky humor is intact, although they went for more starship troopers than godzilla.  the guns definitely blow stuff up.  but it just doesn't hit the spot, not for a long-time EDF fan anyways. if you're looking to scratch that meditative, map-clearing arcade itch, i highly recommend just picking up Lost Planet: Extreme Condition instead if you don't own it already.  it's not the same as an EDF game and hopefully one day we'll get a real one here but for now it'll have to do.

												Disclaimer~ I have played this more on the PS3 version of gameI've heard so many negative things about this game. This is odd, because the reviews are very positive on the Steam page. The negativity seems to be very similar to what Duke Nukem Forever struggled with. Players that remember the previous titles wanted a specific experience the new one didn't deliver on. Like Duke Nukem Forever, this game isn't actually that bad as long you judge it for itself rather than the others. I have not played the previous title of Earth Defense Force. I can only say that my experience with this title was simply positive. Do I think this is the best thing since gravy? No. I will say this was a better Starship Troopers game than the actual Starship Troopers game. The gameplay is okay. It's not too slow, it feels like it's actiony enough for it to be arguably be considered fast paced. While it is fun at first, I will say that the weapons you start with get very dull after awhile. All the enemies you fight, they have a lot of health. This causes you to resent yourself for choosing any of the fully automatic weapons later in the game. The solution is to have slower rate of fire weapons or missile based weapons. It gets more tedious, however, when you start unlocking the good weapons that hit the targets for you by heat seeking them. You could literally aim at the sky and the missiles will figure out the rest for you. This basically means that you don't even have to play the game anymore to play the game. This is sad, because I feel it could be very gun to combat against enemies with a variety of firepower instead of feeling I have to use specific type of weapons. I cannot help but feel a simple solution would be to just make each weapon have different strengths and weaknesses rather than just saying ""these are the best weapons, you unlock them later.""The player can also pick classes of soldier, which is an interesting touch. There is one with a jetpack, another that's compensating speed for other perks, etc. You can pick based on your playstyle. Downside when playing online? The fastest player gets all the kills and all the tanks sorta just show up late to the party, thus you can argue you're being punished for picking the armor class soldier. Though, not as punishing as being the one guy that picks a cannon based weapon while the other players spam rockets into the sky and hits everything in the area.The enemy diversity isn't drastically huge, it's pretty limited. It isn't so small that you will get bored right away, but it does tarnish replay value. That's the same with the actual missions, they're all the same. The game just doesn't feel interesting as far as goals or purpose. You sorta just play to kill.Online has some expected choices, such as survival. It's okay, it's not super enjoyable because of the weapons once again as earlier mentioned. The main attraction is just coop for the main game, the ""story"" I guess we'll call it. Overall, it's a positive experience. It's an okay game, kinda like how some B-Movies are an okay movie. You might not play that movie a whole lot, you'll watch it every time and again. This game? I beaten it on PS3 for single player and never touched it since. I have a hard time wanting to play it on PC. I do think $10 is worth it, but maybe even wait for a sale.6/10Pros-Cheap game, good experienceGameplay is pretty fun and exciting at first. Some variety of player customization, such as weapons and character classYou fight giant bugsYou get what you paid for.Cons-Replay value is lowGameplay is pretty lacking for the long term, it's like a firework. Exciting at first, then you realized you've spent some money on something for very temporary satisfaction that could have gone elsewhere.The game feels lacking and empty as far as content goes, even though I cannot figure out as to why. Some weapons are poorly balanced, some are easily spammed and take any skill out of the game, thus all the satisfaction of playing. Ruins the game for other players as well that don't get to kill anything because of their power.6/10. A positive experience. Not a bad game, but not great.			",648,117,18,55,55,7,71

												Single Player: 4 (Tedious repetative and overly difficult late game)Multiplayer: 6 (Any shooter is better with other humans)LAN Multiplayer: 9 (Fantastic fun when you are able to organically interact with the other players)Fantastic Game to play with a group of friends, not incredibly well polished, and generic in a lot of ways, but still enjoyable. The different classes are all distinct in terms of special abilities, but the differences between the different classes' weapons are sometimes so minor that they don't have a distinct feel. Leveling towards the end does feel pretty grindy, with the ramp both of difficulty and experience neccessary to level is incredibly severe after the first hour or so of play. That combined with relativly similar weapons, and having all of the classes level seperatly means that gameplay can become tedious, especially if played alone. This being said, the multiplayer shines. While there are no real changes that i'm aware of between the single and multiplayer modes at all other than AI teamates (that aren't terrible, as I had expected), somehow this game becomes incredibly ridiculously enjoyable when played as a group in the same room. I'd reccomend picking this up for a group of people looking for a fun LAN game, or for a game run online while utilizing a VOIP.			",58,7,0,14,7,0,23

It' so bad that it's just plain awesome! You won't find many shooters that are this crazy. Leveling buildings with rocket launchers. Taking down giant mechanized spiders. Destroying huge motherships. Fighting waves of drone fighters, while trying to survive an onslaught of giant insects, straight out of a 50's sci fi movie. And when you're going to take on an army of arachnids and mechs, you may as well do it in style. So EDF:IA gives you multiple classes to choose from this time. And each one, a complete bad♥♥♥♥♥ Tons of weapons, that make no sense. Unlimited ammo. Seemingly endless waves of enemies in large scale maps. Online co-op multiplayer. And an assortment of some crazy cheese dialogue from your teammates. Sign me up!EDF EDF EDF!!!!			",2688,1008,120,316,352,31,452

He won that encounter by hitting me in the face with a rocket. Meanwhile, our third was laughing like crazy shooting down building after building just because he COULD.Sure, we played through a bit of the campaign seriously, but our experience was mostly co-op shenanigans with how silly our weapons were in scale. I'd played through it solo before, and it wasn't as enjoyable an experience, aside from when i needed a bout of mindless shooting, but with two good friends it was suddenly one of the greatest mindless games i've ever played.

												This game is an action packed kill-fest. Despite the technical issues which I will go into further in detail, the game is surprisingly fun, albeit a little frustrating at times. First and foremost, the controls are a little jenky. Plain and simple. They do not always respond the way you want to, however, they are not terrible. The teammate A.I. is horrible. In a game where you are getting swamped left and right literally hundreds, if not more, enemies at once, your teammates ability to hold their own is very important... and the A.I. completely drops the ball. They are inaccurate, will just stand there soaking up damage and dying a quick death and also, for some reason, seem to have an inability to revive you if you fall in battle. This is especially problematic in major boss battles where you are getting swamped with 2 or more boss enemies and the usual barrage of hundreds of normal enemies and when there are few wide spread checkpoints in the level.All this being said however, the game is unusually fun and entertaining despite these issues. There is something gratifying each time you make an enemy go splat and a great sense of accomplishment when you do actually complete a level. The charterer leveling system is fulfilling as well. Each tier unlocks new weapons, deployables and upgrades, which in turn makes playing single player more enjoyable and less frustrating. The game really shines in co-op mode however and makes most of the technical issues much more bearable. The story is really not anything that special. It is pretty much just an excuse to blow away tons of abnormally large insects, arachnids and aliens... which is just fine as long as you know what you are getting into.Final verdict: Despite the technical flaws the game is a fun kill fest that is worth the minimal money it costs.  4/5 stars			",1673,653,25,232,149,9,211

												Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon is a semi-reboot of the series and is the only game in the series not made by the original developers Sandlot. It takes place around the same time of EDF 2017 and is set in the city of New Detroit. Upon starting the game you can either choose to play the game by yourself or create a new online game for people to join. If you decide to go it alone you will be accompanied by two AI bots named Kid and Cyrus who are not entirely useless but nowhere near as helpful as real players. You can then choose from one of four classes to play as. The Trooper who is your jack of all trades with no real special talents, the Tactical who can lay down turrets and mines, the Battle who is essentially a walking tank with the biggest and most destructive weapons and finally the Jet who can zoom around in a jetpack.Each class has a different set of weapons exclusive to them and with the addition of being able to change your armor to a few different colors it helps making each class feel unique. So far the game is looking awesome and you eagerly jump into mission 1. The first thing you will likely notice is that this game looks much better than the previous entries and every enemy has been resigned to fit this new, gritty theme it's going for. Personally I actually prefer this art direction compared to the previous entries and it makes it all the more of a shame when you actually start playing it. You see they decided to add RPG mechanics by gathering experience and leveling up your character but the problem lies in that you'll start off completely rubbish.Your gun barely does any damage, the clip for each weapon is insanely small meaning that you'll be reloading 80% of the time since this is a game about fighting hordes of enemies and probably worst of all is how the Jet class starts off. You know how he has a jetpack? Well yeah, starting off you can very likely jump higher in real life than that thing lifts him off the ground which is just sad to look at and turns him into a glorified roller-skater. 7 hours of playing nearly exclusively as this class and his jetpack is noticeably better after leveling a few times but don't expect to be able to reach most of the surrounding rooftops for a vantage point.One of the selling points of the game is that it features 300 guns. Well that too is messed up by this completely unnecessary leveling system since whenever you pick up a gun crate from the battlefield they are inexplicably unable to be used until you reach a certain level. Not only does that take the fun out of collecting loot since it takes so long to level up but it also means you will be forced to stick with your rubbish weaponry due to bad game design. Another thing that is really strange is that every weapon of a category looks exactly the same. As an example the first rocket launcher looks the same as the latest rocket launcher you just picked up, the latest assault rifle does too and every other gun has a single weapon model for its entire category. This makes the feel of finally leveling up and being able to use a new gun all the more disappointing.Using explosives in the midst of battle is still as satisfying as ever since every building is completely destructible and by the end of a mission most of the city will be in ruins due to fierce fighting. Unfortunately these new and improved graphics do come at a great cost. There are red “invisible walls” everywhere and you will quickly notice how small the area you can actually play in are. The game tries to hide this fact by drastically changing how missions are designed. While most of the mission from the previous games set you in a huge environment and tasked you with simply surviving the onslaught, this game is chock filled with way-points you must head to. Go to a certain area and switch a beacon or something equally mundane, fight a horde, then go switch another beacon and rinse and repeat until the game finishes.This gets old fast and since there are only 15 missions in this game, each of them last quite some time further making the repetition noticeable. The worst part of it all is that this game switched from the cheesy, plain dumb dialogue of the rest of the series and instead went the dull, serious route. I found the dialogue plain unbearable and most every word you hear out of someone’s mouth will be a random string of words like “Bravo Zulu Lightning over” or “Affirmative, Oscar Bravo Lightning Strike”. I guess they were trying to make it sound cool and edgy but it just sounds like a bunch of things kids would say when they take a match of CS:GO far too seriously.Moving back to the topic of compromises caused by the improved graphics, the amount of enemies that can be on the screen at any one time has been greatly reduced. To give the illusion of facing a horde of enemies they now spawn right around you by crawling out of the ground. This could have been cool if it was used a few times but that is how most of your encounters play out. You go to a way point, receive a string of random words from the mission handler and then enemies predictably pop out of nowhere instantly surrounding you time and time again. Gone are the days when you see hundreds of ants marching to your location as you desperately pick off as many as you can before they reach you. Yes the previous games had graphics right out of the original Xbox but this is a prime case in where graphics are not everything.Ant hills make a return and still spawn in infinite number of enemies until destroyed. Yes, they messed that up too as you are likely imagining. No longer can you destroy the hill with your rocket launcher that is capable of destroying several skyscrapers with a single blast, now you must walk up right next to the hill and plant a tiny charge on the outside. The worst part of this is that it takes several seconds to set it up and a single hit causes you to start all over again. This was clearly designed to “enhance” coop by forcing your friends to cover you but with how fast most weapons run out of ammo, it's likely they simply won't be able to in many cases. Friendly fire is always on and you will take damage if you mindlessly run in front of a friend that is firing his gun. Your AI companions if playing solo are pretty good at not shooting you but seem to constantly try to get themselves killed when you are firing.If you are downed they can revive you and you will be back at full health. Once you finish the campaign you will have the option to turn off the AI bots in future playthroughs. You will also unlock a “campaign remix” mode that randomizes the enemies encountered. Not really a mode that makes much of a difference to the missions. You also have survival mode where you can play with up to 6 other players and fight until you all drop. In survival you can only play as the Trooper class, gain no experience and none of your guns from campaign can be used. One thing I must praise this game for is that vehicles are now finally helpful and no longer have controls designed by someone that has never played a video game. It is pretty fun to ride in tanks, mechs or just get into anti-air turrets. There are quite a few new awesome looking enemies added as well. At the end of the day I get the feeling that Insect Armageddon wasn't even originally supposed to be an EDF game due to how badly they messed up the basic features this series is known for. It may be fun for a bit if you plan on playing with some friends but I just cannot recommend it.			",1881,553,61,204,168,17,226

Product received for free
What I liked: Campy stupid enemies and lots of them to kill Fun overpowered weaponsWhat You Need to Know: This game runs @ 30 fps, unless you download a mod to fix it,stupid developer This game is very grindy in terms of leveling up, pair that with very mindless gameplay, this will not be fore alot of people The reload mechanics is similiar to Gears of War, but the window to perfect reload is so small, it's annoying asf. The bosses are fun, but some take too much damage, like the queen ant, she is a b*tch. You get 4 classes to choose from:	tank with high capacity weapons and shield	jetpack with snipers(jetpack is weak though)	assault is jack of all trades, with fast reload and revive and can use all weapons	tactical which has deployable turrets and mines Voice chat is always on and is gargabe. You will hear echo from the game when chatting with friends in discord If you don't plan on replaying this game, it is really short and ends restarting the first mission right away. lolMy Score:CRecieved as a GiftMain reason for dislike: game is shallow in terms of upgrades and combat, also it fails the singleplayer testGames similar:  Earth Defense Force 4.1 ( has more content) ",224,25,1,13,29,1,28

												A hectic third-person shooter where you defend future Earth from invading bugs. It reminds me of Starship Troopers, if the troopers were f'n killing machines. You level up the four classes available to earn better guns, allowing you to play on the harder difficulty levels for an even more hectic experience. The co-op is supposed to be amusing as well.

												This game is a lot better than it should be. It doesn't really excel in anything, but it's just plain fun. The campaign mode doesn't offer a lot of variety. You go around killing bugs, planting the occasional bomb, reaching rendezvous points and so on, with the game throwing in a new kind of bug to shoot every now and then. The game's sense of humour will make you grin at times with jokes that show that it's not taking itself too seriously. The variety of weapons is quite decent and it will take you a while to get all the upgrades for each class. It's a lot of fun to see how much damage you can to when you get a new piece of equipment! The pace of the game is intense at times and it's really fun to run through seemingly endless hoards of bugs while blasting at your heart's content.To sum things up. This game is quite shallow and repetitive, but I found myself coming back for more for quite a while. I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys blasting gigantic bugs with a variety of futuristic weapons just for the heck of it.			",86,27,9,20,25,2,30

												This game is a lot better than it should be. It doesn't really excel in anything, but it's just plain fun. The campaign mode doesn't offer a lot of variety. You go around killing bugs, planting the occasional bomb, reaching rendezvous points and so on, with the game throwing in a new kind of bug to shoot every now and then. The game's sense of humour will make you grin at times with jokes that show that it's not taking itself too seriously. The variety of weapons is quite decent and it will take you a while to get all the upgrades for each class. It's a lot of fun to see how much damage you can to when you get a new piece of equipment! The pace of the game is intense at times and it's really fun to run through seemingly endless hoards of bugs while blasting at your heart's content.To sum things up. This game is quite shallow and repetitive, but I found myself coming back for more for quite a while. I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys blasting gigantic bugs with a variety of futuristic weapons just for the heck of it.			",86,27,9,20,25,2,30

Dated looking graphics and an older game engine are easily compensated for with an amazingly fun game with great re-playability in co-op mode. There are times when there is so much crap happening on screen and the game never chugged or slowed once.....impressive.Class based and good variety within the classes, and a fun grind to level up.Worth the $20 for a decent indie game and definately worth it if it ever goes on sale.

												8/10EDF is an interesting game that can be buttloads of fun especially if you play with friends. The downside is DLC's and ugly UI. If you don't mind that you will be left to enjoy human flight(in suits), lasers, robots, a variety of guns, and plenty of alien insects to kill. I'm looking forward to newer releases of EDF. Very fun stuff.			",251,52,6,40,21,1,46

												Awesome Serious Sam styled game with 4 classes, best part is the coop mode for up to 3 players, why it wasn't 4 one can wonder.The coop campaign on normal difficulty (lowest) lasted for 4 hours with me and a friend playing 2man. I think the survival mode and harder levels and the ""remixed campaign""  will give it even more playtime. Very fun to play with friends.Good 20 euro investment for people who enjoy these kind of swarm games.			",114,4,1,15,4,2,20

												A darker, grittier version of the wacky budget game Earth Defense Force. While it is certainly the most visually impressive installment in the EDF series, it also feels the most hollow. As far as I'm concerned (and I'm sure many EDF fans will agree with me) much of the charm the series possesses comes from the over-the-top, colorful and corny action and dialouge which is completely lacking this time around.Don't get me wrong, the massive hordes of insects to shoot are still there and the gameplay has hardly changed at all, but it still doesn't ""feel"" like an EDF game to me. The drab colors and serious overtones make it seem like this game was a blatant attempt to cash in on the often too serious and ""dramatic"" American war movie tier trope seen in games like Call of Duty and the like.All things considered it is a decent little timewaster if you're just looking for that mindless shooting itch to scratch and for ten bucks you could definitely do worse.My advice though, if you're looking for the definitive EDF experience that you may have heard others gush about, get EDF 4.1 and ONLY jump to this one if you've exhausted yourself on that and are looking for a bit more.

												If you have every played and enjoyed an EDF game before, buy this one.  It's perfect.  It's got everything you could ever ask.If you haven't, buy it anyway.  It's a very forgiving game.  You don't get hit a few times and die right away, you are basically pummeling random bugs endlessly and picking up health wherever it drops, you will probably play through a few hours without dying on your first try.  You also don't need to look for ammo.  All weapons have infinite ammo, at the cost of reload times.  Each weapon has a reload time and that's it.  Just keep on shooting bugs.  Thousands of them.  It's great fun!10/10			",4125,1558,197,486,660,69,658

If you really have to have this game, like i did, just be sure its heavily discounted. If you loved Starship Troopers, its pretty much a must have, otherwise stear clear... But on a positive note it should be able to run on about anything, its not very demanding of a game.... Its about a 5/10 for me, and I love B grade....			",815,195,33,60,28,3,43

												I was really hoping this game would become better after my first session, but I can honestly say that it didn't pull me in. And, in my opinion, if a game doesn't pull you in within the first few hours, then it's usually a game that's not worth the money, or full price, depending on the situation. The game itself has mediocre graphics, ok sounds and very basic gameplay. It basically all comes down to shooting as many insects as you can. Later on the enemies get increasingly harder but that's about it. There is a bit of tactic involved by selecting your weapons and armor before you start a mission and you'll level up by completing levels. It just... gets very repetitive. I can name a dozen mindless shooters that ARE fun.[Rating: 66/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												TLDR sometimes I pull my pants down and bare♥♥♥♥♥♥♥fart to not get the smell into my pants. In public.The gameplay isn't terrible in terms of mowing down giant bugs with big guns, but it is extremely generic feeling bargain bin quality. Like when you walk into Gamestop and say 'do you have pc games' and they say 'yea the section is over here' and it's just a sad little section on the bottom of one small rack with only 10-15 games and they are all still like $30-50 even though they are years old cus thats how gamestop is then you see this game in that bunch and it's like $19.99 which is hilarious lolol. Or something to that effect.6/10 kinda decent but still too heavily generic to recommend. Not worth the time when much higher quality similar type games exist. Like the Lost Planet games which are all superb in production quality and gameplay, in which this game excells at neither.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Terrible.Just a God awful game.Gameplay is shoddy, graphics suck, voice over work is terrible and all you do is grind out experience to buy more guns that only keep up to the enemies strengths.You never feel like you're over powered in this game even after plugging in 80+ hours, finding all the guns and maxing out your armor (which believe me isn't worth doing)The final difficulty level is abysmally balanced... If you're not playing with a full group of maxed out EDF veterans, forget ever beating the game by yourself... it's damn near impossible, if the enemies don't kill you first, the boredom will.Steer clear unless you need a game to play as you're waiting for a triple A title to arrive.

												While it appears I am defending New Detroit more than the actual Earth, there definetely is an armageddon of sorts going on involving some sort of insects. While I'm not quite sure if the semi-annual pilot voice over is the star of the game or not, I can discern that as an actual Earth Defense Force- your ♥♥♥♥ing terrible at your job. Judging by the ADHD afflicted standard troopers you encounter the basic EDF recruit goes though what I can only assume is a 5 minute tutorial on the concept of muscle mass and tactics, and a grueling 9 month crash course in ways to remain stupidly optimistic and how to turn everything you say into a cheer. The game ends on a cliffhanger after you defeat X amount of Y's for the Zth time, leaving New Detroit in complete and utter ruin- which still looks better than modern day Detroit.New Detroit Defense Force Mediocre is a fantastic run-and-gun game that is best played with boxing gloves filled with spaghetti for an additional challenge.

												Strictly speaking, this is not a great or very good game.The mechanics are a bit clunky, some suits are clearly superior to others and the enemy A.I. is nonexistant.That being said...It is incredibly fun and addicting. Basically, you play a bad horror exploitation movie witha bit of ""Starship Troopers"" thrown in the mix. Its silly, over the top and fun, fun, fun.And as such, it is very rewarding.

												plays well, a fun way to do an alien/giant bug/giant robot style armageddon... only issue i have is the fact that it take practically FOREVER to kill a single enemy such as a Daddy Long Legs or Mantis... even the dropships (of which there are many at times) seem to never die. the AI teamates seem to demolish these things faster than i do. if the damage output of the weapons was tweaked a bit, or there was slightly less health on the big enemies id probably put this game up with my top 10, as opposed to its top 15 status right now			",130,6,0,4,7,0,8

												Having a decent amount of playtime under my belt. I can say that this game has given me and my steam mates some of the best laughs.Nothing beats shooting spiders with small nuc's. And when you can do it with mates, all the better. The 4 classes vary widely. There is, Tactical (Support), Heavy (Tank/DPS), Jet (Exotic) and Soldier (Jack of trades).All the classes have strengths and weaknesses. Though Jet gets VERY overpowering in levels 6-8.The Story is simple, and the dialogue is purposely cheesy (Cheesy good).As stated in other reviews, there is alot of replay-ability with remix campaign that randomizes that enemies spawn where. The levels you get are limited by difficulty. Normal is 1-5, Hard is 5-7, Insane 7-8. With the way gear unlocks the games stays challenging without being overwhelming.I would recommend this game as a good laugh. The DLC is with it.The only negatives I can find is the 3 player limit. (Though with Level 5+ weapons 4+ would make the game a cakewalk).And that in the wave survival mode you can only play as Soldiers.			",162,12,1,18,22,0,37

												Another fun romp through the ashes of the city you are trying to save. Certainly a different feel from the original which I am sure turned some people off to this particular game. Felt like a decent succsessor although certainly went for a little less old Japanese horror film feel and more of a serious game. My biggest isssue was with scale. The first game had tons of missions and weapons for you to unlock. I am currently going through EDF 2017 again with another friend and we are at approx. 20% after completing over 50 missions, while IA only has 15 missions they do feel a bit longer. Overall a fun game but the short duration is pretty dissappointing. Still grab a couple friends and strap in for a few hours of over the top bug killing.			",68,6,0,13,1,0,3

This game is an excellent third person shooter that is worth full price in my opinion. I am stuck grinding on a campaign level for better guns and levels, but that could simply be my lack of skill when it comes to fighting the mechanical spiders.			",282,68,7,37,20,0,4

												I got one very fitting word for this game: Wicked. Because that's what this game is... Wicked. This game wastes no time on tutorials, explanations, story, any of that♥♥♥♥♥♥.. It throws you face first into a MASSIVE fire fight against some big - and I mean REALLY big - insects, with unlimited ammo (you do have to reload though), some squad members, and a couple of objectives to complete. A little further, you're engaged by an even bigger alien robot, which is quite a tough nut to crack. For the story part, you'll have to settle with what you can make out from mission briefings and voice chatter, because with all that action crammed into this package, there's simply no room for anything other than the wet weaponry dream of any gun-loving maniac, and a whole lot of gigantic, alien, insect asskicking. If you don't like insects though, you may wanna make up your mind before buying this game; will you get enjoyment out of blasting gigantic versions of them to pieces, while they swarm you?

												Having a decent amount of playtime under my belt. I can say that this game has given me and my steam mates some of the best laughs.Nothing beats shooting spiders with small nuc's. And when you can do it with mates, all the better. The 4 classes vary widely. There is, Tactical (Support), Heavy (Tank/DPS), Jet (Exotic) and Soldier (Jack of trades).All the classes have strengths and weaknesses. Though Jet gets VERY overpowering in levels 6-8.The Story is simple, and the dialogue is purposely cheesy (Cheesy good).As stated in other reviews, there is alot of replay-ability with remix campaign that randomizes that enemies spawn where. The levels you get are limited by difficulty. Normal is 1-5, Hard is 5-7, Insane 7-8. With the way gear unlocks the games stays challenging without being overwhelming.I would recommend this game as a good laugh. The DLC is with it.The only negatives I can find is the 3 player limit. (Though with Level 5+ weapons 4+ would make the game a cakewalk).And that in the wave survival mode you can only play as Soldiers.			",162,12,1,18,22,0,37

												I got into EDF on the playstation 2, and was pretty pysched when I found out about the new version coming out a while back. There are a few things that make me sad, weapons are earned through leveling, not being one of countless dudes. But the balance of still finding weapons on occasion, the very fact you get to level up something other than your health bar, and the addition of various armors that grant abilities and buffs is pretty awesome.It also adds a huge degree of replayability. The game ends about where I would put the halfway point of campaign, but that being said there is a lot of awesome stuff happening. The ability to pretty easily play with any friends that have it makes for a very enjoyable time.  I prefer the heavy battle armor and massive destruction of missles, but the jet armor will let you fly around, and the tactical armor allows you to drop turrents. EDF is mostly about fun. It's a grind about killing giant bugs and doesn't throw too many suprises or puzzling things your way. That being said I highly reccomend this game if for no other reason than the sheer aggression and letting of steam qualities. Cheers!			",452,82,4,77,26,10,68

												LOL IT IS AWESOME! Having put some time in it now - DANG I wish you could co-op campaign with > 3 people! Get through normal and hard so you can play the *real* game on Inferno difficulty with friends and experience the game as it is meant to be.It can be very challenging, but I've never once felt like I died in a cheap way - every time I know how I messed up and your buddies can often revive you. It's good, through and through.It's really unfortunate that SURVIVAL (up to 6 players in co-op) doesn't allow you to choose any class but trooper and gives you virtually no loadout choices. It would have been an awesome mode if you could use/level your favorite frame(s) from the campaign with all your friends, but as-is I haven't bothered to play it with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know how some games are great because they are varied and intelligent, and artistic, and blablabla? THIS IS NOT THE CASE: EDF is like that time when you got really drunk on a Death Metal show, and by that I mean, if you try to remember how you could do that or why you did, you can't, but somehow you know you felt awesome. By that I mean, this is an arcade game, like Robotron or Smash TV, with the giant insects from Starship Troopers and every cheesy science fiction b-movie ever made. It's not a game to be invested, it's a game to have fun. GREAT fun. Go destroy some spiders now.			",131,23,2,4,0,0,5

												EDF offers the full package. It has 4 classes of quite different experiences, some minor RPG leveling and weapon purchasing elements, and a robust campaign. Although the campaign has kind of an abrupt ending, it's not really an issue as the entire point of this game is bug squashing. Do you like choosing between dozens of different types of guns, anywhere from launchers, rockets, sniper rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, and so many weird types of weapons that there's something for everyone. I change up my weapons frequently. The environments are destructible as well, so most of those weaopns will decimate all the buildings as well. I find playing this game very carthardic, as it takes little effort to play it and isn't terribly frustrating as long as you treat the difficulty settings like Diablo ones.

												It plays grate in an Intel HD 3000 so those of you with laptops have no worries. Aliens have decided to ""bug out"" and attack earth. In this little sci-fi shooter you can shoot everything. Your friends, the enemies, you're self, and particularly fun (for whatever reason) buildings. There's no penalty for leveling a city, in fact with a few guns it's hard not to. While it's a grind fest, you get weapon drops from the bosses. They are the particularly big things that often involve shooting the glowing bits of them enough, they will drop crates.This game is basically a bad sci-fi movie by Michael Bay without the needless sex of course. You run around blow everything up and just feel good, because you saved humanity and got a better gun to do it with next time. This is a go to game of mine when I want to have some mindless distraction.The DLC is over powered and this game is all about over powered so pick it up along with the game, grate deal if it's on sale. It's best with friends but you can easily find a match online.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A hidden gem. Great on keyboard or controller, this title offers tons of variety, tons of replayability, and an almost fully destructable environment that offers fans of any style of action gameplay options. Rain down firey death with a jet trooper, or wade in balls deep with the heavy trooper. Go nuts with the engineer's turrets, or quick and mobile with the infantry. The dlc is pretty worth it, with the new weapons adding a fair bit of new strategic options to consider. All in all an amazing game.			",253,52,3,41,19,2,61

												Earth Defense Force is a third person shooter pitting you against hordes of alien invaders, said invaders are using giant robots and huge bio-enginereed insects to invade our world:  it's up to you to stop them in the 15 campaign missions.PROS:-alien units are well designed and animated-intense, frantic combat against hordes of insects and robots-most of the environment can be destroyed, cars blow up and buildings crumble to dust when hit with rockets: this adds a slight strategic layer to things cause doing so increases your line of sight (at the cost of cover) and gives the alien insects less surfaces to crawl on-dialogue is generally funny, the game really doesn't take itself seriously with soldiers joking and abesnt-minded intel officers taking their time to explain how to beat a boss-a good amount of armors and weapons to unlock and level up-very fun when played in coop-when not playing coop AI companions are quite competent and generally quite effectiveCONS:-graphics are a tad bland and levels generally look all the same-unremarkable voice acting-gameplay is overall simple and boils down to going from point A to B shooting everything that moves-some enemy waves last a bit too long-no tutorial whatsoever, thankfully it's easy to pick up and any doubts can be cleared by looking up a FAQ-a bit on the short side-leveling up armors takes quite a long time, you'll have to grind missions once you're done with the campaign or simply replay it selecting a higher difficulty

EDF comes out as a straightforward game that offers plenty of mindless fun, shooting tons of enemies and leveling the city using the various over the top weapons at your disposal is truly enjoyable.There's not much of a story, the characters are cliched and the ending feels hurried but the fact is the game isn't really interested in that stuff: what it wants is to offer you an huge b-movie inspired alien armada-and a few bosses-to blow up alone or with friends: and it does so really well.I'm not sure the game has alot of staying power once it's done, there's a campaign remix mode that adds different foes and ups the ante a bit but it doesn't really change things much, so you'll have to play survival with friends or just grind campaign missions again to level up everything.At its sale price of 3 bucks EDF is a really fun albeit simple and short game: if you're into third person shooters and like its campy b-movie style it will not let you down.

												Got this game with all DLC for like 5 bucks in a sale, I can say it was worth the money.In EDF:IA you do one thing: massacre giant insects and robots with four different classes. I did not even know that EDF exists before this game.+Nonstop Action+A no-brainer game, really nice to jsut relax+more action+lots of guns and four classes, however...+lots of destruction- ... guns all look the same, as do the explosions- not many enemy types- balance is very bad at some points, some classes play totally OP why others stay back with the excuse of being more ""tactical"", which helps nothing because this game is about pure DPS over an as big as possible area- for the tiers later in the game it become quite grindy- coop joining is weird, there is no server list and you dont know what kinds of missions etc. is availibleA really good game to pick up and play a mission or two per day, I played it solo because nobody of my friends has it, but I Imagine it's even more of a blast with others. I had fun playing it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just to be upfront, I'm new to the series and this is my first taste of it.Giant insects & spiders? ✓A variety of character loadouts? ✓Swarms of aliens from outer space? ✓Mechs? ✓A giant monster that barrels in like a meteor from space? ✓Destructable enviroments? ✓Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon is a pretty fun game if I do say so myself. There are some negatives to point out. EDF is a little repetative in its objectives. Essentially you're moving from point to point, killing swarms, and that's the crux of it. Another negative to point out is that the dialogue is pretty corny and cheesy. Your squad-mates chime in with very cringey things to say and it's not even funny; you'll involuntarily sigh when you hear them . Also your character's name is ""Lightning""....yeah.With that being said, if you're able to ignore the negatives, this is a very fun title. EDF: Insect Armageddon is a pretty neat gem on Steam. It's worth a look.			",419,40,10,36,17,6,30

												Earth Defense Force 2017 was an amazing game on the XBOX 360, and I was more than thrilled to find out that there was an EDF game developed for the PC, unfortunately it was developed by an entirely different team so it's got a different flavor and there are gameplay elements that ruin the EFD experience I had with EDF2017. First, there is a severe lack of missions. EDF IA has a total of 15 missions. I believe EDF 2017 had around 60 missions of crazy bug shooting, giant robot destroying, campy sci-fi goodness. Yeah, I like that there's a survival mode and a 'remix' of the campaign but I'm sure the devs could've cranked out more than 15 missions. The graphics aren't bad, but EDF was never about having 'amazing' graphics, considering the sheer amount of stuff happening on-screen you hardly have time to notice as you're running from an army of ants and spiders while dodging the blasts of robots that are towering over skyscrapers. The weapons and different soldier types are pretty cool too, and I'm glad to see that the devs decided to bring some variety in that form. I'll recommend this game if it's on sale, but at full price it's kind of hard to suggest, especially when this game has paid DLC, which was a horrible idea for this game. PAID DLC should not have come anywhere NEAR this franchise. In the end, however, this is EDF for the PC and that's quite alright. I just wish it was the EDF that I fell in love with on the Xbox360.

Try to protect the Earth from an invasion of giant insects and see how far you can get.Customise the colors of your uniforms, unlock and earn a wide variety of weapons for the four classes in the game.I don't know about the multi-player aspect of Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon as I only play solo, but the single player campaign and survival mode are bolth excelent. If you like being in the thick of heavy action against grim odds with barely a chance to catch your breath, you might like this...at least until you end up running down the street in a blind panic with a tick the size of a bean-bag chair on your back.

												Having played Earth Defense Force: 2015 on the XBox 360, I had high hopes for the subsequent iteration. While Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon doesn't quite capture the magic of its predcessor, it's still an enjoyable sequel that should be considered by any fans of the franchise or newly interested gamers.The staples of the series are all there--giant bugs, giant spaceships, and an endless supply of bullets and bombs, The game places more emphasis on a progression system that upends the simplicity of the previous game. Instead of killing bugs to get armor and weapons, you have to earn the weapons THEN upgrade the specific clase enough to unlock the weapon.The familiar chaos of the series is still as campy as ever. Every building is destructible if enough rockets are thrown at it. Bugs fly in every direction. Despite my issues with the class system, it makes the game more interesting in co-op.Overall, it's a good game and any curious should pick it up during a sale.			",153,27,1,20,9,3,19

But I wouldn't let that deter you from buying the game, it is still a ton of fun.			",221,27,4,18,10,0,14
