												This is the first and so far only accurate simulation of WW2 kamikaze missions I've ever played and I'm pleased to say that it does it well. I feel my burning Japanese spirit swell up with pride as I dodge the yankee devil danmaku and sacrifice myself so that my comrades might walk over my corpse and onward to victory. This is the spirit of kantorai, something you gaijin would never understand. Long live the Emperor. I give this game 10/10.			",94,16,5,20,11,0,34

												This is one of the best bullet hells here avaliable on Steam (of course it's not touhou but it does its work pretty well), and it's totally worth it (more if you can get it on sale). The third part of the Gundemonium Recollection, and a vertical scroll (instead of horizontal like its predecessors), with very charming characthers and of course a japanese touch. The other two games of the Gundemonium Collection are great too, so if you want to get it, don't doubt it.			",130,16,2,17,4,1,15

												Another one of my favorite shmups on Steam. This game has a ton of polish, a few different game modes, very nice pixel art with lots of explosions happening all the time and 13 characters! This game is a bit different than your typical shmup. Your ""bombs"" in this game will explode by sacrificing your character against an enemy. Weird concept, but it works great! You can also buy multiple lives and new characters after each stage to make up for sacrficing yourself. Its still very difficult and most people wont make it past the Beginner difficulty. One of the best shmups on Steam and highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Kill one, another takes its place. Hitogata Happa is a game that is completely different from the other Gundemonium games, opting for the traditional top down view and focusing itself as a prequel. But is this a suicidal concept? Gameplay Hitogata Happa, for whatever reason, plays very differently from the other Gundemonium titles. Using the more widely used top down view, Hitogata Happa's main gimmick is in its name. Roughly translating to ""humanoid explosion,"" Hitogata Happa features the ability to crash your playable character into an enemy to create a powerful explosion that is almost necessary for completing the game. To offset this questionable sacrifice, your playable characters are an army of non-sentient dolls created by your BFF and partner in revolution, Kreutzer. Your dolls are 100% expendable, and you get more after finishing each campaign mission, so you can stockpile. In addition to having lots of them, you also have a variety of dolls to choose from, with all of them doing different things. You'll, of course, need all of this because this game is hard. Like, really hard. Harder then the other Gundemoniums, at the least. Bosses have time limits, enemies are quick to the draw and cover the screen with bullets very fast, even on normal difficulty, and things go downhill really quick unless you're good at dodging or erasing bullets (You can do that!).  Graphics Probably the most ""updated"" graphics of any Gundemonium game besides Recollection, Hitogata Happa looks alright, but definitely loses a bit due to the same color palette being used on every enemy (This is mostly done as the enemy faction, the Genoremasody Reich, are suppose to look similar and very factorialized, justifying the color palette). The game also has a bit of color loss, mostly due to the game's darker approach in story. It does make up for these lackluster colors with its intriquite weavings and patterns that you see all over the game, from the marking on the AoE of your suicide bomb attack, to the text on the mission complete screen. Performance Nothing particularly bad. Good ol' Potato friendly gaming. Soundtrack As per the Hitogata Happa way, the Soundtrack is a bit more different, going for a more elegant approach with tons of organ, piano, and fiddle/violin abuse. It's good, but not what you're used to if you've listened to the other two soundtracks. Still, it's kickass in it's own way, especially the true-final-boss track. Really good stuff from Woofles, who takes DM Ashura's place in the soundtrack department this time.  Recollection Good game. Play it if you like bullet hells.			",129,10,1,9,12,1,7

												If you want to enjoy this game, you NEED to read the manual. Playing this blind is odious and how you need to play it is not as obvious as most other shmups.The thing about having to crash against the bosses to kill them is interesting, but just as you would think, is very annoying to pull off since if you get hit by a bullet it negates the explosion and that's what's most likely to happen as you near the boss you're trying to attack.The thing about the game entering sudden death mode when the timer runs out on the bosses, sure, it enforces the suicide bomb playstyle expected from the game, but will be an immediate turn down for anyone who, like me, came expecting a traditional shmup and didn't look for the manual. So, hopefully, you'll read the ♥♥♥♥ing game up. It still makes boss fights really annoying if you take too long to beat them, which is more likely than not since you'll spend most of your time running into bullets while trying to suicide into the boss. Hopefully this problem is solved once you give yourself enough practice and time to learn the game, I did not give myself that many.One thing I remember from this game is that there were a couple patterns on ♥♥♥♥ing easy that did not ♥♥♥♥ing belong on easy.One thing that bothered me a lot is that once you die, you get a short time to select a new character to send out, which you can select with the arrow keys. DON'T. Just ♥♥♥♥ing DON'T. If I want to select a new character before spawning, at least let it be only with the actual character selection keys. It's REALLY annoying when I set some character to be the next one to go out, and then when the current one dies, a completely different one is sent out because I didn't let go of the arrow keys or I pressed it too early.

												""GODJIRRA?!?!"" - Intro to the boss on level 3.Blindingly hard game made all the harder by lack of tutorial coupled with new mechanics. First: If you run out of time on a boss he goes batshit insane and will start wrecking your♥♥♥♥♥♥ yo. If he destroys your current doll in this mode (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ certainty) you game over. Second, crashing your doll in to something on purpose once your flow meter is charged will cause a powerful kamikaze attack, and is sometimes the only way to stop running out of time. Third: Half the dolls you can buy in the game are♥♥♥♥♥♥ stick to Leaf, Earl, Assam and Clover. Armed with this information you can now make a stab at Euridice mode. You are welcome.Also the story makes about as much sense as Donnie Darko dubbed in Korean.Still keen? Well prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥sailor, and go try to ♥♥♥♥ up some neo-nazis with cute little dolls.

												Crazy Japanese bullet hell fun. I wish I was better at this genre so I could truly appreciate the advanced features and the need to ration your kamikaze attacks. Unless you're a bullet-hell/danmaku ninja, you have to save your doll roster for specific bosses and reaching the end of the game. Several unlockable units and bosses for the truly skilled. It's not Bug Princess (Mushihimesama, they made a port of that for iOS, LOLOLOLOL), but it's still hella tough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very fun bullet-hell shooter.The main gimmick, for the genre, is that you can choose between 8 types of dolls, each with heavily varying abilities, and none ever come out as useless.  You can buy multiple of each, as they act as your lives, and you can also use these dolls, when their FLOW is maxed/after a set amount of time, to bump into the enemies (easier said than done in most cases) and unleash a powerful explosion, the key to success in this game.  These are really fun and rewarding mechanics.Given it's a bullet-hell, expect it to be pretty tough.			",176,21,2,14,9,3,11

												Sadly this is a bit of a nose dive in terms of quality compared with the previous Gundemonium games. It's got all kinds of weird mechanics that simply don't work well in a bullet hell game and I feel alienated. You certainly cannot play this like any other shooter as the game constantly encourages you to get close to larger enemies and die to perform the most damage and most of the time you'll hit a bullet on your way there and waste that life. The bullets are also a lot faster, the character speeds more varied making it very difficult to pick up. Even the best players die constantly, making an attempt to be good at this game very undesirable and unrewarding.With that said the Arrange Soundtrack is still awesome so feel free to get this on sale just to get a copy of the game's music!

												An oddity among bullet hells in which the player can gather a huge armada of higly specialized, highly disposable kamikaze ships. Hitogata Happa's mechanics inspire in me a wild ambivalence. It is absurd, demanding, and masochistic in ways that no other shooter would dare. This game brings so many gimmicks to the table along with such a relentless difficulty that at first pass it seems like some kind of sick joke, but  I can't help but feel a certain fondness for its vaulting imagination.  In between the whimsical dolls named after tea leaves and the massive German flying machines there's a mechanically tight game with plenty of heart that just begs to be replayed again and again. After all, success really comes down to bringing the proper tool for the job, and knowing how to use it.  ",950,283,17,93,73,9,100

												Hitogata Happa is a Japanese bullet hell shoot’em up that will not only test your patience but your skill and reaction time as well. I have played lots of bullet hell games on steam, but none can hold a candle to how hardcore Hitogata Happa is. The bullet patterns are absolutely insane and the fantastic musical score will get you pumped as you wade through endless walls of impassable bullets. Unlike other games, Hitogata Happa offers you a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of ship variety. Each ship has its pros and cons which require practice for an understanding of how they work. Boss fights are epic and they all have extra mechanics that make them extra fun to fight. Sadly, no matter how much I love this game, it’s not for everyone. It is very hard; the first boss fight will rage quit most people. However, if you are a fan of Japanese bullet hell, this is the best you are going to get until TouHou makes it to steam.

												An interesting gimmick for a bullet hell. You have to charge up a bomb by surviving during boss fights then suicide dive the boss to do any damage. If you get hit by a bullet, you die and therefore don't blow up and do damage, enjoy sitting around charging your bomb again. Better hurry up though, the boss goes full lunatic mode if you take too long. Oh and also, you can't run into the parts that are vulnerable while the boss is moving, because that means it's attacking and therefore makes it so you don't explode on contact for some reason. It's an interesting gimmick, but that doesn't make it fun.			",130,25,2,17,6,1,10

												Well, I hadnt played this game in ages, and after buying the Gundemonium Collection, I figured I""d have a go at it since I couldnt really remember much of it.....and then it very quickly hit me as to WHY I hadnt played this game in ages.  Suddenly, I remembered it all.  If you're wondering why my ""time spent"" on this game here on Steam is so low, and yet I'm writing a review, it's because I've already spent a big pile of time with this, and the other two games, on the PS3 versions, which came out quite some time ago.  The other two games in the trilogy are bloody brilliant.  Excellent bullet-hell type games.This one though is different.  Everything that the other two get right, THIS one gets wrong.  Uninteresting attack patterns, extremely repetetive (and short) level design, stupid control issues (really?  There's no ""slow movement"" button here?  In a bullet-hell shmup? when there WAS one in the other two?), cheap boss attacks (the first boss: If you DONT know that he's going to do the arm swipe as his first attack, and if you dont ALREADY know just where to be when he does it, you WILL die 1 second into the fight.  Gets worse from there.) and one of the worst game mechanics I've ever heard of in this type of game.See, here's the main gimmick:  You've got all of these different dolls that you control instead of ships.  You can switch them out when one dies, and you essentially get nine lives to go with.  All of them have different abilities and blah blah blah.  None of THAT matters, though, you see.  While that all sounds cool, it's obliterated by that particular gameplay mechanic that I mentioned up above.  You cant just shoot things in this or use special powers on them, nooooooooooo.   What you have to do is kill yourself.  No, really.  Bosses in particular CANNOT be beaten without doing this.... numerous times on each.  You fill up this ""flow"" meter by shooting stuff, and when it's powered up, ramming yourself into an enemy of any sort will cause the doll to violently explode, doing massive damage to anything caught in the blast.  Bosses take next to no damage from anything else, so you A: have to do this against them, and B: have to have enough remaining lives when you reach each one.But the problem with this is simple:  This is a danmaku shmup.   Bullet-hell.  Where the idea of RAMMING something exists.  Think about that for a second.  You've got chaotic, and most importantly, DENSE patterns coming out from these things, and you have to RAM THE SOURCE OF THEM.  In other words, you must successfully plow directly through the areas with the highest bullet density (since it's where the shots are coming from) and successfully ram the boss without taking a hit.  Yeah.  Good luck with that one. Typically, getting really close to enemies... and I dont mean right next to them, but just a short distance away... in a bullet-hell game is quite the challenge for most players.  There are plenty of games of this type where the closer you are to an enemy when it pops, the more points you get.  Which makes sense due to the challenge of getting close without taking a hit.  But that's an OPTIONAL thing.... you dont HAVE to do it.  And you can learn it in bits and pieces.  As you go through the game in question, you'll learn the patterns and learn how everything works, and you spot different ways of getting close to some things to pop them, and so on.  Well, in THIS game, you *have* to do it, and getting close isnt good enough.  Gotta actually collide with the thing.  AFTER surviving long enough to charge up the Flow meter. Yeah.  Saying that this is frustrating is an understatement.  This developer has made a number of interesting and creative shmuppy games, and for the most part all of them are very good, which of course includes Gundemonium Recollection and GundeadliGne, the other two in this 3-pack.  But THIS game is the exception.  And I haaaaaaaate having to say that, as this is one of those developers that I have alot of respect for otherwise.  But even a great dev can make a mistake from time to time.			",271,38,1,35,44,0,30

												Hitogatta Happa would be a game that you'll hate to hate. It's a quite engaging little manic shooter, DoDonPachi-style, based on a buyable/sacrificable ship-bomb mechanic.A somewhat interesting feature that you'll forget rapidly when you'll be confronted to the load of flaws that the game suffers and the intense amount of frustration coming from cruel and unusual gameover mechanics (You need to suicide your doll/ship on the boss to bomb him, and inflict enough damage to kill him before the timeout, whatever your skill is, this becomes overly complicated passed stage 2).Buy it only if you're really into manic shooters and are looking for a new game to beat.Otherwise, I can only advice you to spend your money on other games.4.5/10Pros :+ Relatively cheap+ Localized+ Not that badCons : - Glitchy controls on keyboard- Unreadable action- Terrible HUD- Uninspired patterns- Unfairly punishing ""instakill-on-timeout"" mechanic- No visible hitbox ? Seriously ?- Locked in 640*480- Gratuitous engrish everywhere.- Frustratingly near from being an actually good game  ",73,44,2,9,15,0,14

												I give into defeat with this Bullet Hell gate ~ far more difficult than most and you are also required to kill yourself into the level/bosses in order to do real damage.For crazy bullet hell fans only!

												I'm not a flying shooter fan, and this one is definitely the hardest of the bunch.Read the instruction manual before the game -- a key concept is that you need to sacrafice your lives to get past certain parts of the board.Hardcore flying shooter fans will like this game, everyone else, stay away - or get something to punch when you can't complete level 0 (the mandatory intro level).For my tastes, this is a great flying shooter, but I just don't like it.1/5			",679,182,12,83,50,6,98

												This game is alright, but suffers from slow character movement that makes you feel very restricted. Bullets move at a pace that you can keep up with as well, but it's very annoying to be moving to the right and not just get there in a decent amount of time. This is the first game in the series (as far as I know of, series) that I've played so I don't know if there's any better ones, but the controls are slow so I can't enjoy it. Experience is key and I cannot experience, nor do I feel as though others can. The game can still be enjoyable but there's others that are better and possibly even cheaper.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imagine Touhou with fewer lives and no idea what you're doing. I don't know if my ""spells"" are weak or I'm doing something wrong but I lose after one or two lives. Also the plot has something to do with Prussia (once a real empire in Europe) magic (mentioned in the intro) and space age warships (not mentioned but that's what I saw as the enemies). Maybe I just don't know what I'm doing but atleast touhou was easy to learn when I was new.			",59,4,0,9,6,1,8

												Hitogata Happa is a weird bullet hell shmup by the creator of Gundemonium, a genuinely fantastic shooter. I kinda wish I could say the same here. This game looks great, and seems super cool for sure, but holy BALLS is it difficult and obtuse as all hell. I don't understand the mechanics, I don't get how to beat the first level boss on BEGINNER MODE, I just. It's so confusing, even after reading the manual. F*cking HELLSINKER is easier than this game. At least I could actually beat the first stage in that!I'm still giving this game a thumbs up though because it's not actually a bad game, I'm just bad at it. Pick it up with the Gundemonium games, give it a shot, you might enjoy it. Platine makes good games, but this one is by far their least accessible one. RTFM!For reference: Steam is showing this review as being posted a year ago due to me removing my original (joke) review and reposting this actual review. It seems it doesn't actually delete review post dates, just the review itself. Doesn't make one look great, I'll be honest.			",266,70,8,24,44,4,51

												One of the three gundemonium games and the only one to be a vertical shooter instead of the horizontal. Without any explanation it's a bit tough to start out. The game looks likes a standard shmup (shoot em up) game with bullet shooting, slowdown but there is one thing which is not clearly explained... how to use a bomb. As your doll stays on screen for some time your flow meter will go up and once it hits max you'll get a notification on your char which says bomb. All you need to do now is ram into your enemy. That's how you use a bomb. Sacrifice one doll's life to do massive amount of damage to the enemy. At first you're stuck just using a bunch of dolls named leaf, but as you progress you can buy different ones and each doll has a different style of attack, mana attack and bomb. Coming from someone that's played a lot of touhou and cave co, ltd games, it's not bad but I wish the characters would move faster. At least add an autofire button like most cave shmups.

												In this game, you play the role of a little girl and an adult girl who looks like a little girl and then up to 12 more little girls that are actually dolls. You fight neo-nazis in the 1700s and blow stuff up, and then you fight giant machines and some guy who fused himself to a machine or something. There's not a lot of dialogue in this game, but the bullets say enough. And boy, they say a lot. They won't shut up. This game is hard as balls, and the true final boss is excruciatingly difficult - even on easy. Yeah. Great game (my favorite).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- Very challenging- Lots of interesting gameplay mechanics.- A lot of replayability- Amazing soundtrack, which is also included when you buy the gameThe only issue is that one of the mechanics is not straight forward.

												Probably my favorite out of the localized Gundemonium Collection.  I'm not an expert and bullet hell/heaven by any means, but I sunk a lot of time trying to get the best ending on the lowest difficulty.  There's a lot of quirks about this one that you won't see in a typical shooter game.  You can get a large number of lives (to a certain point) by buying dolls in-between rounds.  Each of these dolls are basically your ship that you can use to fight enemies with and each has a different function as well as their own unique super ability.  Each of them also has the ability to become a bomb by themselves, you won't be able to use a bomb unless you ram your doll into things, thus sacrificing it for large amounts of damage which is essential to beating bosses later on.  Speaking of bosses, you're against the clock.  Once you run out of time, you can certainly still beat a boss, but...In any case, there's a lot of depth and play in this game.  I've got this on both this and the PS3 and I much prefer this one for the arranged music that they added in over the PC/PS3 release.  If you're a fan of STGs, this one is probably up your alley.

												Right now, my favorite vertical scrolling shooter. Intense bullet-pattern action with over 7 playable characters, four difficulty settings, and two extra modes. The unique explosive humanoid dolls system allows one to sacrifice a doll when the Flow gauge is maxed for extreme levels of damage to enemies, and brings a level of strategy to selecting dolls to bring to battle as dolls handle, attack, and bomb differently. Good value alone for people who like curtain fire scrolling shooters, totally worth having as a part of the Gundemonium Collection as a whole.			",187,44,6,27,14,1,18

												This game is quite different from other similar Doujin Vertical Danmakus (i.e Touhou) out there.It's a little bit more leaning towards Resources management:Your lives here are also your bombs, you're supposed to ram them into bosses for huge damage. They don't give you 30 lives on the 1st stage on Normal for nothing. Don't worry though you can purchase them back in bulk between stages.So it's dodging the bullets, ram yourself into the big enemies and cancel bullets for heavy scoring, then use the score items to buy more lives. It's a quite different experience from normal STGs.			",251,112,9,39,36,1,39
