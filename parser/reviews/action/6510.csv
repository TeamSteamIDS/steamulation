TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Lost Planet: Extreme Conditions is the first game on Lost Planet franchise. Developed and Published by Capcom, it was originally designed to be an Xbox 360 (2006) exclusive but was later released for the PC (2007) and subsequently, the Playstation 3 (2008).The player takes the role of Wayne Holden, a Snow Pirate surviving in a failed colonization project of an alien world known as E.D.N. III. Said planet was a prospective new home planet for humanity until it was discovered that: 1. Its covered in perpetual winter. 2. Its home to a hostile alien species known as the Akrid. Wayne, along with his father was supposed to be hunting a particularly powerful Akrid but it proved too powerful and soon things went from bad to worst as Wayne finds himself left for dead in the frozen surface of the planet. He was later recovered and revived (with amnesia) by another group of Snow Pirates who came across his frozen body. Join Wayne in his quest to recover his memories and piece together a conspiracy by a mysterious corporation known as NEVEC.PROS:+ Graphically and Visually stunning despite being 8 years old at the time of writing this review (2014).+ Vital Suits (V.S.) are fun to pilot and to play+ Healthy amount of Variety on the above mentioned VS, each having their own strengths and weaknesses+ Good Music and Sound Effects (although the voice acting could have used a bit more work)+ Good enemy variety+ Epic boss battles+ Large enough levels for exploration however...(See CON #7)+ Great environment, level design and refreshing new setting (abandoned frozen planet)+ Performance Test functionality (which is proper since the game HAD a heavy system requirement back in 2007 for the PC version)CONS:- Voice acting could have been better (or they could have used the original Japanese with english subtitles)- Story line is a bit hard to follow if you're not paying attention- Not very memorable characters- The jumps between cutscenes and missions are sometimes disconnected.- Poor A.I. (You'll see more intelligence in a Coma patient than the Human Enemy AI in this game.)- Repetitive combat- Unrewarding and pointless collectibles that serve no purpose in gameplay or story. (You don't get rewarded for exploration.)CONCLUSION:Its a NICE game that could have been done better. I can still give it my RECOMMENDATION because I particularly liked my experience with it. It can get a boring at times, but Lost Planet: Extreme Conditions does make for a good pass time since the levels are interesting and satisfying to play through.The visuals are great which are complemented with good music and sound effects however, the voice acting is tolerable at best. The combat gets too repetitive at times and the human enemy AI is woefully underwhelming but the fun and excitement found when using the Vital Suits does make up for it.All in all, its an AVERAGE game. RECOMMENDED to be bought on a SALE rather than full price.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												My favorite part about this game, that I wish we could see in more singleplayer experiences nowadays, is the fact that it doesn't hold your hand. There's no ""FOLLOW"" sign hovering above NPCs, there's no slo-mo sequence during boss battles to help you get a better shot, and the game only gives you hints, not explicit instructions, on how to proceed. For example, rather than ""dodge the exploding missiles this boss sends flying at you and aim for its weak spot on its stomach"" you get simply get ""keep moving"". The game doesn't tell you how to fight the numerous types of enemies you encounter, you have to figure it out as you go. It's forgiving, but not too forgiving. For example, if you spent all of your energy trying to get through a certain area, there will normally be a station at the end to give you a one-time refill so you aren't completely ♥♥♥♥ed. The system of necessary, but constantly draining thermal energy is what really makes this game. There will be times when you absolutely have to decide between fighting a group of enemies in order to get the thermal energy they drop, while risking getting hurt and losing even more; or you can try to outrun the enemies, many of which are much faster than you, and leave behind their potentially live-saving thermal energy. There's no ""Restart from Last Checkpoint"" option in the menu, so these decisions need to be made quickly and you'll have to live with them afterwards. During boss battles, especially ones where you pilot a mech (which drain your energy at a faster rate), you will quickly find yourself taking note of where all the stores of thermal energy, ammunition, and cover are and incorporating them into a strategy.I'm not trying to make this game out as some kind of unholy, Dark Souls-esque death grinder, but rather this is the way that I feel that all single players games should be in order to be worth a full $60 price tag. Enough with the in-game hand holding incorrectly called ""hints"". Enough with ""boss battles"" that can only be won if you wait for a quicktime event or predetermined action in order to beat them. And even though it came out in 2007, it still looks and plays pretty good. Not enough single player experiences have genuinely hard levels, boss battles, or enemies. If you want a game that will give you a challenge, this is the game for you. A classic action/adventure game, starting off relatively easy and getting more and more difficult as you play through. Capcom is known for making good, challenging games. If only more developers could take a page from how a single player experience should be, at least on the harder difficulties.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely love this game. When I was a teenager my parents bought this for me on xbox 360 and I was blown away. When I saw it was on sale I had to get it. It's just as great as I remember it! I connected my xbox controller to my pc and I'm settling nicely in full nostalgic immersion.I had to nominate this game for the Steam Awards because that finally boss battle was, ""Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!""

												It's a pretty cool game. Storyline is awful, but it doesn't matter since this is one of those games that has a superb gameplay. As much as the game tried to ruin the fun by incoherent and silly story, it was a surprise that I would enjoy this game the way I did from start to finish. The Mechs looked great and it felt good to control them and maw down the nasty bugs. Every time a big battle with the bugs would take place, I turn on the score from Starship Troopers - ""DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER!?"".

												A storyline that is fairly interesting, paper-thin characters you won't give much of a damn about, with a sprinkle of barely running PC Port for flavour.The 3rd person gameplay in a new setting makes things interesting, adding in the use of controlling Mech to the mix, it all sounds good. Thankfully it plays good as well.There are only 3 things that bring this game down for PC:1. Shoddy Port: DirectX 10 version is borked, use DirectX 9 version instead. That does'nt end the Crash Problems, which     are random on every PC it plays it. Some people have experienced Crash-Free gaming. Even close to 10 years since it was released in 2006, Capcom has left this PC port to wither away...2. No Steam Achivements/SteamWorks: There are some seriously epic fights in the game, some even optional, its a pity to not have a badge claiming you single-handedly defeated the Giant Worm on the Plains.3. No single player replayability: When you finish the game, that is it. Done. Finished. Forget about the online modes, no one plays it online. You can't even watch the in-game movies once they have been seen in the campaign.For the price and age of the game, best to buy it when it on sale. Usually sells for US$5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Argueably the best of the series, Lost Planet: Extreme Condition is Japanese Studios at their finest.KAIJU! KAIJU EVERYWHERE! Lost Planet is a Science Fiction Third-Person Shooter that is everything you'd expect from a Japanese Kaiju film.Lots of guns. Lots of blood. Lots of Kaiju.Battle for survival on a frozen planet that is infested with Akrid. They come small, they come gargantuan. Those are the only sizes. It's amazing.You can carry two weapons as well as grenades and you have a grapple to reach high places.Since the planet you are on is frozen you must collect thermal energy to stay at a regulated temperature...otherwise your life drains until death.You stand alone against the swarm, will you survive?Never. Stop. Shooting.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games that came from Japan and one of my favorite stories in pc gaming. I've played this since its release year and it always makes want to adventure into unknown places and test my skills with the largest of Alien monstrositys I've ever faced. The graphics are decent, the combat is amazing, and the weapons plus mechs, aka VS's (Vital Suits) dominate all with awsome gameplay and action that takes you into things that blow your mind. I recommend this game for it's weapons and mounts mostly, but try it for yourselfs, see how you like it and let me know what you think.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really nice game if you want an action-packed adventure with some environmental exploration and great freedom of approach.The thermal energy mechanic might take a little while to get used to, but as soon as you wrap your head around it you'll be feeling like a real scavenger, looking around for every container and such, to get that glowing liquid that lets you survive, and you might also want to optimize your ammo usage for that extra survival flavour.The setting is very fascinating,although its background is too vaguely described.Enemies are varied and have cool designs, and they are quite aggressive and will swarm you if you're not careful.Bosses are usually huge and ensue epic battles.There are some cool weapons, but the best feature is the robots, there are different models that handle differently and have special moves and abilities, very nice. The stronger the robot, the more thermal energy it consumes, so it's all balanced and you gotta be a good player to survive.The grappling hook is very cool, you can do some nifty tricks with it, too bad that the game doesn't mention them in any way.There are some collectibles, not sure what they are for since I didn't look for them.Sniping makes the game easier but I recommend it on some very hard parts of the game, e.g. you on foot vs. 6 robots and 12 soldiers.It's playable with m&k, very very enjoyable, only the last ""corridor"" suffers from this layout.The multiplayer in this version seems to be unusable, what a pity.Had problems running it in dx10 with my 7870, played it in dx9 without problems, all to the max at 1920x1080.All in all an excellent shooty-shoot fest with a good japanese flavour that gives it a feel of a lovingly crafted capcom game.Took me 12 hours to play the campaign on normal, I'm an explorative player though, no point in rushing the experience. So if you're an ocd zergling it will probably last less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 29, 2013
												We are seeing games change. They way we get them, the way we hear about them, talk about them, and the way we play them. Lost Planet is one of the figure heads leading this charge of modernisation, albeit in a subtle way. Playable code was available, publicly, a whole eight months before the finished game itself, with multiplayer maps out three months before the final release. These demos attracted a groundswell of positive word of mouth for the game, the likes of which marketing people can only dream of in their very stickiest dreams.And now, we have the finished game. But is it like getting to spend longer with a good friend, or just an unwelcome house guest you can’t wait to kick out?Lots of people are using ‘old school’ as a phrase to describe Lost Planet, and they are all wrong. Just because the core game manages to successfully rekindle the feeling of fun many gamers may have forgotten, it doesn’t mean that it apes games of yesteryear. What it does do, and does very well, is to combine elements from other genres, and bring them together neatly. Take, for example, the feel of the game. It’s an action based shooter, obviously influenced by movies. But on some levels, it feels almost like an RPG – even better, it feels almost exactly like starting the RPG half way through – you know, right at the point where the game is getting good, and has just started giving up the best equipment for you to play with... The weapon set is, on one level, quite basic – Machine gun, Shotgun, Sniper, a couple of futuristic guns, and a selection of grenades - such as plasma to stun, or Disc for precision throwing and large blast radius. The grapple line offers some variation from the norm, but isn’t really utilised that fully, and its use is, for the main part, left to player discretion. But then you get to the mechs (VR suits), and everything moves up a notch. The VR suits are an open, blank slate of flexible, combat weaponry, not least because they feature customisable weapons - you can lug around different VR weapons, and quite literally bolt on or take off whichever you fancy. You can even fire these giant weapons on foot, which sacrifices a lot of mobility, but the freedom of choice and the chance of a last minute, desperate boss victory far out weight the fact you’ll have to stop to shoot. The VR themselves come in various flavours, from the basic, to those capable of massive jumps, and others that transform from walkers into burrowing tanks. You never get attached to any one particular VR, though, as they are liberally scattered throughout the levels and encourage you to be as promiscuous with their weapons and types as possible.There’s plenty to overcome with your new toys: The naturally occurring insect-like Akrid monsters, which neatly fit into the implied ecosystem, ranging from minor threats to screen filling bosses, with some that you’ll swear are screen filling bosses, when they are, in reality, only passing cameos. Each and everyone of their varieties wears glowing weak spots, target markers that give you tantalising obvious finishing methods, yet somehow never quite manage to become routine kills.While the Akrid are by far the best enemies in the game, the other, human opponents - the mercenary styled Snow Pirates, and the military like Nevec forces are obviously designed with care. But unfortunately, their AI script greatly threatens to destroy your sense of immersion, by having them act even dumber than the giant bugs. There are flashes of brilliance from them, particularly on the unlockable ‘Extreme’ difficulty, but more often than not, they simply charge at you so you can shoot them, or stand still while you slaughter them from afar, and are quite the bitter disappointment. But while the Akrid are the best enemies in the game, they are not the best opponent – that honour goes to the environment itself, the titular Lost Planet. So much more than just a setting, its vicious and hostile nature, whether out on the frozen snowbound surface, or deep below in red hot volcanic caves, sees your surroundings constantly demanding attention and careful management of available heat energy (gained from defeating enemies or stashes throughout the levels) to ensure success. This energy management system, T-Eng, is perfunctory on first play through, largely offering a safety cushion as it replenishes any health lost in combat. But on the higher difficulties, it becomes a much stricter mistress, forcing you into a very tightly timed resource management mindset, where risk and reward are everything, and winning the day by the skin of your teeth has never felt better.  Lost Planet also offers online multiplayer, for lobbies of up to sixteen people, and a smattering of game types, from command post capture to straight out deathmatchs. The eight playable levels offer quite a variation, with some new features – such as underwater sections – and all feature the VR suits on them for player carnage. It’s engaging and fun, with the addition of having to choose an online avatar, and a rudimentary levelling up system bolstering out the mainly stable and lag free games.Games like Lost Planet always come across as slightly insecure. By being so heavily influenced by Hollywood action movies, they never seem quite comfortable in their own skin, content to stand or fall based on the experience of game play alone. And like people everywhere, they find safety in numbers, always managing to bring along a friend. Now the law of averages says this friend will be annoying. The friend in this case is the cut-scenes. And oh, yes, my, how they’re annoying. Lost Planet suffers some truly dire and nonsensical cut-scenes. While hopes were initially high, with Korean actor Lee Byung-Hun being incorporated as your digital avatar Wayne, and Inafune’s obvious love for action and horror movies showing through successfully in his other titles (such as Dead Rising), it was only right to expect a little more. Unfortunately, it’s business as usual.Lost Planet doesn’t push into new territory with its story scenes, with terrible, shallow characters, who never really have clear motives or reasons, and change sides at the drop of a hat. Plot twists happen quite randomly, seemingly for the sake of it, and all of this is wrapped up in a large bumper hamper of cheap and over the top melodrama. Lost Planet, judged on its story scenes alone, would cause a lover of American daytime soaps to turn off in embarrassment. Luckily, though, there’s a cracking game lurking in-between these thankfully skip-able nuances. And the scenes themselves aren’t at all necessary for progression; that’s handled by a page of text briefing that clearly outlines what you are about to be doing, and precedes every level.Lost Planet is a welcome house guest. Challenging without being frustrating, empowering without being patronising, with small, wonderful discoveries, and giant, heart-stopping battles, it creates an amazingly consistent and sturdy game world that feels weighty and real. Lost Planet hasn’t outstayed its welcome, but at the same time, you won’t be asking it to move in.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had a ton of fun playing this game!Pros:- The combat is GREAT, punching akrid in the face with a 30 ton mech is really a nice sensation- A lot of different mechs, each one requiring a complete different approach- Huge Monsters (HUGE)- The graphic is still pretty good even after all this yearsCons:- The story is TERRIBLE, after playing this you will probably appreciate more even Twilight- The final battle, *SPOILER*Whoever designed it should be exile from our planet...after 9+ wonderful hours of game, feeling great in a juggernaut of metal, shooting bullets big enough to pulverize a car, for the final battle you find yourself flying in the brain damaged cousin of gundam, with huuuge energy sword...incredibly UNfunny to use, and slow like a dead frozen pig...using the same TWO attack over and over...and over...and over...andIn the end, it's a good game, to maximise the fun:1) When a cut scene start, mute the audio and read a comic...or a magazine...or count the cars passing outside, whatever you do, it will be better than following the story2) Have someone else doing the final battle, don't spoil yourself the memory of the entire game with that atrocity.

												I like this game a lot. If you like TPS (3rd person shooter) games and you are fan of mecha anime, it is game for you. Multiplayer is completely dead.Story is average with many cliche elements and it's pretty predictable - one man mercenary ""army"" (aka Rambo) taking down the largest organization on planet, yea right. Graphics is excellent. Use SweetFX too further enchance graphics. Problem - DX10 crashes (Capcom s.cks, many reported that problem) and explosions are super fugly. I really mean super fugly :-/.Audio volume is lowered when there are cut scenes.Gameplay is your typical TPS out there, and mecha are very good (except the last one). You can't die in normal difficulty because you can have so much energy (9999), it's just ridicoulous. Saving grace is that doesn't apply when you are in mecha - then you actually lose energy.Easily 3/4 of enemies are brain dead. Only threat are NEVEC soldiers and especially mecha but only in larger number. Akrid are joke except in one level (can't remember exactly) when there is huge swarm of big ones which just multiply from the ground after you kill them.Boss fights are from the joke to epic BS like on the last level 11. It is frustrating because of both broken K+M and gamepad controls so you can't properly control your new shining super mecha. Too bad Capcom comletely ruined this franchise - LP2 is terrible if not played in co-op mode (completely broken boss fights), and LP3 is outsourced c.ap.P. S.I don't know why they put two girls (btw Luka and Basil are not female names) in the game and one of them (Luka) has naked breasts. Come on, action is on the frozen planet, it's plain stupid!

The setting menus are full of bizarre terminology - mouse sensitivity is hidden in 'aiming style' which goes from 1-7, though even on the highest setting it is remarkeably low.I couldn't recommend this to anyone.

												An okay third person shooter with some faults. The thermal-energy system for health is interesting, but it really doesn't impact the game unless you play on the hardest difficulty. That said, on the hardest difficulty bosses can become an exercise in patience. Mechs and grapple hook are cool I guess. Final boss is one of those ""let's completely change the gameplay instead of testing the player on what they've learned throughout their playthrough"" kind of scenarios.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-> tl;dr: TPS with incredible graphics, good gameplay, boring plot and fun as hell. <-I've played this game back in 2008 and it was great, and now in 2015 I'm playing it again and it's still great! The graphics are still amazing (better than quite a lot of games released in 2014) and the gameplay definitely doesn't feel dated.The game is a linear TPS with giant monsters and mechas, although during half of the game you'll be walking on foot (which can be a pain since you're slow as hell) but as a plus you get a grappling hook when you're not riding a mecha that you can use to pretend you're spiderman.The game can get challenging at times (specially at boss fights and on later missions), but even on hard mode you'll never run out of ammo for your machine gun or out of T-Eng (what makes your life regenerate and power your mechas/energy guns) while you kill normal enemies.The plot is generic and the cutscenes, although beautiful, are long, boring and forgettable. Feel free to skip some, no regrets, no tears.I've never tried the online, so I can't say if it's good or not.But I doubt anyone still plays it online.Fantastic and cheap game, buy it.

												Pros:- Fun game play, weapons, mechs, and HUGE bosses.- If you play games for awesome shooting action and boss battles, you will love this.Cons:- Horribly hokey story/acting. A slap in the face to intelligent sci-fi narratives.- If you play games for good story and characters, you will be very disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lost Planet: Extreme Condition combines third-person shooting with mech fighting reminiscent of the old MechAssault games. Although Capcom did a somewhat lazy job with the port, it's fun and playable enough to warrant buying on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's the first game i ever bought on Steam (in 2008). My PC was so♥♥♥♥♥♥at the moment I bought it, this game ran about 15 fps at lowest setting and it was unplayable at all. In 2016 I remembered that i haven't finished that game and I started to play it on new rig. What I can say about graphics: thanks to DirectX 10 even in 2017 graphics looks pretty decent, considering that this game was released back in 2007. Gameplay is fun and easy (most of time) but on high difficulty this game transforms into some sort of Dark Souls. Speaking of hard difficulty: if you will beat the final boss you will remember it for pretty long time. It took me 3+ hours to beat him. This game is filled with a lot of cinematic cutscenes which makes this game only with them look like a good CGI movie. In this game combat system can be divided by two types: regular combat and mech combat. While in  regular combat you can get bored by running and shooting, the mech one will satisfy you throughout the whole game with their variety and weapon customization. And yeah, forget about multiplayer, it's been dead for years. Overall this game is fun and I recommend it first for those who like challenging games and SP games with good story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lost Planet is.. different. I've wanted this since it come out on PS3 all those years ago. I got it on steam and here's what I think.The story is decent but seems fragmented. You'll get an overall jist of the story but the details are somewhat overly complicated and hard to follow. The voice acting was ok but, for whatever reason, was never synced to the ingame character's speech (Lips moving out of sync with audio) and was a source of constant annoyance. The combat is fun and engaging. Only being able to carry 2 weapons at a time at times was annoying but not overly so. Overall I liked this game and hope the other installments are decent if not better, in the obvious ways, than this one.  Get this but not at full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Loved it when I was a kid, love it now.

												I actually find it very, very rare when I actually wish for a game not to have a story or to just get a proper remake. Lost planet is clearly one of those games.They've managed to openly bridge usefulness between man and mech in such a way that practically makes you think of when and where to use one, Varying in strength and use, they drain your power in exchange for brute strenth and armor, While the latter is questionable because with enough energy you are a tank god that only seems to fail if hit with a combo or a bad frame attack... For a known example, getting drilled into a wall, and getting up to the back of the entire machine and dying because their hitboxes are huge. It hurts the game none, but it's funny to see. Especially when some enemies will destroy your mech on sight but stare at you while you stand there on foot emptying consecutive clips ov vs weapons... Rare, but also funny. Anyhow, the balence is close to perfect, and often you will find yourself switching on the fly essentially playing multiple game roles alone on the fly, which is a pretty great way to balance vehicle use in a game.The game and it's areas cry for co op. I can't say it in a serious enough way. While climbing through the reaches and enabling beacons as well as climbing vantage points in pure platform shooting genius, You could easily see several other characters where they could and should have been provided there was co op. Yes, Lost planet 2 exists, It is addressed. But as I said earlier this game needs an excuse to re establish what this game feels like, which is an insanely futuristic scenario driven monster hunter game, and while borderlands and other co op shootings take a dive at certain elements in a way that only opens up the game to a specific genre, this game is an essential scream of game elements that could easily appeal to casual 3rd person shooter gamers, 1st person shooters, and even your dedicated robot gun slinging mech gamers. They could have milked this game dry and I don't know why they passed it up while they're holding games like street fighter over our heads still.If you enjoy exploring, shooting, platforming or even mech or vehicle games, this game deserves a go, and while most of the potential of this game is pure imaginitive on my end, Even without seeing the potential of this game if you experienced any game like it... (*Cough* Halo *cough*) You'll want to give it a shot at the least and join everyone else who wonders what capcom was thinking when they dipped our feet in the pool and then kicked us out with their sequels lost planet 2 and 3. Perhaps you should grab lost colonies, or even wonder why capcom hasnt considered punching us with a remake with co op or something. Or address the missing 30 years. Anything! This game is a smooth mix of concepts, and the only thing I can say to best describe this, is like a counterfeit that beats what it's modelled after, and is sold for much, much less. Yet is either ignored or cast out for being similar to something, though not entirely the same, regardless if it could have been better or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Background: Kinda enjoyed Lost Planet 3 and had always been interested in playing the first two since before. Not interesting in multiplayer so didn't even try.The Good:* Big bugs are fun and rewarding to fight* Simple controls and movement with an often useless map* Looks OK for it's age with some has great alien design* Decent story and characters keep things moving* Good weapons and great damage feedback gives impact to battles* Grapple works really well but could have been necessary more oftenThe Bad:* Graphics look bland and dated in places (not badly so)* Keyboard bindings sometimes ignored by in-game feedback* ConsolePortitus in the menus, movement and gunplay too* Small Bugs feel like cannonfodder and aren't ever a challenge* Walking speed feels sluggish and you rely on jump and slide* Thermal tick down could have been more interestingly usedImpressions: Overall I liked the game and it's design work and mechanics even if it was rather simple to beat and outside of boss battles it's mostly unmemorable.It might be unfair to expect more from a game of this age but I was left feeling that there was a cracking experience here that was dragged down by console port limitations. To be fair they give you a lot of rendering options for compatibility but sadly it didn't extending into updating the in-game feedback for what keyboard button to press in some situations. Recommended for:Conclusion: 6/10. A fun retro console like diversion that feel unambitious. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actually a fun action game, but skip the story.No, seriously, it's a bad story with holes and boring characters, and it's not even well told. Skipping it greatly enhances the gameplay. Not to mention that some level have virtually no connection to the story. The level on their own, although not great, are actually enjoyable.Even at it's current price (15€) it's probably worth your money, on sale even more so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a grocery list of issues and eight years has not preserved this game very well. This game is a poor console port and it doesn't hide the fact. The game will show you an X-box controller for controls when you are sitting mouse and keyboard in hand. The controls are very stiff and the character is a nightmare to control. Every jump or hookshot is an agonizing movement as you cannot control the character until the animation is finished. Switching weapons requires the character to come to a complete stop and then switch weapons. Most of the enemies in the game will sit around and wait for you to to come and kill them, they will rarely put up a fight. The human enemies in this game will sometimes shoot in your direction, but as long as you don't approach within 50 feet they won't pursue you. The game uses an energy mechanic that if you kill an enemy it will drop a puddle that you can collect. Unfortunately, the puddle won't last too long so if you kill an enemy from too far away you need to rush right for it to collect it. There are moments when you kill a bunch of enemies, then need to spend a lot of time to run around and collect all the energy. This requires you to stand directly on the puddle, no ranged collect, by far the most annoying mechanic for a majority of a game.Lastly, this game uses waypoint saves with no option of saving individually. This presents a problem during boss fights and bosses that will one hit kill you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Based on in game play time, it was about 5 hours, I'd add about another hour for the cut scenes between missions, giving it a whopping ~6 hours total play time for the campaign, a far cry from the 8h42m-9h15m listed on howlongtobeat.com.So you'll notice right away, this is a negative review, why? Did I enjoy the game? Were there any issues? How was the story? I'll go over all these below, but the negative review comes from the bottom line- would I recommend this game to a friend...? Nah...Let's start off with the meat and potatoes of the game.If you told me at the start this game was an anime episode, I wouldn't have believed you for a second. This is about human life settling on an alien ice planet, fighting vicious, gigantic alien beasts (Akrid).. No effin way this is an anime episode, man... but it is.The characters are overly cliched, in an anime style and fashion (google Rick or Luka & Lost Planet), and the story was extremely cliched. The main character loses his memory, meets these over-the-top anime characters, and then he immediately goes out to fight aliens and clear out their hives on their behalves. Facility doors open automatically for the Akrid creatures, key characters 1 shot enemies in cut scenes, even when aiming behind their back, and the bad guys don't ever shoot the good guys, even when they're vulnerable. UNGH, there were so many logical pit falls in this game!Combat wise I think I ran out of ammo once or twice, but it didn't last more than 5 or 6 seconds for me to just run over and pick up another gun off the ground. Your Akrid enemies have red weak points, sometimes hard to hit, especially with the technical issues below. Human enemies use various guns, turrets, and mechs or walkers of various power. Difficulty wise, I played on normal and only died on 1-shot Akrid kills and the final boss. I literally didn't die from any other skirmish or combat. Combat was kinda idiot proof with ammo, guns, and mech suits scattered EVERYWHERE.Spoiler: The final boss fight you hop in your gundam suit, flying over the planet surface while fighting the enemy gundam with your plasma swords. Yeah.... anime....Input wise, you'll want to play this game with a controller, as I did, to avoid the confusion of constantly being prompted for Xbox 360 buttons, this is a really negative point for a PC port, this criticism is similar to the one I gave for Dead Light. Keep in mind I didn't have an Xbox controller active when I started playing this game.Other technical issues plaguing this game included off sync audio during all cut scenes, even after restarting the game, and huge screen tearing issues during fights where big creatures or mech units were supposed to be causing the screen to shake or vibrate. Instead I got full horizontal screen tearing. I almost quit playing the game because of this as it was near impossible to aim at the stupid little red weak spots of the enemies.Bottom line, would I recommend this to a friend? No. The anime features, overly cliched story & characters, horrible 1 liners, and technical issues aren't worth the fuss. Did I have fun? Yeah, it was ok, but there were a lot of frustrations along the way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has cutscenes boy oh boy. In between each level you get about 10 minutes worth of cutscenes, totaling over an hour of cutscenes in the game. That is insane. It's like a movie and a game combined. At least it is entertaining and well acted I guess. But that is how Capcom makes all of their games besides Street Fighter so you just have to accept it. This is a great game. I like it better than LP2 because it doesn't have the weird mouse Y axis sensitivity issue that 2 does. And unlike LP2, you don't get your head caved in easily and have to respawn all the time. But if I had to pick, LP3 is the best game in the series. It is just more recent and more technically superior than the other games. But all in all, they are all fantastic games, one of the best game trilogy's of all time. I love all three games. The graphics in this game are (mostly) great and still hold up very well even today and the game runs great. This ""Extreme Condition"" edition puts in a bunch of new MP features which do not matter since MP for this game is deader than the hooker in my trunk, but I wasn't planning on playing MP for it anyway. The SP is a really fun time. Shooting big bugs, piloting mechs and shooting the fk out of everything in sight. One of the top games of all time, along with LP2 and 3 for that matter.It controls way better than LP2 so the combat is much better. All around a great series. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is all about 3rd person combat on foot or in mechs. The weapons and the control of the vehicles is pretty fun. The grappling hook is a nice touch and the thermal energy aspect moves the game forward. I love how you can pick up huge weapons off the ground and attach them, to your mech.What kills this game is lack of enemy AI, dull level design and poor enemy placement. You'll see the same couple of soldier enemies throughout the entire game and you kind feel pity for them as you gun them down. There are some cliche bosses to break up the monotony. But overall, the whole experience was bland and joyless.The final boss (level 11) is the worst thing about this game. You have to learn a whole new control system in order to do a contrived aerial boss fight. The battle is scripted in a way that makes is easy to finish if you know the sequence.The storyline, dialog and voice acting are remarkably lousy so you'll want to skip that. Don't even try to follow the story... there's no payoff and they almosyt never directly relate to the game itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lost Planet: Extreme Condition is a third-person action game made and published by Capcom. It throws you into the role of Wayne Holden, a Snow Pirate trying to rid the planet E.D.N. III of monstrous beasts known as the Akrid. These creatures when killed, give you ""thermal energy"" which is used to power your armor or mechs known as V.S. Suits, and provide a shield much like that found in Halo. Graphics: For a game released in 2007, the graphics are still great for today's standards. Every inch of snow, V.S. Suit, Akrid and weapon are rendered with sharp detail and the textures good. Sound: The ring of bullets piercing through the air or the screech of a two-story high Akrid are captured beautifully and really immerse the player in the game.Gameplay: The game is a fast-paced and arcadey shooter, with fluid controls and this allows for great mobility of both Wayne and his V.S. Suits. The gameplay is easy to get into and the gamepad configuration is laid out well enough for anyone to master.All in all, Lost Planet is one of my favourite games and I would give it a 7.5/10.

												Lost Planet: Extreme condition is the Steven Segal of console action games;  it’s not the best in class by any means, but it is hilariously fun and has a gritty B-movie charm all of its own.  Cut from the same cloth as Capcom games like Onimusha, at it’s core, LP is a 3rd person action shooter with a bit of platforming and a lot mechs to pilot.  The game competently juxtaposes the player between weak yet agile on foot action and the lumbering death machine you become when inside a mech, and you’re ever dwindling thermal energy bar (which results in death when it runs out) keeps you on your toes as you must replenish this from fallen enemies.However, the game really comes in to it’s own during the mech sections.  Excellent sound design of your crunching footsteps and deafening weapon fire makes you feel like a steel behemoth as you face off against increasingly huge alien bugs.  The bosses in particular are HUGE and a real joy to battle.  There’s also large variety of mechs, most of which have variable weapons which you can pick up or change, and some mechs are even ‘more than meets the eye’ if you know what I mean.  The Goods•	Very well optimized console port with smooth framerate and plenty graphics options•	Excellent sound design•	Colossal boss fights•	Great variety of mechs and weapons•	Using grapple hooks way before Arkham asylum made it coolThe Bads•	Awful storyline and clichéd characters (the amnesiac thing has been done to death)•	Average graphics (but good framerates)•	The only female characters are clearly just there for their cleavages•	Not much replay value – bosses become quite easy once you learn their patterns•	SPOILER see belowAll in all, I got this on sale, and despite how glaringly average this game was, I couldn’t but it down because MECHS AND GINGANTIC BOSSES. It might be Under Siege rather than Die Hard, but nevertheless LP is a total blast and real fun to play.  There are better games out there (Warhammer 4K Space marine, Vanquish, to name a few) but if you like this kinda console shooter, I would recommend it, although you might want to think about picking it up on sale. I think it was worth it for the boss fights alone...SPOILER – the final boss is atrocious.  After you spend the game honing you’re skills as a bad♥♥♥♥♥pilot of bad♥♥♥♥♥metal beasts, and using kick as weapons like giant shotguns and grenade cannons, the game throws you into a pound-shop Voltron complete with fancy laser swords and zero swag.  A dreadful end to pretty damn good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is interesting and fun at times but it often feels like its pushing you through a meat grinder. The game had the nasty habit to abuse cut scenes to the point where I was asking myself: ""when do I get to play?"" The missions feel very generic and I often feel that I am just going through the same gameplay with just one or two more turns in the map. The mission endings are weird to put it lightly simply because some missions will what feels to me, randomly end which is very confusing because sometimes Im not even through with the level. The narrative is not remotely compelling to me but neither are a lot of game narratives in my experience so that can be forgiven. The voice dubbing is awkward but also forgivable. This is a obvious console port but I feel that it did a fairly good job of it even though the in game help screens constantly flash the controler controls. Controlling a VS is a bother, I chose to run and gun instead simply because I had more control with the character outside of the mech. The game also like to place players in situations after they are done loading the level that pits them against a bunch of enemies shooting already before the player even understands what is going on.Having said all that I found it fun enough to say buy it if your bored out of your mind. But I would look else where for a while before settling on this game that hasn't aged very well. Also use backspace to exit the game, took me a while to figure that mess out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to start by saying I played with an xbox 360 controller and all the controls worked as attended. I might be a little biased toward this game because of nostalgia but this game brings some of the best game mechanics and gameplay of its time. The grappling mechanic in the game is one of the reasons I love Lost Planet so much. It is very smooth and an extremely enjoyable tool that separates from other shooters. This game is far from perfect as the story doesn't make very much sense and the ending will have you cringing like no tomorrow. The crazy amount of action in bad♥♥♥♥♥mech suits and the awesome characters make up for that. The graphics hold up well and the enemy diversity is great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a lot of problems. First: the controls. Everything is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow, from movement speed, to jumping, to standing up after getting knocked down (which happens a lot), to picking up a weapon, to switching weapons, to entering a mech, etc.The health system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the main reason why the levels can be very easy, even on the hardest difficulty level. There are levels you can basically run through without even fighting the enemies, getting hit by them all the time and still progress, because you have so much ♥♥♥♥ing health. I have no idea why they decided that the energy (needed for powering the mechs) is added to your health when you’re not using a mech. It totally breaks the game at some points and makes the difficulty curve very uneven.The levels aren’t designed well and the enemies, though cool and powerful looking, are boring to fight. The exception to this are the boss battles, which are clearly the highlight of the game and can definitely be fun and challenging (even with alot of energy stored up).The graphics are pretty nice for an early 360 game and at times there really is a lot of stuff going on with tons of enemies on screen and explosions everywhere. Sound is completely forgettable, as is the story/characters. Some variety in the environments would have been welcomed as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS IS A BAREBONES PORT. You can change your buttons, but many options are unexplained or lacking (camera turn speed is both poorly lacking and dosen't have a setting up to my shooter standards). If you're okay/ready for that, you may just enjoy yourself. Aside from the bare-port nature, the negatives amount to standard stupid Capcom writing and occassionally frustrating design. A massive worm can kill you in one hit, but can be avoided so long as you're willing to walk around the entire edge of the map. A section with a moving platform might be ended completely if you fail to kill explosive enemies in time. Later bosses can easily force you into no-win scenerios, made all the more frustrating by a lack of any easy ""restart from last checkpoint"" button. These things suck, but the shooting is fun, and few games let you use a grapple so ""freely"" (the short range you need for the grapple sucks, and you can't use it mid-jump).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A bit of a rubbish console port. Some of the on screen prompts are only good if you are using an Xbox controller, which I am not. I don't know what 'Y' is or what its equivalent key is and it won't tell me. Press 'Y' is a useless instruction. Is it jump? Crouch? Fire? Scratch may bottom and do a little dance? I haven't the foggiest.It may as well be in Aramaic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was excited to jump into this franchise but it’s not off to a good start. The game ended up being very disappointing. The story, writing and voiceacting are all laughably bad. The characters are very silly, the story is the entertaining sort of bad, the so bad its good because its fun to listen to the awful dialogue and I love how the game takes itself so seriously that’s also part of the fun of watching the whole thing play out, reminds me a lot of the original dead rising. Eventually though the story and cutscenes do start to get boring to sit through towards the end because the story starts to get convoluted and I just stopped caring, the cutscenes wear off when they stop being funny to sit through. The gameplay doesn’t excel at any aspect and it doesn’t do anything bad, it all feels very bland, because it is all just mediocre third person shooter run and gun gameplay with some interesting enemies to fight here and there and some decent level design which is why I don’t think the game is bad because it does have a few redeeming qualities. I was surprised how good the game still looks, the snow effects still hold up very nicely and its nice to look at even now 10 years later. I personally didn’t have much fun with the game though I thought it was a boring experience overall. 4/10 (Mediocre)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much every other review has summed up my feelings.Sure I didn't make it that far into the game but a massive turn away for me that wasn't mentioned was the lip syncing.Now that wasn't too bad for me, but my first sentence should give you insight.So when making up your mind on buying this game, read the other reviews.Rant Below.Also completely skipped my mind when the game started up, made by Capcom.If you're a fan of their games you'll probably like this but I have never liked one of their games, and developer is not a deciding factor for me. I've given Devil May Cry, Dead Rising and even the loved Resident Evil games multiple tries but they never stick. I guess I should just give up on Capcom.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why so many people like this game...The game is an Xbox port so therefore it has LOTS of bugs/glitches. I don't even know why I paid for an unfinished game like this one? The graphics are pretty good -- but only if you have a pretty top-notch PC, otherwise you have to play on the lowest settings. IMHO play this on the Xbox, don't buy it for the PC - waste of money.Also, the campaign kind of sucks. It was kind of bland and the characters bored me and the multi-player is dead (obviously).OVERALL found it boring, but play it if you like the graphics and the mechanics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rating: 6/10Overview: Third Person ShooterThe Good+ Graphics hold up very well despite its age+ Plenty of graphical/control options + Variety of different mechs you can control, each with their own strengths and weaknesses + Good atmosphere and setting + Good controls+ Lots of enemies on screen The Bad- The voice acting and dialogue are awful. - Level Design- The story is overly convoluted - Get knocked down...ok I'll just stand back up and....knocked down again....ok, let me just get up and fire my rocket lau.....knocked down again..LET ME STAND UP FOR ONE SECOND....Knocked down again... - Frustrating boss battlesConclusion:A game with a cool setting and an interesting premise that falls completely flat because of poor execution. Frustration really begins to set in on the later levels to the point where I was running through the levels as fast as I could just to get to the ending. I really wanted to like Lost Planet because I loved the setting and concept of the game but the gameplay just isn't all that fun. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sadly, I went into this really expecting to like it as I had played Lost Planet 3 before and thought that it was a pretty good game. However, after having gone through as much of it as I am willing to go through, which for the record is up to the last boss, where it decided to glitch out or something because the boss had no health left, the tower was stopped (I'm not even sure that was needed,) and yet, the boss would not fall down. See 


♥♥♥♥ing. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. 
A Screenshot of Lost Planet: Extreme Condition
By: Severs




 for proof. Yes, I got his health down first. Then I went for the tower just in case that was a thing because he wasn't falling over. Then I hit him again a couple more times just in case it was the ""pixel of health"" issue where he just had so little that it didn't show on the bar. But nope, in the end I had to say screw it, I win, I am youtubing the ending.The controls in this game are very unintuitive, and really horribly set up for mouse and keyboard by default, and with how many buttons there are that do things, I don't know that it could be made much better even with redefining keys. The boss battles are fairly uninspired, and either too easy or too hard. Just when you think you're about to be handed something badass, and go have a ton of fun, you realize how clunky the controls for everything are and almost wish you were on foot again. The story in this game is pretty good, nothing spectacular, but pretty good. All in all, I must rate this a 2/10 because of the clunky controls, and the way it cheated me out of my ending. With better controls, and a ending that doesn't cheat you, it could probably be a 6/10, but sadly Capcom dropped the ball on this one and I've gotta say no. If you've played the others and are curious about this one, just find yourself a playthrough on youtube.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10/2014 - Is this Game still in Beta because it's broken! Can't change options in Audio/Video section and unable to return to main window from this section either. From what I could see it has very limited resolution settings available; it’s crap so far and I haven’t even played it! Is it primarily designed for Console because playing it on a high end PC, it’s practically broken? I’ll reinstall it to see if I have a bad install.10/13/2014 - Okay, a re-install fixed my problem, mentioned above, but then game locked up launching the DirectX 10 version. I launched the DirectX 9 version and all is well. My first impressions got off to a bad start but now, after all that, it's not too bad for a 2007 game release.10/19/2014 - Okay now for no reason all configuration options are again corrupted and unable to change selections (mouse over item and it goes crazy/back and forth real fast). Unable to move my character in game; It's broken again.10/20/2014 - I'll try a complete uninstall and reinstall, 2nd time, to see if DirectX 10 launcher corrupted the game somehow.11/4/2014 - Performed a third Steam uninstall/reinstall and problem still exists. This game could be awesome but on Console system only and not recommended for Win7 PC platform. Even tried all compatibility modes with no improvements (all on Admin rights). My final recommendation is DON'T PURCHASE IT FOR THE PC PLATFORM - IT'S BROKEN! CAN'T CHANGE SETTINGS WITHIN GAME! MAY LOCK-UP IF YOU ATTEMPT TO CHANGE SETTINGS WITHIN ""PC SETTINGS"" OF THE GAME!

												A very bland game. The characters, story, and dialogue all feel like they were taken from a bad anime. Combat is boring save for a few of the boss fights, but even they aren't necessarily great either. Getting caught in loops of knock back from explosions and boulders is also super frustrating due to losing control of your character for like 3-4 seconds per stumble. The AI is pretty dumb, especially the human enemies. Being able to change weapons on a mech on the fly is cool, but often times I would accidentally change weapons when I was trying to enter the mech, which would lead to me getting hit again. The buttons to equip weapons and enter the mech should have probably been different. Speaking of mechs, the last mission goes full-on Armored Core for some reason (which wasn't that bad tbh, it just felt very awkward given the gameplay is so different from the rest of the game). I dunno. It was just really bland, and clunky at times. I can't recommend this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story and dialog was disjointed and non-sensical for most of the game.  Gameplay was OK but too repetitive until you got to the boss battles.  Machines and character felt too slow.

												Absolutely not. This game in mind numbingly frustrating. Not because of how much damage is done to you, but because EVERY SINGLE ACTION either knocks you down, or stun locks you. Enemies are bullet sponges and switching weapons makes you have to stop for a moment and switch out. The hook shot is around double the length of the main character and is much, much to short. Also, every time you hook on to something you freeze at the point of location and jump upwards costing you valuable time and usually resulting you getting knocked down by any shot.Thermal energy isn't a problem, but it can be tiresome to try and refill your suit or mech.The only weapons worth using are the lazer weapons, because either the assualt rifle does pitiful damage or the rocket launcher makes you stop to both fire and reload.Secondly the levels are so very bland. I understand it's an ice world, but there are no interesting land marks dotting the horizon or interesting interior levels. The levels are huge and you move at a snails pace. It's literally one of the slowest moving characters I have ever played.But, by far, the most annoying point of the game is being stun locked like an idiot over and over again by the bosses. Don't buy this. Go for something else or skip to the second game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game PLay is good and effects are great but it really sucks you cannot save the game except on completion of a mission. 3rd mission sucks because after you get everything and are prepared to assualt the worm and it destroys or eats you.  IF you get across to the next objective you cannot enter or proceed. Very sad it sucks after the first 2 missions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thermal energy-thing makes no sense whatsoever, because it's virtually impossible to run out of it. Why have it in the first place? I suppose those mecha's look kinda cool, but they're not realistic in the slightest. Don't even get me started on the dialogues, whoever wrote the damn thing should be fired. Characters are bland, the storyline is weak. I want my $3 back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A terrible game with peculiar fans.If you enjoy:-Slow movement-Slow interaction-2 weapons only-Slow climbing-Every action being cancelled by all hits in the game, specially the cluncky grappling system.-Bad guns sound effect with no good feeling.-Thermal system that tiks down like a ♥♥♥♥er (at least on hard), which will end you with so much Thermal thing that you are god and you don´t give a ♥♥♥♥ or with an irritating clock of death while you are stunlocked.-Stunlock, perma-stun, etc. You will be Stuned so many times by so many AoE attacks (missiles, rocks,whatever) that is not even funny.-Smoke, so much smoke/snow particles that you wont see a thing, almost all the time, but don´t worry, tha tAI will see you.-Bad AI, bugs are ok i guess but dudes will stand in place and be shot in the face, but don´t worry, they will spame missiles even if they don´t see you antmore (which gnerate a ♥♥♥♥ ton of smoke and stunlock!)-Generic characters-Story...forget about that, is there even a story?-Cluncky controlls (you have to maintain pressed the crouch button to then press jump to dodge, like seriously....)-Mechs are even clunkier, slower, not really more powerfull (specially when you want to go inside one quickly and you characters decides to instead take one of the weapons of the mech).-Boos characters that will not stay still for a freaking second, like absurdly epileptic bosses; this while they spam smoke/snow particles, ♥♥♥♥ton of AoE attacks with stuns, a really slow character that is easly cancelled every action and that has to stop, yes stop running to change a weapon.-Crashing on DX 10 option-Terrible checkpoints.-So much moreI am really serious here, this game has so many issues is not fun. I don´t know what were the standars on 2007 but this game has not aged well on 2014; and i am okay with mindless shooting, i am okay with the preassure (i liked Dead Rising 2 for example), but this game makes no sense, only thing i can think is the game not being so terrible (the issues less apparent ) on Normal Difficulty instead of Hard (although i thin there are even more difficulties.)I payed 3.75 for this game and regret it, beware, you have to love this game a lot to really like it.

												Capcom. I feel like I should celebrate being able to run n' gun rather than tank-shoot (I know RE 6 addresses this too), but Lost Planet's shooting is just lame. I can't see a reason why this shouldn't be a first-person shooter. Your character model isn't very interesting, it doesn't immerse me, and you have to press zoom multiple times to get back out of zooming with an iron sight weaon. And no, you don't actually use iron sights. The camera just hops forward. Also, zooming with any gun other than the sniper rifle is pointless. The assault rifle seems to have 100% accuracy as long as a target is close enough to actually shoot at. You cannot roll, there are no special abilities, the controls that pop on screen are only for an xbox controller, meaning you have to go through the options and figure out what xbox controller button corresponds with each keybord button and so forth. It's just lazy. It's a port and it feels like it more than most games. There are a lot of ports I like and that don't bother me being ports. This is not one of them.That's just the controls and presentation. The bosses can one shot kill you, even if you're legitimately giving it your all. There is no quick time even to escape death, either. Giant worm lunges at you and despite running perpendicular to it, its mouth touches you? Welp, you're dead and have to play the first 5 minutes or so of the level over to get back to it and start the fight over. I believe I could have eventually beaten this boss if I really put more time into it than my first three attempts, but this was just the third mission in an eleven-mission game and I already wasn't having fun. This was on EASY DIFFICULTY! Yeah. Anyway, if you're a masochist who loves losing at video games and spending too much time on games with too high of a difficulty, only later in life realizing that you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥away your time and will be dead soon, then you'll love this game. For people who like fun games and games with difficulties that do not lie, I would recommend that you avoid this title. I got it for free (I don't even remember what it came with) and was still disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Discovered Realm™: Manageable Weather is a pest-killer simulation in which you play as Wayne Brady trapped in a blizzard with a severe ant problem. Eventually the pest-control group called NEVEC which stands for ""Never encounter venemous Eriophyidae caryana"" That seeks to destroy nut-tree-eating gall/and or rust mites, thus leading to a heated conflict amidst the blizzard as both battle for dominance of the pest-control market. In your battles, the harmonica system given to Wayne by Gale Harold will prove to be invaluable; healing his injuries by using the points that you collect from exterminated insects, essentially making you invincible until you run out of points.There are a few clunky sections in which your exterminator tools will not work properly and the crosshair seems a little sluggish without any option to change it in-game, but for a PC port of a very early Xbox 360 game, it still looks very good and performs well enough; the bugs look very detailed and insectious.Overall, if I had to rate it, I'd give it a 5/10 from an outside point-of-view. You like it or you don't; but personally, if I gave a rating on my own feelings, it would be a 7.5/10 for the impressiveness at the time of release and inventive mechanics. The story and cutscenes make no sense, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lost Planet 2 has better cutscenes and visials in some places, but gameplay wasn't as enjoyable.Lots of mechs to hop in and ride around blasting hordes of Akrid, with man-sized shotguns and lasers to swap out and carry on foot if you like.MP is dead unfortunately, but the single player is great as is.If you like mechs and blasting crowds of monsters, you will enjoy this!

It pushes the edge of your graphics card systems, it provides HOURS of fun, it is very difficult to play and you can't go wrong with it. Games like this are an almost, ""near"" model of what PC games should still be at. With incredibly long gameplay, and difficulty you won't find games like this much anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game a lot back when it came out, and I had to play it on Windows Live.  Those hours are lost to time, and my steam playtime doesn't reflect my actual playtime.This is important to note because I played a lot of the mutliplayer, and the multiplayer is one of the best parts of this game.  I wish that it was still a part of the Steam version of this game.  Not to say that Steam isn't hosting servers, but that there's nobody playing, so I don't know.The single player is fun.  This game feels like a 3D version of a Megaman X or ZX game, which makes sense condifering Inafune was one of the heads of the design team.  The core gameplay is rock solid, ""arcade"" thrid person shooter.  You know what every mechanic in the game does after briefly playing with it, and the game encourages you to push the limits of what you can do with those mechanics.  I'm mainly talking about the grappling hook, which seems to be endlessly functional.  Any other game like this would be rife with glitches, but Lost Planet defies you to throw yourelf up walls and wedge yourself in corners, never once have I encountered a clipping glitch that made me reload or restart.  The game ends levels with boss fights in the same way Megaman does, with unique bosses in unique environments, which makes the game feel even more ""arcadey,"" despite it's serious tone.The weapon variety herein is absoutely fantastic.  Automatic rifles that will fire with pinpoint accuracy at any range if you stand still.  Shotguns that knock enemies off their feet.  Rockets that deal rediculous damage on hitting a target, and splash damage if you don't, and come in handy pistol sizes.  Sniper rifles that feel extraneous next to the fully automatic ones noted above, but give you a nice zoom-in of yoru enemy flipping backwards when you headshot them.  A laser gun that spits damage.  A ball-lighting gun that paralyzes and still does damage.  And then there are mech versions of each of those weapons.  And then you can take those weapons off of the mechs, and use them yourself as a puny human who's dwarfed by the guns you're weilding.  And mechs get homing laser organ guns, genade launchers that split their projectiles apart in midair, and pile bunkers that you can also use on foot.  They also get automatic lasers and cannons that you can't pick up, but you still have that pile bunker.  Grenades in this game are a treat: the normal frags are satisfying and concussive to enemies, the plasma grenades will stun and eject pilots from their mechs, the stickybombs are shaped charges that wreck mechs and do double-duty as proximity bombs, fuel-air bombs are terrifying and insta-kill deadly in multiplayer, and you also get frisbee grenades.  Why don't other games have frisbee grenades?As for mechs, every mech feels unique, but all mechs fit into a tier system.  Most mechs have a unique ability, some have several, but some mechs are just better than others.  You can just get ""the best mech"" and never want to let go of it, because it is just the best.  In single player, this isn't a huge problem because the game progreesively ramps up the power of its drops and spare mechs you can hop into as you go along.  In multiplayer maps with mechs, this becomes a problem, because the first minute of the match turns into a race for the best mech, and then the next minute is one guy surbstomping every player they can find before taking enough damage to be ejected and pulped by gunfire.Multiplayer is basically the best part of the game (the core run-and-gun gameplay and the weapons), but with and against other players.  Instead of the Imperial Stormtrooper gunners or Starship Troopers bug hordes, the game throws at you into multiplayer maps that are large enough to get lost in, but not large enough that enemies can't find you, and expects you to hold your own against people who are just as grappling-hook-cabable and gun-handy as you are.  Matches come in several varieties, including capture-the-points, deathmatches and team deathmatches, capture-the-flag, humans vs bugs, and maybe some other gamemodes.  Nobody cares much about the others, because deathmatches, CTP, and bugstomping are so much fun!  The maps are far more creative than any military FPS on the market, and I liken them to Battlefront 2 maps because of how huge and varied they are.  The megaman level design shows its face here, with lots of verticality and the expectation of players to grapple around onto towers and ledges.  This is would fall apart in many other games, but because the core game is so refined, it's easy to grapple and run around quickly whilst maintaining situational awareness.One map in particular, the in-building ""two towers"" map, was one of the best CTF maps I have ever played, if only because of the diverse weapon design and the wicked chokepoint skybridge between each team's tower.  That's just about the only way to get to the other team's flag, and the game turns into a match to see who can survive the player-made guantlet of sniper fire, grenades of every variety, stickybomb mines, and machinegun fire long enough to make a break and sacrifice themselves as a distraction for the rest of the team to funnel through and overwhelm the enemy.  The pushes back and forth, and the struggle to maintain control over the exits to the skybridge inside the enemy tower so as to avoid the WW1-style entrenchment that happens when the fight hits the bridge, those games are forever burned into my brain.Why is this game not the best thing ever?  Well, the campaign is short.  And the story, while interesting, is simple and burried beneath bad acting and a horrible engish script.  It's so bad I can't imagine that the translators had much to work with on the Japanese side.  It's laughably bad, and if you like that kind of thing the cutscenes herein will make your day.  There's a weird ""Rising Revengeance"" vibe to the cutscenes, especially when talking with this game's verison of Sundowner.  The character designs are interesting, but sometimes silly and sometimes forgettable.  The characters themselves aren't terribly memorable either, ironic considering the main protagonist has amnesia.  Also, the gameplay feels very fun and again Megaman-esque, while the story seems very serious and self-sacrificing, leading to some of that good-old-fashioned lugonarrative dissonance.There's a lot of frustration towards Lost Planet 2 and 3, and from my perspective, that all comes from players of Extreme Condition that didn't get a more polished (and better-scripted) version of this game.  If the multiplayer community was anywhere near as active as it was in the first three years of this game's release, I would say to buy the game right now for full price.  As it stands, the game can only offer its campaign to showcase its gameplay, which is a dead shame.  If you played this game back in the day, and you can get yourself a Steam key from the box or snag the game for 66% off, do it, play it through again, and hope the community can drum up some multiplayer action once in a while.

												I skipped this one back in 2007. Lost Planet came along in a post-Halo-2 era when there was a whole raft of console-focused sci-fi shooters trying to steal Halo 3's thunder. Killzone, Resistance, Crysis, TimeShift, and on and on. It was easy to lose one in the onslaught, though Lost Planet does try for something a little different: a pyrotechnic, anime-inspired third-person adventure that feels like a sloppy mash-up of Metal Gear Solid and Gears of War.The Good:* The level design-- where you're often frantically hopping into a stolen mech right in the middle of a pitched battle and then ejecting out again as it gets blown up around you-- is rad. Titanfall obviously cribbed some notes from this one.* The game still looks faaaaantastic with the graphic settings cranked up. The snow, dynamic shadows, smoky explosions, & even the fur trim on your coat still looks impressive.* The cut-scenes are anime af, while still telling a story that's way easier to follow than a Metal Gear plotlineThe Bad:* Boss battles often seem more difficult than they're supposed to be, because of sloppy controls or bad camera placement. (Why the hell can't you go first person while piloting a mech? Too often you're blindly firing at an enemy while staring at the back of your own armor.)* The basic enemy soldiers are laughably bad shots, like stormtrooper-level bad. This is fun in its own way, but can make some stretches a little tedious.* That straightforward storyline sometimes runs a little *too* obvious, and left me wishing for a bit more Metal Gear weirdness.Not much else to add. Surprisingly recommendable!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												has many many annoying features such as being throw like a doll on every attack and take 5 seconds the fully stand back up just to be knocked back down even though you literally cannot die until your energy is gone (Unless youre in a mech suit and the suit blows up killing you instantly for whatever reason) as you sit and watch until your energy slowly goes down you would wonder was this game worth the money.......sorta get past the bad voice acting, unlikeable characters, bad mechs, slow reaction times, unpauseable cutscences, and (my favorite) huge♥♥♥♥♥smoke clouds that get all in your face and view making so you cannot see.

												Lost Planet is a 3rd person shooter, where you use a variety of futuristic weapons to fight against giant, alien insects and corporate NEVEC troops.  You fight both on foot and in mechs known as VS.  This game takes place on an ice- covered world known as E.D.N. III, and most of the levels are in either barren, snowy wilderness, or inside some sort of heavily defended, massive structure.In terms of gameplay, the most unique feature is the use of thermal energy (T-ENG).  When your health is depleted, you use your T-ENG to refill your health bar.  Your T-ENG depletes rather slowly over time.  When your T-ENG is depleted, your health bar depletes over time, and you will freeze to death.  It is an ice world, afterall.  You refill your T-ENG by killing enemies or by destorying vehicles/ structures that my contain some form of thermal energy.  There are also posts that can be activated to restore a large amount of T-ENG.  One of the strongest points of this game is the story.  It isn't particularly complex, but the characters are so enjoyable, that they draw you in, and make you care about them and their ice planet.  Pros:-I loved the characters!  -Most of the gameplay is very fun in a simple, traditional sort of way.  -The T-ENG system is a clever way of reminding you that E.D.N. III is a very cold planet, and it adds a sense of immersion.-For the most part, the game on normal difficulty has a ""just right"" feeling when it comes to challenge.  At times it was frustrating, but it rarely ever feels impossible.   Cons:-It's easy to get stun locked at times.  This is especially true during boss fights when your VS gets destroyed, and you have to run to an unoccupied VS.  You just get hit over and over again by giant rockets and energy weapons, and it feels like you have to stumble and ragdoll your way over to that VS in order to survive.-Many of the control prompts in the game are given to you with XBOX360 buttons, even if you are using a mouse and keyboard.  It can be frustrating to learn how to pilot each VS, since you have to figure out which XBOX buttons correspond to your keyboard keys.Overall: 8/10    ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												one of the few consolations for people who got the xbox 360 early, the real charm was always in the multiplayer, and it stands miles above its two trash sequels.  If anynones ever down to start a group and relive the multiplayer, add me plz			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+The Story is average at the best but I loved Luka's boobs.+Combat system is very good. and I quite enjoy it. +Missions are nice and little open world :) that i really liked. with snow. +Graphics is alright really even on DX9.-bad port from XBOX360.  VS robot special moves keys  are Z/X/C since there are not in the game settings.  -NO SUPPORT From the developers on the bugs/patch -Multiplayer is dead. but is understanable... the game is quite old. -It seems that you cant play in DX10 at full HD in windows 8.1 In order to play 1920x1080 in DX9 you have to change the resolution in config fileC:/#USER#/AppData\Local\capcom\lostplanet\config . doesn't work in DX10. ---Overall for the PC version 6/10I reccommend this game on sales only. -STRICTLY-  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My thoughts on Capcom's Lost Planet series.I am going to talk about Capcom's title Lost Planet 3.I believe they went backwards and here are the reasons why:Capcom focused on visuals and large areas of beautiful set design in order to garner sales. Players would be led to believe that because of they way to designed Lost Planet 1, they could explore every square meter! They had visions of grappling large caverns, jumping over stalagmites and swinging from stalactites while slaughtering enemies with interesting and unique weapons.Instead they were given invisible walls, designated grapple spots, generic weapons, predictable AI and bad voice acting (their lips did not sinc with their words).Lost Planet 1 had limited map volume but at least every square meter of it could be grappled. The only problems I had is that the player could not jump AND grapple. I found this annoying and could have made gameplay 100% better. In Lost Planet 1, cover was not a key press used only in certain areas like in Lost Planet 3 nor did I have to find that *perfect* spot to place my grapple. In Lost Planet 1, I could grapple any surface - even enemies for additional damage! I think Capcom looked at Mass Effect 3, saw how much attention they were getting (meaning money) and copy/pasted their combat system without regard to innovation.Mistakes that are made that erodes gameplay most game companies practice:1. They give you no option for variable FOV and the option to use first person view.2. They put invisible walls on maps, turning huge beautifully rendered areas into a museum with only limited pathways.3. Give the player generic weapons that have no real bonuses or drawbacks in choosing one over the other.4. Giving infinite ammo with no drawbacks.5. Enemies that have the AI equivalent of Aliens/Colonial Marines. This is probably the second most insulting thing you can say about a game companies implement of AI next to Mind Hack (which is the WORST AI implementation in the history of gaming).If you have nothing to risk, you have nothing to feel good about gaining. Remember the Jedis in the prequels hacking apart the main enemies (droids) by the dozens? Yeah. No tension equates to no elation from victory. Make the AI smarter and more creative.

												Don't buy this game... not recommended at least.Where do I start with this piece of junk...?It's a third person shooter alright. it has some interesting options for aim customization (you can adjust the way the crosshair moves relative to your character and such) but that's about all that's positive about the game. Even with highest graphics settings, the game looks basically just cheap compared to what was first shown as ingame footage. Aside from all that the Gameplay sucks. I started the game on medium difficulty (there's three in total) because I wanted to get a quick impression... ended up continuing it because I just didn't want to play all that again. The thing is. the game is just ridiculously easy, very few of the enemies barely even manage to attack you at all most of the smaller monster just seem to... be there to be shot and not much more. They move like half a kilometer per hour and do some (very well animated though) moves... but they don't attack... at least they didn't attack me. Human enemies just stand still at their predefined spot most of the time and act as if they were shooting in your general direction, though I have yet to be significantly hit... they just can't shoot straight. Except for Rocket Launchers... those things, even if they hit somewhere remotely close to you, will send you flying (they don't actually do much damage though) which get's me to the next point: Ridiculously large health pool, constantly refilling too from a pool of ""thermal energy"" which can be found in simply everything (frozen old cars, barrels, EVERY SINGLE ENEMY ... you get the idea) so dying is basically not an option, aside from Capcom's typical animated special killmoves that some bosses do.Leveldesign and story are in equal parts boring and rightout stupid. In fact, starting a mission will give you a screen telling you ""Objectives: Go there and clear the place out."" ... no kidding... that's actually exactly what every mission comes down to. Then you'll start the mission, instantly standing somewhere between a few dozen small enemies and a lot of stuff lying around that needs to be broken to fuel up on some energy and ammunition. Then you try to find where the heck you're supposed to go since it's sometimes completely unobvious (there's lightposts pointing in the direction where you need to go) and end up fighting a slightly harder foe (usually a mech with rocket launchers that moves around completely stupidly or a giant monster with some nice special animations.... and not much else), then the screen goes ""Mission Complete"" ... mission over... cutscene with some horribly bad written plot and next mission. The Game does not feature any kind of advanced combat mechanics like cover, zoomed aiming or such, so basically.. it's generally uninteresting and unrewarding.I've never got so bored from playing a shooter... seriously...The game DOES feature a rather well-modeled kind of sympathetic main character though... if it's any help....
