												35%I'm going to be honest with you. I sat down to write this review for Dead Horde the top down, run and gun shooter from DNS development, but I had a tough timeplaying this game for the 18 hours I put in to get 100% completion. Iit's not that the game has complex themes of survival that are hard to sum up or anything like that, it's just that it's such a boring paint by the numbers experience that I often had trouble remembering just what happened during my time with the game.From blockbusters like Dead Rising and Left 4 Dead to indie darlings like I made a game with zomb1es 1n it!!!, there are a lot of zombie games on the market, and you're going to have a hard time finding one as bad as Dead Horde. It's predictable, has no personality and does nothing that the...excuse the term...hordes of zombie games has done before it. Dead Horde places you as one of the lone survivors of a zombie apocalypse and your job; your only job is to shoot and blow up as many zombies as you can to survive. Sound familiar? Dead Horde employs a top down view that finds you holding down one button to shoot and another to move forward and that's it. Sound familiar? It should. It's all been done before in games like Zombie Apocalypse and I made a game with zomb1es 1n it!!!, but the key is that those games did something to inject the formula with a novel feeling. Zombie Apocalypse for example featured four player co-op (as opposed to 2 player here) and I made a game with zomb1es 1n it!!! was just plain silly, here we get none of that.And there we have the key problem with Dead Horde. It's obvious that the developers have played the key zombie shooters of this generation and have lumped all of their key features into their game. For instance there's an almost carbon copy of Left 4 Dead's Boomer in the game. It's a pretty widely accepted fact in the gaming industry that the zombie shooter is a dated and stale genre and it's titles like these that offer absolutely no new ideas that are the perfect example of that.Throughout Dead Horde you'll gain the option to upgrade weapons at certain points and while it's a cool addition, in reality it does nothing for the gameplay. All of the weapons feel the same and lead to the feeling of merely grinding through each section from beginning to end. There's no real reason to explore, and you'll find yourself holding down two buttons and moving in one straightforward direction (well, except when you'll have to back pedal from enemies). You know, it's funny - I never thought that the zombie apocalypse would be this boring.If Dead Horde had a saving factor it would be the vehicle sections which do tend to offer a break from the monotony of the game. It's quite fun to mow down the undead in a jeep or utility truck - the first few times, but when it happens again and again, it loses its appeal quickly. It's also important to note that the vehicle controls never really feel as tight as they should, and they often feel like you can't get control no matter what you do.You've already played Dead Horde, even if you've never touched the game - it's all of your favorite parts from all of your favorite zombie games, only here they aren't done as well and have no personality. Dead Horde is an obvious attempt to grab a piece of a large yet dwindling audience. There are a ton of great zombie shooters on the market; hell there are a lot of competent zombie shooters on the market, why choose this one?			",245,47,4,39,15,2,55

												When I first reviewed this game a year ago with a negative rating, I had not beaten it. Now that I have beaten it, I would like to still give it a negative rating but thoroughly explain why.First off, the price tag is wrong. This game should be in the $5 bin. I don't say that because the lack of story (you don't play a game like this for story), or for the graphics (I don't mind the old look, I rather like it.). This game is literally a one trick pony. In each level you fight zombie runners. Lots of them. Mobs. Oh, and they are just as fast as you. A zombie is as fast as a living trained soldier. Yeah, makes no sense, but it sure makes the game unforgiving and just plain stressful to play.The look of the game is rather dark. The levels are huge, and within each level you work your way from checkpoint to checkpoint, clearing zombies until you reach the end of the level. One of the major issues is that the levels are fairly long, and there is no save option. Even though the game saves the checkpoint, it only saves it while you are in game. If you leave the game, you will have to restart the whole level over again. The controls are very simple and I had no trouble playing the game. The dodge button is your friend, since you cannot outrrun the zombies. The sound effects and soundtrack left something to be desired, since only one song plays briefly when a horde rushes you. I really wish they could have come up with a few more tracks to change it up, but oh well. Now to fight zombies you need good guns. You start off with an Assault Rifle with unlimited ammo. This serves to be your primary gun. There are stores scattered amongst the levels so you can buy upgrades for your gun and buy new guns, such as a Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, a Lightning Gun, and a Minigun. There are also different kinds of grenades to purchase. The major damage weapons don't appear until near the end of the game. This game is so difficult that honestly the upgrades are not too noticeable. The ""mutants"" of this game are identical to the ones from Left 4 Dead, with the exception that there are no witches. So imagine the runners of Left 4 Dead with the mutants and thats who you fight, with little to no variance. Just zombie mobs. For every walker, there are at least 100 runners coming at you. I'm honestly scared to see how this plays on Normal difficulty. As you kill zombies, you earn money and sometimes health packs are dropped if you need healing.Honestly, the whole time I was playing this game, I kept thinking about how great the games Zombie Shooter and Zombie Shooter 2 are. They are basic zombie shooters (soldier trying to stop a zombie virus), but it has RPG elements, like choosing stats for your hero (male of female). Not only that but you can pick fun perks that enhance your character. You get to buy guns and equipment to help in your missions. The soundtrack is great, a pumping techno/rock mix that is just great for killing zombies. The games definitely have more of an arcade look to them, but the level design is a lot more interesting then Dead Horde. Plus, you can get Zombie Shooter 1 and 2 for the price of Dead Horde (if you buy the two pack). Seriously, check those game out instead. There are even free demos so check it out. I wish Dead Horde would have had a demo, because that would have saved a lot of people's money.			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												The game is OK but is repetitive. Go forward, if zombies appear keep shooting going backwards so they get in line and kill them all in the same spot, then continue move forward. You'll get bored quickly.			",1472,423,125,86,261,22,172

												A most marvelous mixture of BLAND, TERRIBLE, and POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP.The game is a sorry excuse for an isometric twin-stick shooter: the controls are sluggish, the guns offer no gratification, movement is awkward and it's SUPER EXCITING to trundle through levels such as TOWN, HARBOR, and FACTORY that are right out of a Blender tutorial.The graphics are the absolute bare minimum: every single enemy is dark grey, the game takes place at night and there's barely any light. Also, trees cover about half of the screen whenever you run into one.Among the sea of regular zombie gray, you'll occasionally run into big fast gray, barfing fat gray and leaping gray. That's it.And it's so well optimized, you'll find yourself enjoying the 4-5 frame animations in glorious 10-30 frames-per-second.tl;dr: You've been warned - this game is a heap of dried up dung.

												It’s nearly the same like the game „Primal Fears“. So everyone who loved the Game Primal Fears should buy Dead Horde too. You have other maps but the weapons and upgrates are the same. For all those who don’t know „Dead Horde“ or „Primal Fears“:Both games are Horror-Action-Shootergames. The view is third person like but with a little bit practise also first person shooter players will love it. You can play those games alone or with a coop-mate. If you have the possibility to use teamspeak, skype or steam-voicechat together it’s really fun (yeah sadly there is no voice communication in the game). You can choose your weapon and with making money (from killing monsters or collecting) you can buy new weapons or you upgrate the once you have.The enemies have different healthpoints and make different demage. You also never know how many enemies will spawn in the next moment. So you better take care of your own health and of course if you play coop also of your teammate!Good luck and have fun!

												As a zombie fan craving for zombie games I would say Dead Horde is a huge disappointment. Not quite the Dead Nation that I was expecting! Maybe I was expecting too much... maybe not since Dead Nation is also an indie game...Aside from the poor graphics and art style, my main concern with the game is the gameplay itself. The shooting kinda feels tedious as the weapons sound bland and have a low rate of fire. Also, killing bullet sponge zombies is just unsatisfying even when the weapons are upgraded to their fullest.The most satisfying parts of the game are when you get the opportunity to drive armored vehicule as they allow you to take down hordes of zombies with a mounted machinegun. Unfortunately, the horde setup feels terribly uninspired as pack of zombies always appear after picking up ammo, money and health boxes laying on the ground.Overall, Dead Horde offers no sense of danger and terror that would come with a zombie outbreak setup. The lack of work on the environment makes every level generic at best. Not to mention the poor storyline which give no sense of progression.If you want to play this game because you can't play Dead Nation on PS3 then restrain yourself and do everything you can to get a hold on Dead Nation. I'm dead serious.Rating :4.0			",700,97,7,58,33,5,62

												Right now. 5/10Fun, cool, and has a challenge.But some stuff makes no sense. All zombies go faster than your character and take tons of bullets to kill. The fat zombies can some reason move 3x the speed of anything in the game and takes like a quarter of your health out if it touchs you. Plus I noticed pushing dive or shoot, it takes some time to respond.			",157,7,1,15,4,1,3

 pew, pew, pew, roll, pew, pew, roll. That is all you do in this game, literally. On top of it being about as fun as masturbating with a cactus its also chock full of bugs, I found 4 in the short time i played it - one was a game breaking bug. If you buy this game you have made a grave mistake and show very poor decision making, your life is probably a mess, if you get it in a bundle don’t bother installing it.Anyways, in short, I didn't care much for this game.

												This game is one of those rare instances where you can tell the developer didn't quite understand(or care) about the engine. You don't have to play for more than five minutes to see that the physics of this game were probably moddled from a racing game of some kind. All characters ""drift"" instead of making proper turns, enabling you to get some cheeky circle moves in, completely defeating the AI, which seems to be the ""run diectly at the player"" variety... which is fine for a zombie game.The Good:-This is a Zombie Shooter, and is fun in small bursts.-Once you adapt, the controll is very good.-It dosen't look that bad on lower settings, and runs fine on my toaster of a computer.-Enviroments are very well crafted, and some simple but nice puzzlesThe Bad:-Seemingly little variety in enemies.-Game flips back and forth from mind-nummingly linear to ""where the heck do I go now"".-Small, repetitive selection of sound effects.-Some sound effects are played in ambiance, and then used to trigger doors and such.-Devoid of story,I love zombie games, but I wouldn't recommend this one. For a quick multiplayer it seems good, but as a singleplayer experience it's not, and that's my drawing point. If you're looking for a story, pass this one by.			",469,218,7,82,79,7,68

												Dead Horde, as a co-op game, shows a lot of potential. It's severely hampered by bugs and poor gameplay mechanics.While the aforementioned potenial has it appear as a very good game on the surface and early game. Later game becomes annoying and hard for all the wrong reasons. There's bugs that prevent you from moving at times when absolutely nothing is blocking your path, attack animations are completely irrelevant as attacks will hit the moment the enemies start their animations and not when the attacks actually go through. Worse still, combat later game boils down to killing all the enemies before they get to the point they completely overrun you. The game also has an elevation system, but the combat does not compensate for being a higher elevation than your target.All in all, this game is mediocre, and that's being extremely generous.If you really want to get this game, wait for a sale. It is most definitely not worth a $9.99 price tag.			",294,70,3,33,14,1,13

												This game would be ok for the 10 year old me.I used to love flash games, and simple games were enough.But I've played many zombie games so far and this one is really bad.You don't have an invetory, it's not necessary once you have only 2 itens, gun and grenade.Almost no ammo management once your first weapon has infinity ammo.No scavenging, no itens to pick on the floor or to find in the map.You can upgrade your weapons in the shop, more damage and realod speed, but the zombies will get upgraded too, so it's useless.You can't enter any building.I gave up after 20 minutes, I think I saw everything the game has to offer...

												As an overhead shooter Dead Horde is about as bad as they come. It's missing a very key element-fun. Linear levels, a basic weapon cache, and bad graphics are some of other poor qualities that make up this game. Even the coop element doesn't make this game attractive. Skip this one. There's are countless other overhead shooters where your money would be better spent. NOT recommend!			",747,184,19,65,52,12,82

												Must say I didn't play long, so take this review for what it's worth. While the game isn't ugly graphics wise for the price, but two things make negative impressions on me is the controls (I used the keyboard) and it was just wonky movement with the W,S,A,D keys. The other negative was although it was a zombie game, it takes over a half a clip to kill one zombie. I would probably play it again just to see if a controller may change the movement issue, but the bullets to clip to zombie problem would still persist.			",1267,556,55,146,204,16,261

												Dead Horde is basically a 3rd person shooter in the vein of Alien Shooter series, or Shadowgrounds series, albeit with much worse graphics (a lot like that other zombie game from the same developer, Trapped Dead). You have this mercenary that was hired to clean up the island, as you work your way through this rat maze one way through... and wait for the occasional zombie spawn that sends a horde at you from all directions, even where you had just cleared of all zeds. Add ""shops"" in the middle of nowhere that will upgrade your weapons (increased clip size, ammo carried, firing rate, damage caused...)  Interface is suboptimal (why press control AND right-click to throw? Why not just right-click?) and animation lame. You'd probably like Shadowgrounds / Shadowgrounds Survivor much better.

												Despite Steam saying I've played only 30 minutes (which is a lie, I must have played this game for 2 hours), I think this little time would be sufficient to see that this game is not playable. Just this, impossible to play. The movements are laggy, the animations are strange, the enemies don't die (but the character dies with hits that comes from enemies that are far away) and the environment is buggy.2/10			",263,61,3,29,40,3,32

												If you like Zombie Shooter or Nation Red... STICK WITH THOSE, this game has poor design, when you are supposed to fight hordes of zombies in a style similar to arcade shooters or the usual flash game you can find around you either make lots of slowly and menacing enemies have low health or have the faster ones still have low health but better mobility, this game's difficulty is basically the usual running zombies with none of the player character's ability to survive. You will be chewed to death unable to even outrun them, your weapons do very poor damage, having the flashlight on or off has no advantage whatsoever, once a horde appears they will chase you, the AI is omniscient in that regard, environment hazards are useless and offer no tactical advantage either, vehicle sections are OK but that's it, I wish I could get a refund but this game is not worth even those 2 bucks right now, get Nation Red instead.

To which end, to the friend who I gave the extra copy from the two pack I am sincerely sorry. I thought this was going to be a PC version of Dead Nation, and it was (if the developers of Dead Nation had released the alpha to the public). Heed the Metacritic score, it's no joke in this case.

												As an overhead shooter Dead Horde is about as bad as they come. It's missing a very key element--FUN. Linear levels, a basic weapon cache, and bad graphics are some of other poor qualities that make up this game. Even the coop element doesn't make this game attractive. Skip this one. There's are countless other overhead shooters where your money would be better spent.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

Posted: December 4, 2015
VERDICT: Dead Horde is a barely average apocalypse themed twin-stick shooter with limited gameplay and dated graphics.  Most gamers will find gameplay too repetitve and frustrating.  Graphics are dull and the sounds basic.  It is remaniscent of 80s style video games.  The game relies on fast moving zombies/ mutants, ambushes and a sprinkling of bosses with unique abilities to create the overall challenge.  Bad pathing & line-of-sight, slight stuttering animations and slow controls can cause frustration. Leading to frequent mistake-induced insta-death.  That is until you get used to the mechanics.   However its not all doom and gloom.  It has a nice amount of weapons and upgrades.  I had fun playing through it but only when I worked out the game machanics.  It definitely has its moments but ultimately there are better games of its type out there.  If you can overlook the gloomy graphics and the lack of manual save, and if you are a hardcore twin-stick shooter enthusiast you may find the difficulty that much more satisfying to overcome.  Otherwise I would recommended only if old-skool games appeal to you.  If you arent convinced then definitely look elsewhere for a better or modern variant.  ... More info below ...01. GENRE: Old/skool, budget, linear, 2.5D twin-stick shooter02. SETTING: Military themed mutant/zombie apocalypse03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Weve seen it before:  You are a soldier whose team was sent to investigate and stop a mutant infestation from taking hold in your area.  Seperated from your squad you must now single-handedly (or with teammate) make your way through each area crawling with fast-moving enemies, while avoiding ambushes in order to rejoin your comrades and continue the mission.  Along the way you earn cash to purchase weapons from a decent-sized arsenal and collect pick-ups to boost your ammo, cash and health.04. GAME MODES: One nine level campaign designed to be replayed four times with ramped up difficulty from easy to insane.  It has coop or single-player modes.  Had difficulty in finding a partner though.05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: Levels switch between linear corridored maps where you must get from A to B, to arena type zones where you must kill waves of progressively harder enemies.  Some levels are a combination of both.  There are a few sections where you can drive a vehicle, where you can slay mutants at will.  These were fun.  If only there were more of these sections!  Range of design is limited if mixed up fairly well to compensate.  There is no manual save so once started a level must be completed.  Check-points allow you to restart if you die.  But if you quit the game this progress is lost.  Aggravating if you have had enough of dying and need a break!06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: The basic dynamic is to move forward slowly.  Group of mutants are alerted by your presence.  It pays to be cautious as weapons only kill a few at a time.  Every so often ambushes are triggered by location.  Backpedal while shooting, move faster when running away or eventually get caught.  Roll-away periodically handy for getting out of trouble fast.  Trust me... you will be running back the way you came alot, alternating between backpedalling, running and rolling away.  Watch out for zombies that avoid your line-of-sight by running behind objects so they cant be seen until too late.  In terms of equipment you can buy ammo, weapons, grenades and upgrades periodically when you encounter a supply kiosk.  Weapons include: assault rifle, shotgun, frag nades, mines, buzzsaw, rocket launcher, minigun, lightning cannon and kids toy for distraction.  Each of these has a range of upgrades including: damage, clipsize, total ammo, and range.  These cost cash to buy. Cash is earned through killing enemies.  Moreso with limited pick-ups scattered around each level.  Pickups also include: health boosts and ammo recharge for all but your assault rifle which has unlimited ammo.You die. Die and die.  Its one of those games where you need to learn and use the glitches to kill the bosses.  However if you perservere there is some decent gameplay to be found, even if after the second playthough it becomes repetitve.07. ENEMIES: There are only a few variations in the enemies faced.  They are all zombies or mutations thereof.  Each has their own strength of threat; the zombies tend to hunt in packs, some are faster than others and should be prioritized, The large bloats need a few clips emptied into them to avoid the green goo they vomit on the player.  Dont let the slashers get to close as they damage fast and hard.  While the leapers can jump from far and send waves of concussion towards the player if they get to close.  08. A.I: The A.I. is super-heightened relying on the players proximity to zombies for them to activate and chase the For the most part the A.I. is simple yet effective.09. CONTROLS: Probably the worst part of the game (along with some of the animations).  They can be sluggish and annoying.  Frustratingly as so if and when you mess up you will get punished... badly on higher difficulties.10. GRAPHICS: Dated but well-drawn back in the day.  The range of environments, furniture and models is frankly better than alot of modern games.  Really keeps visuals interesting especially across levels.  Definitely a plus overal.  Resolution is limited to 1366x768.11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Minimal.  A nice use of music when ambushes occur.  However sometimes these cut out and are truly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed by a group of mutants.  Not good!12. VOICE ACTING: There is none.  Likely due to its low-ish budget.  Frankly you wont miss it.  The story [what there is of it] is so short that you can glaze over the text in a few seconds between levels.13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Borders from easy to very difficult.  Mostly due to the issues with controls and lack of smoothness in the animations.  Game relies on zombie speed being faster and able to outrun players for the most part.  Learning curve is okay but hard until mechanics are understood.  Had the hardest time on Normal learning how to and when to; move and dodge, and learning glitches to take down each type of zed in every situation.  Once you've got this nailed its just a question of applying them to encounters with more enemies.14. PROBLEMS: It plays well and is stable on my not so modern Core i3 PC.15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Most of the achievements you will get on your first playthrough.  100% completion will take some effort. Campaign must be completed on each difficulty level: easy, normal, hard and insane.  Afterall four you will still need to farm another 2000 or so kills for the hardest achievement.16. DLC: None.  If you want more there is a sequel of sorts called: Primal Fear.17. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: There is coop but after posting for some coop help I got no reply in over a week so you may be forced to play this singleplayer Im afraid.  Thats a shame because some of the youtube videos of coop play take the game to a different enjoyment level.18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Will mostly appeal to hardcore twin-stick shooter lovers and/or fans of old-skool games.  Just dont expect much and you wont be disappointed.19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:  It maybe short and you can complete the campaign in a few hours but the game is designed for at least four complete play-throughs and with a Coop partner Id imagine its a lot more fun.  If you are a casual gamer or not a big fan of twin-shooters you may be satisfied with only one or two tries.  Otherwise the challenge with each difficulty is there for hardened veterans of such games.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: I would suggest getting this in a sale.  Though its not far off being a good price for the content there is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game Dead Horde to me seems like a poor example of game developing. It feels a bit like the developer/publ. just wanted to try to make some money riding on the ""zombie-game"" wave without doing much of an effort.-the control of the game is kind of weird-the graphical presentation is poor... all enemies have the same appearance, same color, etc.-the leveldesign feels like generated by autoeditors-not much motivation by unlocks... very slow unlocking-no story (ya i know..most of zombie games dont have much of a story)for 1 or 2 euro maybe a few minutes of fun...but in the end not really worth playing it.

For one, the ""Zombies"" take 7 bullets to kill, that whould not be a problem if you got more than 14 rounds in your M16, As an addition, you reload time is like 2 seconds. A second thing is that they make the hordes like 20 zombies big, Im sorry buy even with the shotgun (Which only carrys 12 rounds at any time) Does not even kill them with 1 shot. A third thing, the dogs. They are also overpowerd. i havent even beat the first mission on easy because it is too difficult. Even with this Sale going on, People....Save your money.

												Dead Horde could have been a good game with a larger development team and a lot more love, but it misses the bar in multiple categories and is at most a good time for a few hours, with moments of frustation due to poor gameplay.Summarizing combat, your character is slow, with all enemies being as fast as you or faster, your only way to gain distance is through a forward jumping roll, which feels unresponsive and will often get you snagged in a corner after a leap. Enemies make a straight line for you, and have no collission amongst themselves, making it very easy for all enemies to be able to damage you, which is often unavoidable.The hoard cannot be pushed back or slowed down except for shooting them with your primary rifle, but they will still be faster than your ability to backpedal. Only one big zombie can be stunned through shooting him, and all the big zombies move much faster than you, often forcing you to tank their attacks when dealing with them on your first playthough.All zombies, including the big ones, make no sounds when approaching you from off-screen, only making sounds when attacking, and being hit. This makes it very hard to respond to threats, and even with a watchful eye and good reflexes, you will often find yourself with a big zombie in your face before you can react, with no way for you to get distance from it.Usually your only defence against having to just tank the damage, is to have already done a playthough (or died), and know where the enemies are going to be, and when the waves spawn, and having a powerful weapon already prepped.The difficulty curve is all over the place, with two mid-campain levels being very difficult and crampt, and the end of the game feeling underwhelming. The entire game is filled with poor level design, riddled with objects that completly block your view, spots that will snag on your character, and areas that you should be able to squeeze through, but instead block you.To summarize, the game feels very cheaply made, and has that arcadey difficulty that only a cheap game can replicate. Don't buy Dead Horde for it's normal price of $9.99, get it when it's on sale or with a coupon for $1, even $2 is pushing it. However, after understanding it's many flaws, it can still be enjoyable and will help waste a few hours. Thats about it.			",378,79,9,16,44,3,31

												STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS ""GAME"".This is the poor man's Shadowgrounds/Zombie Shooter clone.The weapons - M4A1 and shotgun (yes, there's only two) - suck very bad. Killing zombies have never felt this bland.Everything is very poorly animated and most of the zombies are just reskins of previously encountered zombies. The sound sucks too (there's absolutely no sound variations when you shoot, and when zombies are hit or die).The only positive aspects *would* be the co-op, physics ""puzzles"", and different vehicles you can drive, but since the game forces you to clear rooms after rooms of boring look-alike zombies, without having to resort to any strategy, and without any tension, it shall remain an utterly pointless game.

												bought it. played it. regret it. multiplayer is♥♥♥♥♥♥tried to conect to my friend 6 times on LAN and still didnt work. Single player is too repetitive. also its 100% liniear and you can literaly just run through it all and shoot at the hoared running behind you without worring about dying. sure its an indie but god was this horrid development. They add new enemies but they all pretty much have the same speed. this game right here needs more effort overall.			",125,8,1,10,13,0,20

												This game is a co-op top down zombie shooter. Overall its pretty simple, kill mutants, get money, get weapons/grenades/ammo and defend a point until u can continue. Rinse and repeat. Would I recommend this game? HELL NO! There are dozens of games that uses the same formula but on a much better level, some of them even free flash games! A friend of mine gifted to me and I still feel ripped off.THE GOOD:-The environment looks pretty good and detailed for the price of the game.-The lenght of the game is pretty good for such a low price title.-The weapons are pretty diverse and all work differently which is pretty cool, ranges from assault rifle up to a lightning ball shooter thing.THE UGLY:-Terrible performance, the games runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥and with many crashes and what not.-The animations are so bad... most of them have really low number of frames for exemple the dodge with something like a total of 3 frames.-The enemies variety is terrible: normal mutant, super mutant, fat mutant, jumping mutant and on the very last level of the game zombie dogs.-The upgrade and cash mechanic is really bad, it feels like a flash game made by a 12 years old.TLDR: Dont buy this game at any price, its not worth ur time or money at all, even with a friend ur better off playing any other game of this genre.1/10			",327,74,7,49,33,4,68

												It's... pretty bad. Major stuttering issues in the menu, seems more like the game was originally meant for consoles. Even the mouse support is really off in the menus. Lot's of buggy things, most weapons are useless, graphics can bug out and look horrible as is, controls are odd to say the least, and there's so many design issues.. Worst of all, it's boring, and I like top down shooter zombie games, but this is just bad. It's not satisfying to kill zombies, some of the 'special' zombies which are highly unoriginal by the way, really stand out and feel silly. The game has no tutorial to speak of, which could really be used since the way the shop works is just really really confusing. There's nothing really to redeem this game, it brings nothing new to the genre, it doesn't do anything well, and you'll honestly have more fun playing a simple FREE shooter made in flash or something. SAS comes to mind. 1/10.			",508,104,12,60,23,7,29

												Ok so, I usually do NOt trust random peoples opinions when it comes ot whether or not a game is any good due to the fact that the younger generation of gamers are so completely whiney about every game that comes out. A good 90% of the itme that i see a game that says 'DO NOT BAI! KTHNX!'... It usually turns out to be an at least DECENT title. But this time around, their assessment was correct. This game is pretty bad. It's playable, the controls are smooth and everything. But iyts just so basic and the animations are so simple, theres tons of other options for zombie games with the exact same camera style that blow this out of the water. If you got it from a bundle as i did, then no loss. But if you're planning on buying this game for the price that is charged in the Steam store, please do yourself a huge favor and do NOT buy it. If this game looks like its interesting to you, go ahead and go back to the main store page and search for the game 'How to Survive'... Because that game there, that game does what i expected this one to do.on a scale of 1 though 10 i would rate this game at about 2/10. And thats being generous. I'm only giving it as high as a 2 because it's functional and completely playable. Unfortunately thats about all this game has going for it!			",1773,417,72,157,132,15,154

												Dead Nation is WAAAAAAY better. (At least for these kinds of games that I've played.)After only being able to make it 3 levels in. Here is what this game is. It's a Zombie game... That pretty much sums it up.Story is exactly like every other D-Movie zombie storyline. 100% you can skip. Nothing of interest to note.I'm pretty sure the store screenshots of the Graphics are a LIE! I was not able to get those graphics no matter what I did. The graphics are so choppy and glitchy it isn't even funny. You will have things blocking your view so you can't see your character or zombies. The shadows tend to glitch and stretch randomly at times. Textures are more plain and dull than Slender Man's face.The camera is jumpy and laggy. I don't suffer from motion sickness, but oh my god. Moving the camera too fast made the camera jerky and jumpy so bad, I felt like throwing up. Adding in the terriable graphics and glitchy shadows, taking a knife to my eye sockets would have felt better.The sounds in this game sound like they were recorded with a potato. They just sound horiable. The world also has a lack of sounds 99% of the time. There is only 1 music track in the entire game, and that's only when a ""Horde"" of zombies randomly spawn to mob you. I ended up muting the game and just have my own music playing... Even with that, this game SOMEHOW managed to make Foobar2000 fk up and repeat songs or skip parts of songs.There isn't really an options menu to speak of. I've even had my key rebinds change randomly on me.There is a coop mode in this game, but I could not get another poor basterd to play with me. But from what I hear, it's a ""Same Screen"" coop mode. That sounds lame.Yeah the achievements are easy as fk, but I do NOT want to play through this game 4 times! Difficulty achievements do not stack, and Hard and Insane are locked untill you beat Normal and Hard.No Steam Cards, for those people that care.I honestly don't remember where I bought this game or why. I would guess that I got it in a bundle of some kind, so I probably only spent <$1 on it. Either way, I do not recommend this game. Delete it like the rest.			",1000,303,41,103,76,9,150

												There's not really much I can say about this game but then again there's not really much this game offers either.It's a bland shooter in an isometric view in which you control a marine, whose chopper apparently crashed in the middle of nowhere and his main task is to just survive wave after wave of incoming zombies.There's no introduction of any kind so the game leaves it to you to kinda figure out what may have happened.From the moment you press start, you control your marine from an isometric view.There's only one camera mode.You can't zoom in or zoom out, you can't rotate the camera either.There's not any kind of a minimap or any map whatsoever so you're basicly stumbling blind and don't really know where to go.It's not like this game is some kind of a sandbox filled with multiple ways of reaching the next checkpoint but it still gets confusing.You have a rifle and a grenade at your disposal.The rifle has an unlimited ammo but the way it works is that you still have 16 rounds in a magazine so you still need to reload it.The thing that was irritating me was that it was quickly running out of ammo and the reloading process was pretty lenghty.Too lenghty when you consider the number of zombies running around and the fact those zombies are faster than you are.So you basically keep running around, guns blazing, the zombies keep going at you while you keep moving forward.If you get lucky, you'll be able to pick up some med packs along the way and you'll definitely need those.The graphics are pretty poor even at 1080p and the environment is as boring as it gets.It's basically like playing a hack & slash game with guns instead of magic and swords, without the loot part and without any kind of story.This game is not absolutely horrible mind you since it can still bring some mayhem joy to those who are in a mood to play a mindless zombie slasher but there's not anything really in this game that may agitate anyone to stay for long.

												Dead Horde is a basic game. The game mechanics are flawed, the hordes often too large and a definitive focus on co-op make the game largely difficult for a single player. Weapons wise it has barely any to speak of and the complete bulletsponges that the zombies are make it difficult to actually recommend this game.Play it with a friend if you're bored.

												Do I like this game?  Yes.  Would I pay $9.99 for it?  No.  But is it worth it on a Steam sale for $1 or $2?  Hell yea!  I grew up with shooters like this from Ikari Warriors, to Total Carnage and Smash TV, to console games like Reloaded so I know how games like this are supposed to be.  What I did I like about the game?  I found the simplistic nature of the game very straightforward and basically a lot of fun.  It doesn't really boast anything more than it promises other than casual Zombie shooting.  I found it to actually be very similar in nature to games like Yet Another Zombie Defense.  It's fun, with progressing difficulty and power ups.  It's mindless fun entertainment that satisfies the need to kill zombies!!!What I didn't like about the game?  The horde music is repetitive and annoying at times so I just turned it down so it was barely audible so I could still hear when a large swam was attacking.  There wasn't a lot of variety of zombie types and why must every game after L4D have a fat zombie that vomits??  The game while visually simplistic seems to give low to mid end video cards a hard time.  I found that my ultrabook and XPS gaming laptop could barely play at medium/low settings while those same systems can play L4D2, CSGO and other graphically superior games without issue.  I even found a bit of stutter on a 4GHz i7 with a EVGA 680SC that plays BF4, WatchDogs, and Crysis 3 on ULTRA high settings with no effort.  The zombies are so fast that sometimes a large horde can overrun you even if you are running away and dive/rolling to get further distance.It's a good game but to be a great game these glaring issues need to be resolved.

												This game is terrible.Plot is uninteresting and unoriginal. The gameplay is bland, I'd rather play the CoD Nazi Zombies Top Down version than this.The Controls are very basic, and they're not buggy or unresponsive at any points. But despite the maps looking large and explorable, are surrounded in invisible barriers that lead the levels to being extremely linear.The levels at least add variety, as well as vehicles and special zombies (although not enough to be worth it). the stores are pretty much pointless when your rifle has infinite ammo.Coop is a travesty. You can't go anywhere unless your partner shares the same screen. Most of the time, my brother and friends would lag from the connection and one of us would do terribly.This game is way too easy. Walk backwards and shoot is all you'd have to do.I bought this game really cheap, and got my money for it, more or less.			",167,39,0,25,19,0,14

												Poorest game in its genre. Looks like a work of a 5-years old child. Game process is very boring and simple. I would not recommend this game to anyone. Bought a 2-pack of it during sale for $2 hoping for coop game but I can't force myself to play it again after 5 minutes of playtime.			",282,28,16,42,20,2,79

												There's not really much I can say about this game but then again there's not really much this game offers either.It's a bland shooter in an isometric view in which you control a marine, whose chopper apparently crashed in the middle of nowhere and his main task is to just survive wave after wave of incoming zombies.There's no introduction of any kind so the game leaves it to you to kinda figure out what may have happened.From the moment you press start, you control your marine from an isometric view.There's only one camera mode.You can't zoom in or zoom out, you can't rotate the camera either.There's not any kind of a minimap or any map whatsoever so you're basicly stumbling blind and don't really know where to go.It's not like this game is some kind of a sandbox filled with multiple ways of reaching the next checkpoint but it still gets confusing.You have a rifle and a grenade at your disposal.The rifle has an unlimited ammo but the way it works is that you still have 16 rounds in a magazine so you still need to reload it.The thing that was irritating me was that it was quickly running out of ammo and the reloading process was pretty lenghty.Too lenghty when you consider the number of zombies running around and the fact those zombies are faster than you are.So you basically keep running around, guns blazing, the zombies keep going at you while you keep moving forward.If you get lucky, you'll be able to pick up some med packs along the way and you'll definitely need those.The graphics are pretty poor even at 1080p and the environment is as boring as it gets.It's basically like playing a hack & slash game with guns instead of magic and swords, without the loot part and without any kind of story.This game is not absolutely horrible mind you since it can still bring some mayhem joy to those who are in a mood to play a mindless zombie slasher but there's not anything really in this game that may agitate anyone to stay for long.

												This game is like Zombie Shooter 1 & 2 but without any of the charm or fun or delightful cheesiness.Wait, I gotta reload. . .Gameplay is repetitive; it's occasionally passable when it lets you drive one of the oversized vehicles. Seriously, the operable vehicles are out-of-proportion with the rest of the game.Sound quality is poor. The soundtrack is almost laughable--they could have made it so bad it's good, but instead they chose to rarely use music at all. That being said, you know you're about to run backward shooting a bunch of zombies whenever trashy techno bleeds out of your speakers.That's the core gameplay mechanic. Run backwards shooting, then turn around and keep running while you wait 7 seconds to reload. Please don't interrupt the reload animation until you are certain you have a fresh mag, or your avatar will have to start over. There's also a jump button, kind of. Red barrels explode when you shoot them. Eventually.Still reloading. . .There are different zombie types, but they don't change the gameplay the way they do in, say, any other zombie game.None of the weapons are satisfying. You can upgrade the weapons, but I struggled to notice a difference in DPS or power. Yes, your assault rifle will shoot faster, but that just means you have to reload more often.The game might be marginally improved if played via co-op, but it doesn't accomplish the twin-stick shooter feel that suits couch co-op so well. I never bothered, but I can imagine you get the benefit of seeing the reload animation twice as often, so BONUS!Still reloading. . .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is terrible.Plot is uninteresting and unoriginal. The gameplay is bland, I'd rather play the CoD Nazi Zombies Top Down version than this.The Controls are very basic, and they're not buggy or unresponsive at any points. But despite the maps looking large and explorable, are surrounded in invisible barriers that lead the levels to being extremely linear.The levels at least add variety, as well as vehicles and special zombies (although not enough to be worth it). the stores are pretty much pointless when your rifle has infinite ammo.Coop is a travesty. You can't go anywhere unless your partner shares the same screen. Most of the time, my brother and friends would lag from the connection and one of us would do terribly.This game is way too easy. Walk backwards and shoot is all you'd have to do.I bought this game really cheap, and got my money for it, more or less.			",167,39,0,25,19,0,14

												  I love this game with all my heart.  Dead Horde is a state of the art game with next gen graphics and game mechanics.  The resolution is at a sharp 480p with a smooth 10fps.  What I really enjoy about this game is the focus on player interconnectivity.  The game forces you to play with your friends, to make it a more enjoyable experience.  There may be a ton of bugs, but those just help the game shine more.  I reccomend this game greatly.			",223,51,10,22,30,0,10

The story line is brilliant and well thought out(with a few surprising twists ;) ). The graphics are so clear its like looking through a window into another universe. As for the gameplay, one word........fantastic. It seems like nothing is off limits, from rolling forward to shooting.Overall a solid 6/10			",48,3,2,3,5,0,3

												Dead Horde has a mixture of good and bad elements.  On the positive side, it supports widescreen format resolutions as well as the Steam Overlay.  The control scheme is a simple to learn point and click excercise that can be adapted to fairly easily.  Unfortunately I wonder if the developers decided to create a zombie title to cover for the fact that their is a terrible monster ai.  Much of the gameplay becomes an excercise of running backwards while firing at a stack of zombies that can only slightly run faster than your player character runs backwards.  In addition, the game lacks any sort of story that I see, even in campaign mode, and the ingame screens lack any sort of map.  The resulting experience is a linear Shadowgrounds or Alien Swarm with considerably less combat variety.  If you love zombie shooters or isometric arcade action, you might like Dead Horde, but there are other games in the genre of similar price that do a superior job.			",1051,328,48,158,114,10,216

												It's kinda like the game Dead Nation for PS3 but with better controls of what the guy should do like, turn your flashlight on and off.Pros: it's a zombie game where you run around getting cash to buy and upgrade weapons such as; a rifle, a shotgun and some grenades Zombies aren't Too diffecult to kill neither are they too easy.Well made levels, theres an appropiate amount of destruction in the world you run around in.It's topview so you can watch your back betternegatives:It's not an competative online game where you compete against other countries as you do in Dead Nation (GREAT feature, i love to see how slow some countries go and how fast others go)It's topview, you can't aim for specific areas of the zombie (such as the head)The camera is kinda bugged so when i try to spin fast around to shoot a zombie behind me he bugs for a while making me panic and loose alot of hpSlow movements therefore no outrunning zombies (especially the zombie dogs)theres a very limited amount of Health and ammo pickups. Weapon and weapon upgrades are expensive as F***My conclusion: Not recommended to most people, if you though find these kinds of games fun and you want a challenge (i mean a REAL challenge) buy this			",301,51,4,19,45,3,29

												Decent game. The models are very limited in animations which result in really weird looking movements. All the other things look fine though, so it's really distracting. Anyway, the idea is to move your character through a level, which consists of several sections (with checkpoints). You can't get to a new section without cleaning the current section first. During the game you'll be able to buy and upgrade new weapons to make things easier. There are also vehicles to move objects or run over zombies. But there's no real variation here in the end. Dead Nation has the same idea (although very limited) but does manage to be fun and challenging. Get that game instead of this one.[Rating: 64/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												I heard many had issues getting this game to perform well enough to play.  I had no issues with getting the game set up.  I did however not enjoy the game as much as i thought I would.  By the 4th level, I realized I had already seen every monster and the devs were good at creating levels but not gameplay/design.Overall it is an ok game that you upgrade weapons, kill zombies, and play Coop.  For me it just suffered from being repetative.  The entire game basically tries to cheese you by putting you in places and setting you in a trap.  Once I found this out, I just ran the direction I came every 30 yards and avoided the traps.The char models move funny and the physics get wonky.  I don't want to sound like I am totally bashing the game, because its ok and decent.  However the pit falls made it less than ok or decent.  I would avoid it unless you love games like this.

												You can download Unity, grab some free asset packs and copy some basic code and create this game on your own in a weekend.  Its boring, you just run down a specific path and point and shoot.  The shooting does not feel right, the sounds are generic and there is nothing different to see other than things on the side of the road.  After the first 3 minutes of play, you have seen everything this game has to offer.  When 66% of the reviews are negative, it is for a reason.  I got this game on sale for $2.50 and still feel like I got ripped off			",93,2,0,9,20,0,23

												This game is fine for it is and for its price, however, it does require an update to handle a number of issue, as follows:1. The most annoying thing is the radius limitation. What I mean is that when playing co-op with a partner, the two players are not fully free to wander as each whishes to. The players are limited by a particular distance. This means that if you are going left while your partner is going right, the two will eventually stop going their directions, until your partner starts going your way, or you go your partner's way. This will result in zombies catching up with you (and hurt you badly and kill you) when shooting while backing up , not knowing how much further can you go.2. Grenades in this game seem to hurt you and your partner much more than they harm zombies, and while playing co-op, be assured that even when you keep your distance, you will get hurt by your partner's grenades. 3. Some minor bugs: health packs seem to appear even after being picked up. Gates and checkpoints taking much time to clear the way and let you through.4. Too bad the game isn't designed for more than two players in co-op mode. ",22,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Dead Horde is a repetitive, top down zombie shoot and go game where you shoot zombies and go places. You can upgrade weapons to increase their damage, clip capacity, reload and all that shiz. But at the end of the day, you're just running backwards while being propelled by the bullets you are dumping into zimbeez. Dead Horde is an overpriced flash game in which the only justification for its 9.99 USD price tag is the fact that it has polygonal graphics. But because it has zombies, I'm willing to overlook its shortcomings.10/10, would buy a dozen more copies for myself if I could.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was fun, but not great. Although most weapons are the standard ones, you get 2-3 that's a bit wacky. The graphics is ok, and it has some vehicle action too. It has some invisible walls, but after a while you'll instinctively know which ways you're not supposed to go. It's a bit badly optimized, it was choking my GPU at the shop parts, which is totally 2D. It was fun playing through once, but there's not much replay value. Couldn't get the local coop to work.tl;dr It's flawed, but fun. Get it on a sale.			",352,80,6,45,21,3,92

												This is a pretty fun game. The only thing that I didn't like is that the best guns in the game aren't available until the end of the game. It would have been nice to have all guns available, and then you could save up your money and only buy what you want. After going through all the playthroughs on the various difficulties, I was like, ""I'm almost to the ray gun"", and once I got it, two more levels and the game was over. It also would have been nice if there was a New Game + option where you have all the guns/items you purchased in a new game. Also, it would have been cool if you could upgrade your existing weapons to maybe do more damage, or hold more ammo, etc. Just a few ideas to make the game alot more fun. That being said, if you like zombie shoot em ups, I would give this one a try. But, maybe like others have suggested, wait until it goes on a 50% off sale. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Why does this game have negative reviews?This makes no sense to me. Sure, this type of game is so incredibly common and overdone that it gets boring. For some reason, this really hit on point with me. If I have a few minutes to kill, it's going to be great for that. In comparison to other games in this exact subgenre, it's great! SoundDon't know. I almost always mute the sounds on this type of game, because I know what it's going to be. Zombies groaning, guns shooting, maybe some heavy metal or spooky music. The end. I'm not going to use that as part of my judgment. GameplayFast paced and fun, you can upgrade your weapons in a number of ways, and you're not given a ridiculous onslaught with too many options. You're not presented with totally unrealistic weapon choices (at least not where I'm at in the game, at least.) It works! OverallI think it's worth it, and I know I had to get this on sale or in a bundle. For sure, in that context, it's great. I'm not looking at the full price, but I would say anything in the 10 dollar range is worthwhile. 7.0/10 - Pretty good.			",2909,1137,96,354,354,29,474

												It´s alike ""hack-and-shot"" games, it´s a game made just for fun, when you have those days that just want to kill some zombies.

												so this review is gonna be a shorth one , the game is not bed at all not superb but not bad its simmilar to point and click games just with intents gore in it its pretty straight forward really but only playing it for an hour you see fast that its just the same over and over in diffrent settinbgs wich is a bit sad you walk a couple of mins shot zombies then the music hits high tune and a horde comes running superfast (but you as a human can not run O_o ) then you move on couple of mins and horde again .. and this can be okay to a certain degree but when you get further in the game this reminds you more and more of a skylook of a left for dead clone super zombies that are big and mega fat and pukes poison ect ect.. how hard is it NOT!! to try to be like that bloody game (i know i know it was mege popular and so on ) i 've did't like it so much but not saying it a great game but why must every other game after that reminds you of that certain zomibes anyway considering i'm not finnish with the game and even at easy its pretty a challange its not a bad game at all but for now i'll give it a 5\10 just because that reminder of an other game with ruined it for me (this is just my opinion of the game )			",149,37,2,35,40,2,55

												Dark, bland, muddy art style combined with weapons and controls that just aren't fun makes this a title I can't recommend. I got it as part of a Bundle ages ago, tried to play it, got about 30 minutes into it, then quit. I tried again just now and remembered, again, why it didn't grab me.I enjoy a twin stick shooter. I played quite a bit of Crimsonland, and Narco Terror is pretty fun (though crazy hard). In the case of Crimsonland you get a constant stream of upgrades, perks, and unlocks to keep you wanting to play. In the case of Narco Terror, it just has so much retro action movie personality and explosions! But this? It doesn't really have much going for it.- Oversaturated genre (zombies).- Muddy, dark art style.- Ridiculously fast zombies.- Slow, uninteresting upgrade/progression system.- No character customization.- Weak guns.

												Not as bad a game as most people here say. If you like to play a mindless zombie shooter, this is it. If you want variety, stories and all, this is not it. Despite its not-so-good graphics, there are stutters and lags. There is no variety to enemies and you kill the same enemies over and over and over. But still, I like it when I just want to complete levels and shoot some zombies. Yes, despite all its drawbacks, it is good at throwing a lot of zombies at you. Initially, you may feel it too hard, especially when you are confined to small areas with some solid amount of dead company, but believe me, once you get hang of it and learn the trick, you will enjoy the challenge.One important tip... Do NOT play local co-op. It will be harder for you two to play since you share the same screen and neither can go out of the camera bounds. You start running in opposite directions to escape the horde and you are dead meat.7/10... at $1-2 or so...			",568,172,18,47,35,4,71

												I really do love the concept of this game and the ideas it puts on the table for games like this, it's not original, but it is re-imagining the top down zombie survival shoot'm up genre. But in saying that, I must also add the fact that this games pros, sadly, do not outway the cons. I've listed the major points of both below, hope you find this review usefull, Thanks!Pros-The developers put noticable effort into the enviroment and detail of the game-It has a standard networking system that's relatively easy to use, which I really appreciate in a multiplayer game-I love upgrading my gear in all games that allow it, and this one has a pretty good variety of weapons, each with the capabillity of being upgradedCons-The zombies take more lead than neccassary to put down-The undead also run just as fast and some are seemingly faster than you-Co-op experience is frustrating, because you tethered to your team member-The number one reason I don't like this game is....NO SAVING AT ALL (Besides Checkpoints), so if you're planning on beating the game, bring plenty of Mountain Dew and Get Comfy.

												I don't really remember how I got this game.I'm going to assume it was gifted to me...or maybe I got it cheap...maybe, I don't know.So, seeing as I miraculously own this game, I thought 'Ok, might as well try it out, huh?'. I like zombie games since I see them as a form of stress relief (teaching = high stress). But this adds to my stress levels - the exact opposite of what I wanted.Pros:It's a top-down shooter (Don't see too many of those nowadays)ZombiesSorta-kinda worksYou can uninstall it with no problemsCons:Too many to list down			",186,33,0,47,31,1,37

												Another unfinished product that has made it to steam. It has a poor save sistem, imbalanced gameplay and unfortunate control scheme. They did not gave the player the option to map all keys and up and down for certain items coincide with my arrows control cheme making it unpleasant to switch control scheme every time you need to move something with the forklift and such.
