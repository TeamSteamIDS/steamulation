Fast-paced and shamelessly entertaining // Best for those seeking an FPS throwback to simpler times+ Maps are large and allow for generous movement when in combat+ Enemies attack in droves; spikes the difficulty, certainly, but also keeps the adrenaline flowing+ Visuals may not have aged well, but they are moderately  impressive when considering the year of release+ The action is practically nonstop; there aren't any innovative mechanics by today's standards, but the consistent need for maneuvering and gunplay makes for a great, and a classic, mob shooter+ The monster designs are surprisingly creative, if often campy and odd+ There are secrets aplenty, often behind hidden walls+ Applaudable level design+ Weaponry benefits from a moderate variation and a deep satisfaction in their use-With precious little breaking up the fast pace, the gameplay gradually becomes a bit too uniform; can give way to a sense of tedium if played for long hours at a time- There appear to be no active players over the network, and no available servers runningLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

Short version: 83%Serious Sam can be considered the epitome of old-school FPS games: 100% pure action, non-linear levels filled with secrets, and hundreds upon hundreds of monsters to kill with a vast arsenal. Mindless first-person combat has rarely been this fun.Long version:When CroTeam, this small Croatian studio released Serious Sam: The First Encounter in 2001, probably even they didn’t think that their game will grow into one of the most successful indie FPS franchises. After all, on the surface, it looks like any other shooter from around 2000: half-linear levels where it is impossible to get lost yet have enough room to hide many secrets, all full of pickups to supply the player with health and ammo for the sizeable arsenal.The trick is that this simplicity hides excellent game mechanics. The action rarely stops, but it doesn’t try to tire out the player by not giving enough breathing room. The difficulty levels offer a balanced challenge to FPS newbies and grizzled veterans alike. (Just to illustrate: on ‘Serious’ difficulty, you meet over six thousand enemies during the course of the game.)The range of difficulties is only overshadowed by the available option in the engine itself. The Serious Engines were always famous of letting the player take control, but the first one really takes the top. Thanks to this awesome flexibility, the game ran on anything back then and looks surprisingly good even today, despite its old age.I’d lie if I said CroTeam put too much effort in the story: you play as Sam Stone, who was sent back to the source of all evil, ancient Egypt, to stop an alien warlord from eradicating humanity in the far future. Still, the writing is quite memorable, thanks to the corny one-liners and the overall nonsensical nature of some of the encounters that help to alleviate the stress after some especially adrenaline-pumping scenario. So, in a sense, the “story” does its job, like the rest of the game.			",78,260,0,12,9,2,21

												The easiest setting for this game is harder than the hardest setting of most modern shooters. This is one of those games that will force you to either git gud, or die trying. One of the most hardcore shooters of the early 2000's. And it still looks pretty damn good visually.Full video Review:

												Definitely WAY ahead of its time, and still a great game to play if you feel like being on-edge and jumpy the entire time that you're playing :) The human-computer interaction is unique and like nothing I've ever seen before, the FPS action is intense, and the ""scare factor"" is there (You will soon dread the ""clop clop clop"" that announces the skeletons' approach). Very worth the money, especially for its current price!			",55,16,0,28,20,0,22

												Great game if you like old school shooting that's fast paced and frantic. Some say this kind of gameplay is mindless but I beg to differ, at least at the higher difficulty levels you must strategize and prioritize targets asap or your goose gets cooked in a jiff. It can be harsh but once you master the various onslaughs the game throws at you, you won't accept anything less than an avalanche of baddies for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snacks.I think the 2nd encounter HD has a more robust tool set than this game as far as options/modes and multiplayer goes but the single player is still very much worth going through if you want to experience frenetic thrills as dozens upon dozens of creatures hell bent on your destruction swarm forth awaiting deliverance from your more than able tools of erradication. Seriously, the future of the species is in good hands!			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												The greatest FPS made for its time. If not for its outdated graphics, it should receive many trophies for its other up to par features, such as the huge arsenal of weapons made available for die-hard FPS fans who get vexed by the tedium of wielding the same weapon or switching between two different weapons. It's an FPS game that delivers with great humor and an interesting story line that complements the game's aesthetically appeasing graphic designs of ancient Egyptian and Mesopatemian obelisks, pyramids, and statues. The monsters that you fight are so hilarious and unique that you'll begin to feel like you're sucked into a vortex and transfered into a world where everything is strange and creepy. The game evinces the concept of antiquity and alien technology interlaying one another in a historic period (Most likely around 2000BC to 200 BC) in ancient Egypt and Mesopotemia. The feeling of being stuck in an antiquated period fighting formidable technologically advanced robots brews up a unique and interesting game that absorbs you deep into the game. I guarantee that you will not want to stop playing this game after you finish the first level. It's the type of game that elevates your dopamine levels and excites you to the max. BUY this game if you wish to be entertained and have a couple of laughs now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game that came out in 2001 the graphics are still stunning. the gameplay is well balanced however some of the weapons need a little to get used to so don't be like me and try to kill a Kamikaze with a Rocket Launcher. that was probably my worst mistake in gaming. however this game does a lot of things right for example if you find a new weapon you directly get confronted by some enemies to test it out, that is something i don't see in modern games. if you would find a new weapon in a modern game it would most likely only be used for that section of the game. this game is just here to remind some of us how awesome the games where in our childhood. but why did they have to invent the Kamikaze enemy just why?!?! bosses? no problem!♥♥♥♥♥♥load scorpion thingies? no problem! one or more kamikaze?

												I like the 2nd Encounter more than the 1st SS, but it's up to you to decide. Here levels look big and quite empty. The game also lacks of - Chainsaw, Sniper Rifle, Flamethrower and Serious Bomb.+Visuals - I like green hud, and the game looks nice, as nice as the 2nd encounter.+Sound - good OST but it will never be as good as in the 2nd encounter.+Gameplay - run and gun as is, A lot of secrets, nice jokes, and Sam is just brutal. Your mom sized monsters, your willy sized monsters, flying monsters, fish monsters, monster monsters, and a lot of deadly traps.+Multiplayer - Co-op for campaign, or PvP arenas, both very fun :)+Various difficulties - actually difficulties heavily affect the gameplay in this game - harder the difficulty - worse guns you find on levels, less ammo, lower amount hp healed by medkits, the amount of the enemies and their hp increased, they even become invisible, like all of them.+Lore - huge wiki describing all the enemies and weapons you face in your pocket, very fun and interesting to read-Lacks of Chainsaw, Sniper Rifle, Flamethrower and Serious Bomb.Personally, I like the Second Encounter way more than the 1st, but I can be wrong here, 1st Encounter is not that bad after all. Buy this game for yourself and your friends for a better experience, good thing that SS often put to the 90% discount, but actually it worth every penny.			",2056,824,59,208,221,16,291

												Serious Sam The First Encounter can easily be taken as a tribute to Duke Nukem with a similar style of both gameplay and storytelling. That is not to say that it isn't a game that can stand on it's own though as a solid dose of juvenile shooter action.The premise of Serious Sam is simple enough, you are the most badass dude on on earth and you have to kill a bunch of aliens in order to save humanity. The game knows that it's story is not important and makes no effort to hide the fact that the only purpose of the few tidbits of writing you get every once in a while are simply there to make sure you know it's a single player game. What Serious Sam is about however, is the shooting.Much like Duke the main character, Sam, is no power armored pansy. He doesn't need cover systems, regenerating health or turrets to kill his way to the alien overlords. The weapons are many and varied although the lack of anything equal to the shrinker makes me a little sad though. The combat is fast and furious your only protection against the multitude of projectiles being thrown at you is your skills at dodging, and of course, you ability to kill stuff so it stops shooting at you. The levels are huge seemingly unending at times and the game throws legions of enemies at you at a time making for some of the most hectic action I've experienced in recent years. Similar to Duke the levels are also littered with secrets and shortcuts that rewards the attentive players among us.Graphically the game looks good without impressing too much, a good enemy variety and a decent amount of detail in the level design ensures that the graphics only add to the experience. The music is somewhat bland but the sound effects are of a decent quality and Sam's one liners are well delivered.All in all Serious Sam The First Encounter gives you a great first person shooter experience the way it's meant to be played, fast, hard and hectic. At a good price point even on release this should be a must own for every serious FPS'er.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Serious Sam First Encounter is a classical example of how to create a good game which one can spend hours on without ever growing tired of playing. While it is already old, it is by no means outdated. (With perhaps the exception of the graphics, but hey, that's what happens with any game if more than 10 years pass) Don't mind my lack of gametime on steam - I must have over 100 hours throughout my childhood on this game, it's amazing, and I can recognise it isn't just nostalgia making me say that.Storywise, it's nothing to write home over. It's a fairly standard story for a game that relies more on its gameplay than on captivating you with word words and more words. Aliens happened, they're after you, you're in acient Egypt and you have guns. Good luck!There is more to it, if you take the time to read into the story there are just enough flavourful blurbs and explanations around that you can read to figure out where your enemies came from, and parts of the storyline, though it isn't something that will carry you through the game, it's more like an extra.The true power of Serious Sam is in the gameplay, with excellent level design, guns that are satisfying to use, and a very high skill ceiling allowing you to feel like a god laying down devastation on hordes of enemies, moving fast enough to dodge almost all of their fire (Since all but a few enemies use projectiles, this means you can dodge nearly everything with enough practice) yet not too fast to become unmanagable. This, along with plentiful secrets, and a game that won't just say 'no' and throw up an invisible wall if you move slighly off the beaten path means that Serious Sam has an excellent grasp the concept of what great games are about- FreedomFreedom to choose your own tactics (And most are valid as well! No need to gimp yourself)Freedom to move as you pleaseFreedom to explore the levels and find all the secretsAnd the freedom to handle any encounter in the way you want to.Along with this, Egypt as pictured is a somewhat unique setting for an FPS game, with a lot of it lending itself for interesting levels and impressive scenery. The enemies you face are unique and mostly iconic as well, with the beheaded bomber and kleer skeleton being some of the more known enemies. In addition, Serious Sam has a great sense of humour, and you can play with a friend, two friends, or a whole army of friends.If you're interested in a great FPS game and don't mind slightly outdated graphics, Serious Sam is there for you.And if you do mind the graphics, check out the HD version! It's worth it			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												An absurd protagonist, lots of ridiculous and carthartic-to-use guns, a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of enemies, a big field to put them all in, and an irreverent sense of humor: it's a f*ckin' excellent combination.Obviously, it takes a lot of ideas from DOOM, including a really annoying bone-based enemy that would be a great enemy if it had about half as much health. Same goes for those bull things. In addition, the difficulty curve gets a bit too steep near the end, but other than those issues, it's a rock-solid game from start to finish. Get it.

												Seriously one of the best shooters out there. I've been a player of this since early release on the CD copy, and let me tell you there are no other games that give such a satisfying experience fighting so many massive amounts of enemies. The levels are tremendously detailed for the area it came out in and related to the time periods recreated, there are always new places to explore and it never gets stale. If it weren't for this game, I wouldn't have spent so many hours in shooters such as Unreal and the Unreal Tournament series. This game at an early age brought on my love for shooters and I don't think there will ever be another like the first two Sam games.			",86,1,1,3,2,0,2

												Back then when video games were not about cinematics.This game is one of the greatest game ever.Ironsights for weapons? Who needs that when you can simply shoot the **** out of your enemies.Regerating health? Nope, we don't need that and this game understand that.The gore is pretty nice for a game of that time, the weapons are fun to use, the maps are awesome, some of my favorites maps ever are in this game.I would suggest this game to anyone who likes classic shooter, FPS and funny (serious) games.If you like Serious Sam, you may like Painkiller: Black Edition (Gold Edition) and Rise of the Triad.9.5/10You could also get Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter if you care about achievements and better graphics but It is not really worth it, who needs achievements when you got a game like this, not the genre of game which should have achievements In my opinion anyway.But you sure should get The Second Encounter, It is totally worth it.

												Serious Sam The First Encounter is a decent ""old school"" FPS. You go around blasting various alien enemies with various guns. The game feel is good with Sam moving around. The weapons each have their own advantage against certain enemies. You won't be using the same gun the entire game. I was constantly switching weapons based on what was coming toward me. The weapons I would say are pretty ""standard"". Pistol, shotgun, machine gun, rocket launcher, laser gun, etc. Each having their own advantages and disadvantages. The amount of unique enemies is fairly small. You'll be seeing the same types of enemies over and over again. The design of them is nice though. Each enemy has a distinct audio clip that you will rely heavily on to quickly choose the right weapon for the job. I think the graphics hold up quite well. I was able to get the game running in 2560x1440 and it was very sharp. One thing that turned me off was the large difficulty spike toward the end of the game. It's a pet peeve of mine when games sharply increase the difficulty at the end. I had to use God mode to get past it. Pros:-Good graphics for the time that still hold up today-Good gameplay feel and hit detection-Audio cues for enemies-Each gun has advantages & disadvantages-Quick save feature-Stable. Never crashed on me (windows 8.1 64bit)-Secret areas!-Generally smooth 60FPS (has some slowdown here and there but didn't affect much)Cons:-Lackluster story-Repeating enemies-Difficulty spike at the end-Felt repetetive toward the end of the game6/10 Good. Slightly above averageI got Serous Sam Classic 1 and 2 by buying Serious Sam Classics: Revolution  for $1.49. Fantastic deal!!!Even $9.99 full price isn't bad considering you get 2 games with it. If it's on sale and you like fairly average FPS's then pick this up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very good game about done with it at the time of writing this review. Obviously there's better versions of it but the main reason I got this was because of the custom maps and mods exclusive to this version. The best map i've played that is very detailed and seems to have had a lot of work put into it was called sanatory. The map can be found here https://42amsterdam.net/samforum/downloads.php?do=file&id=130Not many maps on this website and I prefer seriouszone but this site definitely does has some unique content. The main draw of playing this instead of the HD version or Revolutions is the custom content exclusive to it but revolutions sure does have a lot more content vanilla and custom than this one.

												One of, if not my favorite game of all time. Serious Sam TFE displays what an arena shooter can pull off.The storyline? It sets the mood, that's about it, and that's all it really needs to do.You are sent into the past to kill off hundreds upon hundreds to even thousands of enemies from destroying the future. Simple enough?Serious Sam introduces literally the most memorable foes in any video game I've ever encountered. I remember each name, and all the stats because the game throws them in your face in a way that actually satisfies. Two shots per beheaded soldier, a quick shotgun blast to male Gnaars, double shotgun for those damn Kleers, loaded cannon to the major Biomechs! The best part is that these enemies rarely appear in troops, but in groups! You'll have a Biomech on one side, an Arachnoid on the other, an Aludran Reptilioid on the roof... how will you choose to approach this? It's all up to you and your powerful arsenal!Something also notable about Serious Sam is the stunning detail. Each enemy has a spot-on texture to make it feel like a true foe, and writings, paintings on the wall give for a total immersion into the mysterious landscape of Egypt. And how damn satisfying that is.Running through factual lands to kill fictional beasts has never, EVER been so pleasing. With a unique arsenal and engaging gameplay, Serious Sam gives you an un-parallelled journey to the beautiful land of Egypt with true to history level design.I could go on and on, but I can't do this all day. Basically, I find Serious Sam to exceed in almost everything it does, and what it does, just never fails to amaze me in all the probable 1000+ hours I've probably played it in my lifetime. A closely followed community also backs up this game, giving you awesome access to mods, weapon models, gameplay tweaks, sound edits, and much more to make Serious Sam the game YOU choose it to be.It's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing stunning. 10/10			",174,23,6,7,12,1,6

												Man, do my wrists hurt!  And no, you clever so-and-so's, haha, very funny...no, it's NOT because that long-awaited nude footage of Scarlett Johansson in that weird alien movie recently plastered itself all over internet-land.  It's because I finally finished the last stage of Serious Sam: The First Encounter in a single sitting, and 4,467 enemies later I am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥E-D, both mentally and physically.  Though the latter may, in all fairness, be mostly on account of the unfit, lazy turd which I admittedly am.  But I do have a strange, well-earned sense of ""achievement"" just the same, 'cause this game ain't no walk in the park, let me tell ya...   Recommending this game to the super-serious, look-at-me-I'm-such-a-badass-cos-I-play-VIDEO-GAMES-all-day-long league of uber-gamers is a bit of a no-brainer: It's long, it's hard, and it's positively RELENTLESS with the wave after wave after wave after wave (I'll stop there) of enemies which the game constantly throws at you.  Make no mistake, you'll kill a LOT of things in the course of this game.  With a wide array of weapons, of course: The ultimate being the ""cannon ball"", my personal fave, which is a bit like ten-pin bowling, with the nasty monsters filling in for the pins.  And there's a nice variety and eccentricity to said monsters, what's more: Headless kamikazes with bombs for hands, stampeding hordes of bull-like creatures which send you literally flying, wannabe Scorpion Kings with gattling guns...yup, it's a pretty crazy game.  Though perhaps not 100% original when you factor in the existence of, oh, I don't know, the DUKE NUKEM franchise perhaps?  But we know that Sam isn't actually Duke, because his t-shirt says so...so let's just put all the lawsuits down and play nice, whadya say, kids?   Yessir, this game is D-U-M-B, but undeniably fun.  And only occasionally so insanely hard that you feel like throwing it in altogether...but I guess it can't be THAT hard, if yours truly could finish the ♥♥♥♥er ('cause I am, in troll-speak, decidedly ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; at these games, there's no denying).  Just don't expect the comparative intelligence of the Half Life games, for example, and you'll be fine.  Visit Ancient Egypt.  Kill stuff.  LOTS of stuff.  Now, isn't that the kind of moral message we want to be sending our kids?  Who said video games couldn't be edumacational?  They certainly show up the multitude of shortcomings in the formal education system...I can't recall ever being told about spaceships and laser guns and giant lava monsters in my Ancient History classes.  I've a good mind to sue the system for stunting my intellectual growth...Verdict: 8.5/10.			",744,418,6,57,40,5,78

												I like it. Great deal for the 3 of them. This one, small download, easy install, controller/xpadder works awesome with it. Runs very smooth and looks like a great plot so far. Edit: After playing it for more than 1+ hours I can strongly say, worth it... Especially on sale. As expected a decent plot, smooth controls, great weapons and enemies and environment/graphics. Have not beat it yet.Good game thus far, small install low cpu great plot graphics controls etc.			",395,62,12,29,12,2,32

PROS:+ fun & crazy gameplay+ big variety of funky weapons+ blasting/shooting down huge hordes of enemies+ a ton of secrets to be found+ cool boss fights+ soundtrack+ awesome co-op+ good multiplayerCONS:- outdated graphics menu options- some network issues in mulitplayer- ridiculously hard in SingleplayerComment:This is the first game in the Serious Sam series, the one that started it all. I played this as second after SS:TSE and I got it because I wanted MORE Serious Sam. I loved it and along with my friend we've spent a heap load of time on it. Almost as good as SS:TSE but lacks some bits. However for any true fan of Serious Sam this is a must. The battles are just as epic and the co-op is just as good. Recommended with all my heart.

												I bought this game during the Autumn Sale. So, everything that people are telling you is true.The game is basically an arena shooter. Waves of enemies everywhere and basic bullethell features.There's a good variety of weapons for the 4 hour campaign and the graphics still look good. Everything else though... not too great. Some enemies are too spammy, like the bull, which throws you around you can't avoid when there's more than 5 of them. The story is almost non-existant and the dialogue is just cringy. Not funny-cringe. Just cringe-cringe. Otherwise, if you want a good, solid game, then this game is for you. Plus, the price tag includes the second game and a remake.			",543,172,24,62,101,8,72

												Ahh, Serious Sam... I have fond memories of playing this with my dad way back when we first got this house. Now, being able to play it again (courtesy of Mistress Gamer Grill <3) I remember EXACTLY why this game was such a gem. This FPS was the last of a dying breed. Open-level, FPS, no cover system, and approximately three metric buttloads of enemies running at you from all different angles, only to be mowed down by any of your armory of weapons stashed in the black hole behind your back. The enemies in this game are hilarious, the scale of the giant encounters are hilarious, the ridiculous damage of your weapons is hilarious, this game is, and will continue to be the best I've ever played. Don't forget online co-op, a buddy is one of the only things that makes this game more fun.			",49,0,0,8,1,0,3

												I played Serious Sam : The First Encounter when it was released in 2001 and have always had fond memories of it since then . Tell you what , this game hasn't aged a single day . Most first person shooters do but not Serious Sam . Hear me out . Sure the visuals may feel somewhat repetative after a while but there is always a sense of grandness in the bright open outdoors with the sun shinning over the valley  . The indoors are often well desgined but still feel flat and clumsy sometimes . Their labyrinthian design can feel a bit dated and the gameplay gets very repetative , but its too much fun to be overlooked . Especially in short burts . The First Encounteris also a short game so it won't be a long tiresome journey either . The thing that works like a charm , personally is the gameplay . The shooting is a lot of fun . Espcially if you are into games like Killing Floor . You defend yourself while killing hordes of enemies that charge at you from all directions of the map or shoot at you from a high platform or tower . Once you clear an area a door opens and you move into the next area or map . Then rinse and repeat . Occasionally you have to collect a few items or hit a few switches to forward youself into the next map or level . Its solid fun if you ask me and well worth a try . It might be my nostalgia talking but I am frankly amazed at how good this game feels and runs on today's systems . Everything is butter smooth . No constant updates , no dlcs , no online crap . Just a great single player experience . Time I deal with The Second Enounter now ! Adios :)			",169,34,0,16,4,0,24

												The old graphics might be a turn off for some gamers, but keep this in mind. After all these years, I had lots of fun playing through Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter. I was impressed because of the gun shooting mechanics, these being better than some modern FPS titles. Get the Serious Sam Classic: Revolution to get access to SSC: The First and Second Encounter for free. Let's get serious, they are worth buying and playing through.

What I liked about the game	Very impressive level design, the levels are huge, brilliant for fighting hundreds of enemies. The game has aged well the graphics still look good today. The skyboxes also look good and go well with the level. 	Good story, The PDA keeps you up-to-date on what's going on.  	Serious Sam is a brilliant protagonist who can be quite funny.   	Not a sad depressing game, it's very cheerful with its colourful levels, Sam's personality, and its comedy elements.	Hundreds of cool looking enemies to slaughter. You also have a great arsenal of weapons to slaughter your foes with. 	Many secrets to be found, plus there are secret levels. 	I like how serious Sam has his own PDA with A.I that talks to you through dialog. When you kill a new enemy or pick up a new weapon the PDA will provide information on that new weapon or enemy. 	I like the idea behind the map, telling you where you just been and where you are going to next. 	You can switch from first person to 3rd person. What I disliked or was disappointed with	Can be very challenging and frustrating, especially towards the end (I played on normal). Make sure you switch on auto save, because it was turned off when I first started playing game.   	The Egyptian setting got a bit boring towards the end.	The soundtrack isn't anything special.	The game does have a auto save system, but I would still recommend you save it manually frequently, because the auto save can save in the most inconvenient places. 	It's a shame Netricsa isn't voice acted.	The accuracy of some enemies can be a little too good.        ConclusionA very good game. You get a lot for your money. You get the original first encounter and the second encounter plus you get serious Sam revolution, which contains both the original games with some minor improvements, you also have survival mode and steam achievements, all for £7.99. I have also seen this game on sale at 90% off, regularly. If you like Painkiller or old school FPS games then I highly recommend you buy this.  82/100 ",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

												I have enjoyed playing this classic game.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay of Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter is quite decent. It is quite fast paste and very fun when you have lots of monsters trying to kill you at one time. That is why the gameplay is quite excellent.VISUALSThis is an old game. The graphics on this game seem to aged well from what I can tell. But for today's standards, it is no Call of Duty.FINAL THOUGHTSI have enjoyed playing this game in the past and I would recomand playing this game because it is complety different then what comes out of AAA titles in today's age.

												You start out with just a simple gun. After a few steps you get another gun to dual weild. After about 5 hrs you have so much guns and STILL getting more guns/rifles that even Rambo would drop his jaw. I am almost at the end and I play on hard difficulty because I consider myself an experienced fps player (played since 1995).What I like- There are secrets- No regenerating health- Easy to get into- BIG open arenas- Tons of guns- Boss fights- Many FFS moments- One linersWhat others may not like- Repetitive (so is Tetris, chess, sudoku... what's your point?)What I dont like- Makes me wanna play instead of studyI would recommend this game in a bundle because after the first one you want to play the rest of them. In the bundle Ibought there are HD versions together with originals which are awesome.			",164,15,0,16,6,0,5

												Overall: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 7/10Music: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10This game could be seen as the spiritual successor to Duke Nukem 3d and may well be the reason DN4E never did very well. We already had a sequel to D3d and it was this game. One-Liners,  mind blowing challenge, frustratingly frantic battles and of course the sweeet satisfying weapons.The challenge can get quite intense and honsetly it's a little wonky in some jumping areas. But you'll have a grand time meeting all the challenges this game with throw at you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Serious Sam is a game aiming at, now read carefully, Castlevania and Metroid players.Forget the shooting. It's a mere excuse, disguise, for the insane amounts of ridiculous secrets to be found. I mean it.The shooting is actually easy, of course when we're talking about normal difficulty.7/10 seal of Simon's Quest			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When there're movies that you just must-watch then this is the game of a kind that you just must-play!That is the plain First-Person Shooter genre of the early 2000's: Guns, Monsters and MORE GUNS & BLOOD (or Flowers, if you're a hippie - you decide)! It's a classic and I'm not gonna lie, that's one of the games that coined my childhood on PC.It's a simple shooter, so every once in a while when you have a free evening, get yourself some chips and beer to relax by KILLING ALL that's moving on your screen!Prelude: You're the chosen one, a killing machine to exterminate the entire army of Mental, the Overlord of Monsters that came upon the Earth to conquer it. You're the only one who can stop this invasion.✓ Singleplayer ✓ Full COOP Multiplayer (Great fun at LAN-Parties!)✓ PvP Multiplayer (Deathmatch)✓ Brainless✓ Tons of Guns and Monsters✓ Cultic Soundtracks✓ Sequels and HD Remakes with even More Monsters™ (check 'em out!)The game was innovative and beautiful at the time, there's literally no reason to not play it!

												Serious Sam: The First Encounter is a very simple game: Shoot everything that moves. Literally. And while that is the beauty of the game (taking account the complexity and the realistic nature of modern day FPS's) it's also it's weak point. It's a lot of fun killing a ♥♥♥♥♥on of alien-enemies with your arsenal, but the problem is that the game has way too many gigantic choke points that are nearly impossible to pass. It can become extremely tedious to go through one segment of a level, and honestly, without the quick-save feature, I would have called it quits pretty soon. Not to mention how often you ran out of ammo and have to resort to using your pistols against really powerful enemies. The game also recycles the same type of enemies constantly, and it can get boring pretty fast. If you aren't familiar with old-school FPS games, don't go for this one.			",26,2,1,0,2,0,5

												The purest shooter, can get chaotic at times if you'll go into it thinking its brainless, but there is order behind this chaos, and you better approach each encounter more tactically. This is not a Duke Nukem 3D or Doom clone, the level design is good but much more linear since the focus here is the shooting itself.Its a monster shooter, with balanced guns that feel awesome, great soundtrack and sound design (also helps in combat), good looking for its time (and doesn't look dated unlike other games of its time), lots of replayability thanks to mods, cheats, secrets, higher difficulties or if you just want to try different ways of going through the same levels, plus multiplayer which still has some people playing, but very few since the game is old.The only negative, or at least not positive, thing I can say about this game is that its not much better then the remake. Few secrets changed (no playing with gravity in the remake, but this one barely has it anyway), few secrets added. The game is near perfection, but maybe you'd like to get the HD version instead.

												Serious sam classic is really fun and hectic especially when playing with friends where it can become spawn killing the game but all round this game be it that it was bought for me  by a friend ive had a lot of fun playing both on my own and with my friend. i wouldnt say it was my favorite game of all time fair enough it is an old game but it still is very fun to play the graphics are decent for the games time things look detailed where they are needed as are the enemies and weapons. so to conclude i would give a 6.5/10 its a really good game.

												This game is the one of the best FPS Games since i was kid beforeIts a perfect example of how to make a games in a simple mechanics but can goes into 10x multiple.And Serious Engine Nailed it.When I was since 2002,it was jaw-dropping,no performance issues,stable,even there`s a dozens of enemies attacking you,and its a classic game where everyone will enjoy killing enemies,more like stress-killer.Graphics are beautiful since that year,and looks good in todays year,so many customized graphics that you can changed,so much possibilities.Overall,play this game with friends,in fact,there`s still players played this game.Score : 8.5 / 10			",141,23,1,7,5,1,6

												The purest shooter, can get chaotic at times if you'll go into it thinking its brainless, but there is order behind this chaos, and you better approach each encounter more tactically. This is not a Duke Nukem 3D or Doom clone, the level design is good but much more linear since the focus here is the shooting itself.Its a monster shooter, with balanced guns that feel awesome, great soundtrack and sound design (also helps in combat), good looking for its time (and doesn't look dated unlike other games of its time), lots of replayability thanks to mods, cheats, secrets, higher difficulties or if you just want to try different ways of going through the same levels, plus multiplayer which still has some people playing, but very few since the game is old.The only negative, or at least not positive, thing I can say about this game is that its not much better then the remake. Few secrets changed (no playing with gravity in the remake, but this one barely has it anyway), few secrets added. The game is near perfection, but maybe you'd like to get the HD version instead.

Graphics are very good, beautiful and well-designed levels, good humour, LOTS of enemies to shoot and LOTS of weapons to shoot them with! I have some very good memories of playing this back when it was first released - still very enjoyable to play it now. This is one of the 'classics' - right up there with Unreal, Half Life and Deus Ex in terms of pure gaming entertainment. :)Philip			",594,109,42,101,125,2,206

												Serious Sam TFE displays what an arena shooter can pull off.The storyline? It sets the mood, that's about it, and that's all it really needs to do.You are sent into the past to kill off hundreds upon hundreds to even thousands of enemies from destroying the future. Simple enough?Serious Sam introduces literally the most memorable foes in any video game I've ever encountered. I remember each name, and all the stats because the game throws them in your face in a way that actually satisfies. Two shots per beheaded soldier, a quick shotgun blast to male Gnaars, double shotgun for those damn Kleers, loaded cannon to the major Biomechs! The best part is that these enemies rarely appear in troops, but in groups! You'll have a Biomech on one side, an Arachnoid on the other, an Aludran Reptilioid on the roof... how will you choose to approach this? It's all up to you and your powerful arsenal!Something also notable about Serious Sam is the stunning detail. Each enemy has a spot-on texture to make it feel like a true foe, and writings, paintings on the wall give for a total immersion into the mysterious landscape of Egypt. And how damn satisfying that is.Running through factual lands to kill fictional beasts has never, EVER been so pleasing. With a unique arsenal and engaging gameplay, Serious Sam gives you an un-parallelled journey to the beautiful land of Egypt with true to history level design.I could go on and on, but I can't do this all day. Basically, I find Serious Sam to exceed in almost everything it does, and what it does, just never fails to amaze me in all the probable 1000+ hours I've probably played it in my lifetime. A closely followed community also backs up this game, giving you awesome access to mods, weapon models, gameplay tweaks, sound edits, and much more to make Serious Sam the game YOU choose it to be.It's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing stunning. 10/10			",53,1,0,1,0,0,0

One of the most ridiculous FPS's I have had the pleasure of playing. fully expect to go up against 300+ enemies at once with about 10 heavy hitters mingling in the crowd. Although you are given a ridiculous array of weapons, you will still need to strategize; at some points you literally wont be able to unload your guns fast enough. awesome fun and definetly worth it			",160,11,4,10,12,1,16

												So after my first 30 minutes of this game I must conclude that it is fantasticThis is the first ""old"" shooter I played and it makes me want to play all of them. Even with outdated graphics this game gives you an adrenaline rush as intense as that one time your parents almost caught you wanking. Graphics: OLDseriously old looking graphics. The unique thing is the render distance. Most FPS games are corridor-crawlers, not this one. In Serious Sam you wander open fields full of dangerous foes. Controls: mehI've seen quite a few better controls. They feel a bit weird when you first jump in so I thought I'd get used to them. Then it turns out mouse accel was on and I'm a bloody idiot. So yeah I recommend adjusting the options before jumping into the game.Gameplay: AWESOMEThe most important part, and it is amazing. Nothing to me is more relaxing than wading through the blood and gore of several enemies to reach ammo and healthpacks. It feels like an 80's action film in which you are the main character, and it feels good.Enemies: breddy gudNo lack of variety here. I've seen so many different kinds and as of now I only played 30 minutes.Overall: I'd give it an 8/10. pretty good go buy it  ",90,3,1,3,3,0,1

You are not letting go. Ever. Enjoy bunny hopping and circle strafing for several hours straight. At least there is manual saving.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really serious! The very first game from the Serious Sam series. Gameplay is the core, graphics are ok as for that year's game. Enough different weapons. If you like shooting and killing big dozens of enemies (pretty original ones) in one area, this game is definitely for you! Recommended! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So after my first 30 minutes of this game I must conclude that it is fantasticThis is the first ""old"" shooter I played and it makes me want to play all of them. Even with outdated graphics this game gives you an adrenaline rush as intense as that one time your parents almost caught you wanking. Graphics: OLDseriously old looking graphics. The unique thing is the render distance. Most FPS games are corridor-crawlers, not this one. In Serious Sam you wander open fields full of dangerous foes. Controls: mehI've seen quite a few better controls. They feel a bit weird when you first jump in so I thought I'd get used to them. Then it turns out mouse accel was on and I'm a bloody idiot. So yeah I recommend adjusting the options before jumping into the game.Gameplay: AWESOMEThe most important part, and it is amazing. Nothing to me is more relaxing than wading through the blood and gore of several enemies to reach ammo and healthpacks. It feels like an 80's action film in which you are the main character, and it feels good.Enemies: breddy gudNo lack of variety here. I've seen so many different kinds and as of now I only played 30 minutes.Overall: I'd give it an 8/10. pretty good go buy it  ",90,3,1,3,3,0,1

												If you're after one of the best,old school FPS's with classic graphics and jam packed with senseless killing of a ridiculous amount of weird♥♥♥♥♥mutans,Serious Sam is your man! Variety of over-powered weapons,but not really in gameplay...a few puzzles along the way,but It's pretty much all about getting the heart racing and killing♥♥♥♥♥♥ It immerses you in the fact that you're always watching your back for more things to come attack you and when a wave of enemies are running at you from all directions,you're only focused on taking them all out. Ironically,great fun for when you're not after anything too serious or mentally strenuous.			",377,32,23,25,24,9,10

												The tech demo level is pretty cool... Shows you all the different particle effects etc that they use throughout the game, Theres a few online servers, but most people playing are less then desirable....Buy it if the Gold Edition is only a little bit more than the double pack, otherwise leave it			",932,243,51,106,108,10,172

												This game is just batshit insane. One of the most ridiculous FPS's I have had the pleasure of playing. fully expect to go up against 300+ enemies at once with about 10 heavy hitters mingling in the crowd. Although you are given a ridiculous array of weapons, you will still need to strategize; at some points you literally wont be able to unload your guns fast enough. awesome fun and definetly worth it			",160,11,4,10,12,1,16

												One of the games that innovated FPS parody. Serious Sam: The First Encounter blends seamless FPS gameplay, with brilliant level design, and a goofy comedic sense of plotting. Sam Stone is the epitome of much of the late 90's FPS characters and it is with him that I get the most laughs. The enemies vary in some of the most ridiculous fashions. From headless infantry to undead bone predators; Serious Sam brings ridiculous to a whole new level. Nevertheless, it's sense of wit is much appreciated and fresh despite being such an old game. The biggest key here, however, is the design of Ancient Egypt. Breathtaking design and exquisite detail that bring Ancient Egypt to life like I have never seen before. Detailed messages detailing important aspects of Egyptian history, providing comedy and education. What a work of art Serious Sam is.			",406,29,4,48,17,0,24

												Serious Sam was inspired by Duke Nukem and Doom, and thats very apparent when you play it.It's a true old school game, which was way ahead of it's time.Buy this if you're a retro gamer fan. They don't make 'em like this anymore.			",454,20,6,11,8,3,38
