												This game reviewed badly.The press hated it, and the community didn't get it.The story was gaped at and lambasted as being one of the worst in gaming.It caused the death of its development studio, Grin.And yet, it's still one of my favourite games.Originally, I bought this when it came out on PS3, having thoroughly enjoyed Bionic Commando: Re-Armed.I didn't read any reviews, and trusted in Grin to deliver a cracking bionic experience, and they delivered in spades.It's all about the arm you see; you CAN play it as a straight-up third-person shooter with occasional swingy bits, but to do so is to miss the point entirely.You should be swinging, punching and throwing at every opportunity. You should be concentrating on evading the enemy through being a target that's impossible to hit.You should be damn good if you're to get the most out of this game.And that's what people didn't get; they were fooled by how it looked and were expecting a more open experience. So they played it as such and moaned when they didn't get much out of it in return.Bionic Commando is a linear game, and it makes no bones about it. It's not trying to be an open-world roamer; it's giving you a series of tightly packed scenarios to let loose upon as you see fit, encouraging you to experiment as much as possible with the sublime tool it's giving you.And boy, does it reward good play; it has the best use of an achievement system I've come across, even better than Dead Rising (although it definitely took a few queues from there).Under all other circumstances, I hate achievement systems; they're poorly implemented checklists of things you're likely to do anyway most of the time.Yet here, the achievement system rewards you in game as well as with achievement points (less noticeable on the PC where they're simply challenges and the subsequent rewards without the Steam achievements).Manage to kill 3 grunts with one grenade? Congrats, have an upgrade to the amount of nades you can carry!Taken out 3 grunts with one grenade launcher shot? Aces, your grenade launcher radius is improved!And each completed challenge may lead to another, more difficult one, meaning you'll scout out opportunities while playing the levels that'll let you complete those challenges. It's rewarding you for excellent play in the best way possible, and never completely overpowered.On top of this, you have an incredibly well realised vision of a city hit with a recent disaster of apocalyptic scale and some of the best music in gaming. The first encounter with Polycraft, BC's flying mech suits, is a particular early game highlight, with a dramatic, pulse-quickening tune driving your emotions higher as you swing between buildings kicking robot suits out of the air.It's exhilirating, and makes you realise that BC is one of the best ""Super-hero"" games out there.Many games that claim to be about more traditional super-heroes end up feeling flat and distinctly non-super, but BC at its best outclasses them all.It's about larger-than-life caricatures, ridiculous technologies, moustache-twiddling conspiracies and ♥♥♥♥ing sweet bionic♥♥♥♥♥♥Oh, and swinging like a loon through a post-apocalyptic city while Mike Patton hollers like a howler-monkey on cocaine.It's not without its flaws, and could really have done with a little longer in development. Being able to revisit earlier levels with some of the sweet unlocks from later in the game would have been nice; a New Game + a la Demon's / Dark Souls would have been fantastic.But ♥♥♥♥ it. This is a near-perfect slice of third-person arcade action, bombastically delivered by people who had an obvious love for the source material.Age and SSDs has also given it that wonderful Meatboy instant restart feel, positively encouraging you to fail, so that one time in 100 you'll pull off something so incredibly sweet you'll punch the air then sadly realise you don't have an awesome bionic arm like Spencer in real life.Well, you can't have a bionic arm.But you CAN have Bionic Commando.Buy it.

												Let me try to put in to words how I feel about this game.I wanted this game desperately when it released and was shocked to hear the negative reviews. Though in time the overall view of the game has rightfully improved, at the time it was a resounding ""meh.""As luck would have it, days before it released my console would break down. Being a poor teenager with no income, I wouldn't have a functioning Xbox for months. And then, when I *did* get a working console... it was defective and lasted only a few weeks. So did the second and third ones.So Bionic Commando, understandably, had to wait on the back burner.April 2010. The fate of GRIN, and the future of Bionic Commando, was already sealed. It would get another Rearmed, (which I admit I did scream in joy at when I saw the E3 reveal trailer...) a follow up to the remake of BC, and that would be it.But hell, it was $10 and I still REALLY wanted to play it. Sign me up.What I played quickly cemented the game as one of my favorites of all time. I will never forget the moment when I came up from the underground tunnel into Ascension City Park, swinging from branch to branch and flipping through the gently swaying leaves. Or when faced with snipers, fortified and watching the path I needed to take. Quickly swinging from building to building, using them as cover as I climbed. Punching the snipers out or grabbing them with my arm and sending them blasting off in a way that would make Team Rocket envious. And when finally granted a sniper rifle of my own? Slowing down and painting the ground with the brains of my enemies, all the while a (wonderfully deranged) Mike Patton voiced a jeering Spencer, mocking his dead opponents after every successful headshot.Or, as anyone who has played the game will know.. The Archives. Little needs to be said about the moment where Groeder sends an entire army raining down into the claustrophobic arena while the games standout track, The Gauntlet, cheers you on to overcome the odds and beat some BioReign♥♥♥♥♥The swinging is easily likened to Spider-Man, but isn't quite as mindless. Your bionic arm will not automatically connect with anything just by pressing the attach button; you must aim your cursor and find a spot yourself to latch on to. It can be tense, especially when you're trying your best to get out of a hailstorm of bullets, or trying to get in a better position to attack a Biomech that is mercilessly hounding you.The music is phenomenal. From ""Enhanced Tunnel Vision"", to ""Hunters of the FSA"", down to ""Groeders Theme"".. every song is incredible. And yes, of course, the standout track that everyone instantly thinks of when playing this game-- The Gauntlet. I still feel a rush of adrenaline when I hear that song... though I might just have something wrong with me.I want to keep going on about this game and why I love it. The challenge/upgrade system, the multiplayer, even further into the grappling system, Mike Pattons insane dialog, the BEAUTIFUL scenery... but I've received criticism before on writing way too much.There is only one thing the critics got right: The story. It is... goofy. And that might be a tad bit generous.Finally, I want to address something a lot of people might not be aware of: The developers behind this game, GRIN, closed shortly after releasing this game.Those devs went on to create Overkill Software (yep, the Payday guys!) and Ulf Andersson, the genius designer on BC, ended up becoming Wolf in the Payday series.Try and imagine how different things would be had this game sold as well as it deserved to.

												This game is an underrated gem. The controls are unique and work very fluently. Shoot your enemies. Punch your enemies. Throw cars at your enemies. Throw enemies at your enemies. Swing above your enemies and pound them to the ground. Swing around more elegantly than Tarzan. This game just gives you this rare feeling that you can do something really cool with your keyboard and mouse.It's one of my all time favorites in the action genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like Spider-man with guns.This game is so underrated, sure it's got outdated mechanics like having weapons just be powerups that last for a short while, and the levels are boxed in by radiation that kills you instantly, but it's just so much fun to swing around the levels shooting at stuff, using your bionic arm to pick people up and throw them, just so much fun can be had with just that arm and a little pistol (and sometimes a few shots of a more powerful weapon if the designers were kind enough to put one nearby).

												""Is that a long health bar or are you just happy to see me?"" - Nathan Spencer, the Bionic CommandoBionic Commando was a game that almost showed enough self awareness to be awesome. As fan of the original, I am happy to see it get a modern mock up. Although it was clear they changed some things (like, the ending), I was happy that the developer brought the classic back in an updated fashion and then used it for the basis of their full on modern sequel. And in this sequel, the game play is tremendously fun. The grappling hook arm left nothing to be desired. Unfortunately that is the extent of the awesome. The story is predictable, passe, and all around dumb. Simply put, it makes little sense (even with having played the original and the reloaded version of it), and, where the voice actors do a decent job with their lines, those lines are frequently so bad that they could only save it if they lampooned it.  If you ignore the story, which you should since it is that bad, and take the game to simply be a long ride with a grappling hook and a variety of challenges, then this game is great. If you care anything about story, look elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked this game up on the winter sale 2014 for like a buck something and didnt expect to much from it . I thought that due to most ports to PC suck real bad.But then i played this one i think Capcom did a real good job with this one !! It translated to PC very well .Im useing keyboard and mouse it works 100% fine (when does that happen in a port?)  !! The game play is action packed. It starts out a bit slow but finished hard and fast!! The gfx are decent and the controls once set up are fine,bigtime for this being a port!! The plot kinda reminds me a bit of chesse like in Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon but in a good way (love that game also) !I say if you are looking for some good old school button masher, pick this one up 100% !! And if it goes on sale you better get this game in you library !!!			",1639,532,47,191,132,22,176

												This is a really underrated and underappreciated game.In my opinion it's one of the best games of the last generation. If you can look away from the somewhat bad acting and the fact that it-s linear and not open world like it should've been, it's an amazing game. And don't get me wrong, the game has a great story, just not well acted.I really love the bionic arm, swinging around is not like in Spider-Man, here you have to aim your swings on your own and it feels great, doing an awesome swing while shooting an enemy hearing the epic main theme in the background is something you'll never forget, it makes you feel like a badass.To anyone that wants to play this game, I recommend you play Bionic Commando Rearmed first. This is a sequel to that game after all. And if you see something called Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, get away from that disaster as fast as bionically possible. That game ruined the amazing franchise that is Bionic Commando. I also love this game because it's a swedish game, and I'm swedish. Its one of the first games I mention when someone asks what games come from Sweden.I'd rate it like 9.0 out of 10. It could've been a 10 if it was open world and had a cast that can actually act.

												This game is so amazing honestly. I recommend you don't play this on the highest difficulty setting, because it's just going to make you hate this game. This game has received such heavy criticism from many reviews and big gaming sites, but honestly it's such a trip. The multiplayer is dead, and the campaign is short, but heck, for $9.99 you're definitely getting a lot for what you paid for. I find myself replaying a lot of the levels because the visuals are just beautiful, the swing mechanics are great, and I honestly can never get bored of this game. The soundtrack is amazing and while the story is not the absolute best, it definitely makes up for it in the frenetic gameplay, firefights, and combat techniques you can develop. The game is amazing, and for $9.99, you definitely can't go wrong.			",237,16,4,24,11,0,18

Imagine Spider-Man with machine guns.After completing the outstanding 'Bionic Commando: Rearmed', I was eager to see if Grin, the developer, could transfer the swing mechanic into the third-dimension. 8 hours later to beat the game on Hard difficulty, I can confirm they did. No other game does it better, not even the Spider-Man games. There is a learning curve due to the free-form nature of the swing mechanic. But once you master it - once you grasp where to attach your grapple, know what point in your swing trajectory to detach your grapple, understand which direction to shift your weight to, and think far ahead to identify your next two or three grapple points - once you master all that will you truly feel like a ""rad"" Bionic Commando.The swing mechanic also integrates with the combat fluidly. You swing around to avoid bullets, lasers, missiles and other projectiles all while getting into angles that will allow you to strike the enemy at their most vulnerable side. The enemies are usually a mix of airborne and ground units which presents a plethora of challenging scenarios and opportunities for badass maneuvers. Your arsenal is primarily the usual shooter-game affair except for this one move where you latch on an enemy with your grapple, zip towards them at high speeds and kick their face in. Swing, zip-kick, swing, shoot, swing, zip-kick, shoot, swing, shoot, and so on and so forth at different enemies without ever touching the ground. When you have a chain going, it's beautiful. Unfortunately, there are a good number of areas where the fight is too focused on the ground. You can still swing, but since most of the enemies in those areas are infantry units and sometimes there isn't much room to swing or there are too few surfaces to grapple onto, the game feels less like Bionic Commando and more like an average third-person shooter. Also, the fact that you can't zoom your gun while swinging despite being able to do so on foot means half of your bullets are likely going to miss when going for fancy shoot/swing combos. It encourages the separation of combat and swinging when the game is at its best when the two are merged seamlessly together. Thankfully the game is at its best majority of the time.Now moving on to the artistic aspects. Before the game was released, a graphic novel was made available called 'Bionic Commando: Chain of Command' (which I was still able to find via Google search). It sets up the game's plot and promised an exploration of the theme of human enhancement - using bionics beyond a ""cure"" for physical disabilities. Well, the game's story squandered that opportunity (although the story is still passable by gaming standards). The score, however, is an amazing modern interpretation of the 8-bit original.Finally, the multiplayer. There is nothing much to say. I've never tried it since the population is virtually nil. I would imagine Capture The Flag would be awesome with the game's unique traversal system. If you're reading this and know others that are interested, we should get a game going (though we have to use Hamachi or Tunngle since Capcom dropped their servers).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game could've been decent if it weren't for the ridiculous punishments for going as much as 10 cms off the intended pathway (instant death in most cases) followed by an awkward checkpoint that forces you to redo the same fight against the same basic grunts over and over instead of putting you at the area where you actually died, all because you missed a grab and drowned/died from radiation poisoning. This is something that only works if you've designed the game around it, such as Dark Souls, NOT for an action game that gives you a swinging mechanic, perfect for an open world game, and then limits you to small, tight spaces because everything else is ""off-limits for your mission"" and therefore kills you instantly. In fact, this game punishes you so hard for not strictly following the story that trying to get the collectibles in each level becomes a non-option, as you don't want to redo the same fight 3 times and listen to the same weak dialog between characters just to get a floating blue item. It's a game that feels like it could've been so much better had it been polished, playtested for a few extra months and based around the whole idea of swinging around FREELY without being scared of instant death screens, instead of mid/close quarters fighting with an emphasis on (an extremely weak) story.

												This game is a mixture of Prototype, Splinter Cell and even Darksiders. Bionic Commando is nothing like those games in general, but you can get that ""oh, I've seen this before somewhere"". Similarity with Prototype and Darksiders - well, you can use the environment to aid you in battle. Throw rocks, cars and other stuff at your enemies. The way the main guy talks with the one that gives him orders is the same way early Splinter Cell games had. Most of the sentences starts: ""Fisher!"". Here you will hear ""Spencer!"" many many times ^^Bionic Commando is a true console port where even the controls tutorial is untouched. You play with keyboard and mouse? No problem! You will still get the tutorial with the xbox controller buttons (Thank god that you can go to the options menu and see which button is which).It has many collectibles you can gather at every level, but these collectibles are just for wasting your time. They do nothing, you acquire nothing by collecting them and sometimes they are placed at the most crazy/annoying locations and if you fail that one try - you will die and you will have to play from the checkpoint once again (killing the same enemies in-between or doing other stuff). I know it makes you to explore the world, but if it's the only way to make you do that - that's a game design flaw.As for the world - even if it looks like an open world with a wide radius - it's actually very limited. You can't go out of bounds, or you will instantly die and those bounds are hard to see. The screen starts to flicker and you better get the hell out of there or you will die in 2 seconds and you will have to do all the same things you had to do before you got there. + there are many scripted 'one-way' approach scenes.Some checkpoints are placed on some annoying places. it makes you to replay the same areas with tough enemies if you screw up a jump or two.Story is very forgettable and it feels like a one long mission. After that, boom - you already beat the game (game length about ~7-8h).And even after so many negative points this game still delivered at the end. The last 1-1.5 hours were really fun and saved the game for me. Overall, the action is fun in this game. Boss fights are fun and challenging until you learn how to handle them. And you know what? As for the last boss, you can even tell him to ""shut the f*ck up!"" when he talks ^^. Just brilliant!			",387,103,12,43,37,8,62

												It's hard to believe that it's taken Capcom more than twenty years to publish a sequel for Bionic Commando. This game is the long awaited follow up to NES title of the same name. Once again players jump into the bionic boots of Nathan Spencer to swing around via his bionic arm, play with guns and throw cars at a giant mechanical worm.The story wrapping up the action goes that following the events of the original Bionic Commando cyborgs were tossed out like garbage, while Nathan was used as a scapegoat and sentenced to death for crimes he didn’t commit. Naturally the cybernetically-enhanced people were outraged by this and formed a terrorist group to fight back, detonating an experimental weapon, wiping out the population and destroying Ascension City. Fortunately for Nathan, the attack was on the day of his execution so he gets out of jail to kill the terrorists.Missions take place in and around Ascension City and for the sake of level linearity most of it – except for the places Nathan needs to go - is dangerously radiated by said experimental weapon. It’s also a good idea to stay out of the water as Nathan sinks like a rock. This is also the biggest point of frustration in this game as there are several portions where you have to swing across floating mine fields - miss a mine and you’re sunk.Then you have to sit through a load screens which can last several seconds and make what should be a simple second or third attempt a big source of frustration. The second gripe is that these unavoidable load screens are far too common – every time you come to another check point you’re greeted by another one, breaking the flow of gameplay significantly. Fortunately, Grin has done an excellent job on the swinging controls and even indicates to you the perfect time to jump saving you a lot of unnecessary frustration. Holding down the trigger after you jump will cause you to grapple onto the closest target automatically as well.The bionic arm can also be used as a weapon to throw an object/enemy. Aside from the arm, Nathan has a decent selection of guns too, including his classic machine gun. On top of that Bionic Commando introduces new toys including rocket and grenade launchers - all of which are made available via pod drops throughout the game.If you can look past several frustrations, you’re in for some impressive environments ranging from the city park, down town areas to deep caves. Navigating them is the simple task of moving from way point to way point, and dispatching enemies along the way.Although going from “point A, to point B” sounds repetitive, Nathan isn’t your usual silent tough guy – his character carries the game well. He’ll let out a yell when you take an impressive jump or swing. On top of that, he can take a jump from insane heights without dying - where most protagonists in recent memory would crumple.Bionic Commando also sports some of the craziest boss battles in recent memory, including one against a giant robot worm in a parking lot. The other enemies range in size from swarms of robot insects, to generic soldiers, and armoured soldiers with a weak spot in their back. Some fights will even see you taking on up to three armoured soldiers with nothing but rocks to throw.Bionic Commando is a strong action game, but it's nowhere near groundbreaking. The groundwork has definitely been set for this franchise and I'm excited to see where Capcom can take it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A real fun game, if you was a fan of the oldschool version then this is really worth buying, getting the hang of the grapple can be hit and miss, may get used to it in minutes may take you an hour just depends on your reaction time I guess.This was of course a console game first and so it can use a controller tho I strongly recormend using the mouse and keyboard.The only 1 problem I have with this game is there is no manual save and so few checkpoints/save points that if you die you will no doubt have to do a fair bit again.Also has a nice soundtrack remenisent of the oringal.

												I feel like this is overall one of the most underrated and unappreciated games on Steam. Despite a slow start and some small annoyances like a lacklustre story and some weird technical choices, Bionic Commando is very fully featured and comes with its own achievements, collectible/upgrade memories, area notes, a great variety of enemies, excellent boss fights and most importantly a plain old fashioned fun central gameplay mechanic.HighlightsThere were plenty of highlights in Bionic Commando for me and none of them stood head and shoulders above the rest because most components were fully rounded. Large open maps were very rare in gaming until Croteam came on the scene years later, and the textures, changing environments, well designed levels and artifacts all create a compelling and fairly memorable world.The weapons are also rounded, and in most modern shooters you'll find yourself sticking with just one or two weapons, whereas in Bionic Commando, while the firing animations are occasionally mildly annoying, everything is well designed and different enemies and situations warrant different weapons. The variety of enemies is also worth mentioning, even if I thought the standard grunts were frivolous and redundant by the end, the different types of enemies with different variations added a depth to combat, and the boss fights all have a small setup, good intro animations and a genuine need to remember arm moves and combat techniques to progress which harks back to the good oldschool learn-and-apply method.* Consiquential achievements are far too rare and they're used here to give you upgrades and extras when you experiment with your abilities. They actively reward varied play. Bulletstorm is the only other game I can think of off-hand that does anything similar and it's very welcome.Mistakes and AnnoyancesThere was nothing game-ruining here, but there were a few annoyances worth mentioning. Right off the bat the tutorial segment is a frustration because the controls are mapped for console rather than PC, which stand out because the mechanics take some time to get used to. Small things like the unskippable cutscenes which made for waiting several seconds to load the same boss fight each time you died, collectibles having a strange audio flag that pulled you out of any immersion, and the God awful menu system which makes you go through 3 menu progressions, then reload back to the title screen, then access another two menu points to quit just boggle the mind. Together these small annoyances made this feel like a slightly weaker title.The other thing that actively takes away from the game though is the marriage between great voice acting and poor dialogue. The dialogue is really subjective, and personally I found the crude humour and occasional bad one-liner fitting for what is essentially a fun mindless action game, but after hiring such great voice actors it's a shame they haven't spent more time and effort on the story and writing, which could've easily made a good game great.RecommendationsAt just £6.49/9.99€/$9.99 at the time of review, Bionic Commando clocks in at an average play-time of 8 hours and the collectibles add at least another 6 or 7 hours for completionists. This is also a fantastic game to come back to and I can see anyone interested in speedrunning having a blast trying for a faster completion with this game.My conclusion then, is that this is good value for money and a good buy for anyone who doesn't mind a mildly dated and fairly mindless but strong platforming shooter with a hidden depth of ability.

												TRIGGER WARNING - This review has spoilersThe whole revival of the Bionic Commando IP happened at an unfortunate time in history. It was when nearly every company was looking to have their games be more darker, serious and brooding. It happened as Inafune was outsourcing most of Capcom's IPs to Western devs. And to be fair maybe that's the only reason this series ever made a comeback. Because of Grin's interest in the series. Or atleast that's my take from it. Even having tried to work on Strider and Streets of Rage as we know now. But back to this series. Grin made two pretty decent Ghost Recon games (and the racing game Ballistics) before making Bionic Commando Rearmed. I had no idea what the series was at the time but the remake received pretty unanimous praise back then and after playing it later I must say it's an amazing game. It's a frolicking Indiana Jones -esque action platformer where you gun down nazis and eventually explode Hitler's head in graphic, satisfying detail. It's a colorful adventure with funny writing and with gore in appropriate places. It plays, sounds, looks and reads great and it had it's own distinct vibe.Now how does this relate to the Bionic Commando Reboot and to what I said earlier about bad timing? That vibe is gone. See when Grin could reimagine the series for the reboot, they took all the story elements and made them super super serious. Basically gave it the ol' 'Man of Steel' treatment. Nathan ""Rad"" Spencer is now an angry vet with cornrows and a gravely voice. He's been left to rot in jail for years after saving his country but having been sentenced for ""war crimes"". Nathan is called to action one last time by his old friend Super Joe who also talks all broody and is voiced by Steve Blum doing his Jack Cayman voice. Joe tells Spencer that unknown terrorist group has nuked one of their cities, killing millions and it's up to Spencer to traverse the city and find out who's behind the attacks. Spencer also looks to find his lost wife. Also worth mentioning briefly is that Nathan Spencer is voiced by Mike Patton whose music I love but I think he's terribly casted in this game and his delivery doesn't come across believable in the slightest. He's better at voicing characters like the Darkness.(Spoiler) Super Joe later turns out be evil and it's revealed that Joe killed Spencers wife so that her mind could be put into Spencer's trusty Bionic Arm for it to have worked in the first place. Joe and Spencer later have their final battle in the sky. Joe ends up dieing with Spencer falling down out of the sky. It's uncertain if Spencer actually dies and the game ends with cliffhanger with no sequel in sight ever. (End Spoiler)It's these kinds of changes to the story and mood that affect other areas of the game and by extension my enjoyment. You see form follows function. So with a darker mood in the story comes a darker color palette and environments in the art direction. That said the game is too grey. Like way too gray compared to the vibrant palettes of the previous games. The environments also consist mostly of different parts of a destroyed city. It's a sad contrast to the caves, factories, jungles, mountains and forts of the previous games. I shouldn't feel depressed when playing a game about a guy punching evil in the face. Unless it was done well like in Rambo or First Blood, but that's beside the point. I don't think that's what the series should be.Tonally the game is a mess. Imagine if in the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Marion just died a horrible, bloody, murder porn death in the hands of the nazis because Lucas and Spielberg were feeling edgy that day. Also Marcus Brody wishes Indy dead throughout the whole adventure. Sallah sells Indy out to the nazis and him and Indy have their final battle on top of the ark where Sallah melts into nothing but you don't see if Indy died or not because maybe he was able to avert his eyes at the end, who knows. Indy collapses behind the ark and as you think the camera will pan around to show him alive the screen goes black and the credits roll. Also the movie is in black and white and instead of the Raiders score, it's the Schindler's List score.The gameplay however is great and that's where the problem lies. Even with the depressing tonal shift it's a joy to just play. Especially just swinging around in the environment is a lot of fun. It's hard to give this game a clear yes or no recommendation. Just this muddled maybe. It's a game that you maybe should try but it's also one that you don't lose much by not doing so. And I am honestly surprised how well they turned this series into 3D and would love to see someone else implement these grappling mechanics into another game. However one flaw with the gameplay itself is that mechanics encourage exploration. You want to see just where you can get to with the bionic arm, but the game is sadly overly linear. The areas may look open but there are invisible barriers everywhere to block you. Some kill you instantly and others simply don't let you progress. This ties into the bad timing. Were it made today the game would surely be open world and similiar to likes of Just Cause 3. And while this 'modern way' doesn't work for every IP, it would've sat perfectly with this one.The icing on the cake is that this game sold poorly when it came out. It was going for that mass appeal and just didn't reach that audience. After Bionic Commando, Grin made a Terminator Salvation tie-in game before going bankrupt.Ex-members of Grin then formed a new company called Overkill who made one good game (Payday) after which they♥♥♥♥♥♥out a turd called Payday 2 and have since been the stars of their very own, self-inflicted microtransaction debacle. Only this time it took them 2 games to burn themselves. One could say it's like poetry.Anyway. Bionic Commando Reboot. It's okay.			",211,12,2,11,4,0,10

												This game is pretty cool. It's quite hard to get used to it and I have to admit that I flew through the air like a potato at first, but after a bit of training you turn into a flying killing machine, striking from hundred meters above. At the ground you start throwing cars at your enemies or if you have an evil day you just take the corpse of the recently killed to humiliate your villains. The graphics are quite nice, music is rare but cool, and the story is for an action game really good with super epic ending. So if you aren't absolutely casual give it a try, it's totally worth the money and while Bionic Commando doesn't reinvent the wheel it gives it a super cool bionic arm and yea, that's pretty awesome			",259,65,2,27,11,1,19

												fantastic game. imo, very underrated. i'll start with the bad and then onto the good.bad: this is a port. on-screen controls are all for xbox360, so thats not the most helpful. only settings you can change are resolution and refresh rate. i assume the game detects your hardware and the visuals scale up/down accordingly. voice acting is...meh, writing is...meh. plot is...meh. nothing to write home about. not a very long game either, but $10 isn't a bad price for it.good: gameplay is quite fun. swinging mechanics are not 100% polished, but its pretty good. the combination of arm based combat and weapons, along with the varied areas and bosses mean the game doesn't get boring. superb soundtrack. one of the best i've heard in any game. the protaganist will say corny one-liners after every couple of kills, which always gives me a chuckle. visuals, for a 2009 game, are pretty damn good. if your hardware can handle it, force V-sync and AA through your GPU control panel. Made the game look so much better, and much smoother. Before, there was no AA and my FPS was fluctuating wildly b/w 90 & 160 resulting in a lot of tearing. for $10, its a great buy. just know that multiplayer doesn't work anymore, I assume the servers are closed. shame, i had fun playing MP on ps3			",67,6,2,1,5,1,3

												People will call this a bad game. It really isn't. (Depends on your computer though.) It's a rather short game, only lasting about 5 hours if you get good at it. But those five hours have a lot going for them. The combat is excellent, always pushing you to do your best against the multides of enemies. But it reaches a point where it keeps throwing the giant mech robots at you (Which is conviently after you learn how to use and instant kill grapple.) The combat manages to flow smoothly into the swinging mechanic, and you can zip around the area, using that as your advantage against the many enemies the game hurls at you. There is seriously nothing more fun than tossing your enemies around like little dolls.But, the game has an challenge mod, where you get in-game abilities and perks for completeing them. The problem? This only works in story mode. If you level jump to an earlier area, you can can't collect any missed collectables or try to complete any challenges. So, if you like to speed through the game and keep the momentum going, you'll miss out on a lot. The boss fights are hit or miss. Some, like the fight against a giant robot worm, manage to be exciting. Others, like the last boss, are annoying. None of them really take advantage of the swingings, so you'll be fighting bosses on a lot of flat areas. (It would have been really fun to fight the last boss by swinging off his flying drones and shooting him from above.) The story though, and by extension the big plot twist, is bare bones and stupid. Your goal is to fight off some terrorists while trying to find out what happened to your wife. New characters come in and pop away forever in the same cutscenes they're introduced in, and very little feels resolved. The game even ends on a cliff hanger, and you just feel cheated by the end. Do I recommend this game? Yes. But get it on sale. Like for 2 dollars. Because it won't last long enough (Since the multiplayer servers are down forever) to justify a big price. (There is a reason it's only 1$ to buy it for a console.)			",130,14,1,6,2,1,3

												This game was fun. Graphics satisfying. Overall, its worth it. But I recommend getting it on sale. I'm going to bash this game yet recommend it. Strange.Be aware the porting is sloppy. That is the most noticeable frustration. Movement like walking on terrain and jumping can be frustrating but because you can swing around, it makes up for it. Plot isn't anything special. Graphics are acceptable. Voice acting of Spencer is overacting and I'm a Mike Patton fan--however the script is pretty bad so that doesn't help. It's unfortunate. I agree with other reviewers on the aggravation of hitting a contaminated zone and dying quickly when your are having fun swinging around. Bad game design. Also bad designing is dying, having to watch an animation sequence, dying again and having to watch the animation sequence again. This game is full of little things like that. Just bad choices, like giving Spencer dreds. ?? Probably for easier animation. Put a hat or helmet it on him instead. I don't know what they were thinking when they wrote this game and why they did what they did but its done. Nothing we can do about it.Having mentioned all these, I still had fun. I recommend it because it is different. There are strong and original action sequences that stand out. One of the strengths of this game is being able to use your surroundings to attack the enemy. Nice!! I am a Bionic Commando fan so I am a little biased. But if you have to make a choice between this or Bionic Commando Rearmed, get Rearmed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being one of the older gamers and growing up in the NES era of harder then fsck games, this game resonated in me, thinking of the NES Bionic Commando (and having to beat it in shifts with my brother, since we were allotted a 30 minute timeframe to play games in as a kid).  I didn't know there was an arcade version before, just the NES version. But here we go!Pros:  It's Spiderman with guns.  You start out with gunplay (and what you think is a weak pistol, until you start aiming for the head), but the game eventually becomes swinging, shoot and dodge and throw things action.  To me the swinging action felt natural and easy, without the ""optimal swing"" suggestions from the UI. There were many panic'd moments of swinging under buildings and all while dodging enemy fire, hoping for that moment when I could pop up and do massive damage.  The plot takes so many twists and turns, that you can't (until the end) guess where you are going.  It can be forgiving.  Enemies respond  appropriately to being approached in melee range (often snapping out some sort of electic stunning/killing baton, or taking advantage of your zipline).  It's gorgeous for the time, and even now.  And the humor makes me laugh (see the easter egg regarding the mechanical worm, your character breaks the 4th wall talking about it's health bar, and on playthroughs Joe suggests you fsck it which your character gives a VERY APPROPRIATE RESPONSE of uhhhhh).Cons:  This is NOT the glorious open world game that it should have been. It falls into a ""We'll keep the player confined due to a crappy mechanic"" catagory, which makes it much more linear then it begged for.  Yes, I realized that the whole area is full of radiation, but the moment I hint about getting on the edge of where the designers ment me to be, I don't want to immediately die to radiation.  The same applies to water, yes I realize a giant metal arm would drag me down, but I didn't expect to drown in 3 feet of water before the game EXPLAINS it to me.  And while I praise the plot twists, I also lament in them... there's times where the plot makes zero sense (mysterious congression member that is only there to be Joe's foil, I'm looking at you).  Or is easily guessed.  Especially at the end where...  Well, I don't want to do any spoilers but the jump from when you fight Groder, who has final boss material written all over him especially considering the NES game, until you fight the actual final boss... makes no sense. It's like the writers and designers went ""Ok we have to finish this up"". The final boss battle is a simon says mashup that is painful on the keyboard (if you've gone with the origional keybinds, which INITALLY MAKE SENSE).  It's probably better on the XBox controller that the onscreen commands referense, without notating keybinds.  I felt like I was playing the old Track and Field games, letting go of the mouse to twitch/mash the F button.  Even the menus and all leave me with thise sense, losing a ton of interesting reading to the ""ok, do I press the down arrow, or the actual down button (bound to S) to read all of it?"" syndrome. The ending left me feeling... unsatisfied.  That's all I want to go into without spoilers.  It wasn't even worth waiting for the epilogue, especially since the last part isn't even translated (thank you wikipedia).Final Verdict:  If you can get it on a grand sale, it's worth it. Like a $3 or less kinda thing. You'll have 5ish hours of gametime, feel mostly satisfied (until the end) that you are the speedy, dodgy, spiderman killing machine you are, only occassionally hampered by game mechanics, random deaths, and a final fight that is stupidly annoying on the keyboard with the default binds.  And you'll get that rush of being spiderman. With guns.			",208,44,7,23,18,3,52

												I've only played 2 spiderman games before (both demos) Spiderman The movie and Spiderman, the one where smoke is at the bottom. Both were kind of boring to me. This wasn't. It was awesome.StoryYou play as Nathan Spencer a guy who is on death row. He is released and given a chance to earn his freedom and the location of his wife by taking down the enemies in a town that was nuked. You fight against Bio Reign a pro bionic terrorist group. In the time between the NES game and this one bionics are outlawed because of a rumor that it causes agression (and other reasons). Yes it sounds like a Hollywood remake of something simple (like half the shows on TV) but it works out fine. The story is very cool and is told through conversations between Super Joe and Spencer and messages on relays. Half of the time Spencer is serious but the other half he is not. When killing enemies he sometimes gives one liners like ""Sucks to be you!"" and ""Go long son!"". When he tries to put a password in and it isn't right he says ""Well that sucks"". Also the big gunmen are cocky and call you names that a 7th grader would make.GameplayYou use your bionic arm to attach to objects and swing. Use W to swing forward and S to swing back. You can also ""reel in"" to objects (attach to it and ram yourself towards it). It's very fun and you can go far with it. Lots of people say it's hard but it's not really hard to me. In midair even if you are not close enough to your latch target yet you can hold the cursor there and when your body gets close enough it will latch on. The harder thing to do is to reel in to attack bionics in the back (if you dont aim right you will latch to the ground). There are two kinds of enemies, regular gunmen and bionics. Gunmen can be killed by your guns and grenades or your bionic arm. You can throw objects in the world at them, fling an enemy up and throw one at the other. The bionics are the real fun enemies to fight. You swing around looking for objects to throw while dodging their attacks and then wait till they get close enough to attack while worrying that they will get you before you can throw the object. It's very fun and intense.MusicThe music is really good. It is very epic and sounds patriotic for some reason. Most of the tracks are remixes of the original theme (which are still good) but some of them are ambient and it has a very cool action theme. There is a fight in a library that will give your goosebumps because of how epic the music is making it.You will feel so free when you play this game and swing. You can go great heights in distance and combat with just your arm. And it's pretty easy despite what others say. Checkpoints are available right before big fights so I don't understand why some reviewers like GT said they weren't. The only problem is that if you want to get all of the collectables the checkpoints are unforgiving because you could get the item (after risking your life for 5 min trying to get it) and then miss a swing or die from the enemies before you get another one. Then you have to get it again			",161,29,0,1,3,1,3

												I like it...I really do....I almost wanna thumbs down this sucker though cause of one irritating AF thing. The checkpoints are oh so very annoying. You can watch a cut scene then die and still start far back at some way point before the cutscene. Not to mention having to recollect all the collectables that happened after said waypoint too. UGH. Everything else is pretty fun though. :\EDIT: Upon playing further I change my mind....♥♥♥♥ this game...it has to be one of the most irritating games I've played. Go out of bounds for a split second and die. Respawn and have to redo a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥...dafoq do these collectables even do?

												Great game, brings back memories. So what if it's a bit cheesy? It's a cheesy milita spiderman 2000's sci-fi action movie game. The controls don't feel clunky, but they could be smoother; there were better games in/before 2009. This game still holds a specila place in my heart though, I suggest to give it a try at least. Also it wasn't properly ported so it's only showing xbox controls. There aren't many buttons though so once you find them you get used to them in no time. Another thing is that this game is challenging, and I love that! Doesn't hold your hand and will have you playing for a while, the boss fights are also engaging (it's Capcom, what do you expect?!).A lot of reviews said that it was repetitive, but I don't think that's the case to be honest, I mean as mentioned the boss fights are refreshing, but there aren't a variety of enemies and only 3 different weapons; you end up using your bionic arm most of the time anyways which is fun af. Hey you have like two hours before you can return it if you don't like the gameplay. PS the swinging takes a while to master because the physics on it are a bit weird, but once you learn it you're good to go (took me a while though).			",48,2,0,3,1,0,3

												A game with quite an interesting development story; one can almost see where the developers had to cut corners. This game shows a lot of promise while never truly reaching that level of greatness.Good:+ Not a cakewalk; game will have you learn it well+ Decent PC port - performs well, all keys are remappable (keyboard and mouse)+ Good graphics+ Varied and beautiful levels+ Good gameplay once you get the hang of itBad:- Checkpoints are sparse and unforgiving; which means you will be forced to restart difficult sections a lot- The game assumes you use an Xbox 360 controller for on screen prompts- No Anti-aliasing!- A little cliche and barely interesting plot- The fog that limits explorationI feel despite the stories this is a pretty good game. It gets much better after the first few levels. I'd give it a 6.5 or 7 - One needs a lot of patience to play this game; it could have been much better with a bit of polish.			",140,33,2,16,2,0,9

												So I really would love to recommend this game to any gamer in general because I had fun with this but I would be leading them to disappointment, but if you are curious and willing to look over some things in a quest to see what this game is like then I would recommend it since its only $10 when not on sale.I am going to start with the good, your main weapon/way of moving around (the bionic arm) is really useful as it should be. Swinging is really fun (best part of the game in my opinion), once you get the ""hang"" of it you really enjoy it, its like being spiderman but better and less wimpy. The environment is usually open letting you find your own way to objectives and they are  pretty well designed. The character dialogue had me laughing not because it was intentionally funny, but because it was so generic action hero one liners that were so over the top ridiculous for the situation. Honesty that is about it on the positive stuff.Now time to bash, the combat system fell flat for me, using the different weapons like grenade launchers and LMG's felt out of place because of the awesome bionic arm that was definitely under utilized. They didn't really explore anything inovative with the arm besided movement and grabbing enemies and throwing them (sometimes into other enemies). Melee combat could've been amazing if you used the arm in crazy ways instead of just waving it at your foes. The story is barely worth mentioning since its another ""where's my girl"" scenario that doesn't end well. Character are not interesting and just there as place holders as something to look at. Boss fights weren't big fights but instead surviving untill you can attack (Worm fight was my favorite). But the worst of it all is the constant technical issues that can show up at really bad times, like when you get stuck in a jumping animation in the middle of a boss fight or everytime you land after a big swing. I know I bashed this game alittle but I did have fun and I would recommend it if you are more of a hardcore gamer, but I can't bring myself to recommend this game to most gamers.

												I'm speaking as a novice to the series; this title is my first game in the franchise. With that out of the way...... I think whether you enjoy BC or don't - depends on the difficulty setting you intend to play on. Seriously. You get a choice of: NORMAL, HARD and COMMANDO. You can't change your choice afterwards. I like to get the most out of my games, so I chose COMMANDO immediately. And on COMMANDO... things get very very very very messy, and still other things which would make the game challenging now make it cheap.And that's what BC is: C-H-E-A-P. And I don't mean price-wise.BC's challenging (or frustrating) difficulty comes from its checkpoint system, where they're pretty far apart. And basically your character Spencer is not a badass; he's a wimp that can get killed by each and any single enemy you encounter. You're armed with a pea-shooter, and occasionally you're given special secondary weapons with very limited ammo. But the pea-shooter's your main thing. Piu-piu-piu-piu, goes Spencer as he has to fire 5-10 bullets into one soldier. Bam, bam, bam, goes the soldier as he kills you in three. Oh, and they can shoot you from literally miles away, even if you don't see them. Reload checkpoint.Oh, your extendable grappling arm - aka your bionic part that the game's all about? Yes, you can grab enemies with it, toss them around. But about 0.5 seconds after you hook onto them, they whip out a sort of taser and send a jolt across the arm. If you're not at full health then - you're dead. Reload checkpoint.You can go melee with the foes. And yes, they will again whip out their taser and bash you with it. Health scenario from above? Reload checkpoint.Snipers? One hit takes you out, with your default health. There's always at least 3-4 of them aiming at you from different directions. They can shoot you across the whole map. Ka-bam! Reload checkpoint.There's robots - flying nimble crafts, or heavy earth-bound behemoths that will pump you full of led and rockets. You can't just shoot them, there's a technique to beat each. And yes, they will soon start coming out in pairs and trios. Reload checkpoint.Scenario: you take out a pair of flying polycrafts in a crazy battle, and while you take a second to congratulate yourself, some 5-6 soldiers parachute from the sky and shoot you dead. Checkpoint? Oh, it was placed BEFORE the fight with the polycrafts. Enjoy! And the game's full of it, so full of this damn cheapness that about a third of the way in I just thought of giving up... and I rarely, rarely, rarely give up on a game, at least for difficulty reasons.You die in 5 seconds if you fall into water, because Spencer can't swim since his arms weighs a ton. If your stray a little from a seemingly open-world levels, you die of ""radiation"" in an equally quick amount of time.Despite it all - BC is a GOOD GAME... as much as that's hard to believe. The Spiderman-like mechanics of your bionic arm are pretty neat, if a little buggy at times. They do take time getting used to. You get to dispatch of your enemies in plenty of awesome ways. The challenge system is awesome: the game offers you to perform challenges (kill 5 guards with one grenade, etc.) and rewards you with character ability and/or weaponry upgrades. There's also collectibles for your hoarding needs. The catch? Well, completed challenges and collected collectibles get saved AFTER the checkpoint. So you may find yourself pulling off extremely difficult challenges or getting that inaccessible collectible, only for a random guy to shoot you - and then you have to repeat the WHOLE section again, and do everything from the start.My playtime's 12 hours at the time of this writing, and I'm only at about 55-60% completion of a single-player playthrough. That's pretty long for a very linear 3rd person shooter/platformer.Bottom line: If you can get past its quirks and cheapness, BC can be very fun.			",218,42,1,17,6,2,18

												Great 3d action/platformer, not a great Bionic Commando game.Beaten twice on console, bought again on PC because I'm a fan of the franchise. If you know what you're getting into, you're gonna have a great time -- if you're looking for Bionic Commando-style gameplay, play ReArmed instead.			",336,116,3,88,18,2,38

												I'll start by saying I've re-written this review to be a little more coherent and sensible.  Bionic Commando has gotten a lot of flack, and caused an unfortunate closing of GRIN studios, whom which had a decent amount of fame due to their hit remaster Bionic Commando:Rearmed.Bionic Commando, with dreadlock Spencer, is by no means a perfect game but definitely holds ground for some praise.  The combat becomes a little repetitive and tedious at points.  However, satisfaction is the real treat of the game once you've beaten a tough segment.  This player, finding himself a little frustrated at times for playing on Hard mode first playthrough, was still happy with the presentation and overall experience.The visuals are nothing special, but do their job.  You have your standard fare of cityscapes, and certain jungle segments that looked pretty cool, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Having a toaster with a mere Intel i7 processor, and an extremely old nVidia GT520 (yes not GTX or anything beefy), the game runs pretty darn smooth, even with hoards of enemies on screen.  Never being one to bicker about framerate drops to a certain degree, I've never noticed anything game breaking.The soundtrack is somewhat memorable, but pretty typical military pep affair -- it's what you'd expect to hear from a game like this.  The voice acting was definitely believable.  Mike Patton did a good job as Spencer.  But their choice of famous Steve Blum as Super Joe was kind of off.  Steve's voice just doesn't fit how Super Joe's character looks in this game.  Steve could've probably done Spencer's voice, it'd have fit the look of Spencer far better, I think.The meat of the game for me was the swinging and grapple combat as is a lot of players who've favored this game.  You're given various guns and grenades throughout the game to use to dispose your enemies.  However, there's ample opportunity to grapple, throw, and zip kick your enemies just the same, and is probably better suited for it usually eliminates enemies quicker...and it looks cooler.  You can even throw boxes, crates, and other soldiers into each other for kicks.  My only beef with the swinging mechanics, was there were a LOT of deaths in my playthrough because of the questionable range of the grapple arm.  Sometimes it felt like I had to be two feet from a surface in order to grapple at times.  There are points where you have to swing across ""mine fields"", where the air mines are the only things you can swing from, and sometimes if you're not used to the swinging mechanics, you may die if you're not careful.A big gripe I have with this game kinda goes hand-in-hand with each other.  I'd have loved a big sandbox world, or many different trial courses seperate from the main game --without combat -- just to swing around and have fun in.  The game offers ""breaks"" in between combat so you can have fun, but they're always pretty short lived.  I'd have loved a bigger playground and not be limited to blue radiation clouds that can kill you instantly, and sometimes are unable to get out of due to the somewhat finnicky range on the grapple arm.  There will be times where you'll swing where you THINK you can go to shortcut your way to an objective point, but there are a stray cloud or two that will just kill you instantly.All in all, this game isn't absolute trash, and despite certain struggles and frustrations, I did have a blast in the end.  This game is definitely meant to be played with mouse and keyboard, and it was really fun in retrospect.  After certain tough segments, I couldn't imagine people even thinking of playing this on pad.  In fact, I think that was partly why a lot of people hated this game... I can see one playing it again to try to find the collectibles, but they don't really unlock anything.  It's a damn shame there isn't more to the game other than the story, and the multiplayer servers are completely trashed.  But first time through?  I'd recommend this game on PC.  7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story is lacking, the voiceovers are bleh, the controls need to be reworked, and you never know when the auto-save is actually cooperating.  These are some pretty glaring flaws, but overall it's still a fun experience.  Fun how, exactly?  When the controls cooperate, swinging through a destroyed city like post-apocalyptic Spider-Man is fun.  Using pure destruction to take out enemies is fun.  The graphics can get a little muddy up close, but the scope of the levels is pretty nice, though the artificial barriers via radiation is somewhat annoying.This is a game most people will be on the fence about.  I'd say get it when it's on sale, although I am disappointed that there are no steam achievements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What to say about this game.  This is my first review, so I'm gonna be rambly as hell and probably lose track of what I was saying.The gameplay is this title is just about as amazing as one could get, for the kind of action involved.  Swinging and jumping and everything makes you feel like a big ol' badass.  Shooting is sub-par though.Otherwise the game is merely okay.  The writing ranges from mediocre to laughable.  The tone is incredibly confused.  There are funny moment and Spencer rattles off one-liners as fast as Duke Nukem, but the lines are cliche and boring.  The themes explored in the game are about as shallow as a kiddie pool, dealing with trust of one's government, loss of loved ones, and betrayal.  So much more could have been done with this game.  I just can't even.Overall, it's good for one or two playthroughs.  If Capcom could get around to adding some kind of mod support, that'd be great, but the game was a commercial and critical flop, so I doubt that would happen.  This is the game that sunk developer Grin, so there ya go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is all flash and very little bang. The gimmick is cool to start off with but the rose tinting soon fades and you are left with an incredibly annoying and repetitive game that offers very little in the way of fun. You will find yourself falling to your death a lot.The game itself runs well and I had very few performance issues, but with a game of this age that’s not surprising. The combat is alright, it has its moments but they are few and far between. The enemies are not varied at all, once you have fought a few you have fought them all.The setting is pretty cool, I love this sort of thing, a huge destroyed city to swing through. But there is no exploration, you are railroaded to where you need to go. The story also is ridiculous. It makes little to any sense and that is when they bother to have any storyline in the first place. If the idea of swinging around appeals to you then have a go. That being said don’t bother trying to finish it as the payoff is lame, pointless and full of more holes than swiss cheese.Have fun? ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												This right here is one of the better games around and it's based on the classic NES series. Game is faithful recreation of the NES classic and if you have experience with the original one, you'll notice this.Game is a port. So the techside of things isn't that good. You can only change resolution and brightness/gamma but not any actual graphical settings. That being said.. the game still does look very good and for it's time, the visuals were well above low quality.Fun and challenging game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actually quite a good action adventure game with a unique twist using the bionic arm for some smooth swinging and grabbing objects, and then throwing them.. could be cars, enemies, boulders... quite cool after you get the hang of it. Too bad that there are no Steam achievements, but there are plenty in game (quite difficult ones)... Story was also nice, some cool speech taunts. Needs some time to grow on you, as sometimes the automatic save checkpoints are too far away, and you need to replay some sections several tims until you get them... Also, the post nuclear scenario with the radiation as level boundaries worked quite nicely to set the stage... 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bionic Commando is the proverbial diamond in the rough.  Ignored by critics, adored by gamers, this titleshould be in every person's steam library as it is always on sale.  A particularly good game for a gamepad.On to the game... The swing mechanic is perfect.  Meaning that it is extremely accurate and requires precise control to really master.  But when you do, you will become the swing cyber ape of violent death.  It is glorious.  Weapons are fun and overpowered, and the massive environments really let you swing out.  You begin powerful and end the game a god of some strange swinging death.  HUZZAH indeed!The game is also beautiful through and through.  Buy immediately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Flawed but mostly very enjoyable. Unconventional swinging mechanics take some getting used to but are a lot of fun if you ignore the part of your brain that says the physics make no sense and play around with it like you would any other videogame mechanic. The first and last half hour or so are the worst parts of the game. This is a completely linear game, which is fine but feels very divergent from a lot of the early environments (big ruined cityscape). Once the game comes up with more plausible methods of constriction than radiation gas the problem becomes a lot less pronounced. The game is at its best when you're fighting large groups of enemies in an open area with lots of stuff to swing around on, which is a scenario that happens fairly often. The story ranges from entertainingly corny to servicably corny to terribly corny. Also, make sure you unlock the classic skin before playing because his new design looks incredibly unfitting in a game where one of his remarks in regards to a boss is ""Is that a long health bar or are you just happy to see me?""8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A short game, with lightweight mechanics, although both of these things are in keeping with the original (and awesome) Bionic Commando games. Be aware if you are a fan of the series like me, this is not the remake, the remake is ""Bionic Commando: Rearmed"" (which is actually not bad), and I happened to pick this up with it as a bonus.It's a simple 3D shooter/platformer. The central character Nathan Spencer (if you aren't familiar with him) has an extending bionic arm that enables him to swing around a bit like spiderman with guns, and this is his first - and probably only - departure from the world of 2D side-scrollers.The all-important grabbing/swinging mechanic is done nicely, enabling the player to smoothly chain swings and feeling ""fun"", gunplay is ok (always zoom in for max damage) and the bionic arm can be put to effect in combat - making it fun to clear a mob of enemy soldiers without firing a shot. There is some throwing around of objects which can get a little janky at times but is mostly just fun.Difficulty is not (in my opinion) punishing, and the game itself is playable enough to be fun to the end - although in traditional Bionic Commando style you will be facing lots of the same enemies, so be prepared for that. Some of the bosses are a bit easier than you'd expect, although not to the point where it spoils the game, and there is one boss (no spoilers) that makes for quite a long battle.I completed it in a shade under 12 hours, and I tend to take my time completing games. The game is generally polished, except for the fact that button presses are generally listed as control pad buttons which sucks if you are playing with a KB/M.It's not earth-shatteringly great, but I enjoyed it from start to finish and will probably be playing it again.PS: This ""review"" is for the single player experience. I didn't try out multi-player - the online play doesn't seem to work. The LAN play actually looks like it will be a blast, I will try when I can cajole a friend into it.PPS: There's a little bit of gratuitous swearing in this, including for one boss fight where it happens at random. I don't mind but my kids love the Bionic Commando games so I'm glad I played through it first - you might not want to play this while granny is in the room.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: June 13, 2016
												Quick Summary: Third Person shooter/platformer with somewhat clunky controls (if you use keyboard + mouse) and not too much depth. It’s still fun and challenging though, so it’s worth playing through. If you have a mediocre computer like me, you might want to artificially cap the frame rate (using your video card settings) since the game will try to run at as high an fps as possible and heat up your video card.You play Spencer, a “bionic commando” pulled out of prison many years after the events of the original Nintendo game from the 1980’s (imprisoned for murdering all the bad guys). In this version of the future, many soldiers who have lost limbs in combat have been outfitted with cybernetic “upgrades” turning them into super soldiers, kind of like the Deus Ex games. Due to the threat of super soldiers running around, bionic upgrades have been banned, and a lot of soldiers have been forced to give up their arms and legs, leading to bad blood between the government and some very dangerous people. In this sequel, a terrorist group called BioReign has attacked a city and it’s your job to go in and discover what they want while killing everyone in your way.You control Spencer in third person perspective and with the aid of your bionic arm, you can swing around like Spider-man. Seriously you can swing from pole to pole or wall to wall just like the recent Spider-man games (Shattered Dimensions, Ultimate Spider-man, and Web of Shadows). This makes it a lot easier to get from place to place once you master the timing and aiming required to swing across the battlefield without ever touching the floor. Unlike Spider-man, you actually need to aim where to grapple. That arm of yours is also your best weapon since it can snag enemies and throw them around, or just punch them in the face.  You can kill any basic enemy in the game with 2 punches.As for gunplay, you have a basic pew pew gun with lots of ammo, but the secondary guns (shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, etc.) are all extremely limited in ammo. You cannot pick up guns dropped by your enemies and they rarely drop any useful ammo. You can only get more ammo by picking up a new gun from drop pods that land near you (especially in boss fights). Because of this gun scarcity, you need to get used to using your melee punch and grapple slam.  I didn’t realize until about 75% through the game how easy it is to pull in enemies and throw them at other guys. You’ll barely need your guns after that unless you get swarmed or need to fight heavy cyber gorilla dudes.Pros:+Decent graphics and an okay story. The visuals for the characters faces aren’t that good, but the gameplay visuals are well done in the ruined city, as you would expect from a modern console port. +A few challenging boss fights to test your reflexes. Cons:-This is a console port, and even if you use keyboard + mouse, the on screen directions are for an xbox controller. This can be a problem during the quick time events if you’re not used to playing with a controller. It can also take some time to get used to the swinging mechanic. The arm’s grapple range is a little difficult to estimate at times, so you’ll be falling to your doom a few times.-The game uses a checkpoint system, and the checkpoints are farther apart than I’m used to. There are a number of action sequences where you’ll die and think “wtf, I have to do the whole thing over?” Fortunately, I realized about halfway through the game that you don’t actually have to fight most of the enemies. The game doesn’t have “experience” or money so there’s no real reason that you need to kill everyone. Some places have doors that won’t unlock unless everyone’s dead though. Overall the game is not bad, but it could have been a lot better. It’s not that good as a shooter, and the swinging portions can be annoying where you’ll swear you should have grappled but still fall to your death.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that just couldn't catch a break. It released in a swarm of AAA titles that people cared way more about, and reviews initially slammed the game because it actually takes skill to move across the maps and no one's good at anything anymore. This is Spider-Man as a third person shooter. The Swinging mechanic is very freeing, and allows you to combat your enemies and traverse the environment any way you see fit. Xbox controllers are supported natively, and though I remember it taking a small amount of effort to run at 1920 x 1080 without any tearing issues, my experience was overall smooth and I didn't experience any major bugs or any crashes. Overall a fun, very under rated game that more people should set aside time for. You can also unlock Spencer's original costume if you own Bionic Commando ReArmed and it makes the experience even better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It certainly isn't going to beat out our Hispanic friend Rico, and its instakill gimmicks and annoying to get collectibles may be a turnoff for some, but Grin's revamping of the classic formula and Jamie Christopherson's (MGR:Revengeance) Simon Viklund (PAYDAY 1/2)-supervised score along with familiar yet new swinging action gameplay make it something of a sleeper hit.One negative is also the slightly incoherent banter between the protagonist and Mission Control, (he just said you COULD save the guys, and you said he was more concerned with the mission? You couldn't have said ""I'll move faster"" or ""Yeah, I hope so too."", not be a d**k for the sake of being a d**k!)Interesting fact folks: this runs on an earlier version of the PAYDAY engine. The more you know!EDIT: After trying to get this game running recently, it threw up in my face and told me PhysXloader.dll was missing. Except I already have the newest version. Don't expect a patch as studio reformed and lol cash♥♥♥♥♥s.Ninja Edit: After little deliberation, it was found you require the PhysX legacy drivers, which allow this game to work. Carry on folks.

												In terms of pure game mechanics, Bionice Commando 2K9 is an absolute hidden gem. Very few games handle 3-D swinging properly, and it can be quite a difficult mechanic to implement, yet it's done so with aplomb here. On top of that, the game combines this swinging with a militaristicly styled 3rd person shooter to create a very unique experience of highly mobile tactical shooter (thanks to your generally small health bar and generally limited amount of ammunition and weapon carrying capacity). When this game is firing on all of its cylinders, you'll have truly amazing moments where you'll Spider-Man around large maps taking out squads of enemy soldiers, their air support, and mechs bit by bit fighting against larger numbers and gravity all at once. And it can be glorious. However, there are a host of very real problems too: > The radiation walled death zones can be very, very annoying> There isn't enough enemy variation in either the number of types of opponents, nor the AI for the more advanced ones present in the game> There DEFINITELY aren't enough bosses, and only one boss battle takes full advantage of all of the player's mechanics> The weapons are functional, but not terribly imaginative> The linear progression of levels is not the best choice considering the player's abilities - one big sandbox or multiple smaller sandboxes would have made much more sense considering the nature of your moveset> The world's tone is trying to ape Gears of War bleakness far too much, but doesn't have either that game's Bromancing or gallows humor to add necessary levity to the experience, and just becomes the king of Edgelord Grim-Dark apathy> The plot gets mind-bogglingly stupid two-thirds in while leaving off on a horrible note that includes a bunch of QTE's in a game without any of them up to that point (with a terrible cliff-hanger tease on top of it all), and finally . . .> they seriously spit on the character of Super Joe, who is ostensibly the original Capcom mascot (you'd think they'd have treated him better, considering). (Oh, and the Multi-player, which is just as amazing as the absolute best the SP has to offer - think UT/Quake 3 style tournament shooting DM with grapple swinging all over the pretty big, very vertical maps - has never found even a small audience, and so is very dead)But all of that said - this is still a great experience every once in a while to load up and play through a run on a weekend. A fine little adventure that showed off some great mechanics that could have been very well served in a sequel that would have more time to be developed (and which understood the proper level and enemy design for a swinging super-soldier character type). In a way, it's painful to play as a result. Because you can TASTE the missed potential with this series. But if nothing else, this might be the best possible game to teach game design: it shows you so many ""Do not do this"" lessons, while still retaining a core of solid gameplay that you can tell it wasn't incompetence of craftmanship that was the problem here.

												Bionic Commando is a game I loved most of the time and hated at other times. The game obviously centers around using your arm to swing around the world and fight bad guys with various weapons and abilities. The basic structure goes something like this: Swing through a short entry area, swing through the world and shoot/throw/punch enemies and swing to the end of the area, and repeat. This is broken up by a few really fun boss fights, and is mostly fun. I think the best part of this game is the main mechanic: the arm. you left click to launch your hand and grip an object, and you can swing from there. the catch is, you have to manually aim where you want to swing every single time. while it feels awkward at first to control and may turn you off,  but once you get a hang of the swing mechanics and weight of your character it becomes an absolute BLAST to fly through the stages at lighting speed. The arm lets you do other things, like grab and enemy and throw them at others, kick up and punch cars around like paper, and zip from one end of the arm to another. unfortunatley, this concept is limited by some odd design decisions. the levels are very linear, and you're often punished for exploring by being hit with radiation, this game's form of the invisible wall. radiation kills you almost instantly, and i found myself sometimes swinging to get away from an enemy mid-combat only to land somewhere i wasn't supposed to only to be killed. the guns are also somewhat tame in comparison to the arm, and feel especially weak as a result with a few exceptions. Your pistol is your main weapon and gets things done but is mundane. the other weapons are the highlight here, and most shine. the machine gun tears through enemies, the rocket launcher homes in on minibosses, the grenade launcher destroys everything in the game, the shotgun rips anything apart, and the sniper, wel... snipes. the problem with these weapons is their relative rarity, and ammo is SCARCE for these things. you will almost never run out of pistol ammo but for most of these bigger weapons you'll only get 8 shots for (with the rocket launcher and machine gun being exceptions, 4 rockets and 400 bullets respectivley). these are satisfying, but you'll be afraid to use them because of the scarcity of ammo around the game. the story is very B-movie like, and the main character is unlikable throughout the entire game. the music though? top notch remixes of the original NES themes will have your adrenaline going. all in all, Bionic Commando is not for everybody. It is a flawed game for sure but if you are like me and give it a chance you might just have some fun with this one. Keep this one at arm's (heh) length, but don't be fooled by those who panned it harshly because it's still a good amount of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While this game can be quite frustrating, it is also quite fun.  If you are a fan of the original, then more likely than not you will like this.I was dissappointed at the amount of exploration you can do, but there are some secrets to be found by adventuring.  By far, one of the most annoying aspects is the radtiation zones.  If you venture too far, you can die of rads.  However, you generally only get 2-3 secs to change your course if you are in a rad zone and often while flying, that is quite hard to do.In any case, the mechanics of swinging this way and that are fun and allowing for multiple attack scenarios.

I did have fun with it, and it stayed true to the story of the olden days, but it had quite a few overtones and over the top plot twists that might have been a little too much. Plus, you'll get mad at the Biomechs. I did. Play this if you want another rootin', tootin', grapplan shootin' adventure.* YASD: Yet Another Stupid Death. You know, when two of the aforementioned Biomechs appear out of nowhere and land relatively close to you.

												Severely underrated, Bionic Commando is a real treat to any fan of swinging around really fast. Basically, it's a linear Spiderman game with significantly harder level design, a much better combat system, awesome music, and a B-movie story. It's hardly the second coming we were all looking forward to, but in my opinion it isn't too far off base. The multiplayer is a genuine blast to play, too, especially CTF. Too bad it isn't online anymore. LAN play still works though, so if you can round up some friends for a LAN party, Bionic Commando sessions could become a regular thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bionic Commando is clearly a game that was developed and produced with a clear target market.  I was very much shocked to find that this game apparently reviewed very poorly upon release, and am even more shocked to find that others would still regret playing this game, as it is, truly, ""an underrated gem"".  The most fascinating piece, is that i was actually skeptical about this game upon purchase.  It was on sale, however, and also came packaged with the Bionic Commando Re-armed game.  I've never been a fan of Bionic Commando on the NES.  I thought the game was ambitious for its time, and the controls a tad confusing.  This game came across at me as another generic third-person-shooter with another gimmick in gameplay, but it is actually so much more.  Despite my lack of interest in the original Bionic Commando, i am a huge fan of Capcom games, and this game carries with it the same love and care that most Capcom games have traditionally carried.  This game is one of the best games I have played in a long time, and it hasn't been since i played Mega Man X4 as a teenager that i felt this badass playing a video game.The clear breadwinner of this game is the gameplay.  As i mentioned, i was worried this game would be another generic third-person-shooter, with the bionic arm being another gimmick in gameplay.  However, i am proud to say that this game took a bionic fistful of my words, and shoved them right back down my throat.  The bionic arm is clearly amazing, with the range of actions you cam accomplish with it.  Swing through the leaves like a crazed bionic Spider-Man, ready to eliminate anything that moves in the most spectacular fashions.  Grab your enemies and smash them with your iron boots!  Fling your dead enemies at your enemies!  Throw cars at your enemies!  The way this game mixes classic shooting elements and a new, bionic arm is absolutely amazing.  The way you must master your swinging through the apocalyptic ruins of the city is breathtaking, and the way you can mix traditional elements with the versatility of the bionic arm is some of the most refreshing gameplay i've seen in a while.  Bionic commando is a game that is clearly designed with the gameplay at heart, and that simply touches my heart.  The game does give you a variety of paths to follow, although the game is for all intents and purposes linear.  It's a game that requires progression in story and location, much like Halo(but no one complained about Halo being linear, did they?).  Waypoints are a way of life.  love them.  In fact, the linear gameplay may be something to be desired of Bionic Commando, as too many times i have found games leaving me wondering where i'm supposed to go, or what to do.  Bionic commando is an action game, and it makes certain to keep you in the action, as well as making certain you are the absolute center of action.  The next great thing for this game is the controls.  This typically isn't mentioned in a review as far as i've seen, but i believe it deserves note.  The controls for this game are some of the simplest i've seen in a while, yet still some of the most versatile.  The controls for Bionic commando, from the tips of your fingers to the moving image on the screen, are fluid and intuitive.  The game lets you grapple on to almost any surface, which was a shock to me, as I was expecting the bionic arm to be a gimmick to use in only certain locations.  The bionic arm changes everything, though.  You can literally make your own path, and when you get good enough, you'll be one crazy flying death monkey.  it's simply amazing.  You can do about five or six different moves along with swinging and shooting like a crazed ape, and that perfect mixture of bionic awesomeness with shooting like a normal person makes the game feel so versatile.  Also of note, the jump button works finally.  ALso of special note, this game apparently features keyboard and mouse support, but i couldn't be bothered to figure it out.  The game DOES, however, work 100% fine with wired 360 controllers, and the simple way the controls are laid out is absolutely beautiful, as well.  Second clear winner on this game experience is the sound.  The soundtrack is well balanced and masterfully crafted.  The music can be serene at times, when you're exploring the ruins of the city, but is intense and fast as you progress into more enemies and bosses.  The sound effects are amazing, and if you play the game enough, your characters WILL break the 4th wall and/or go off script.  For the sake of it's short-lived life-span, i will also mention the story here, as it basically reduces to sound.  The story isn't a bad story, but with the way it's delivered(both in simple dialogue and in the voice acting), it is a bit lacking.  The best bits of your story actually come from within the actual gameplay, and for whoever voices the mad german scientist guy, well done.  You nailed the classic video game villain with your shrill voice, and the angry german accent gave the words such strength that it filled my heart with glee every time you spoke.  It was your voice alone that made the citadel level with all of your minions at once bearable, as i had to repeat that level about a million times.  I wish, however, that i could say the same for the rest of the voice cast.  While the lines do feel very silly at times, however, the easter eggs you can come across simply make this game evenmore endearing.Of final note is the visuals for this game, which are simply astounding.  I was actually pretty surprised to find such low system requirements for this game, and had a few concerns, but thankfully i was not disappointed.  Character animations are very fluid, and feel good to watch and make.  Moving around the game feels natural, the swaying of the trees in the breeze is very pleasing, and lighting is actually very well done(even in the underground caverns).  Water for this game looks AMAZING, debris flying around the city looks fantastic, ragdoll corpses always feel nice, and nothing is left to be desired, i must say.  Close-ups on characters do look a bit odd sometimes, mostly when speaking, but luckily the game doesn't take you in that close most of the time.  Overall, Bionic Commando is clearly a game made by people who love Bionic commando, for people who also love Bionic Commando.  It's a refreshing piece of gameplay with some very unique pieces, and it serves a heck of a lot of fan-service.  The game even ups in replay value, as there are certain unlockables you can only access by playing(and progressing) in the classic remake, Bionic Commando Re-armed.  this may actually tend to annoy others, believing it a scheme to grind more hours into the game, but it really isn't.  for those that love the game, this isn't even an issue, and for those who are just getting into it just have more incentive to play.  I didn't enter this game with high hopes, but it proved itself to be a game that remembers what it's like to be a video game, and that itself is something very special.  Would i recommend this game?  every day of the week.  My co-workers already think i'm crazy because i just can't shut up about this game.  whatever you might play, there's something in this game for everyone.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd be lying if I said I don't enjoy this game, but I'd also be lying if I said I love this game. Bionic Commando is a sequel to the original NES game (or Rearmed which was made to bring the younger generation up to speed and you totally play that one) that starts Nathan Spencer being called to do a mission after being imprison for years and Bionics are shunned. The story is pretty samey to a lot of other story: There's a macguffin you need to get, your characters a bitter hardass while mission control snarks at you and you need to complete your mission against an army of Not-Nazis and save the world. Of course that's not EXACTLY the story but that's what I felt as a good summary. Spencer comes off as an♥♥♥♥♥compared to his radical self in the original and Rearmed (with good reason but still) and Super Joe shows up but he's an♥♥♥♥♥as well. The entire universe of Bionic Commando got a lot grittier in this one, and while it's not a huge deal for me, when I keep hearing swearing during gameplay I get the feeling it's trying too hard to be mature rather than just letting it come out on its own.The gameplay it rather abstract but nice. Swinging around feels pretty good (though it says ♥♥♥♥ you physics) and you can grab onto almost anything you can think of on the environment and using your arm to pull off throws and impressive feats makes you feel like a badass while Spencer hoops and hollers like a madman. Gunplay is pretty meh, you have your pistol which you will be using most of the time, it's somewhat reliable but it god it eats through ammo, you also get a special weapon that can be swapped out and grenades, but good luck keeping a special weapon you like, because special weapon pick-ups are rare as hell. Also using the throwing technique is a bit add because after kiting, throwing leads to items being flung in a very odd and nonsensical angle before being throw which leads to odd situations (like a mook flying off to the right before stopping for a split second and zipping the other way to hit the thing you wanted to hit). Combat in general is kinda nice but I've come to realize 3 things about it1.Your Bionic arm is your best friend. Seriously by late game I only used my weapons to take care of Biomechs quickly or when I had to shoot someone on the double. Throwing OP2. Spencer cannot take a hit worth a damn in this game, but nothing's stopping from swinging to safety and healing up like a ♥♥♥♥♥, which kind of takes away from the momentum of gameplay if you ask me.3. Biomechs can go to hell, because they're annoying as hell and they WILL swarm you by lategame. Also aiming at their weakspot can easily lead to Spencer shooting his arm at a barrel right beside them as much as their back which leads to much frustrationAlso another major issue I have with the game is that it railroads you hard. What I mean by that is that you'd expect to be able to swing around and enjoy yourself and your mobility taking out bad guys however you see fit. However, you can't as radiation has covered the city and the very second you hit an area with radioactivity, you only have a few seconds before you're dead. This gets ridiculous as you're swinging around avoiding gunfire or looking for collectibles (which do very little from what I've seen) and then all of a sudden you hear a blaring warning signal before Spencer flops over dead taking you back to a checkpoint. Speaking of which when you die, you go back and all your progress (objectives, ammo, and collectibles) are gone and you have to get them all bad. The ending is screwy and while I won't spoil it, I feel like it was just a waste of potential of what could have been an amazing final boss.Overall, give it a shot if you find this on sale, but it is a hit and miss game. It's not horrid but you can easily hate it as much as you like it. Just be warned that this PC port is lackluster compared to other ports and is rather lazy, it's crashed twice over the course of the game for me, has no windowed options or even any graphics settings so if you have a low-end computer you probably won't be able to play this.

												I bought and played this game the day it was released for Xbox 360, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Recently bought it on sale, and decided I would try it again, years later, to see if my opinion still holds. It does. (In depth below, skip to the end for final opinion).At its core, the game is an excellent 3D translation of the classic Bionic Commando and remake Rearmed gameplay.  The swing mechanics, while it can take some getting used to, feel precise, even when you screw up using them (getting wrapped around a light pole you have attached the arm trying to swing at an odd angle).  The arm mechanics are adapted well to combat, giving the player many options beyond a gun to kill enemies. Many of these arm combat mechanics were adapted to Rearmed 2, released a year or 2 later. Throwing things with the arm, for me on the PC, did leave something to desire, as it seemed perfectly open throws would fly backwards instead of forward. The weapons part of the combat is pretty typical for a third-person shooter, with the addition of being able to shoot while swinging.Beyond that, however, is where the game becomes a matter of taste.The level design is similar to previous installments; mostly-linear levels confining the player to the beaten path (not unlike other modern 3D shooters).  Unlike many 3D linear games, the area boundaries aren't solid.  They consist of radiation which the player only has a few seconds to leave before it kills them, or water in which the player has a few seconds to use the bionic arm to escape before drowning (lenient considering most games, and previous installments, killed the player instantly for entering water).  I thought the level design is fine, conveying the developers' intent to have the player roam through the city completing missions for the government.Game progression is slow relative to the length of the game itself, and the pacing of the game is terrible.  By the time the player unlocks all arm abilities earned through game progression, the game is over halfway finished.  And the game itself is too short, probably a good 2-4 hour experience from start to finish depending.  The game needed at least another major section.The story, while quirky and excessively profane, left a lot of things to be desired. And the soundtrack, while I quite enjoy it, doesn't have much variety.  I would say about half of the soundtrack is either a loose remix, or uses several parts, of the first level theme from the original Bionic Commando/Rearmed.In the end though, the game is worth the current price ($10), and definitely any sale price.  Ignoring the story, the slow start to the gameplay picks up greatly about a third of the way through the game and you'll be flying around full speed about halfway through.  Combat is simple, and the arm and swinging opens up a variety of ways to destroy the enemy, which doesn't get old.Pick it up, don't take it too seriously, and it should be a good time.

												Massively underrated game, but a lazy PC port (game telling you to push 360 buttons and etc while playing with M+KB). The story is 80's cheese style but is fitting for a sequel to a classic 80's NES game, considering the bad guys were reviving Hitler so they can conquer the world in the original game.

												I purchased this game the day it was released on PS3, and completed the game, so don't mind the low play time on the steam version.The gameplay itself can actually be an enjoyable experience. The combat is quick just like the game itself, and the graphics themselves are pretty good. Unfortunately, that's all the game really has going for it. It used a couple of big names to try to draw in appeal (Mike Patton as Spencer and Steve Blum as Super Joe) and garner favor among buyers, but those few things are really the only good points about it. The story in the game is simply atrocious, and will leave you feeling cheated if you actually make it all the way through. The game itself is designed swinging around, and the first level you are permitted to, you are given a vast view that you jump in to, only to find out it's just a big linear corridor with very VERY little room for exploration. Whether you are moving through a building, a ""city"" or a minefield, you just keep moving along the same path occasionaly looking for, what brings me to the next couple of issues: the collectibles and checkpoints. Collectibles are an addition to any game, and while I'm not complaining about them being in the game, in and of themselves, the checkpoints are spread VERY far apart, and dying in this game can become a common occurence, especially in certain parts. ANY and ALL progress you made is erased when you die, back to the previous check point which can be rather far back in the game, as they are so spread out. Another incredibly annoying factor for the game which ties into the checkpoint and collectible point is, there is NO replaying of levels for progress. Certain weapon or game ""Challenges"" can only be completed at certain points of the game, and collectibles MUST be collected in full. Why? Replaying a level is permissible, however, doing so is merely so you can ""locate"" everything. It does not save when you use the ""Level jump"" feature. The fact is, if you missed something, your only option to get it again is to RESTART the entire game.All in all, if it's a game you can get on sale like I did for $2.00, you really can't go wrong, but if you are a completionist for a game like myself, this game is your worst enemy. For anything more than what I paid for it, I can't reccomend it.			",158,27,0,18,6,3,15

SummaryBionic Commando is a 3rd person action/platformer and a sequel to an NES classic with the same name; A game that was famous for being a ""platformer where you can't jump"". Unfortunately this falls short on almost all aspects.In detailThe story kicks off with an attack to a major city that causes a lot of casualties and also places convenient instant death radiation zones to limit the movement of any swinging bionic commandos who might be heading that way. The main character, Spencer, was sentenced to prison in the past for being a bionic and is now forced on a mission to investigate the city after the attack. He is also promised information about his missing wife/girlfriend in exchange.The story is a mess. The main character who you're supposed to relate to comes across as a tool with almost zero personality or charm. It is implied that he's an unsung hero but apart from one conversation it is not fleshed out what exactly happened. He is mostly just mad at every character we come across and not asking questions that might lead to exposition. At the end to wrap it all up, the only thing Spencer is somewhat supposed to care about is given a stupid twist that would make M. Night Shyamalan jealous.As a pure arcade experience it is slightly better. The core mechanic of using the bionic arm for swinging around and as a combat utility is fun and and works fluently. The problem is that the environments are mostly just small, generic pathways where you go from checkpoint to the next collecting pointless collectibles.Ultimately, the ""bionic armed soldier"" is a bit silly premise and, unless you fully commit to a world with these augmented super soldiers and what moral issues that brings etc., it should be treated as such. The game reminded me a bit of the Just Cause -series where you have a similar movement mechanic with the grappling hook. This really should've borrowed the open world theme from those and focused on being just a power fantasy with a tongue-in-cheek story.On a final, positive mention: The soundtrack with the orchestral renditions of familiar Bionic Commando tunes was great the whole way through.RecommendationThe studio Grin didn't deserve to go down with this game, but having now played through the story I can understand why it happened. It is not the worst game ever made, but I can't really recommend it either.			",203,59,7,12,14,2,29

												For the price I paid the game is overall recommended.Control 6/10 - The arm mechantic works...MOST of the time.Sound 8/10 - Voice overs area  bit cheesyStory 5/10 - Somewhat vague storyline, especailly the ending.Gameplay - 6/10  The biggest frustration is that this game at times have LONG waypoints for saving and overly frustrating to replay a hard part and hearing the same cutscene or voice over again several times.Overall not a bad game, I paid about 3-5 $ for it so I can't complain too much anything more than 10$ might be pushing it.  It's a good 8-12 hour game depending on your skill.  I really did enjoy flicking enemies at other enemies as said before the control ovearll isn't bad...for the MOST part.			",154,28,1,39,3,1,4

Bionic CommandoBionic Commando is a FPS made by and puplished by Capcom.But what exactly is it?Let's find out!GameplayFor a console port,the controlls are smooth and you NEED to master them to get anywhere in the game,but for that later in the review.At first it takes some time to get used to them,but when you get over it  it feels easy(or resort to using a controller if you are a badass with one,i couldn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥with one so i used the keyboard instead.)Swinging around in midair using the arm is alot of fun but gets boring fast.The Game itselfTHIS IS THE SECOND INSTALLMENT.i didn't knew that until it was too late,so i hopped in without knowing anything what they were talking about in the game.This is very difficult veeeeeery difficult.you might die(alot) and find the cruel safepoints evil placed.it took me 13 hours to beat the game,from beginning to end,which isn't to bad.The Enemythe enemies are really stupid,they are trying to rush you i give it that,but they tend to forget your position within seconds when you hide behind something,the ""special units"" do it too,and they are rather stupid(the special units) and sometimes kill their friends by running them over or even shooting them with a explosive weapon.Since you die fast through there aren't many places where they rush you with enemies,so you always have a chance to beat them.Beating those special units takes time and forces you to find a strategy to beat effective.(my strategy for the standard ones is keep them on the distance and throw objects at them)death wallsThey didn't even try to hide it from you,infact,they even said it in the story that radioactive♥♥♥♥♥♥kills you because of your arm.oh and don't jump in water.Do i recommend it?Difficult question.really difficult.i recommend you first look at some gameplay footage,to prevent too much spoilers,the beginning of it maybe,to see if its worth 10€.for me,it was,since i bought it when it was insale(around 1€ was the price for me) and when i bought it i wasn't thinking that such a cool game lies ahead of me,besides the death walls and the rather stupid enemies.

												I have never actually just uninstalled a game, to never play it again, even if I haven't finished it...but I am seriously considering it with this one. I paid $5 for this and still have trouble finding any redeeming value in it. It's hard to even figure out where to start when it comes to the issues, but I think my first one would have to be the sheer difficulty of the game. Anything and *everything* can kill you...and exceedingly quickly. Walk to close to fire(not even touching it), and you're dead in less than a second. Enemy hits you with some sort of electrified stick, you're dead. Flying mech-thing shoots a missle that just kind of grazes you, you're dead. Add to it that you have only have a *pistol* 99.9% of the time with unbelievably limited ammo and you're left trying to punch these enemies to death. No joke, you're sitting there *punching* mechs. The swing mechanic, as you'll read in a lot of other reviews, is also hard to get used to. Why they couldn't just simply make it as easy as it was in the original NES(or remake) game, I have no idea. They took the single most important thing about Bionic Commando and turned it in to a frustrating guessing game of ""when do I release?""...and, of course, when you miss it, you're dead most of the time. Add to it these weird ""Radiation Zone"" areas(basically invisible walls that cut you off from going too far off the pre-determined path) that sap your life away if you happen to go swinging in to one(most times dying before you can get back out) and you've got a game that basically punishes you in every conceivable gameplay area. I'll give it another hour or so...maybe something will change, but I doubt it...			",173,16,8,14,5,0,4

												I really want to like this game, but it's very difficult too. I would recommend it on an extreme sale, but overall (even for $10), I cannot. A slow start to a game, and certainly a slow start to a story. They did a decent job trying to keep the old Commando perks in the game (from sounds, clothes, and music), but for what they have, they could have upped the intensity of the situation. The story doesn't feel like it impacts the game what so ever.The game overall is decent. The premise of it feels somewhat correct, and the bionic arm isn't as limiting as some reviewers say. Although be it so, the arm's momentum feels very stiff (maybe that's the way a machine arm is supposed to be) and the swing mechanic feels limiting. One would imagine themselves swinging all over the level, but in reality one can only go in the direction that is blatantly laid out in front of them. The distance the arm can be used is also a factor, as it is not very far. There is the capability of using melee, in which the coolest part is knocking an enemy near a ledge and watching their animation struggle not to fall. Problem is, it's quite bland and doesn't give the player any impression of an impact. The shooting is bland and literally feels like it was put together in seconds. You can zoom in for a better view, and yes there are different weapons (not really to choose from, rather wait for the proper drops throughout the levels), but shooting and fighting enemies feels like a grind. Enemies aim is quite well, and snipers will take you out if you stay motionless for at tops, three seconds. Spencer can use his bionic arm against enemies, but only to jump in the air once (press A), then zip towards the enemy (pressing A again). They could have done so much more with the arm but it seems they chose not to. They could have given it abilities, or a capability to throw an opponent. Nope, none of that is present here.A game that could have been that much more, just simply lacks. The multiplayer is alright at best, and probably won't keep you busy for too too long. The choppy-ness of the jumps and the difficulty of grabbing opponents with the arm just all feel flawed. It is nice however, that they did decide to include multiplayer. If you are going to make a game with guns and a bionic arm, maybe try to incorporate the two a little better, or at least try to combine the two. The graphics are alright, and the sounds are basic. Due to the reasons stated above, I simply cannot recommend it. Unless you are a complete die hard fan of Bionic Commando, is the only way I can say buy it... and even then on sale. It hurts me to rate this game instead of calling it acclaimed. RATING : 6.0/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C Overall  C+ScreenShots :What the zip-line system looks likeI wish they paid as much attention to game play detail as they did for this animation (mentioned in review when melee-ing)Send your opponents flying with this new and improved bumping system!One of the swinging mechanics. The blue lines in the center of the screen indicate the best time to get the most momentum ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Surprisingly unique 3rd Person Action AdventureBC is kinda interesting to rate, because for a AAA title, the contrast between the bright spots and the shoddy stuff is pretty pronounced.Let's look at the major copouts first- because they stand out like buckteeth on a souped up Miss World:This game yearns for exploration- but you're not allowed! There's semi invisible ""radiation"" everywhere that will cokkblokk your curiousity, sometimes in a very surprising and unfair way. Alternative routes - nopenope. That's insane given how predestined the core mechanics would be for exploring different aerial paths .Further more, the game will dangle it's secret collectibles right on the edge of these hard to gauge radiant deathtraps, so you'll probably die a few times before you'll find out how to snatch them.Additionally, cheap easy-to-spot critique include the game's inability to clearly teach and differentiate the hero'ss different abilities.And finally, BC loses a bit of steam at the end. They can't come up with fresh challenges or ideas. (And -nagnagnag- some core combat stuff could be better polished but which ambitious game started out perfect?) That's rather regrettable, since the game's main feature is kickazz:If you stuck with me till this line, you might just be the hardcore gamer who would enjoy that unique thing which is sooo great about Bionic Commando:It is...the frikkin Bionic arm! Climb, attack or simply frolic like a tripped-out berserker gibbon!No game offers the joy of cybernetic brachiation, the moments where a deft but well-timed tarzanic swing lets you pounce between foes, grab one of them and hurl him into another group of baddies. Superb!The rest is at least solidly done:Artistic designs and animations are tight. Most of the action, weaponry and enemy encounters are nicely done.Music and sounds are great. All in all, it's a shame that sales tanked and we probably won't see a BC 2.  Verdict:3 out of 5 ludonetic implements create a moderately strong gameborg. Platform Action-Adventure Connaisseurs, check it out! Play-Simpletons, don't bother!An interesting concept, done well enough but not quite nailed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dis game literally burned its mark in my memories.Lets start with negative things. because usually last things in day are one what matters most.Negatives:-Radiation is lethal, maybe too lethal, if u whip urself in up air where is radiation cloud, it kills u faster than u can drop down.-sometimes whip movements can be little unrealistic. like shooting whip to underside layer, and press jump. it makes it top site of layer defining laws of physics.-adrenaline finishing moves not listed in game, so u have to look them up from internet.-Multiplayer doesnt work from online, u have to have hamachi or lan to play this game with friends.-Game is based on xbox so xbox button icons can confuse you. anyway, if u want go ""back"" button press TAB and go optimize your key bindings for ur gameplay.Neutral: -There are challenges like ""Kill 50 grunts with melee"" and you get Extra armor for ur charachter to ""level up"" i didint quite like it becuase it defines my playstyles some points if i have to constantly level my charachter up with challenges that aint in my style.Positive:GAME IS JUST AMAZINGASDUOH-Great music.-Great atomsphere what ofcourse includes many things. the blur u see when some things are far away in radiation is best ive seen.-Good graphics (notice game date)-Pretty good physics otherwise but some animations that happen middle combat can be little clunky-All weapons are different and feels different, all enemy classes are also all very different. + u have billion of ways to kill enemies. smash shoot punch throw blow up enemies in midair while you collect ammo from ground and evade enemy rockets.-few but amazing bosses. the worm one, is where u ♥♥♥♥ in ur pants from extacy.-Storyline is great, there may be things or plotwist that u can know before they even happen but the last plotwist is the best.Last thing: this game can feel clunky if u dont have skill with whip yet, but when u learn use whip and avoid collisions it feels very flow and nice like youre flying urself across nuked city of ruins.

												its a good,fun game but i recommend getting it on a sale for cheap i write this review to warn you of a simple problem and help u solve it.the problem is that you ""may"" not be able to start it or play it.solution is Right-click on game in your steam library -> Properties -> Local files -> Browse local files ->  support-> OpenAL -> oalinst.exe.install it. and you are good to goi give it a 7/10  it has the best grapple/hook, its so fun that you will spend a lot of time just grappling around the city and flying like spider man! its fun!

												It's ok. Was really hard, and replaying some sections over and over and over got boring. Controls were surprisingly good, most of the time. Some interesting abilities and mechanics were introduced, but then there weren't many chances to actually use them after that. Like the ground stomp ability, the only times when you could actually use it on a group of enemies is when you were supposed to. Very linear.As a Bionic Commando fan I got some enjoyment out of it, as the swinging itself was fun. I wouldn't recommend it to a non-fan.			",1072,396,32,117,102,12,137

												Surprisingly unique 3rd Person Action AdventureBC is kinda interesting to rate, because for a AAA title, the contrast between the bright spots and the shoddy stuff is pretty pronounced.Let's look at the major copouts first- because they stand out like buckteeth on a souped up Miss World:This game yearns for exploration- but you're not allowed! There's semi invisible ""radiation"" everywhere that will cokkblokk your curiousity, sometimes in a very surprising and unfair way. Alternative routes - nopenope. That's insane given how predestined the core mechanics would be for exploring different aerial paths .Further more, the game will dangle it's secret collectibles right on the edge of these hard to gauge radiant deathtraps, so you'll probably die a few times before you'll find out how to snatch them.Additionally, cheap easy-to-spot critique include the game's inability to clearly teach and differentiate the hero'ss different abilities.And finally, BC loses a bit of steam at the end. They can't come up with fresh challenges or ideas. (And -nagnagnag- some core combat stuff could be better polished but which ambitious game started out perfect?) That's rather regrettable, since the game's main feature is kickazz:If you stuck with me till this line, you might just be the hardcore gamer who would enjoy that unique thing which is sooo great about Bionic Commando:It is...the frikkin Bionic arm! Climb, attack or simply frolic like a tripped-out berserker gibbon!No game offers the joy of cybernetic brachiation, the moments where a deft but well-timed tarzanic swing lets you pounce between foes, grab one of them and hurl him into another group of baddies. Superb!The rest is at least solidly done:Artistic designs and animations are tight. Most of the action, weaponry and enemy encounters are nicely done.Music and sounds are great. All in all, it's a shame that sales tanked and we probably won't see a BC 2.  Verdict:3 out of 5 ludonetic implements create a moderately strong gameborg. Platform Action-Adventure Connaisseurs, check it out! Play-Simpletons, don't bother!An interesting concept, done well enough but not quite nailed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't enjoy this game because of the terrible unresponsive joystick controls. you press the joystick in any direction and it takes almost a second for the game to respond. I thought this might be an issue with my controller but this is the only game that has a problem so I'm chalking it up to the game itself. I suppose you get used to such garbage controls if you play it long enought but this game honestly does not seem worth that effort.			",22,2,0,4,7,0,3

												A pretty fun decent game. Has pleasant graphics and solid smooth gameplay. The sound is good and the music is not bad. I wish I would have payed more attention to this when it came out in 2009 because I am having a good time playing it. Well mostly. The grappling swinging controls are not as awesome as a lot of user reviews would lead you to believe, but they are competent. The problem being that swing points are usually too close together making consistent swinging very awkward to do. It is also very hard to gauge when to release to swing outward correctly even though it shows you a blue icon letting you know when. You still have to pinpoint release to swing even remotely how you want to, which leads to a lot of swinging straight up or at a upward angle, or too low, as opposed to straight forward or at a much desired but very hard to do forward upward angle to propel you forward correctly. The third person shooting aspect is forgettable especially since the only weapon you have in the game is a pistol, although you can find secondary weapons sometimes like a minigun which blows, or a grenade launcher which rocks. You can also punch objects into the air then jump up and punch them at your enemy, or you can latch your grapple onto an object and whip it into them, or you can grapple onto an enemy and jump kick them twice to kill them. You can use the jump kick move for a lot of your kills.Some parts are not very fun. Mainly the part I just got passed. It didn't make any sense but up until this point, about 4-5 hours into the game, everything was very easy, then all of a sudden I had to fight two robots and the difficulty spiked massively from a 2 to a 9 and they are not even bosses, just regular enemies. They are not exactly fun to fight until I just swung objects into them with swing grapple and on like my 5+ try I killed them.Overall it was a solid purchase. I think I payed $2.50 for it and at that price it was a very good deal. Do not pay more than $5 though because it is a pretty short game. 7/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												To be honest, the first level or so of this game is pretty cool. The swinging mechanic is arguably one of the most fun to play with. Unfortunately, the oodles of stale combat shoehorned into the mix become increasingly tiresome, along with the hodge-podge placement of somewhat invisible death barriers along the intended, linear pathway. While I can say that the PC version is probably the best version of this game having played the PS3 version, it's still pretty awful. I had to quit shortly after the second boss (and even passing that was an achievement) because the game design choices moving forward just became increasingly tedious and instead of allowing the player to enjoy the experience, rather chose to punish them with clunky controls and underpowered weaponry. Overall, I'd say avoid it unless it's on sale for like $2.50 and you REALLY have a hankering for a bad time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I reall want to like Bionic Commando.I lovedthe original NES version and the HD remake is fabulous, but in the era of GTA clones why on earth does this game fee like its on a rail? The boundriesare always visible, the grappling hook takes forever to master, and the plot.... wait, I dont recall one, it must be that boring. For some reasonthe bionic arm has always seemed aesome to me and I planon finishing thisgame, but if you join me, realize youll be screaming at the game every 5 minutes because it swang you into radiation instead of that overpass.Get Rearmed, pass this one.

												Why does Spencer have dread locks?This is one of those games where you have to wonder all that could have been. It's not a bad game, but it's not a good game either. It's absurdly short. Frustration is mistaken for ""challenge."" Aesthetically, it's not very interesting. At no point do you ever get to swing and be merry. It's a poor successor to the original, and defiles a lot of what that game was about. If you own Rearmed, you can make Spencer look like he knows what shampoo is.Good idea, poorly executed, needlessly restyled.Based on downvotes, people really like dreads. Doesn't change the suck.

												This is one of the worst games I've ever played. It may have even soured my love for the original. I thought it might be fun to swing around town with my big robot arm, a tiny pistol, and a cheesy storyline... I was wrong. Everything is clunky, from the AI's incredibly simplistic and overpowered awareness of your presence to the fact that your best weapon by the time you give up on the game is still a crappy little peashooter. It seems like they wanted to ride Metal Gear's balls, even using the same voice actor with less enthusiasm and less humor.Bottom line, don't waste your money. If I could get a refund for this, I would.			",105,61,0,21,3,0,23

												I got this game for under 2€ on steam and consider it a waste of money.This is the most messed up console port i ever seen. But it's not only the port, the game itself seems to have major issues.The only fun i had in game where the first two minutes before i even got my bionic arm (main feature of the game).Then the nightmare begins with the tutorial, perfect example of how NOT to do it. I'm playing it with mouse and keyboard in standard settings, while the (forced) tutorial prompts you to press your controller buttons(like press L1 then X to do stuff)...so going to options for every tutorial to find out what buttons to press. Wait it get's worse. You then loose all of you abilitys, you can't even aim any more (you could do that befor you got your arm). Why do i have to do a forced tutorial when i can't use any of that stuff?You get then thrown into a ok looking game world, which looks fine untill you move one step. You notice that decoration object appear 1-2 meters before your feet like debris (not joking they appear one step ahead of you out of nowhere) and massive screen tearing, there are no graphic options like vsync (if i recall right resollution was the only one to change).Then the hook, it feels unrealistic if you ever had a swing on a rope you know this feels false, thats probably why they implemented a indicator when to release. Also the hook can attach to everything but not allways. I tried that at a skyscraper, at lower levels it will attach, at medium level it will mostly attach and at higher levels it won't while the surface looks everywhere the same. No explaination for that.Then unskippable boring sequences like when you enter a district, gave me the rest.At that point i gave up and consider it a fun killer. This game deserves it's bad rating.I might try it out with a controller but i don't think that will change anything, since the mouse+keyboard controlls where ok and are not the reason why this is a bad game.

												This is hands down one of the worst games I have ever played. The graphics are the best part of the game, which isnt saying allot, but the animation, controls and physics are ridiculously bad. Under no circumstances should anyone ever buy this game. Remember how frustrating the NES game could become, this is that times 1000. They could have made a great game but instead they decided to make the controls so bad and laggy that just trying to swing from one beam to another is a test of your patience. Once you're locked on to a beam, rather than having to swing back and forth building momentum the guy goes from 0 to 100 instantly. That isnt so bad except if you want to have forward moentum after you release you must do it a good 2 seconds earlier than it appears you should because the character wont release when you release the button. The combination of these two things makes knowing when to let go and how far your character will go once you release impossible to know for sure. I eventually grew to like the NES game because of it's dificulty, but this game is just maddening because of how they created that dificulty. If the dificulty was a result of the environments and enemies that would be fine, but the difficulty comes from the horrible controls, impossible physics and crappy character animation. The enemy AI is awful as well, they just huddle into groups so you can just mow them down in a line. The story is preposterously awful and the voice acting is so bad it makes the cut scenes unwatchable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games ever. The gameplay allows a sense of freedom and skill that is truly unique. I've finished it four times and it's probably the only game I ever beat at the hardest difficulty.+ Swinging never gets old.+ Cool skills for added variety+ Challenging but fair+ Some nice bosses+ Nice visuals/design+ Very fun online multiplayer (I generally dislike online multiplayer modes, but loved this)- The story sucks.- Not enough ammo for secondary weapons (and the weapons are very standard)- The levels feel a bit restrictive due to the deadly fog and water.- Too many loading sections. It was fine when it released, but it feels dated now (loading only takes one second or less on modern machines).- No proper graphics options on PCI get the feeling that the developer had limited resources and still managed to make something very special. They deserved to make a sequal to expand upon this brilliant title, but instead they were dismantled.I haven't actually played the PC version (just checked out the options and if it ran well), only the 360 one. I just bought it on here to support the title.			",126,25,2,4,3,0,5

												It's hard to find anything good in this game unless you liked NES original and 80s action movies. Cheesy dialogues, primitive story, repetetive level design, dumb AI (and thus boring fights). Basically, this is an 80s game remade in 3D. And that's not enough for a solid gaming experience these days.Another bad thing is that the game punishes you for exploration. This alone is ridiculous and enough to not buy it! Instead of invisible walls there are radiation zones here, and the main hero gets killed almost immediately when gettin into one of those. So go from one waypoint to another and don't think about exploring or the fact the games evolved for the past 30 years. Would you kindly?			",290,110,2,36,13,2,29

Product received for free
												---Poor art direction---Paper-thin and clichéd story---Laborious, repetitive gameplay---Unrelatable characters---Uninspired level designNothing can save what amounts to be a money trap for nostalgic and desperate gamers.  It's difficult to feel an ounce of sympathy for anyone involved in the game's formulaic, darker-and-edgier revenge plot - and so the whole experience quickly turns into what feels like a job, a walking simulator that leads the player from one arena to another.  Items, challenges, and collectibles were scattered around without much thought to them.  Levels seem to have been made with a Playstation 1 era design philosophy: it's not difficult to bump against a wall that's been painted with a flat background scenery.Much like a robot would attempt to mimic a human, this rendition of Bionic Commando seeks to mindlessly check all the boxes on a list in an attempt to mimic a video game.  The result is artificial, and at times insulting.  One's money is much better spent elsewhere.			",230,58,7,31,10,1,22

												The game has decent graphics, but there are a number of problems.  First, there are not that many different types of enemies.  There are about three or four varieties of humans and about the same number for mechanical baddies.  Second, there is a bit of a learning curve for grappling, one of the main components to the game.  Be prepared to fall to your death a lot.  Third, while I appreciated the challenge system in the game, there's really no point that I found to collectibles.  Many of the collectibles are very hard to reach and if you die before getting to a checkpoint, you have to go back to get the darned things again.  I made it a ways through the game before the issue of repetition was finally enough for me to uninstall.			",283,69,3,22,10,2,14

I am wondering how it needs 8 GB disk space...  	-I think to there are not enough fights and actions. 	-Spoiler Alert!!!

												you know, i was hoping that this game would be good. I mean it is ♥♥♥♥ing bionic commando, he was so badass and cool. but then this game was a ♥♥♥♥ up. the tutorial makes zero sence to the player because you are expected to play with a ♥♥♥♥ing xbox controller. so it took me an hour to do the tutorial but how was the actual gameplay. well i thought that the wire swinging would be so much fun, but the timing for the wire was so weird that the game knew it and did not even bother to change it. the main game mechanic of wire swinging was ♥♥♥♥ed up beyond beleif they they put a signal when to let go of the wire button. The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and all they do is aimbot you and gang up on you. the main reason you die in this game is the ""radiation"". the radiation ♥♥♥♥s with your mechanical arm and kill you within 3 seconds of standing in it. the only reason radiation is in this game is to prevent the player from going to explore and look around. they used the radiation to kill the player for going out of bounds. The radiation works sometimes and sometimes it does not. i found areas were i could walk on radiation and out of bounds. they were lazy with this game , honestly. they should have made this game open world if the wire swinging mechanic is such a big part of the game. this would have been a more badass spiderman game. but this game has issues, yes u cannot say that it does not. But even though this game is flawed, the ideas were amazing. one hand shoots, the bionic arm can grapple, throw and light and heavy punch. over all i give this game a 6/10 because of it's  lazy game design and radiation boundries.Edit:I actually sold this game because it was so bad, like i couldent even have fun with this piece of sh!t			",114,2,0,4,4,3,2

												The game uses artificial ammo scarcity to force you into using the grappling gimmick, which is partially-implemented, at best. It's difficult to figure out what you're grappling to and how, making predicting a series of swinging actions a haphazard string of guesswork. In the end, the combat is muddled and frustrating to play because you're being forced to use a gimmick - around which, admittedly, the game centralizes - that isn't written as well as it should be for being such a foundational core mechanic of the game.

												A horrible, unfinished disaster of a game. Content was obviously cut all over the place. It's graphically and artistically hideous. The combat is weightless and shallow, and your hitbox seems to take up the entire screen. The story is complete nonsense. The whole swinging mechanic is ridiculously awkward and unnatural feeling. And the final boss is a 10 second long cutscene preceded by a few QTE's.Pretty much everything that could've gone wrong, did go wrong.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bionic Commando- The Game That's Such A Bad Remake Its Good!I have not played much of this extremely odd title, mainly due to its lack of real keyboard support (all the button prompts are for Xbox remotes!), the wide variety of glitches, the awful combat and platforming, the fact it neglects the previous games and tries to make a dark, gritty game, and it's general consolization of a once beloved franchise.If you stumble upon this game and do choose to purchase it (although I wouldn't if I were you) you will find a short lame story, that doesn't justify itself and mediocre controls at best, alongside some seriously bad voice acting. Although underneath all that consolization and the ruining of a classic franchise is a half decent sci-fi military shooter (on console at least) that suffers from its own intuitive and feels like it was never planned to be made.This review was made in 2016 Would You Like Some Tea's Score: 5/10-Mediocre			",130,11,0,9,4,1,7

Before I talk about the game, let me rant about something relevant that pisses me off...this game is a perfect example of why I hate consoles with my life.Games are DEVELOPED ON PC, games are TESTED ON PC, games are PUBLISHED THROUGH PC and downgraded for wimpy consoles. Yet developers are too stupid to release games on PC first before dumbing down the quality so consoles can play it. Instead they have to port the console quality games BACK ONTO PC with even worse quality...like what are you idiots thinking!?Is it really because of piracy? I'm sorry but any game, even on consoles can be hacked/pirated it's not only PC so go f*** yourself.Anyways, because of these beautiful console ports, we get a game like this (others including Bioshock Infinite, ALL the Grand Theft Auto's, Castle Crashers, Poorly Made Games etc.) where even though it's on PC they tell you the how to play using the f****** buttons on the CONTROLLER! No I'm using a god damned keyboard, these developers are too damn lazy to cut out the use of informing me that X,Y,A,B,LT,RT are to be used when I enabled A KEYBOARD!Now I'm not dissing the game, I think it's a decent game. Just the fact the information I receive is for console/controller players only frustrates me.The game itself reminds me of Bioshock Infinite and Rachet & Clank with the use of a grappling hook, as well as Max Payne and Just Cause 2 with the third person open shooter game.I like the story, and the characters, it's definately better than the Bionic Command Rearmed crap they made before, but it's still an uninteresting game, it's challenging yes but there's nothing in the game that interests me to make me play it continously so I gave up.4/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												A highly underrated game that combines third person shooting with 3d platforming, a must if you love challenge and involved gameplay, the only downsides to this hidden gem are its poor story and closed multiplayer servers, but other than that you are in for a treat, the graphics are good to look at, the game has a certain weight to its swingin mechanic giving you a rush and feeling of tension every time you go for that collectable pick up just under swinging distance from a ledge. I give this game a 8/10, anyone who passed this up back in 2009 was foolish to let such a gem go			",261,19,3,32,7,0,17

												Well done game even if the metacritics are not that high.The game it self has a nice gameplay and good working mechanics even with gamepad as also with mouse+keyboard. But would recommend mouse+keyboard for multyplayer cause of camera speed.WARNING!: Onlinemultiplayer isn´t there anymore cause of shuting down of servers. There is only the LAN-mode left. But with tools like Hamachi/Tunngle you can still play online ;)Story is a bit wierd and gets more wierd till you get closer to the end of the game but at all it´s well done.Buy recommended!

												Bionic Commando is like having bacon in between two pieces of raw potato. Yea bacon is good and ya you can have it on its own but now its in between this uncooked potato. Yea you can eat it and the bacon will be there but in general is just ruined by this raw potato. Thats what it felt like playing bionic commando. The game is developed and published capcom with some help from grin a company known for such great games as wanted weapons of fate and terminator salvation. So if the games that came before and after bionic commando are to speak for the quality you should think about dropping your expectations but even if you do the game soil itself right of the bat by dropping you in, locked up in chains. You don't know why then some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag sets you free just to tell you ay sorry we locked you up for 5 years but we need you to work for us now and we know about your missing wife so ♥♥♥♥ off. Woah I really want to save the world now. After the kick in the balls of an intro the game drops you into the mission with one arm and just a standard pistol and tells you to get your other arm. Thats simple alright only problem is the movement is clunky just walking around, you have a dodge that takes at least 4 seconds to do and gets you nowhere Its more of a harm to do it. so getting to your arm with around 10 enemies on the path is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥when you die in 3 hits, get used to that because there are no health ups to my knowledge. Once you beat everyone and get your are the game opens up in a big way in terms of movement.  You get ability to grapple to walls and pull yourself in or swing if you have the moment. THIS  and only THIS is a redeemable factor in this whole game. Crippled by a bad story, bad level design, and bad combat the only thing that got me through this 6 hour long campaign was some of the cool stuff I can do with the swing. Heres where I direct you back to my potato/bacon comparison. if you want to bite through all the bad potato, chew it up, and swallow it.  Just to get a taste of the good bacon then maybe this game is for you. I have to admit these are some of the best feeling grappling and swinging mechanics I felt in a long time and makes we question why grappling hooks are not in every game. The movement and feel of the swing is great only problem is the bad level design and combat get in the way of just having fun with it and in some point it just gets frustrating trying to fight it so U end up just walking. like the areas where you can actually do some cool stuff, 70% of it is covered in this blue gas you can't go in or youll die and you cant even go to high in the air or youll die its like old spiderman games in that sense. its sad when games from 2003 innovate more than games only 5 years old  but overall I feel the grappling is good enough to carry you through this game if you like that kind of thing. the rest of the game is pretty bad 5/10Capcom's devs said that working with grin was “messed up” so i can see how some parts of the game are good but the rest are just ruined.  Grins track record is pretty sad when I looked at it. they made wanted wof, bionic commando, and terminator in 2009 but after that seems every game they were scheduled to make was canceled including a unnamed strider reboot, a unnamed street of rage remake and 3 other games. turns out they filed for bankruptcy at the end of 2009 due to lack of funds from publishers. would of been nice to see those games but looking at their past maybe this is for the best.SFDvus cya guys			",187,16,6,18,6,1,15

												OK, so I was introduced to hte Bionic Commando series thanks to the amazing Bionic Commando Rearmed on the PS3 (which I also bought on steam recently) and I didn't want to touch the game due to the negativitivity that this game had and how it would stain my love for rearmed. That being said, I was recommended by Gameradar and that's how I got into the game.First thing first, yes..... the story for this game sucks. It sucks not because it's was badly written but rather the tone of the game is taken too serious. The game is literally too moody compare to the tongue and cheek of the 2d version and Spenser was taken too serious and angry to be a good protagonist (also he has dreads compare to his awesome redhead and specs, what the hell was up with that?). The game is also plagued with pretty bad twist including the famous ""Wife = Arm"".So why am I recommending this game if the story suck. 1 word: Gameplay. The Bionic Arm is one of the most awesome thing to ever exist. LIterally it is both a forum of movement and combat weapon. you will never have so much fun with flinging enemies at other people while also swinging across the map. Another bonus that the game gets is that the music is fantastic, one of my favorite soundtracks I've heard. It's already a traditions to have badass music in a bionic commando game, and this is no exception.At any time this game is on sale or during the final days of a major sell, I recommend you get this game			",577,115,4,72,58,9,152

												This is one of the most fun action games I have ever played.It's actually fun to just move around in this game.  How many other games can make that claim?  Swinging around through the levels to get to places is actually fun and enjoyable.  On top of that, the combat is kept engaging with a wide variety of ways you can dispatch your opposition.  The bionic arm is not merely some gimick, the game is built around the unique additions it brings to the table.  The game is amazingly fun and appropriately challenging.The only downsides to this game are things that aren't related to the actual game itself.  The story is terrible and so predictable you can set your watch by it.  For being a AAA game, you might expect there to be more variety in the environments, objects, character models, etc.  There's also some obvious in-game advertising, but none of it is anywhere that you wouldn't expect to see a bilboard; it's just that the bilboards are a little unrealistically geared toward a gaming audience.  And personally, I wish the game had levels you could back-track to instead of being arranged in a linear fashion.But none of these flaws detract from what you really play the game for.  The gameplay is still solid, fun, and amazing.			",71,3,0,3,0,0,1

												Bionic Commando is a game that is hampered by a case of consolitis, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ save system, horrible swaths of deadly blue fog that kill you if you so much as even LOOK at it funny, and a twist climax that's such a horrendous slap in the face you'd swear the writers accidentally swapped scripts with someone's anime fanfiction.But if you can manage to stomach that, you'll find a game with a tricky-but-surprisingly-fluid and intuitive swinging mechanic, lovingly-rendered maps, and the best game music ever composed . Evading streams of tracer-fire with frantic rappelling before launching yourself off of a bridge with a perfect swing that allows you to zip-kick a gunship set to the tune of ""The Gauntlet"" was one of the most exhilarating experiences I've had from a piece of software in a long time.If you ever find yourself with a few extra bucks and some time to kill, give this underdog a try, then lament at how its commercial failure will ensure that a sequel will never happen.

The big amount of combat movements must satisfy to practically any player. I can't understand why this game was rated with 7 and Bionic Rearmed, with its lack of actions, situations, poor visuals, etc. deserves a 9 for the press.The game has some compatibility problems, but all they are easy to fix if you read the forum game here at Steam.

												I was a complete nut about the swinging mechanic in Spider-Man 2. Here too, it is genuinely fun, if a bit obtuse getting started. However, the game feels like it's just trying to waste your time. Artificial barriers (water and radiation ""clouds"") kill you almost intsantly, forcing a reload to a checkpoint much further back than you wanted.Beyond that, the characters are generally unlikable and super shallow. The game as a whole is asnine and juvenile.While there are worthwhile elements buried in Bionic Commando, it was honestly not worth it. Mirror's Edge has a similar addictive kinetic navigation and is way more deserving of your time and money.			",244,39,1,33,8,0,26

												The world of Bionic Commando is a blast to traverse and it is oddly satisfying to play around with Spencer's bionic arm. While I recommend Bionic Commando, there are a few things that detracted from my experience that I feel are worth discussing. The story is a zany military conspiracy satire of sorts that isn't and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Characters are rather flat and predictable. The protagonist in particular is almost impossible to empathize with due to his violent and cliche behavior. That being said, I would like to stress that Bionic Commando is all about the power trip you receive from the gameplay, not the story so Spencer's lackluster tragedy is acceptable. While enemy soldiers pose an appropriate threat most of the time, the sheer volume of enemies in the later sections is more annoying than fun. Mech enemies in particular are a chore to face in the higher difficulty settings because the amount of time it takes to set up an attack leaves the player open to sniper fire. The unforgiving enemy placement rewards cowardly tactics that goes against the power trip philosophy of the game.Finally, without spoiling too much of the game, the later boss fights are poorly executed. Instead of making interesting use of the bionic arm mechanics, these fights boil down to waiting for your turn to attack then entering a prompt to deliver the final blow. Overall these are nitpicky complaints. The game is great and consider giving it a shot if you're on the fence of a purchase.  ",178,24,3,20,10,1,11

												Is this game worth to play? Yes.It is fun? Yes.Should I Buy it? If you like games like spider-man, or devil may cry (not so much like that one) you would like this.In short:- Play only with gamepads, don't even know how these people say it is playable with mouse and keyboards. (x360ce needed for not-microsoft gamepad users, pm me if you need help)- The game is not easy, but is not Dark Souls hard either. But it surely needs some ability with the controls. Though that is exactly the fun in my opinion. It has the old times arcade spirit, because:      --- If you die, you go back 5-10min play, and lost all collectibles gathered.      --- You may die easily if not aware and skilled.       --- This makes the game challenger and rewarding.- The graphics are great for a game from its release date      --- But there's NO CUSTOMIZATION at all. (NVIDIA users may be able to change it be NVIDIA control panel, the looks great after this, really great).- The multiplayer function IS A LIE. The server is off. (Come on steam wt*)- Its a really 'keep it cool' game, you play without any brain stress. The game flows in one direction and you keep going with it. Which results in a light and fun gameplay.I bought it in a sale really cheap. And all the above points considered, it was totally worth for SURE.I'm having fun, i would even pay a little more now that i know the game.			",20,6,2,3,1,0,1

												Bought this on the Summer Sale pretty cheaply and was very pleasantly surprised. If you've played the platformer, this is in a completely different league. The story probably needs some background to understand, but I came into this without at any knowledge of the franchise and still enjoyed the hell out of it.If you're wondering whether or not to try this - if you enjoy 3rd person over the shoulder perspective and don't mind a cheesy (in a good way, like an 80's action movie) plot, check this out.

												!SPOILERS AHEAD!Please note, this review is written in bullet-point form, as that's all it deserves.What Bionic Commando did right:Large, open areas idea for free-roaming with the grappleGood use of grapple/momentum technologyLarge, glowing hidden objects, requires skill  as well as finding themSatisfying use of the grapple system to throw or throw at enemiesInteresting use of challenges to reward upgradesNice use of enemy dialoguePlayed on Hard first time – difficult, but not impossibleWhat it did wrong:Last-gen use of checkpoint system with very few checkpointsInstant death pitfalls, invisible walls, fire and waterLimited incentive to collect hidden objectsHidden items requiring very risky jumps that will easily kill you and require you to start againClunky aiming systemSome long, vulnerable animations (Kiteing)Very basic gun systemLimited use for the melee systemClunky in-game menuGeneric hide-to-heal health systemEnemies see you from far too far away, no stealth elementBadly voiced, unlikeable main characterTenuous plot, badly written scriptGigantic plot holes: What is the 'item'; What did they plan to do with it; Who is the 'Sniper; What is the purpose of Mag's character (dies); Main character's unclear death at the end; Giant army of angel robots out of nowhere; Absurd betrayal for no clear reason; Main character's wife died so he could have a robotic arm, doesn't seem to bother him; Who are any of these characters (supposedly from previous games)Terrible quick-time-esque final bossUnskippable creditsWhat it should have done:Melee system like Batman: Arkham AsylumUse of time-slow while aimingHeal back only the last full chuck of health on a bar of partsDecoy weapon/item to lure large groups away/togetherCONCLUSION:This game is clunky, flawed, and written like a bad fan-fiction... but there is some fun to be had here. You may get frustrated, you may find it unfulfilling, but if you get this cheap on sale... why the hell not? And let's make this very clear: I'm recommending this because ""why not"". It's not good, you won't love it, but there isn't a ""meh"" button for me to choose.			",406,133,1,54,29,4,58

												I wish the creators followed through with makeing the sequal. Regardless, this game was fun (tedious and sometimes rage inducing), and I had a lot of cool moments that made me fall in love. Also can't get tired of that soundtrack...I loved jumping off things and smashing people...			",22,5,0,2,1,0,0

												great fun story so far... if only i could play online and actually create a account. I assume that capcom shut down the server for this game since they couldn't sell dlc costumes for 2 dollars a piece			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not sure why they even say you can play with mouse/keyboard because you can't,or well it's stupidly hard. If you do play this games use a controller.			",73,24,0,19,2,1,5

												Was very surprised by this game! I wanted it when i came out but had heard it wasnt very good...NOT TRUE! it is awesome. Been having so much fun with it. Once you get the hang of the mechanics its a blast to swing around and shoot stuff.			",48,3,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice and simple game. Nothing too complicated, swing around and punch/blow stuff up.Pros:Bit of fun, nothing too seriousGraphics are fairly decentWillhelm screams!Cons:Can get a bit repetitiveThe controls can be a little annoying but nothing too badMaps are very linear and are almost all swing around for a bit, fight a bunch of enemies, find a terminal (big glowing beacon) deactivate some mines, swing to the next area.Exploration very limited due to ""radiation"" zones and drowning in rivers. These are kind of crude, and kill you within a second of two sending you back to the checkpoint which is hella frustrating.Overall:Fun game, a solid 7/10 if you aren't looking for anything too serious or detailed.Edit: Just finished the game, it is incredibly short. I rushed through and finished it in 6 hours or so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a under 10 year old nintendo gamer from the 80's   Bionic commando was my favorite.As a proud member of the PCMR,    Im digging it though the graphics could use a massive boost.Its great.   The PC port done is wonderful,    mouse 1 arm,   mouse 2 fire.  There is a few different keys to do other things, but its nothing overwhelming even for someone younger.Think blood dragon,  meets spiderman.    you got your gameplay in a nutshell.I can has sequel please?   and make it for PC,  with all the bells and whistles,  things like the ability to adjust graphics for people that DONT play on potatoes. If you grew up with a regular nintendo,   buy this and Bionic Commando Rearmed,   You will be happy.Disclaimer -    Making BCR run on legacy PHSYX drivers ONLY was a $hitty idea.    But at least those drivers are still accessible via the nvidia site.			",66,5,0,8,7,0,15

Score: 6/10Similar GamesSpider Man, Duke NukemSummaryYour one death row, but suddenly the government people need you again. They give you back your bionic arm and send you loose to go kill some dudes. In return they will give you information about the location of your girly poo. End of plot and that's ok. The games more interesting aspect in dialogue/plot is just purely how much of a 90's action flick it is.The GoodThe combat feels solid enough without feeling like you are god incarnate killing everybody. The grappling arm feels great as you go swinging around like spider man with a machine gun. The humor is spot on and the game doesn't take itself to seriously.The BadThe game feels very linear do to the radiation. Honestly I wanted to explore this game and swing around everywhere and the game just wouldn't let me feel free to do what I wanted. The graphics are somewhat cartoonish and I don't think it was supposed to. The enemies even on normal have absurd accuracy from large distances that you can't hit the broad side of a barn at. The guns and gameplay feels relatively dated even for when it was released.ConclusionHonestly it's the radiation that made me hate this game. I liked how everything was going at first and then bam dead... Guess I can't go that way lets try going over here... Bam dead. That coupled with enemies hitting me perfectly from distances I could hit them at just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. If you can get passed those two major problems I'd say have at it. The ideas were great and the implementation was mostly ok, but at the end of the day those two things just wrecked it for me.ValueIf you want to give it a try I'd do so at a max of $2.50			",647,319,15,99,47,6,79
