												Hands down the best shooting multi-player experience around. And I've played them all.Buy it for the base - assault mode.  This expansion is over ten years old and people still play.The controls are so precise and unforgiving you need real skill. Forget about heart beat sensors, drones, infared, load outs. You won't find that here.Here you get bolt action, iron sights.And tanks.Nothing beats running over some camping sniper with a tank.			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although I've only logged 10 hours on Steam with this game, I've been playing this game since day one and I have over 10,000 hours logged on legacy platforms like X-Fire.Call of Duty: United Offensive is the best addition in the franchise by far. No weapon skins, no perks, no kill streaks. Those things don't make a game great in the slightest. Starting with the Campaign. To this day I still go back and revisit the campaign at least once a year, the campaign is action packed, tells a fantastic story of some of the battles during World War 2, although the graphics, animation and physics do not compare to the newer versions of Call of Duty or new games in general, playing through the Campaign never fails to entertain me.Call of Duty United Offensive has bought me probably the best multiplayer I have ever played, again it's dated compared to games nowadays but you can't get more fun than going through Foy in a jeep or tank with your friends or even going it alone will bring endless hours of fun.Unfortunately, the Multiplayer is not as active as it used to be, however there are still plenty of servers running stock maps and generic settings.Mods are another thing that make United Offensive such a great game. There are so many different maps (Both serious and silly) the game will never go stale and unlike modern versions of the Franchise which release yearly and provide no modification tools to the community, effectively making the game stale after a year.Is the game worth getting? YesIs it worth $24? Yes and No. A 10 year old game should be cheaper.If this game is ever on sale, I recommend this game for hours of something new and fresh.			",446,74,18,61,44,5,50

												Call of Duty? Expansion? Impossible! Oh but it is and it was the only expansion ever made to date. Developed by Grey Matter Studios, Call of Duty United Offensive is an expansion to the original Call of Duty. It contains a new campaign split up into three smaller campaigns where you fight as a British, American and Russian soldier during battles spanning across World War II.As an expansion it's pretty good. You got new locations and battles to fight in, some new weapons, and some tweaked gameplay. I forgot to mention how in the original Call of Duty the MG42 was quite hard to shoot at because the muzzle flash blocked out nearly the entire screen however they tweaked it making it much more useful to use in United Offensive. The best levels tended to be the starting and/or second levels of each smaller campaign. The American, British and Russian campaigns had really good starting levels however the last levels of the American and Russian campaign were quite annoying as you had to defend a specific location until help arrives and it was annoying getting shot at all sides.I can't really say much more. It's more Call of Duty and has a decent campaign, sadly I still couldn't find a game in the multiplayer which was kind of dissapointing. If you're going to play the original Call of Duty then most likely you should pick this up as well in one of the bundles when it goes on sale. It's worth a look if you're looking to play more classic Call of Duty and it should keep you fairly entertained. I give this game a 7/10.			",199,62,1,29,20,1,29

												If you like the current state of Call of Duty, stop reading this....Okay, now that I've weeded out the plebs, let's get down to business. This is the definitive Call of Duty game. Great story, fun multiplayer, it's all in there, and better than the modern bullcrap that Activision is pulling out of their proverbial butt nowadays. Here's an overview.The CampaignThe story in United Offensive is based on the happenings of actual battles of WWII. Throughout the campaign (which includes 15 missions), you'll play as Amercians, Russians, and the British. Instead of today's ridiculous ""get behind cover to magically recover health"", you'll be dealing with a health bar that can only be replentished with health packs. Instead of a one-man army, you have somewhat competent ai allies who can actually take down enemies (unlike another game I know...). There are one or two missions where you are on your own, but even then you aren't alone for long.The multiplayer is fun, but sadly mostly dead nowadays. There is a greater variety of maps than there are in the new CoD games, some of which are large and have vehicles (Yes, I said VEHICLES, like, TANKS) and some of which are small and made for close-quarters. Guns have recoil, and the guns with the best range are single-shot bolt-action rifles. It takes more skill to be good in UO than it does in any game after it.Sidenote: YOU CAN LEAN AROUND CORNERS. The same mechanic ironically was one of the key points of CoD: Ghosts E3 presentation last year. All they did was re-add a feature that had been stripped out.Other StuffsHere comes everyone's biggest gripe: the graphics. I personally don't care how the graphics look, and I will say that even then they look better then certain ""AAA"" games nowadays. There are little to no physics, just death animations when you kill enemies. The voice acting is superb. The sound can also be commended for the time the game was released.ClosingCoD: UO is worth buying. I would wait for a sale though. I think the battle chest which includes UO along with CoD and CoD 2 goes half off once in a while. Even if you are pleb, this game is worth playing as a reminder than CoD was not always a pleb game, and may in fact help cure your plebness.			",353,60,10,48,31,2,51

												Call of Duty: United Offensive is a first-person game from Activision, and expansion pack to the previous game Call of Duty.Call of Duty: United Offensive add more campaign missions to the game. The American campaign now expand to the Battle of the Bulge, still with the US Airborne. The British campaign now adds the Commandos missions in Italy, and the Russians campaign also expand to the famous Battle of Kursk. Call of Duty: United Offensive also add many new weapons like Gewehr-43, MG-34, Silenced Sten and many more. Another feature of the expansion pack is that vehicles are drivable now in multiplayer games.Call of Duty: United Offensive are great expansion pack for Call of Duty, a good game to play. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												NOTE: United Offensive REQUIRES/NEEDS the original game to be installed to function.United Offensive takes almost everything great from the original Call of Duty and builds upon it. New larger maps, a campaign as long as a standalone Call of Duty are on offer up-front. Behind these large offerings are smaller but notable additions, such as driveable vehicles and new weapons for each force in the game.The campaign is slightly shorter than the base games by about 3 missions. The campaign itself is still about as long as, possibly longer than what is offered in Advanced Warfare, a definitely longer than Modern Warfare 2 and 3's single player. The American missions take you across France in large battles for control of towns, fields and ridges in the besieged countryside. The British missions start you in a RAF bombing raid as a plane gunner before switching to covert missions for the SAS. The Russian missions follow a small unit as they fight their way to Kharkov to liberate it from Nazi invaders. The campaign features the usual Call of Duty missions where you do slightly different things from the usual infantry boot work, such as drive-by turret sections, the RAF section and the Soviet tank mission which is similar to the tank mission in the originals Soviet campaign. Overall, the campaign is well made, the variety of missions under such a tight gameplay build is something that this and the original have that the modern games lacks.This helps the gameplay factors. The lack of regenerating health means that you never feel like a super-soldier. You will probably want squad members to take point to avoid getting your face shot off by an unexpected MG42 gunner. The levels are built for PC players and the maps are built for vehicle traversing as well as on-foot movement, so a scale not present in later instalments is clear.Visually, the game has aged. Animation looks hilarious sometimes, the faces look really bad. The environments look a little middy, but are large and grand. On higher settings (which I think a toaster can do now), the environments are more than passable. Forcing Anisotropic Filtering cleans up a lot of the problems with the games textures. Although the game is not beautiful, it is passable and the visuals never interfere with the game itself.Audio-wise, just like the original, the soundtrack is brilliant and memorable, with the OST being pretty much identical to the original. The gun sound effects are decent, again being re-used from the original. The voice acting is hilarious sometimes, with the fake Russian accents being the most memorable. The German voice work is brilliant as well, with a few shouty lines being spammed across the whole campaign (This is re-used from the original). As with all the main instalments, the amount of chatter on the fields, screaming from soldiers to move and take covers enough to keep the player in the game.Multiplayer-wise, if you can get on, people still play it. The maps are well-done. The use of mounted guns and vehicles means that the game is played differently from later games in the series. The maps are much larger than what is offered in later games, changing how multiplayer is played as they are far more open due to the different methods of play. There are some problems with weapon balancing however which is present in both this and the original game.My only actual complaint would be within the campaign. Sometimes some objectives don't trigger themselves properly (well, it happened twice to me) and although the campaign is solid across the board, the Russian campaign could not quite beat the atmosphere shown in the original Call of Duty game during the Battle for Stalingrad, which is my personal highlight for the series. Despite this, the expansion pack goes above what many other games in the series attempt and is in my opinion, the best of the series. Any fan of the genre should definitely get it and any fan of the new ones should get this to see how Call of Duty should be done.			",253,34,9,26,36,1,38

												This expansion pack starts strong with its American campaign set at the Battle Of The Bulge featuring massive improvements to the originals visuals and some fantastic action packed squad combat. However it seems to degrade in quality about half way through once into the SAS campaign where the missions become less unique and turn into basic Call Of Duty press forward and clear enemies. By the the time I started the Russian campaign I was ready for the game to end.I still recommend this expansion for the American campaign and the first English level.			",287,38,7,10,9,2,16

												Few expansions are just as good as the base game. This is one of them.United Offensive was released in 2004, 11 months after Call of Duty. Developed by Gray Matter, who is known for creating Escape from Castle Wolfenstein, which from what i heard is considered a good game by both wolfenstein and fps fans.The addon perfectly captures what made the original so good. For those that haven't read my COD1 review, it's about having cinematic setpieces every now and then. COD and other shooters are not very different, but what makes COD stand apart is that aside from all the shooting levels, it has the cinematic levels mixed in, and in general, all levels are highly inspired by war films.The campaign features americans in ardennes (heavily inspired by band of brothers). British campaign features a fully modelled B-17 plane, which you can traverse as the level goes on, and you will have to, because as the level will go on, crewmen will be dying and somebody will have to take up their machine gun. The rest of the british campaign is about working with the resistance (in Holand) and the SAS (in Sicily). The soviet campaign in the original was about Stalingrad, Poland and Berlin. UO is about the events after Stalingrad - Kursk.The campaign is not as lengthy as the original though, but that is to be expected from an expansion.UO added many new mechanics into the game. Like the sprint ability (which is also featured in their wolfenstein game). They added machine guns for every side (DP-28, MG34, M1919). The original game also only had Colt and Luger pistols, so they added missing ones for the british and soviets. They added semi-auto rifles - G43 and SVT40. They added rocket launchers - Panzerschreck and Bazooka. In the eastern front, they also added flamethrowers to the germans.All of them are great (sounds and reloading animations are much more superior), though the machine guns mechanic is slightly underworked. You have to place down the bipod before shooting, but usually the only place you can place it is on the ground. You cannot place it on a crate or a sandbag for example, except for a few specific locations.The multiplayer is dead (about 10 servers, some of which have ""bots"" in their title), but just for the record i will tell you a few things i managed to dig up. First of all, original COD was about infantry warfare. UO added jeeps and tanks to the game for each side (US, USSR, Germany). Other than the 3 normal tanks: Sherman, T-34 and Panzer IV, there are also tank destroyers that are present on some maps - Elefant and ISU-152. Google up the elefant tank if you don't know what that is.They also added a ranking system into the game that resets during every match. It works sort of like killstreaks of today. As you play you gain points and you get extra stuff, like more grenades or ability to call an artillery strike.Since the game came out almost a year after COD1, and a year later, COD2 was released, majority of the improvements on COD1 were not added to COD2, which i feel was a big step backward.Finally, i want to add that Grey Matter Interactive was merged with Treyarch in 2005. Treyarch at the time was doing the old gen version of COD2 (for PS2 and xbox), The Big Red One.			",498,99,13,68,57,7,114

In the age of expansion packs, when developers put as much extra content for their game as they could into one disk, this gem was born. If you liked Call of Duty you will like this as it adds tons of extra stuf and a new campaign. Currently it is sold at the same price as CoD but back in the day there was a difference. It was the second in the CoD series and just as epic as the first one, go get it!			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												I just bought this game for the fourth time via the warchest bundle while it was on sale. All my previous copies were physical since I still remember playing this shortly after it came out at the end of 2004. My current hours logged on via steam does not reflect the hours I sunk into this game for 6 years. I will admit the moment I got into a server and started playing base assault again for the first time since 2010 it made me remember why I loved the series at one point and brought back a lot of nostalgia. While by modern standards this game is dated in multiplayer gameplay for lacking health regen, classes, killstreaks, attachments, etc that is to be expected considering this is from 2004 before those became ""core"" to modern fps games. For me personally i find the lack of those things to be a giant pro. It feels like it provides a bit of an actual challenge, and nice change from modern shootersPro:Mods for multiplayer. Besides the original I don't think any other Call of Duty is mod friendly. I will check out 2. But most of my experience with Call of Duty after 4 was limited to console.Vehicles. Multiple stock tanks both light, heavy and jeeps available for multiplayer. Mods add even more vehicles not included in the game. I recall at one point there was a mod that added stuka dive bombers that you could fly. I will have to look for that mod.Crazy amount of maps, all of which are free(see settings to enable downloads)Cons:Multiplayer is as much as I hate to say it more or less dead but still hanging in there with half a dozen servers that I can find via steam that are populated by actual people rather than bots like the zombies server. Also doesn't help the community is a tad split, there a few servers that wont show up but can be conenected to if you know the IP mainly with people that have pirated versions. Then for some odd reason there are still servers active on older version prior to 1.51 patch. Then theres still a few people on the original base game that this is the expansion to.Requires that you have Call of Duty (2003) installed. This is understandable since expansions at the time worked this way, since this was the pre DLC days so this is only a con in that you need to buy the first game.Price. For christ sake steam or Activision. I don't know who still controls the price. I would've bought this game soo much sooner if it was fairly priced. On sale 20$ for Cod, CodUO, and Cod2. Considering how old these games are 20$ is what the bundle should cost as it is  before being on sale and Im being generous given my love for the game. More copies might actually move. Others would say 15 a more fair price for the bundle.  The standard 20$ just standalone on steam when its not on sale would have been fair like 5 years ago but a little excessive now. I honestly think Activision could get something outta ressurecting this and the base game by mking it free to play and mking money off it somehow.Visually, the game shows its age quite badly. Again though this is from 2004 so its forgivable. If activision is gonna start going down the remastering Call of Duty's businesss route then they should remaster the this and the base game together as they would benefit the most from a remaster.

												This expansion has a pretty good campaign. Nothing to say on the story, but the missions and locations themselves are remarkable, especially when you look at them from a historical context. As per usual, the Russian campaign is arguably the most epic in terms of close quarter fighting within the Russian cities.

												Even though it is an expansion to the first Call Of Duty, United Offensive is one of the best games in the franchise. Because it is an expansion, UO does not waste any time with tutorials or hand holding as the game begins with a bang and never stops until the end. If you played COD1 you know what to expect gameplay wise, but UO stands out with its missions and level design.  Just does a good job of mixing things up. My favorite part is probably the British campaign. If you like the COD franchise or WWII shooters in general, I would recomend UO. Word of warning though, you should probably own and install COD1 along side of it.			",289,15,2,5,4,1,15

												Nice expansion from the first Call of Duty. I never played this expansion back in the day, and I do regret it. Once again, the WWII scene, however, I found this a bit more fun than the first Call of Duty, the reason for that being that there are some missions which make you feel like you're in the war. Navy, Army, Air Force - although you don't actually drive the boats, or fly the planes - but you do get to play the vehicle guns. Nice addition of the flamethrower, picked it up and torched some enemies. The final mission for the Soviets is really really hard. I died about 20 times (played on 2nd hardest difficulty), even rage quit, but eventually I got through it. You have Stukas bombing you from the air, tanks rolling in, light armoured APCs, machine gunners all at the train station ready to gun you down, Nazis on the rooftops, list keeps going. That mission was what I meant about feeling like you're in the war kind of feeling. However as you do play on a harder difficulty and you have to get through the final level, you want to save your life, not caring about your peers which is a shame! :P I like this game, but I think the pricing is pretty harsh still. Aus Multiplayer has 1 server, but it looks pretty dead.So yeah:COD 1 +- Flamethrowers- Guns on boats, aircraft- Binocs in one mission for artillery calling- More war kind of feel- Blow up stuff like a train coming on the bridgeMinus points for price IMO as the story roughly takes 6 hours.tl;dr: Good game for Single Player WWII, however for the duration of the game and at this price point may only make this game suitable to buy in a deal.

												Don't mind what Code Monkey said, perhaps he didn't notice that this expansion (and Call of Duty 1) were released in 2004. This is what made ""Call of Duty"" what it is today. Take a place in historic missions and battles, The Assault on Foy, Battle of the Bulge, shoot down ME-109's from a B-17 and more. Good stuff! This expansion is what made me a fan of CoD.

												Just adds more missions - similar style to the base game, nothing new except the plane fight where you are a bomber staff operating MGs. That one is fun albeit just one single mission. All the other mission are scripted and programmed WAY worse than the ones from the original game: Lots of getting stuck on objects or the mission doesnt continue, and many horrible gameplay moments. By far not as fun as Call of Duty. Dont buy...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Call of Duty United Offensive is an expansion pack for the first Call of Duty. Once again we will take on the role of three different soldiers from the USA, UK and Russia respectively. We start things off as the Americans in a snow covered Belgium. The snow doesn't make any difference to the gameplay but it is something that wasn't in the base game so it does give United Offensive it's own style. You will quickly find out that this dlc has much more fierce and unpredictable battles. It will keep you on your toes and raises the difficulty quite high right from the beginning. UO introduces a couple of new guns like silenced machine guns and flamethrowers for your nazi killing pleasure. They are uncommon unfortunately, I would have loved for more time to use the flamethrower.  Like the original you are nearly always accompanied by fellow soldiers and this time around they are a lot more useful. They can hold their own and are way more likely to actually kill the people shooting at them. It may be do to AI improvements or the fact that you will be spending a lot of your time in this dlc fighting close quarters. UO has much more fighting in villages and condensed spaces so carrying a weapon suited for that is a must. Unfortunately some levels spawn way too enemies out of the same locations which makes shooting them kind of tedious as another nazi will sprout out of thin air to take their place until it is time to move on. It also features far more moments were you must defend a location for a given amount of time which almost starts to feel like it's there to pad out the dlc.It took me 6 hours to beat the dlc which is quite close to the what it took me to get through the base game.  No longer are the three Allies campaigns intertwined together instead you play through the whole American campaign then switch to the British when it is done. I much prefer it this way as it helps you keep track of the characters and makes the journey much more consistent than randomly teleporting your view to different events like in the base game. In the British campaign you will be riding in both a boat and a warplane. The plane section is pretty cool as it has you running in the interior to pilot different turrets and fix issues but it goes on too long and both vehicle sections just play out with you endlessly shooting from a turret. Russian campaign does allow you to pilot a tank which was a fun distraction. It also lets you call in artillery strikes via binoculars at one point but you have to look at a very specific point and it comes off as nothing more than a gimmick. Fortunately the main bulk of the levels are very good and have been designed as to challenge returning players from the base game. Whether this difficulty is a good thing is up for debate but from my experience it kept it from feeling like this dlc is just more of the same even though it pretty much is. I don't believe it has any new additions to the soundtrack either which is disappointing as the composer is amazing.  Overall United Offensive tries new things but it is very much more of the same. If they would have toned down the padding thrown in to make the dlc seem longer I would say these campaigns surpass the ones found in the original. The multiplayer seems to have very few people left and some servers have bots to fill up the lobby. It is completely separate from the base game so the already small amount of people still playing CoD1 and UO have been split. You will need Call of Duty 1 to play United Offensive, this is not a stand-alone expansion pack. In the end of the day this is still a lengthy and exciting expansion pack that knows what made the original so good and made it better. Recommended to those that have completed the original and would like to take the fight to previously unseen countries like Italy and Belgium. ",1881,553,61,204,168,17,226

												This game is awesome, they definitley dont make CoD like they used to. UO is actually just a DLC, but i personally think its better than the base game, but both are still great. Graphics still look great to me, and i love how slim the iron sights are on the guns. After you play this, iron sights in other CoD games will feel big and blocky. Overall, this is a fantatstic game.			",156,12,2,9,11,0,10

												United Offensive is a major expansion pack for the original Call of Duty game. It improves on a few of the issues from the original game and features some incredibly epic missions. The game's campaign is structered similarly to the original game with 3 seperate military campaigns starting with a largescale American battle in Bastogne (Battle of the Bulge), easing into a slow and painfully boring British campaign in Italy, and ending with an epic battle with the Russians at Kursk.    Once again, Call of Duty's american missions are based strongly on the events of the 101st airbourne as seen in ""Band of Brothers."" You are tasked with fighting off a larger Nazi platoon in the wintery forests of bastogne as you wait for Pattons tank unit to relieve you and there's plenty of artillery, tanks, and firefights. You then have to attack a village crawling with nazi soldiers by moving up with your squad from the forest to some haystacks just like in the show. These missions are some of the best missions that this game have to offer and they're a lot of fun. Unfortunetly, once again, you are stuck as a British soldier doing boring ""stealth"" based missions that require infilitrating enemy strongholds and destroying artillery guns or getting into incredibly frustrating on rails car chases. And then finally, the game picks up the pace again with another largescale Russian battle sequence, this time taking place at Kursk. This time, instead of landing on beaches with several other soldiers, you are all packed into large trucks and are crossing open fields while planes fly by and blow up your allies nearby. You are then tasked with reinforcing the trenchlines and repelling a major german offensive. The campaign starts to lose its pace after this though, as you start fighting through the streets to eventually hold off a German attack on a railyard that is impossibly difficult. There are snipers, tanks, halftracks, MG42s, infantry, and worst of all... player seeking airplane bombing runs. That's right... during your defense of this entirely open railyard, you are forced to relocate from cover while being shot by all the above because the bombing runs that come ever 30 seconds will always aim for you. It's an incredibly frustrating mechanic that really ruined the finale of the game. But other than that, the gameplay was solid and a significant improvement over the original game. The graphics were improved also. The textures and models look essentially the same, but the smoke effects that would later become a staple of the series are finally introduced in this expansion and still to this day look fantastic, especially after a massive allied bombing run or after blowing up a tank with a bazooka. The lighting also appears to have received a boost, with interior fires casting a bit of an orange glow on the walls that I'm pretty sure didn't happen in the original game. The gameplay mechanics also recieved some attention. A sprint button was introduced, but unfortunetly the sprint is incredibly short, allowing you to only sprint about halfway from one position to another before you have to start walking again. The health system is still incredibly stupid and enemies still home in on you as soon as you try and fight back. Some new weapons were added in that are given plenty of time to shine like the silenced sten submachine gun or the bipod mounted MG42 that you can walk around with. However, the latter came be annoying because it takes forever to deploy the bipod, and you have to keep the right mouse button held down in order to keep it deployed, or it will reset the animation, which can really ruin its effectiveness considering you generally need it when mowing down a large concentration of soldiers crossing a field towards you. Another thing I feel I should mention is that the sound design is fantastic. Bullets will wizz and snap past you if they're close by and you can hear all the dirt and snow spitting up in your face after a tank fires nearby. Rain sounds accurate and realistic which is generally not even done correctly in games that come out today in 2015. So cudos to Infinity Ward for nailing the sound design way back in the early 2000s. So overall, I recommend this game as it continues the 101st airborne campaign into the Battle of Bastogne and also features another cool russian campaign. However, just be aware that the graphics are severely outdated, the gameplay has plenty of issues, and the British campaign is painfully dull.			",213,12,5,6,9,1,2

												Wow is this game frustrating.  I'm going to try again but I played for 15 minutes and everything felt pushed, it was literally like it's meant to be played by someone that knows exactly what to do and where to go.  How I want to play it is have an objective and do it whichever way possible, in here it's go into this hole and shoot loads of guys with this one gun, and then oh come over here going through the open just to pick up another gun in a different hole and cover there.  In the second hole I was just shooting guys when I was getting hit from the back by an enemy, with the weird controls because I was bipoded or whatever, I couldn't get off and hit the guy, so died and had to restart.  So I get back in and keep shooting guys and then finally, GUESS WHAT?!  The same guy escorts you to the next nest you gotta cover, but this time you have to pickup this sniper and *KILLED.*  I died while I was trying to figure out what I was supposed to do.  So I pressed the restart button, respawned me back at the bipod place.  *QUIT*  The main games is awesome, but they went from it being a lot more tame, ""This is your objective, whichever way possible"" In here however, it's DO IT OUR WAY OR YOU DIE, and it's so unclear and so annoying and it doesn't work.  I'm going to go back and see if it gets better.			",38,6,7,1,8,0,1

												Awful. After the other games in the series I've played, which were hard but do-able, this is just a depressing grind. So easy to die, so hard to see what's needed to succeed. ""Get the bazooka, take out the tank"". Sure, but what bazooka? Where?Endlessly respawing enemies until some magic mark is walked over. Yawn.Good for the running gunning gamers, maybe, but for me, just tedious and tiresome. Even when I'm progressing, it seems more luck than any skill (and I admit my skill is low). So I feel more like a passenger than a player. The save points are few and far between, so there's a lot to be played over and over after death. I've tried the quick save, but the game is buggy and crashes trying to re-load.I don't mind a fairly linear game (e.g. in some ways I preferred the first Far Cry over the later 2,3 and 4), but this seems just too constricted. Do the scenario exactly how the designers expected or wanted you to, or you'll die. And then do it all over again, untl you figure out what they had in mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you wanted more of the same of CoD1, go for it. There's a few more weapons that aren't much to write home about, missions with big maps and tedious objectives, and no real cohesive story other than the fact that they all revolve around taking back locations from Nazis. It's roughly around 6 hours of content, but the game's quicksave function has made me crash every single time I've used it at the halfway mark. If you play without saves on the highest difficulty, you will find yourself frustrated and ultimately unable to play the game. From a multiplayer perspective, this beats what you got on CoD1. I will admit that the older CoDs offer a relatively simple layout of weapons, maps, and general combat mechanics, but it's a hard and precise go to kill someone. That's what makes it all the more challenging and exciting for the nostalgics. But because FPS games have now been more about attachments, perks, and these types of accolades, you might find yourself getting bored after a few rounds. That being said, this expansion is rife with bugs and does not play well with current technology. This is far from worth the price of retail let alone a 50% off sale price, and I'm gobsmacked that IW is being this greedy. I cannot recommend it on price and bugginess alone.			",291,42,3,23,15,3,8

												Despite hearing good things about this expansion for the first Call of Duty, United Offensive does not meet up to the praise. The biggest problem COD:UO has is the fact that this game is the one that experiences the most growing pains in the series. This is reflected in the first few missions in the American campaign where the player has to suffer through respawning enemies, limited health, limited ammo, and ridiculous objectives that force the player to do everything. If there is a tank, YOU must be the one to find a rocket launcher to destroy it. If there is an enemy bunker, YOU must be the one to charge in to conquer it. The list goes on and on. On a video game standpoint, this is perfectly fine, in fact, Wolfenstein uses this type of gameplay to enforce a good power fantasy. United Offensive goes too far however, to the point that teammates are rendered useless and the idea that the battle was won by a team effort absurd.These following statements are going to be a bit controversial but please keep reading. The combination of respawning enemies and suicidal objectives may not have been so bad if your health was not limited or if you had a way to suppress enemies into cover. Call of Duty 2 has regenerative health for the player and smoke grenades that cloak your advancement on the battlefield. These solutions may be a bit overkill but they do a great job of keeping the action moving forward instead of the previous games where a stray bullet would make you have to backtrack through the level to find a medpack. The whole issue about health would not have been mentioned if it wasn't for the fact that COD:UO makes you do everything in a battle, to the point when you wonder if you are actually a Navy Seal disguised as a Private.The game does have a quick save feature, which you may have to use quite a bit because the game has very inconsistent checkpoints. There will be times when you have already completed several objectives before getting a checkpoint. At the very worst, you may even get checkpointed while getting shot or having grenade land near by you (and no, you cannot throw back grenades). I do understand that quick saving has its purpose in PC games, especially RPGs, however, action games benefit more from carefully placed checkpoints rather than quick saves. If the developer is smart enough, they can place checkpoints in safe areas or segments past cutscenes that help with the flow of the action.  United Offensive assumes you are going to be using quick save frequently and the game definitely seems to be crafted that way. The first Call of Duty does not seem to suffer from this problem too much, at the very least not on Normal mode. COD1 was crafted in a way that it can even be playable on a console, where you can't quick save at all.Not everything was bad in Call of Duty: United Offensive. The music was great, sound effects were great, and the British and Russian campaigns were interesting (You even take part in a bombing raid with the British Airforce in one mission). There are even light machine guns with deployable bipods you can use to defend areas (which become useless once you find out that you can't deploy them on sandbags aside from the mission sensitive ones). If you are lucky, you may even come across a flamethrower you can use for a few seconds in the early Russian missions. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend COD:UO because COD1 and COD2 exist. I get the impression that United Offensive got the praise it did because there really was nothing like it at the time but now that there is, the problems I mentioned earlier do not stand the test of time. Unless you are a completionist, you should avoid Call of Duty: United Offensive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The following is only representative of the single player campaign:Surprisingly, this is the most scripted Call of Duty game/expansion ever produced.At several points, any movement slightly off script will lead to an instant death from sniper fire, tank shells, or artillery. As the levels are significantly longer than the first game, it is incredibly likely you will run into a scripting error. If you were several seconds late behind your captain in the first part of a mission, forget being able to rescue him when he is downed in the second part of the mission - the game assumes you were right behind him the entire time, forcing you to replay 10-15 minute sections to ensure you are in the proper position to continue with the level.The objective marker has also seemingly been programmed by 45 different people that have never talked, emailed, or followed any project guidelines. The marker will sometimes point to where you need to go, where you need to run away from, where the weapons are to blow up the tank, where the tank is but not where the weapon is that you need to blow up the tank, etc.Overall, this might actually be the worst Call of Duty campaign. Ghosts’ Campaign was run of the mill, but this is kinda straight broken. ",299,49,6,17,20,0,17

												I would not recommend this to anyone. United Offensive is abslout trash just buy the game its slef. The missions are extremly challenging even on easy. i'm a very good gamer and i can player call of duty on hard but this DLC is challenging. It had way to many enemys objectives are not explained. The hole time i played this DLC i had on idea what to do. I must have died or failed the missions at least 250 times.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WAST OF TIME AND MONEY.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												United Offensive is largely more of the same from the first CoD, but with the spectacle ramped up a bit in spots and a really nice bonus with the B-17 bombing mission.  If you played the first CoD then it's back into play as the ordinary soldier again as you're pushed around to different setpiece battles where you face off against hordes of cloned German Nazis. You can choose which guy you kill, but you mainly feel like you're biding time until you're allowed to hit the objectives because otherwise the Nazis respawn endlessly to make life tough.The B-17 mission is standout because it's got such a neat vibe; you're VERY MUCH playing whack-a-mole, but the variety of gun turrets at your disposal makes for interesting times, and the damage your plane suffers is uniquely more interesting than the other moments ingame where you're strapped to a moving vehicle and have to shoot stuff.  UO is an older title and has no reason for costing $20, but a sale of $10 or less is worthwhile.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

												This expansion pack to call of duty is not like those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones we get one modern CODs. This one is basically a game, or should I say, a masterpiece. In this game, you get a MASSIVE new campaign including american, british and russian campaigns. But in my opinion, the best thing about this game is its multiplayer. Its ALOT better than the first one, it adds tanks, new weapons, artillery, cars, maps, new gamemodes and many more. Despite its old graphic, this game is like a veteran from world war 2, it may be old, but still has alot of potential.I give 10/10 because its basically one of the only CODs I enjoy			",82,2,2,6,14,0,20
